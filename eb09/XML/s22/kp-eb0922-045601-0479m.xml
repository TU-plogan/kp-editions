                    other courts, but the crown never parted with the supreme jurisdiction whence
                    the subsidiary courts had emanated. When in the 13th century the council became
                    a regular and permanent body, practically distinct from the parliament of
                    estates, this jurisdiction continued to be exercised by the king in council. As
                    the ordinary law-courts became more systematic and important, the indefinite
                    character of the conciliar jurisdiction gave rise to frequent complaints; and
                    efforts, for the most part fruitless, were made by the parliaments of the 14th
                    century <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in 15 Edw. II. and 2 Edw. III.) to check
                    it. The equitable jurisdiction of the chancellor, which grew up during the reign
                    of Edward III., flowed from this supreme judicial power, like the common
                    law-courts under Henry II, but without drying up the original source. It is in
                    the reign of Edward III. that we first hear of the “chancellor, treasurer,
                    justices, and others” exercising jurisdiction in the “star-chamber” or “chambre
                    de estoiles” at Westminster. In Henry VI.’s reign one Danvers was acquitted of a
                    certain charge by the king’s council “in camera stellata.” Hitherto such Acts of
                    Parliament as had recognized this jurisdiction had done so only by way of
                    limitation or prohibition, but in 1453, about the time when the distinction
                    between the ordinary and the privy council first became apparent, an Act was
                    passed by which the chancellor was empowered to enforce the attendance of all
                    persons summoned by the privy seal before the king and his council in all cases
                    not determinable by common law. At this time, then, the jurisdiction of the
                    council was recognized as supplementary to that of the ordinary law-courts. But
                    the anarchy of the Wars of the Roses, and the decay of provincial justice owing
                    to the influence of great barons and the turbulence of the lower classes,
                    obliged parliament to entrust wider powers to the council. This was the object
                    of the famous Act of 3 Hen. VII., which was quoted by the lawyers of the Long
                    Parliament as creating the court of starchamber. This, however, as is shown
                    above, it was far from doing. The Act of 3 Hen. VII. empowered a committee of
                    the council, consisting of the chancellor, treasurer, privy seal, or any two of
                    them, with the chief justices, or in their absence two other justices, a bishop,
                    and a temporal lord, to act as a court of justice for enforcing the law in cases
                    where it was thwarted by bribery, intimidation, or partiality. The jurisdiction
                    thus entrusted to a committee of the council was not, therefore, like that
                    granted in 1453, supplementary, but superseded the ordinary law-courts in cases
                    where they were too weak to act. The Act simply supplied machinery for the
                    exercise under special circumstances of that extraordinary penal jurisdiction
                    which the council had never ceased to possess. This jurisdiction, Bacon tells
                    us, was still further developed aud organized by Wolsey. The court established
                    by thø<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0480-0457"/> Act 3 Hen. VII. continued to exist for about
                    fifty years, but disappeared towards the end of Henry VIII.’s reign. Its powers
                    were not lost, but fell back to the general body of the council, and were among
                    the most important of those exercised by the council sitting in the starchamber.
                    A court not unlike that created in 3 Hen. VII. was erected in 1540. The Act of
                    31 Hen. VIII., which gave the king’s proclamations the force of law, enacted
                    that offenders against them might be punished by the usual officers of the
                    council, together with some bishops and judges, “in the star-chamber or
                    elsewhere.” These powers also came after a time, like those granted in 1488, to
                    be exercised by the council at large instead of by certain members of it. It is
                    clear, however,—and this was one of the chief complaints against the court,—that
                    the jurisdiction which belonged by law or custom to the whole body of the king’s
                    council was usurped at this time by the inner body of advisers called the privy
                    council, which had engrossed all the other functions of the larger body. Sir T.
                    Smith (temp. Eliz.) tells us that juries misbehaving “were many times commanded
                    to appear in the starchamber or before the privy council for the matter.” The
                    uncertain composition of the court is well displayed by Coke, who says that the
                    star-chamber is or may be compounded of three several councils—(1) the lords and
                    others of the privy council, (2) the judges of either bench and the barons of
                    the exchequer, (3) the lords of parliament, who are not, however, standing
                    judges of the court. Hudson (temp. Car. I.), on the other hand, considers that
                    all peers had a right of sitting in the court. The latter class had, however,
                    certainly given up sitting in the 17th century. The jurisdiction of the court
                    was equally vague, and, as Hudson says, it was impossible to define it without
                    offending the supporters of the prerogative by a limitation of its powers, or
                    the common lawyers by attributing to it an excessive latitude. In practice its
                    jurisdiction was almost unlimited. It took notice of maintenance and liveries,
                    bribery or partiality of jurors, falsification of panels or of verdicts, routs
                    and riots, murder, felony, forgery, perjury, fraud, libel and slander, offences
                    against proclamations, duels, acts tending to treason, as well as of a few civil
                    matters,—disputes as to land between great men or corporations, disputes between
                    English and foreign merchants, testamentary cases, &amp;c.,—in fact, “all
                    offences may be here examined and punished if the king will” (Hudson). Its
                    procedure was not according to the common law; it dispensed with the encumbrance
                    of a jury; it could proceed on mere rumour or examine witnesses; it could apply
                    torture; it could inflict any penalty short of death. It was thus admirably
                    calculated to be the support of order against anarchy or of despotism against
                    individual and national liberty. During the Tudor period it appeared in the
                    former light, under the Stuarts in the latter. It was abolished by the Long
                    Parliament in 1641, and was never afterwards revived.<note anchored="true"
