                    with others of similar size placed horizontally on their tops. Originally there
                    were thirty uprights and thirty imposts, but now only seventeen uprights and
                    seven imposts retain their position. The inner circle, which is about 9 feet
                    distant from the outer circle, consisted originally of forty single stones, much
                    smaller in size, and, unlike those of the outer circle, showing no evidence of
                    having been hewn. The larger of the ovals was composed of five pairs of
                    trilithons standing separate from each other, and rising gradually in height
                    from east to west. Only two of these now remain entire; one of the uprights of
                    the grand central trilithon has fallen, and is broken in two pieces; the impost
                    though fallen is entire, and the other impost is 9 feet out of the
                    perpendicular; another trilithon fell outward on the 3d June 1797; and of a
                    third one of the uprights is still standing, the other upright and the impost
                    having in their fall been broken into three pieces. The inner oval consisted
                    originally of nineteen stones, of which there are remains of eleven, tapering in
                    form and taller than those of the inner circle. In the centre of the smaller
                    oval is the supposed altar stone, 15 feet in length. The whole is surrounded by
                    a vallum and ditch about 370 yards in circumference. From the north-east an
                    avenue, marked by a bank and ditch on each side, proceeds for a distance of 594
                    yards, after which it divides into two branches, one going eastwards up a hill
                    between two groups of barrows, and the other north-westwards about 300 yards to
                    the cursus or race-course. The cursus, which is enclosed between two parallel
                    banks and ditches running east and west, is a mile and 176 yards in length, with
                    a breadth of 110 yards. There is a smaller cursus a little to the north. In the
                    avenue there is a cromlech or bowing-stone 16 feet in length, called the Friar’s
                    Heel, and in a line with it, within the area of the work, there is a large
                    prostrate stone on which it is supposed the victims were immolated. Barrows lie
                    around on all sides.</p>
                <p>Stonehenge is first mentioned by Nennius, in the 9th century, who asserts that it
                    was erected in commemoration of the 400 nobles who were treacherously slain near
                    the spot by Hengist in 472. A similar account of its origin is given in the
                    triads of the Welsh bards, where its erection is attributed to King Merlin, the
                    successor of Vortigern. Inigo Jones, in his work on Stonehenge, published in
                    1655, endeavours to prove that it was a temple of the Romans, but later writers
                    of authority are generally agreed that it is of Druidical origin, although there
                    are differences of opinion as to its probable date, some placing it at 100 years
                    before Christ and others in the 5th century. It seems most probable that the
                    inner circle and inner oval, constructed of smaller stones of granite, which
                    must have been brought from a distance, is of earlier origin than the outer
                    circle and oval.</p>
