                    the west of the great central plateau, its northern districts extending towards
                    the hilly region of the Valdais, where the flat-topped gentle declivities reach
                    about 1000 feet above the sea. The rivers being deeply cut in the plateau, the
                    surface is also hilly in the western districts (Smolensk, Dorogobuzh), whence it
                    slopes away gently towards immense plains on the east and south. Carboniferous
                    limestones, containing a few layers of coal (in Yuchnoff) and quarried for
                    building purposes, occupy the east of Smolensk; white Chalk appears in the
                    southern extremity; while Tertiary sands, marls, and ferruginous clays cover all
                    the west. The whole is overlain with a thick sheet of boulder clay, with
                    irregular extensions to the north; Post-Tertiary sands are spread over wide
                    surfaces; and peat-bog fills the marshy depressions. The soil, mostly clay, is
                    generally unfertile, and stony and sandy in several districts. Many large rivers
                    belonging to the basins of the Volga, the Oka, the Dnieper, and the Dwina have
                    their origin in Smolensk. The Vazuza and the Gzhat, both flowing into the Volga,
                    and the Moskva and the Ugra, tributaries of the Oka, are channels for floating
                    timber. The two tributaries of the Dwina—the Kasplya and the Mezha—are of much
                    more importance, as they and their affluents carry considerable numbers of boats
                    to Riga. The Dnieper takes its origin in Smolensk and waters it for more than
                    300 miles; but neither this river nor its tributaries (Vop, Vyazma, Sozh, and
                    Desna), whose upper courses belong to Smolensk, are navigable; timber only is
                    floated down some of them. Many small lakes and extensive marshes occur in the
                    northwest. One-third of the area is under forests. The population of Smolensk
                    reached 1,191,172 in 1882, of whom only 106,133 lived in towns, and consists of
                    White Russians in the west (46∙7 per cent.), Great Russians in the east (42∙6),
                    and of a mixed population of both (10∙4). Nearly 1000 Jews and 1000 Poles are
                    scattered through the towns.</p>
                <p>The climate is like that of middle Russia generally, although the moderating
                    influence of the wet climate of western Europe is felt to some extent. The
                    average yearly temperature at Smolensk is 45°∙5 Fahr. (January, 13°∙5; July,
                    67°∙2). Notwithstanding the unproductive soil and the frequent failures of crops
                    (especially in the north-west), the chief occupation is agriculture. In 1884
                    3,040,000 acres were under crops, and 2,379,600 quarters of grain of various
                    kinds were raised (2,930,400 in 1883),—the potato crop yielding 5,498,400
                    bushels. Nearly all the land is cultivated by the peasant communes,—only 766,500
                    acres (out of 6,868,900) in the hands of single individuals being under
                    cultivation. Oats are an important crop. Hemp and flax are largely raised and
                    exported. Cattle-breeding stands at a low level; the cattle of the peasantry
                    suffer from a want of meadow and pasture land, which is mostly in private
                    ownership. In 1882 there were 329,850 horses, 349,000 horned cattle, 401,000
                    sheep, and 162,000 pigs. The peasantry are mostly very poor, in consequence not
                    only of the desolation inflicted on Smolensk in 1812, the effects of which are
                    still felt, but also of insufficient allotments and want of meadows. Gardening
                    and bee - keeping, which formerly flourished, have almost disappeared. The
                    timber trade and boat-building are important sources of income, but do not
                    furnish employment for all who are in need of it; more than one-half of the male
                    population of west Smolensk leave their homes every year in search of work,
                    principally as navvies throughout Russia. The manufactures are developing but
                    slowly, and in 1882 employed only about 5100 workmen,—their annual production
                    being valued at £328,800; of this amount the distilleries yielded nearly
                    one-third. A few cotton-mills in the east have a production valued at £62,160
                    per annum. A lively traffic is carried on on the rivers, principally the
                    Kasplya, the Obzha, and the Ugra, where corn, hemp, hempseed, linseed; and
                    especially timber are shipped to the amount of nearly £400,000 annually. A
                    considerable quantity of corn is imported into the western districts. Smolensk
                    is crossed by two important railways, from Moscow to Warsaw and from Riga to
                    Saratoff; a branch-line connects Vyazma with Kaluga. The educational
                    institutions embrace eleven gymnasia and progymnasia (830 boys and 1402 girls),
                    and 394 primary schools (15,031 boys and 2142 girls). Smolensk is divided into
                    twelve districts, the chief towns of which, with their populations in 1882,
                    are—Smolensk (see below), Byełyi (7150), Dorogobuzh (8400), Duhovshina (3660),
                    Elnya (4850), Gzhatsk (7050), Krasnyi (3550), Poryetchie (4650), Rosłavl (9050),
                    Sytchevka (5720), Vyazma (13,000), and Yuchnoff (3230).</p>
