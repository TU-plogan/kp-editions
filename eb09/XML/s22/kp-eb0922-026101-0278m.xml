                    English Channel. Two streams flowing into the Channel—the Authie on the north
                    and the Bresle on the south-west—bound it in these directions. The surface
                    consists of great rolling plains, generally well-cultivated and very fertile.
                    The highest point, hardly 700 feet above the sea, lies in the south-west, not
                    far from Aumale. From the mouth of the Authie to the Bay of the Somme the coast
                    is lined with a belt of sand-dunes about 2 miles broad, behind which is the
                    Marquenterre, a tract of 50,000 acres reclaimed from the sea by means of dykes
                    and traversed by drainage canals. The Bay of the Somme, obstructed by dangerous
                    sand-banks, but containing the three ports of Crotoy in the north, St Valery in
                    the south, and Hourdel in the south-west, has also been considerably encroached
                    upon by the same methods. Next come the shingle banks, behind which the low
                    fields of Cayeux (25,000 acres) have been reclaimed; and then at the hamlet of
                    Ault commence the chalk cliffs, which continue onwards into Normandy. The river
                    Somme traverses the department from south-east to north-west for a distance of
                    125 miles, through a marshy valley abounding in peat. Commanded by Ham, Péronne,
                    Amiens, and Abbeville, this valley forms a northern line of defence for Paris.
                    Apart from the water-power it supplies, the Somme is of great commercial value,
                    being accompanied by a canal all the way from its source wherever it is not
                    itself navigable. From Abbeville to St Valery its lower course forms a maritime
                    canal 165 feet wide, 13 feet deep, and 8 to 9 miles long, capable of bearing at
                    high tide vessels of 300 tons burden. From St Valery to the open sea the channel
                    is bounded on the south by a towing-path embankment 2 miles long, and on the
                    north by a dyke, capable of being laid under water, 1 mile long, and there the
                    current hollows out a very variable bed accessible at certain tides for vessels
                    of 500 tons. The most important affluents of the Somme—the Ancre from the
                    north-east by way of Albert and Corbie, the Avre from the south-east by Roye,
                    and the Selle from the south by Conty—join the main stream at Amiens. The Authie
                    and the Bresle are respectively 65 and 45 miles long. The latter ends in a
                    maritime canal about 14 feet deep between Eu and Treport. The mean temperature
                    is lower than that of Paris (49° Fahr, at Abbeville). Rain falls on 175 days per
                    annum (33 inches at Abbeville).</p>
                <p>Of the total area of 1,522,520 acres, 1,178,184 acres are under tillage, 68,844
                    are under meadows and pasture land, 133,837 are occupied by wood, while 30,514
                    acres are heaths or uncultivated tracts. In 1881 the live stock included 78,069
                    horses, 940 mules, 6125 asses, 140,512 cattle, 449,675 sheep (wool-clip 1117
                    tons), 82,755 pigs, 21,726 goats; there were also 27,902 hives (116 tons of
                    honey and 36 of wax). The department, especially in the north-east, is one of
                    the best-cultivated in France. Beetroot for sugar is the staple crop of the
                    Péronne arrondissement; cereals, fodder, oil plants (especially the poppy),
                    hemp, and potatoes are grown throughout the department, the latter more largely
                    on the seaboard. No wine is grown, but the cider harvest of 1883 amounted to
                    8,904,100 gallons, and beer is a common beverage. In 1884 there were grown
                    7,072,106 bushels of wheat, 1,810,437 of meslin, 1,008,932 of rye, 1,789,089 of
                    barley, 4207 of buckwheat, 11,197,392 of oats, 4,930,067 of potatoes, 1,161,665
                    tons of beetroot for sugar, and 208,686 tons of beetroot for fodder, 40 tons of
                    hops, 242 tons of hempseed, 651 tons of hemp fibre, 1123 tons of flax, 5245 tons
                    of colza seed, and 240,311 tons of fodder. Peat-cutting (84,335 tons in 1882)
                    gives employment to 2640 hands, the best qualities and the deepest workings
                    being in the valley of the Somme, between</p>
                <p>Amiens and Abbeville. The peat of inferior quality is burned on the spot and the
                    ashes used as manure. Textile industries employ 36,000 hands. The linen and hemp
                    manufacture is carried on in dressing establishments and spinning and weaving
                    factories with 50,000 spindles, 2250 power-looms, and 4000 hand-looms, and the
                    manufactures comprise canvas for packing and sail-making, and linen (including
                    damask). Cotton is spun by 72,800 spindles and woven by 745 power-looms and 5000
                    hand-looms. Moleskins and velvets for upholstery and other purposes are among
                    the articles manufactured. "Wool is wrought in 44 establishments with 124,000
                    spindles, 120 power-looms, and 400 hand-looms, producing yarns of all kinds,
                    “Scotch cashmeres,” “China satins,” serges, merinos, repps, poplins, &amp;c.
                    Tulles, embroidery, laces, ribbons, plush, carpets, cotton, and woollen hose are
                    also manufactured. The last industry employs half the population of Santerre.
                    About 6400 workmen are engaged in the iron and copper industries, steam-engine
                    and boiler making, and the production of spinning-mill machinery, railway plant,
                    and umbrella frames. The arrondissement of Abbeville is the centre of a great
                    lock-manufacture, employing from 4000 to 5000 workmen. There are also chemical
                    factories, bleacheries, tanneries, paper-mills (470 hands, product 6108 tons in
                    1881), saw-mills, and soap and candle works. Beetroot sugar is manufactured in
                    66 establishments (5090 horse-power and 6450 workmen). In 1881 53,177 tons of
                    sugar were produced and 2,247,146 gallons of spirit distilled from the molasses
                    and the beet. The total number of hands employed in the industries of the
                    department is 64,000, and the total horse-power 13,181. Thirty-seven decked
                    boats with 400 hands are engaged in the deep-sea fisheries, in the coast fishery
                    132 small boats with 300 hands. Cereals, horses of the Boulogne or Norman breed,
                    cattle, hemp and linen, and the manufactured goods are the exports of the
                    department. Vegetables and other foodstuffs are sent to England, and shingle for
                    the manufacture of earthenware. Besides the raw materials for the manufacturing
                    industries, wines, timber, dye-stuffs, and coal (727,783 tons in 1882) are
                    imported. There are 385 miles of national and 5033 miles of local roads, 119
                    miles of navigable river or canal, and 379 miles of railway. Administratively
                    the department comprises 5 arrondissements (Amiens, Abbeville, Doullens,
                    Montdidier, and Péronne), 41 cantons, and 836 communes. The population in 1881
                    was 550,837. The department constitutes the diocese of Amiens, which city
                    (population in 1881, 67,874) is also the seat of a court of appeal and the
                    headquarters of the 2d corps d’armée, in which the department is included.</p>
