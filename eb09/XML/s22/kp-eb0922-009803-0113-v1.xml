                <p><label type="entry">SIROHI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Seeboee</hi></label>, a
                    native state in the Rájputána agency under the Government of India, with an area
                    of 3020 square miles, lying between 24° 20' and 25° 20' N. lat. and between 72°
                    10' and 73° 10' E. long., and bounded on the W. and N. by Márwár or Jodhpur, on
                    the E. by Mewár or Udáipur, on the S. by Pálanpur and the Mahi Kántha states of
                    Edar and Dánta. The country is much broken up by hills and rocky ranges; the
                    Aravalli range divides it into two portions, running from north-east to
                    south-west. The south and south-east part of the territory is very mountainous
                    and rugged, containing the lofty Mount Abu, an isolated mass of granite rock,
                    culminating in a cluster of hills, enclosing several valleys surrounded by rocky
                    ridges, like great hollows. The highest peak rises to 5653 feet above sea-level,
                    and is one of the great trigonometrical stations. On both sides of the Aravallis
                    the country is intersected with numerous water channels, which run with
                    considerable force and volume during the height of the rainy season, but are dry
                    for the greater part of the year. The only river of any importance is the
                    Western Banás. A large portion of the state is covered with dense jungle, in
                    which wild animals, including the tiger, bear, and leopard, abound. Many
                    splendid ruins bear witness to the former prosperity and civilization of the
                    state. The climate is on the whole dry; in the south and east there is usually a
                    fair amount of rain. On Abu the average annual rainfall is about 64 inches,
                    whereas in Erinpura, less than 50 miles to the north, the average fall is only
                    between 12 and 13 inches. The Western Rájputána Railway runs through the length
                    of the state, passing just east of Mount Abu.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population numbered 142,903 (males 76,132, females 66,771), of whom
                    123,633 were Hindus, 2935 were Mohammedans, and 16,137 were Jains. The town of
                    Sirohi, the capital of the state, is situated at the western base of the range
                    of hills north of Mount Abu, and its population (1881) numbered 5699. Wheat and
                    barley are the staple crops; pulses and cotton are also grown. The present
                    ruling family of Sirohi are Deora Rajputs, a branch of the great Chauhán clan,
                    and are said to be immediately descended from Deo Raj, a descendant of Pirthvi
                    Raj, the Chauhán king of Delhi. During the early years of the present century
                    Sirohi suffered much from wars with Jodhpur and the wild Mina hill tribes. The
                    protection of the British was sought in 1817; the pretensions of Jodhpur to
                    suzerainty over Sirohi were disallowed, and in 1823 a treaty was concluded with
                    the British Government. For services rendered during the mutiny of 1857 the
                    reigning “rao” received a remission of half his tribute.</p>
