                    (1823-1883), christened Carl Wilhelm, an eminent inventor, engineer, and natural
                    philosopher, was born at Lenthe in Hanover on 4th April 1823. After being
                    educated in the polytechnic school of Magdeburg and the university of Göttingen,
                    he visited England at the age of nineteen, in the hope of introducing a process
                    in electro-plating invented by himself and his brother Werner. The invention was
                    adopted by Messrs Elkington, and Siemens returned to Germany to enter as a pupil
                    the engineering works of Count Stolberg at Magdeburg. In 1844 he was again in
                    England with another invention, the “chronometric” or differential governor for
                    steam-engines (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine).</hi> Finding that British
                    patent laws afforded the inventor a protection which was then wanting in
                    Germany, he thenceforth made England his home; but it was not till 1859 that he
                    formally became a naturalized British subject. After some years spent in active
                    invention and experiment at mechanical works near Birmingham, he went into
                    practice as an engineer in 1851. He laboured mainly in two distinct fields, the
                    applications of heat and the applications of electricity, and was characterized
                    in a very rare degree by a combination of scientific comprehension with
                    practical instinct. In both fields he played a part which would have been great
                    in either alone; and, in addition to this, he produced from time to time
                    miscellaneous inventions and scientific papers sufficient in themselves to have
                    established a reputation. His position was recognized by his election in 1862 to
                    the Royal Society, and later to the presidency of the Institute of Mechanical
                    Engineers, the Society of Telegraph Engineers, the Iron and Steel Institute, and
                    the British Association; by honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford,
                    Glasgow, Dublin, and Würzburg; and by knighthood. He died in London on the 19th
                    of November 1883.</p>
                <p>In the application of heat Siemens’s work began just after Joule’s experiments
                    had placed the doctrine of the conservation of energy on a sure basis. While
                    Rankine, Clausius, and Thomson were developing the dynamical theory of heat as a
                    matter of physical and engineering theory, Siemens, in the light of the new
                    ideas, made a bold attempt to improve the efficiency of the steam-engine as a
                    converter of heat into mechanical work. Taking up the regenerator —a device
                    invented by Stirling twenty years before, the importance of which had meanwhile
                    been ignored—he applied it to the steam-engine in the form of a regenerative
                    condenser with some success. This was in 1847, and in 1855 engines constructed
                    on Siemens’s plan were worked at the Paris exhibition. Later he made many
                    attempts to apply the regenerator to internal-combustion or gas engines; but
                    neither in steam-engines nor in gas-engines were his inventions directly and
                    permanently fruitful, though the direction they followed is that in which
                    improvement is still looked for. The regenerative principle, however, as a means
                    of economizing heat soon received at his hands another and far wider
                    application. In 1856 he introduced the regenerative furnace, the idea of his
                    brother Friedrich, with whom William associated himself in directing its
                    applications. In an ordinary furnace a very large part of the heat of combustion
                    is lost by being carried off in the hot gases which pass up the chimney. In the
                    regenerative furnace the hot gases pass through a regenerator, or chamber
                    stacked with loose bricks, which absorb the heat. When the bricks are well
                    heated the hot gases are diverted so to pass through another similar chamber,
                    while the air necessary for combustion, before it enters the furnace, is made to
                    traverse the heated chamber, taking up as it goes the heat which has been stored
                    in the bricks. After a suitable interval the air currents are again reversed.
                    The process is repeated periodically, with the result that the products of
                    combustion escape only after being cooled, the heat which they take from the
                    furnace being in great part carried back in the heated air. But another
                    invention was required before the regenerative furnace could be thoroughly
                    successful. This was the use of gaseous fuel, produced by the crude distillation
                    and incomplete combustion of coal in a distinct furnace, now known as Siemens’s
                    gas-producer. From this the gaseous fuel passes by a flue to the regenerative
                    furnace, and it, as well as the entering air, is heated by the regenerative
                    method, four brick-stacked chambers being used instead of two. The complete
                    invention was applied at Chance’s glass-works in Birmingham in 1861, and
                    furnished the subject of Faraday’s farewell lecture to the Royal Institution. It
                    was soon applied to many industrial processes, but it found its greatest
                    development a few years later at the hands of Siemens himself in the manufacture
                    of steel. To produce steel directly from the ore, or by melting together
                    wroughtiron scrap with cast-iron upon the open hearth, had been in his mind from
                    the first, but it was not till 1867, after two years of experiment in “sample
                    steel works” erected by himself for the purpose, that he achieved success. The
                    modern forms of the Siemens steel process are described in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Iron</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 347 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>) <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> The product is a mild steel of exceptionally trustworthy
                    quality, the use of which for boiler-plates has done much to make possible the
                    high steam-pressures that are now common, and has consequently contributed,
                    indirectly, to that improvement in the thermodynamic efficiency of heat engines
                    which Siemens had so much at heart. Just before his death he was again at work
                    upon the same subject, his plan being to use gaseous fuel from a Siemens
                    producer in place of solid fuel beneath the boiler, and to apply the
                    regenerative principle to boiler furnaces. His faith in gaseous fuel led him to
                    anticipate that its use would in time supersede that of solid coal for domestic
                    and industrial purposes, cheap gas being supplied either from special works or
                    direct from the pit; and<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0053-0038"/> among his last inventions was a house grate to
                    burn gas along with coke, which he regarded as a possible cure for city
                    smoke.</p>
                <p>In electricity Siemens’s name is closely associated with the growth of land and
                    submarine telegraphs, the invention and development of the dynamo, and the
                    application of electricity to lighting and to locomotion. In 1860, with his
                    brother Werner, he invented the earliest form of what is now known as the
                    Siemens armature; and in 1867 he communicated a paper to the Royal Society “On
                    the Conversion of Dynamical into Electrical Force without the aid of Permanent
                    Magnetism,” in which he announced the invention by Werner Siemens of the
                    dynamo-electric machine, an invention which was also reached independently and
                    almost simultaneously by Wheatstone and by S. A. Varley. The Siemens-Alteneck or
                    multiple-coil armature followed in 1873, and became the basis of the modern
                    Siemens dynamo as developed, with great labour, by the firm of Siemens Brothers
                    themselves, and (with later modifications) by Edison, Hopkinson, and others.
                    While engaged in constructing a trans-Atlantic cable for the Direct United
                    States Telegraph Company, Siemens designed the very original and successful ship
                    “Faraday,” by which that and other cables were laid. One of the last of his
                    works was the Portrush and Bushmills electric tramway, in the north of Ireland,
                    opened in 1883, where the waterpower of the river Bush drives a Siemens dynamo,
                    from which the electric energy is conducted to another dynamo serving as a motor
                    on the car. In the Siemens electric furnace the intensely hot atmosphere of the
                    electric arc between carbon points is employed to melt refractory metals.
                    Another of the uses to which he turned electricity was to employ light from arc
                    lamps as a substitute for sunlight in hastening the growth and fructification of
                    plants. Among his miscellaneous inventions were the differential governor
                    already alluded to, and a highly scientific modification of it, described to the
                    Royal Society in 1866; a water-meter which acts on the principle of counting the
                    number of turns made by a small reaction turbine through which the supply of
                    water flows; an electric thermometer and pyrometer, in which temperature is
                    determined by its effect on the electrical conductivity of metals; an attraction
                    meter for determining very slight variations in the intensity of a gravity; and
                    the bathometer, by which he applied this idea to the problem of finding the
                    depth of the sea without a sounding line. In a paper read before the Royal
                    Society in 1882 “On the Conservation of Solar Energy,” he suggested a bold but
                    unsatisfactory theory of the sun’s heat, in which he sought to trace on a cosmic
                    scale an action similar to that of the regenerative furnace. His fame, however,
                    does not rest on his contributions to pure science, valuable as some of these
                    were. His strength lay in his grasp of scientific principles, in his skill to
                    perceive where and how they could be applied to practical affairs, in his
                    zealous and instant pursuit of thought with action, and in the indomitable
                    persistence with which he clung to any basis of effort that seemed to him
                    theoretically sound.</p>
                <p>Siemens’s writings consist for the most part of lectures and papers scattered
                    through the scientific journals and the publications of the Royal Society, the
                    Institution of Civil Engineers, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, the Iron
                    and Steel Institute, the British Association, &amp;c. A biography by Dr William
                    Pole is now (1886) in preparation. (J. A. E.)</p>
