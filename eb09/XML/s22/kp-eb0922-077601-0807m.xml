                    rend="smallcaps">Geography and Statistics.</hi></p>
                <p>As the Swiss Confederation consists of a number of small districts, differing
                    from each other in many points, but gathered round a common centre, originally
                    for common defence against a common foe, it is not surprising that its political
                    boundaries do not coincide with those of nature. So we find that Ticino is south
                    of the main chain of the Alps, a large part of the Grisons is east of the Rhine
                    and of the ranges separating it from Tyrol, while Schaffhausen is north of the
                    Rhine, and Porrentruy is in the French plain far down the western slope of the
                    Jura. Putting aside these exceptional cases (all of them outside the original
                    limits of the Confederation), the physical geography of Switzerland may be thus
                    roughly summed up :—</p>
                <p>(1) To the south there is the main chain of the Alps, which is joined at Mont
                    Dolent (12,566 feet) by the lower ranges running east from the east end of the
                    Lake of Geneva, and which continues to be the boundary up to the Stelvio
                    Pass.</p>
                <p>(2) To the north of this main chain of the Alps there is another great range,
                    only slightly inferior in height and extent, which starts from the hills known
                    as the Mont Jorat above Lausanne, rises in the great peaks of the Bernese
                    Oberland and in the Tödi, trends to the north near Chur, and, after rising once
                    more to form the Santis, dies away on the south shore of the Lake of
                    Constance.</p>
                <p>(3) The main chain of the Alps and this great north outlier are parallel to each
                    other from Mont Dolent to near Chur; joined for a short space near the Pizzo
                    Rotondo (west of the St Gotthard), they again part near the Oberalp Pass (east
                    of the St Gotthard). Between these two great ranges flow two of the mightiest
                    European rivers, the Rhine towards the east and the Rhone towards the west,
                    their head waters being separated only by the tangled mountain mass between the
                    Pizzo Rotondo and the Oberalp Pass.</p>
                <p>(4) To the north of the great north outlier of the main chain of the Alps there
                    arc what may be called the plains of Switzerland, really the huge undulating
                    valley of the Aar (and its affluents), to which must be added the Thur valley
                    between the Aar basin and the Lake of Constance.</p>
                <p>Thus, omitting the special cases named above, we may roughly describe Switzerland
                    as consisting of two great trenches traversed by two great rivers, and enclosed
                    by two huge mountain masses, together with the enormous valley of the Aar and
                    the smaller one of the Thur, both these shut in by the great north outlier of
                    the main chain of the Alps, the Rhine, and the Jura,—two deeply cut trenches,
                    and two wide and undulating valleys.</p>
                <p>The main chain of the Alps rises in Swiss territory to the height of 15,217 feet
                    in Monte Rosa, and its north outlier to 14,026 feet in the Finsteraarhorn. The
                    mean level of the Aar valley has been estimated at 1378 feet, its lowest point
                    being the low-water mark of the Rhine at Basel (914 feet); the lowest level
                    within the Confederation, however, is on the Lago Maggiore (646 feet).</p>
                <p>According to the most recent calculations, the total area of the Confederation is
                    15,964·2 square miles, of which 71·7 per cent., or 11,443·3 square miles, are
                    classed as “productive,” 3032 square miles being covered by forests, and 132·3
                    square miles by vines. Of the other 28·3 per cent., or 4520·9 square miles
                    (classed as “unproductive ”),</p>
                <p>709∙9 are occupied by glaciers, 520·3 by lakes, 90 by beds of rivers and streams,
                    and 62·4 by towns, villages, and buildings. Of the whole area the three great
                    cantons of the Grisons, Bern, and Valais take up 7439·9 square miles, or nearly
                    one-half, while, if to them be added Vaud, Ticino, and St Gall, the extent is
                    raised to 10,552 square miles, or about two-thirds of the entire
                    Confederation.</p>
                <p>The total area of Switzerland (15,964·2 square miles) is distributed over four
                    great river basins (draining to three different seas) in the following
                    proportions :—Rhine 11,166; Rhone, 2717; Po, 1358; and Inn, 721.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Rhine</hi> basin is by far the largest in Switzerland, and
                    drains of course to the North Sea. The Rhine itself is formed of two
                    branches,—Vorder Rhine (valley of Dissentis) and Hinter Rhine (from the Splugen
                    and St Bernardino),—which unite at Reichenau, near Chur. The joint stream
                    receives several mountain torrents, expands into the Lake of Constance, and then
                    turns west, receiving the Thur, and opposite Waldshut the great stream of the
                    Aar, finally leaving Swiss territory at Basel, where it turns north. Its main
                    affluent is the Aar, the basin of which covers no less than 6794 square miles.
                    This stream rises in the glaciers of the Bernese Oberland, expands into the
                    Lakes of Brienz and of Thun, receives from the left the Kander, the Saane, and
                    the Zihl, and from the right the Emme, as well as (near Brugg, that great
                    meeting-place of the waters) the Reuss flowing through the Lake of Lucerne and
                    the united stream of the Linth and the Limmat flowing through the Lakes of
                    Wallenstadt and Zurich. It is interesting historically to note the fact that
                    the. thirteen cantons which till 1798 formed the Confederation are all comprised
                    in the Rhine basin, the ten oldest <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> all before
                    1500) being within that of the Aar, and that it was only after 1798 that certain
                    Romansch-, French-, and. Italian-speaking “allies” and subject lands—with their
                    respective river basins—were tacked on. The <hi rend="italic">Rhone</hi> rises
                    in the glacier of the same name and flows west, receiving the mountain torrents
                    of the Visp, the Lonza, and the Dranse, besides others, expands into the Lake of
                    Geneva, and a little way from Geneva quits Swiss territory on its way to the
                    Mediterranean. The main stream flowing from Switzerland to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Po</hi> basin is the Ticino (from the St Gotthard), which widens into the Lago
                    Maggiore; another stream expands into the Lake of Lugano; and others run into
                    the Lake of Como,—all finally joining the Po in the Lombard plains, thus
                    draining to the Adriatic. The Ramm, flowing through the Münsterthal, joins the
                    Adige and so drains into the Adriatic. The <hi rend="italic">Inn</hi> basin is
                    composed of the upper part of the river (above Martinsbruck) and drains into the
                    Danube and so into the Black Sea.</p>
                <p>Most of the great Swiss rivers, being in their origin mere mountain torrents,
                    tend to overflow their banks, and hence much is required and has been done to
                    prevent this by embanking them, and regaining arable land from them. So the
                    Rhine (between Ragatz and the Lake of Constance), the Rhone, the Aar, the Reuss;
                    and in particular we may mention the great work on the Linth (1807 to 1822)
                    carried out by J. Konrad Escher, who earned by his success the surname of “Von
                    der Linth,” and on the Zihl near the Lakes of Neuchâtel and Bienne, while the
                    diversion of the Kander from its junction with the Aar at Uetendorf to a channel
                    by which it flows into the Lake of Thun was effected as early as 1714.<note

                <p>There are very many lakes in Switzerland. The two largest (Geneva and Constance)
                    balance each other at the soutli-west and north-east comers of the
                    Confederation. The following list gives details regarding the fifteen over 4
                    square miles in extent. It will be noticed that of these twelve are in the Rhine
                    basin (eleven of<pb break="no"

                    basin, one in the Rhone basin, and none at all in the Inn basin. It has been
                    estimated that in the Rhine basin there are no fewer than nineteen large and
                    thirty-seven small lakes. Of the smaller Swiss lakes we may mention the Dauben
                    See, and the Oeschinen See, as well as the Märjelen See close to the Gross
                    Aletsch glacier. There are of course an infinite number of Alpine tarns.</p>

                <p>The lakes marked * are only partly in Swiss territory.</p>
                <p>There are a great number of waterfalls in Switzerland, the loftiest being that of
                    the Staubbach (1001 feet), in the valley of Lauterbrunnen, or “Clear Springs”
                    (Bernese Oberland). In the Oberland, too, we find the Handeck (200-220 feet),
                    near the source of the Aar, while the Reichenbach descends in seven falls and
                    the Giessbach in thirteen. The falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen contain an
                    enormous mass of water, though they are only 82 feet in height. In southern
                    Switzerland the Pissevache fall (200 feet), in the Rhone valley, is the best
                    known.</p>

                    Austria, his figures for France and Italy being untrustworthy and incomplete;
                    but Switzerland has 138 glaciers of the first rank <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    over 4¾ miles long) as against 71 in Austria, though Austria has 391 of the
                    second rank <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> between 4¾ and 3 miles long) as
                    against 333 in Switzerland. The distribution of the Swiss glaciers deserves
                    notice, for in eleven cantons (that is, half of those in the Confederation)
                    there are no glaciers at all, while in five others (Unterwalden, Vaud, St Gall,
                    Schwyz, and Appenzell) they only cover about 13 square miles out of 709∙9 square
                    miles of ice and snow in the Confederation, according to the official survey.
                    Valais heads the list with 375∙1 square miles, then come the Grisons (138∙6),
                    Bern (111∙3), Uri (44∙3), Glarus (13∙9), and Ticino (13∙1). The longest glacier
                    in the Alps is the Gross Aletsch in the Bernese Oberland, 15 miles long; it has
                    a basin of 49∙8 square miles and a maximum breadth of 1968 yards. In point of
                    length the Unteraar glacier comes next (10∙4 miles), followed by the Gorner and
                    Viescher glaciers (each 9∙4 miles). The lowest point to which a Swiss glacier is
                    known to have descended is 3225 feet, attained by the Lower Grindelwald glacier
                    in 1818. Dr Heim has ascertained that the maximum annual snowfall in the Alps
                    takes place in the lower snow regions, a conclusion which the present writer can
                    confirm from personal experience gained on the ascent of several of the highest
                    Oberland peaks in January 1874 and 1879. Dr Heim states that in the central Alps
                    of Switzerland the limit of perpetual snow varies from 9259 to 9023 feet. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Glacier.</hi></p>
                <p>In Switzerland, where the height above sea-level varies from 646 feet (Lago
                    Maggiore) to 15,217 feet (Monte Rosa), we naturally find very many climates,
                    from the regions of olives, vines, oaks and beeches, pines and firs, to those of
                    high mountain pastures, rhododendrons, and of eternal snow (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alps).</hi> As regards the duration of the seasons, there is a
                    corresponding variety. It has been reckoned that, while in Italian Switzerland
                    winter lasts only three months, at Glarus it lasts four, in the Engadine six, on
                    the St Gotthard eight, on the Great St Bernard nine, and on the St Théodule
                    always. A painstaking writer has calculated that, if Switzerland were flattened
                    out into a plain, and reduced to the level of the sea, it would be comprised
                    between the isotherms 51°∙8 and 55°∙4 F. As a matter of fact the mean
                    temperature varies no less than 34½°, for at Bellinzona it is 54½° F., at Geneva
                    49¼°, at Basel 49 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    °, at Chur 48¾°, at Interlaken 48°, while on the Great St Bernard it sinks to
                    30°, and on the St Théodule to 20°. The Alps form the boundary between the
                    region where the rainfall is greatest in summer and that where it is greatest in
                    autumn, the winter and spring rainfall varying but slightly. These are the
                    percentages of the annual rainfall in Switzerland at different seasons :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rhine Basin;</hi> winter, 18; spring, 25; summer, 33; autumn,
                    24.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rhone Basin·. ,,</hi> 21; ,, 26; ,, 26; ,, 27.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ticino Basin; ,,</hi> 12; ,, 26; ,, 27; ,, 35.</p>
                <p>It has been shown by careful observations that the rain (or snow) fall is
                    greatest as we approach the Alps, whether from the north or south, the flanks of
                    the great ranges and the valleys opening out towards the plains receiving much
                    more rain than the high Alpine valleys enclosed on all sides by lofty ridges.
                    Thus the annual rainfall is 35 inches at Basel but 64½ at Beatenberg (above
                    Interlaken) and 69 at Schwyz, rising to 88 on the Grimsel and 102 on the St
                    Bernardino, and falling again at Lugano to 63. Dr Heim calculates that the
                    percentage of snow in the total annual rainfall in Switzerland varies from 63 on
                    the Great St Bernard to 6 at Geneva, the mean fall of 34 being at Platta in the
                    Grisons. Thunderstorms generally vary in frequency with the amount of rainfall,
                    being most common near the great ranges, and often very local. The floods caused
                    by excessive rainfall are sometimes very destructive, as in 1839, 1852, and
                    1868, while the same cause leads to landslips, of which the most remarkable have
                    been those on the Rossberg above Goldau (1806), at Evionnaz (1835), and at Elm
                    (1881).</p>
                <p>As regards the larger cyclones or storms of Europe, a south wind in the Alps
                    indicates that the barometrical minimum is in the English Channel, a west wind
                    that it is in the North Sea, a north wind that it is in the Eastern Alps, and an
                    east wind that the depression is in the Mediterranean, about Corsica. When the
                    barometrical minimum shifts from the Atlantic over Scandinavia to Russia, a
                    soutli-west wind in the Alps is followed by west and then north winds. The
                    “föhn” is the most remarkable of the local winds in Switzerland,—a strong
                    soutli-west or south wind, very hot and very dry. It was formerly supposed to
                    come from the Sahara, but is now held to be a south-west or south wind which,
                    saturated with moisture, crosses the Alps, precipitating a copious rainfall in
                    its course; commencing its descent in the northern valleys with a high
                    temperature for these great heights, it necessarily increases in temperature and
                    dryness as it passes into the high pressure of lower levels. Dr Hann concludes
                    from observation that, assuming the air to cool at the rate of 1° C. in every
                    100 metres of ascent, and the ridge crossed by the fohn to be 2000 metres in
                    height, the heat lost on the ascent is only 0°·5 C., so that when the föhn
                    reaches the north side it will have a heat, not of 10°, but of 20°. The fohn
                    occurs most frequently in spring. Other local winds in the Alps are those which
                    blow up a valley in the morning and down it in. the evening, due to the heating
                    of the air in the valleys by the sun during the day and its cooling by
                    terrestrial radiation at night. The cloud streamers from great Alpine peaks are
                    due to the condensing of the moisture in a layer of air, and, as the moisture is
                    carried away by the wind, so the streamer is dissolved.</p>
                <p>For all these reasons Switzerland has many varieties of climate; and, while,
                    owing to the distribution of the rainfall, the Ticino and Aar valleys are very
                    fertile, the two great trenches between the main chain and its north outlier,
                    though warm, are less productive, as the water comes from the rivers and not
                    from the skies.</p>
                <p>Asphalt is the only raw mineral product the export of which exceeds the import;
                    and it is obtained only in the canton of Neuchâtel, where the output of the Val
                    de Travers deposit in 1883 reached 28,000 tons. Though iron ores are known
                    (according to Weber and Brosi’s map) to exist in 13 localities, gold in 3,
                    silver in 22, copper in 29, lead in 27, nickel and cobalt in 2, tin in 1,
                    sulphur in 3, Switzerland is practically dependent for all its metals on foreign
                    supply. While 35,161 tons of iron were obtained in 1870 (mostly from mines in
                    the Jura), only 19,045 were obtained in 1881. True coal is wholly absent;
                    lignites, however, occur both in the Tertiary and the Quaternary formations, the
                    most important workings being those of Käpfnach, Utznach, Mörschwyl, Dümten,
                    Lutry, Conversion, and Oron. In 1870 the output was 33,364 tons, in 1881 only
                    6184. Anthracite occurs in Valais. Peat is common in many parts. Salt (42,000
                    tons) is procured from wells in Aargau, Basel, and Vaud. The first salt-deposit
                    was discovered in 1836 at Rothenhaus (Basel canton), that of Rheinfelden in
                    1844, of Ryburg in 1845, and of Kaiseraugst in 1865. The wells at Bex have been
                    worked since 1554.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>Game is not abundant in any part of Switzerland; and rigorous game laws and other
                    devices have been adopted in order to increase the number of wild animals. In
                    1875 a law was passed in accordance with which a commission marked out certain
                    reservations or “districts francs pour la chasse au gibier de montagne”; and in
                    1881 their limits were revised for another term of five years, including an area
                    of 5268 square kilometres in 1885. There were then within this area 8487 chamois
                    and about 106 roebuck. The· chamois were most abundant in the Grisons, Bern,
                    Glarus, and Freiburg. In the Alpine regions the marmot and Alpine hare are still
                    common, and their numbers have increased under the protective system. Grouse,
                    partridge, wild duck, and snipe are the<pb break="no"

                    considered game, and the federal council in 1885 appointed a commission to draw
                    up a catalogue of all birds found in Switzerland, and to establish stations for
                    collecting facts of ornithological interest.</p>
                <p>Attention has recently been directed to the diminution of the supply of
                    freshwater fish, due in part to over-fishing and in part to pollution of the
                    streams. It is estimated that the fish-bearing waters in the whole country cover
                    an aggregate area of 1581 square kilometres (1348 belonging to lakes and 233 to
                    rivers and streams), the cantons with the greatest areas being Vaud (443 square
                    kilometres), Bern (161), Thurgau (139), aud Neuchâtel (98). Close seasons, and
                    in certain places close years, have been established, and numerous
                    fish-hatcheries are also in operation (57 in 1885), the species treated being
                    mainly salmon, lake trout, river trout, grayling (ombre), red trout or Röthel,

                    (C. albus), Salmo fontinalis,</hi> and the “mäder.” No fewer than 5,709,432 fish
                    were introduced into the lakes and rivers in 1885. By a law of 1884 the federal
                    council is allowed to defray one-third of the expense of the construction of
                    fish-ladders. In 1882 a Swiss fisheries society was founded. Conventions in
                    regard to the fisheries have been signed with Italy, France, and Germany.</p>
                <p>Great importance attaches to the domestic animals of Switzerland. In 1876 there
                    were 284,478 owners of live-stock, in 1886 289,610. The following are the
                    numbers for those two years :— horses, 100,935 and 98,333; cattle, 1,035,930,
                    1,211,713; sheep, 367,549, 341,632; goats, 396,055, 415,916; pigs, 334,515,
                    394,451; mules, 3145, 2741; asses, 2113, 2042; and beehives, 177,825, 207,180.

                <p>The first federal census of which the results were published was neither quite
                    synchronous (April 1836 to February 1838) nor quite systematic. That of 1850
                    took account only of the population with right of residence <hi rend="italic"
                    >(population domiciliée),</hi> and not of the population actually present at the
                    date of the census. In 1860 the census was declared decennial. The following are
                    the numbers returned:— March, 18-23, 1850, 2,392,740; December, 10, 1860,
                    2,507,170; December 1, 1870, 2,669,147; December 1, 1880, 2,846,102.</p>
                <p>As regards density of population, Switzerland, with 198·5 persons to the square
                    mile, stands considerably above Scotland (125) and a long way below England and
                    Wales (446). The Alpine region is the sparsest generally, though certain
                    districts, like Appenzell Ausser-Rhoden, are very densely peopled; the Jura
                    region has a much higher ratio; and the densest region of all is the Swiss
                    plateau. If we draw an irregular line from the east end of the Lake of Geneva by
                    Thun, Lucerne, and the south of the Lake of Zurich to Rheineck, we shall have
                    nearly all the more densely populated portions of the country to the north, the
                    only notable exception being what might be called the Swiss peninsula of Lugano.
                    A large proportion of the country to the south has only from 1 to 19 inhabitants
                    to the square kilometre. The districts where the density rises above 250 to the
                    square kilometre are that to the south-east and south-west of Geneva, the
                    vicinity of Lausanne, the districts of Chaux de Fonds, Neuchâtel, Biel, Bern,
                    Soleure, Basel, a large tract along both sides of the Lake of Zurich, and the
                    district between St Gall and Rheineck. The districts in which an increase of
                    population had taken place between 1870 and 1880 are curiously distributed. An
                    increase of 30 per cent. or over occurs only in the environs of Basel and in two
                    large areas of which the chief centres are Altdorf and Airolo. Decrease was
                    prevalent throughout a large part of the better populated regions of the north,
                    while a certain increase had taken place throughout much of the south-western
                    area.</p>
                <p>In 1880 there were 960·8 males to every 1000 females, a rather smaller
                    preponderance of females than in England and Wales. For every 1000 above the age
                    of 50 there are 176 unmarried females to 154 unmarried males. The disproportion
                    of the sexes in the country at large is mainly due to emigration; but in certain
                    cantons it is partly due to excess of women in the immigrants from neighbouring
                    countries. In Uri, Schwyz, and Valais only is there an excess of males. In every
                    1000 of the population there were, in 1860, 296 under 15 years of age, 620
                    between 15 and 60 years, and 84 upwards of 60; the corresponding figures in 1870
                    being 315, 595, and 90; and for 1880, 319, 593, and 88. The proportion of
                    married persons to the total number of the adults (47·4 per cent. ) is less than
                    in most other countries, though this proportion has been gradually raised both
                    before and since 1880 by certain legislative changes, including the new marriage
                    law in 1874. At the same time the average fertility of the marriages has
                    decreased. Early marriages on the part of the males are slightly more frequent
                    than in England. Divorce and separation are frequent. Thus in 1876·80 they
                    formed nearly 5 per cent. of the marriages, while in Belgium and the Netherlands
                    they do not reach 1 per cent. As regards the marriage relations of the different
                    creeds, the five years 1877-81 showed that (excluding the canton of Geneva,
                    where the creed is not registered) there were only 0·7 separations per 1000
                    existing marriages where both husband and wife were Catholics, 2·8 where both
                    were Protestants, 3·2 where the husband was a Catholic and the wife a
                    Protestant, and 4·5 where the husband was a Protestant and the wife a
                    Catholic.</p>
                <p>The percentage of illegitimate births during the years 1871—77 was 5·7, 5·2, 5·1,
                    4·8, 4·4, 5·0, and 4·9 respectively, a rate almost identical with that of
                    England and Wales. Infant mortality has been decreasing. While 20·32 per cent.
                    of the quick-born children of 1876 died in their first year, only 17·3 died in

                <p>At the census of 1880 there were in Switzerland 211,035 foreigners (112,311 males
                    and 98,724 females), or one foreigner to every 13 or 14 of the population. The
                    origin of this alien element was very various :—from Alsace-Lorraine, 2607
                    males, 2732 females; Germany, 43,923, 45,991; Austria-Hungary, 8389, 4929;
                    Italy, 27,821, 13,709; Spain and Portugal, 175, 93; France, 26,264, 27,389;
                    Holland and Belgium, 445, 493; Great Britain, 1027, 1785; Russia, 599, 685;
                    Servia, Roumania, and Greece, 119, 35; Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, 194, 188;
                    America, 563, 548.</p>
                <p>Between 1868 and 1877 the average number of emigrants from Switzerland was 3516
                    per annum; between 1878 and 1882 it was 7196. In 1883, 1884, and 1885 the
                    figures were respectively 13,502 (12,758 of them native-born Swiss), 9608, and
                    7583. By far the greater proportion of the emigrants found their way to America,
                    and mainly to the United States, though some of the South American republics (as
                    Chili) attract a considerable number. In the five years 1876-80 3172 persons on
                    an average left for North America annually, 99 for Central America, 594 for
                    South America, and 107 for Australia, while Asia and Africa together did not
                    count more than 167.</p>
                <p>The population is to a very great extent rural. Only three cities (Zurich,
                    Geneva, and Basel) have a population exceeding 50,000, and at the census of 1880
                    only 59 other towns had each more than 4000 inhabitants. Of these Bern (see
                    table above), Lausanne, Chaux de Fonds (22,456), St Gall, Lucerne, Neuchâtel,
                    Winterthur (13,595), Schaffhausen, Biel (11,623), Freiburg, Herisau (11,082),
                    and Locle (10,464) exceeded 10,000.</p>
                <p>A religious census was taken in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1880; in the first case
                    only three categories were recognized—Catholic, Protestant, and Jew; in 1860 and
                    1870 four—Catholic, Protestant, Christians of other denominations, and
                    non-Christian. After much discussion the federal council, which had proposed to
                    drop the religious census in 1880, was prevailed upon by the arguments of ten
                    cantons to adopt a similar classification in 1880. The figures in 1870
                    were—1,566,347 Protestants, 1,084,369 Catholics, 11,435 members of other sects,
                    and 6996 Jews; in 1880 the Protestants numbered 1,667,109, the Catholics
                    1,160,782, the Jews 7373, and miscellaneous 10,838. The Jews are most strongly
                    represented in the cantons of Bern (1316 in 1880), Basel (1053), Aargau (1234),
                    Zurich (806), Neuchâtel (689), and Geneva (662).</p>
                <p>It has been estimated that, of the whole area of Switzerland, 1,642,471 acres are
                    under arable cultivation and 1,917,632 acres in forest, while 2,866,113 acres
                    are altogether unproductive. Agricultural statistics have never been
                    systematically registered by the federal authorities, and only a few of the
                    cantons have devoted serious attention to the matter. Herr C. Mühlemann (Z. <hi
                    rend="italic">f. Schweiz. Stat.,</hi> 1886) gives the following estimate of the
                    area cropped and the annual value (in thousands of francs) of the produce :—</p>

                <p>The name “allmend” is given to land still held in common, whether arable, meadow,
                    pasture, or forest. The main part of the “allmends” now existing consists of
                    pasture and forest land. The pasture lands, “alps,” or high mountain pastures
                    comprise “voralpen,” used in the spring, “mittelalpen,” or cow-pastures, and
                    “hochalpen” (sometimes 9000 feet above the sea), for sheep and goats. They are
                    most numerous in Neuchâtel, Bern, and Grisons. The capital value of the whole is
                    estimated at 200,000,000 francs or more. Of the 3032 miles of forest land 127·3
                    belong to the state, 200·1 to “communes” or private associations, and 897 to
                    private persons. The federal Government has done much to reafforest tracts, both
                    by itself and by stimulating cantonal effort, and generally to promote the
                    science of forestry.</p>
                <p>The silk industry of Switzerland was already established at</p>
                <p>Zurich and Basel in the latter half of the 13th century; but after a period of
                    prosperity it died out. It was again introduced by the Protestants expelled from
                    Locarno in 1555. Crape, velvet, and taffetas were the favourite products of the
                    first stage; ribbonweaving came later with another band of Locarno refugees and
                    the French Huguenots. In 1872 116 firms were engaged in the silk trade, in 1881
                    134. Between those dates the employees had increased from 39,940 to 49,816
                    (65,000 in 1883), and the wages from 15,382,186 to 19,815,453 francs. In 1881
                    2,153,100 kilos of raw silk and 1,067,700 of silk-waste were imparted; and the
                    export of silk goods, ribbons, and ferret silk was 1,152,300, 1,965,400, and
                    819,000 kilos respectively. Cotton begun to be manufactured in Switzerland in
                    the 15th century, and power-loom weaving was introduced in 1830. The industry
                    has owed a good deal to the abundant water-power of the country. In 1881 there
                    were about 23,000 cotton looms; and cotton-spinning employed about 60,000
                    spindles. The workers numbered 88,046 in 1883. Bleaching and cloth-dressing have
                    attained a great development in the neighbourhood of St Gall, both in the
                    cantons of St Gall and Appenzell. Printworks are especially numerous in Glarus.
                    Aargau is the chief seat of the woollen manufacture, having 4 millions of the
                    total production valued at 11½ million francs. Linen, the first of the Swiss
                    textile fabrics to find its way to a foreign market, is no longer manufactured
                    on a large scale. Embroidered goods are the great specialty of the export trade
                    of eastern Switzerland,— the cantons of St Gall, Appenzell, Thurgau, and part of
                    Zurich. In flat-stitch machine embroidery 15,256 workers were employed in 1872,
                    and 27,801 in 1880 (43 and 47 per 1000 inhabitants). In the different
                    departments of hand embroidery 33,359 persona were employed in 1881. The St Gall
                    market is also supplied by a large number of workers in Vorarlberg. The value of
                    the embroidered goods exported from the consular district of St Gall for America
                    alone increased from 19 to nearly 30 million francs between 1879 and 1882.
                    Straw-plaiting is an important industry in Aargau (centre at Wohlen), Ticino,
                    and Freiburg. In 1867-68, when the trade was at its best, the total export was
                    worth 10½ million francs. Watch and clock making is a specially Swiss industry,
                    giving employment to 44,000 workers in 1883. In Geneva alone 296 establishments
                    were at work in 1882 in some department or other of the manufacture. The valley
                    of Joux (Vaud and Saint Croix), Chaux de Fonds, Locle, Les Brenets, Les Ponts,
                    Fleuvier (Neuchâtel), Bienne, Porrentruy, Saint Imier (Bern), Granges (Soleure),
                    Waldenberg (Basel), and Schaffhausen are all important seats of the craft. The
                    condensed-milk industry of Switzerland is also well known. The exports in 1875
                    amounted to 4,261,800 kilos, and in 1883 to 12,086,900. A similar article is
                    Nestlé’s infants’ food from Vevey. Swiss cheese (Emmenthal and Gruyère) has a
                    widespread reputation; the export increased from 5,093,100 kilos in 1851 to
                    25,959,400 in 1883. The production of beer in</p>
                <p>Switzerland was 6,160,000 gallons in 1867 and 20,240,000 in</p>
                <p>1882; in the latter year 289,564 gallons were exported. The distilleries (1006)
                    produce about 990,000 gallons of pure alcohol annually. Allusion can only be
                    made here to the great chemical industries of the country, its potteries,
                    paper-mills, engineering works, gun-factories, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Wood-carving was one of the most ancient, as it is now one of the best known, of
                    the minor arts of Switzerland. The great seat of the modern industry is the
                    Bernese Oberland, where the peasants during the long evenings of winter for
                    centuries devoted themselves to producing artistic articles in wood. It was
                    regularly organized by Christian Fischer in Brienz (1825), and is now mainly in
                    the hands of a company, founded in 1881, which associates capitalists and
                    workmen in the profits. In 1870 1139 men and 56 women were employed throughout
                    Switzerland in this department; in 1880 the numbers were 1202 and 105.<note

                <p>Owing to the original abundance of timber it was almost the only material
                    employed in the building of houses. There are practically three styles: the
                    so-called block-house, in which the logs are laid one upon the other; the
                    post-built house, in which upright posts and a strong framework are filled in
                    with planks; and the “riegelhaus,” in which a framework of wood is filled in
                    with brick or stones. In the cantons of Zurich, Thurgau, and Schaffhausen the
                    riegelhaus (the usual form in southern Germany) has—chiefly owing to the
                    increased cost of timber—displaced the two other styles, which alone were in use
                    there till the beginning of the 17th century.<note anchored="true"

                    whey-cure stations (Heiden, Gais, Appenzell, &amp;c.), and various chalybeate
                    springs (Weissbad, Gonten, Heinrichsbad). Basel contains salt baths at
                    Schweizerhalle, Bienenberg, and Schauenburg. Bern is particularly rich in baths
                    and sanatoriums (Lenk, Weissenburg, Heustrich, Gurnigel, Engistein,
                    Blumenstein). Schwarzseebad is the chief mineral spring in Freiburg;
                    Pfäffers-Ragatz in St Gall is world-famous. The Stachelberger Schwefelbad in
                    Glarus is much frequented. The Grisons have almost a superfluity of mineral
                    waters, some of which (St Moritz, Fideris) are exported in large quantities.
                    Weissenstein in Soleure is one of the oldest sanatoriums in Switzerland. Lavey
                    and Bex in Vaud are respectively famous for their sulphur and salt baths. In
                    Valais, Saxon and Leukerbad are famous. The importance of altitude in the
                    attractiveness of a health resort is shown in a table by Guyer, ‘230 of the
                    hotels for foreign visitors being upwards of 3900 feet above the sea. Dr F.
                    Stöpel <hi rend="italic">(Industrie u. Handelspolitik der Schweiz,</hi> 1876)
                    reckoned the total receipts from foreign visitors at 120,000,000 francs.</p>
                <p>The position taken by Switzerland in the trade and commerce of the world is
                    remarkable when the various natural obstacles are considered—such as absence of
                    raw material for her industries, costly and difficult means of transport, and
                    restrictive customs established by neighbouring countries. The following table
                    shows the value in thousands of francs of the imports and exports for 1885 (the
                    first year for which we have official returns):—</p>

                <p>England is the great market for silver watches; Germany for gold watches and
                    musical boxes; France for weaving machinery; Russia for mills; Italy for
                    miscellaneous machinery; France for asphalt; France for butter; France, Italy,
                    Germany, and the United States for cheese; Germany for silk; Germany for cattle;
                    France for sheep and goats. Cotton manufactures find their way to France, Italy,
                    Austria, Britain, Germany, Spain, India, &amp;c.; leather to the United States
                    and the Argentine Republic. The customs increased from 3,953,192 francs in 1850
                    to 21,342,403 in 1884.</p>
                <p>By article 27 of the federal constitution of 1874, primary instruction, while
                    left in the charge of the several cantons, is required to be sufficient,
                    obligatory, gratuitous, unsectarian, and under public control of the state. The
                    primary school age is up to twelve years, as far as this general law is
                    concerned, but in some cantons this is raised to fourteen, fifteen, or sixteen
                    years of age. The first school year also varies from five to seven in different
                    cantons. Great variety indeed exists in the whole school organization of the
                    several cantons; while the chief authority as regards the primary schools is in
                    some cases vested in an educational department or educational council, or both,
                    in others it is entrusted to an educational director with or without a council.
                    Considering the difficulties caused in many regions by a sparse population and a
                    rugged country, primary instruction is well carried out. Funds are provided by
                    the state, the commune, and often by the private individual. Even in remote
                    districts the school buildings are generally good. Bern has been especially
                    active in building new schools. In 1882 218,191 boys and 215,889 girls attended
                    the primary schools. Of these 311,271 had German as their mother tongue, 97,113
                    French, 19,864 Italian, and 5832 Romansch. The total number of male teachers was
                    5840, and of female teachers 2525; the average pay in money per male teacher was
                    1303 francs, for female teachers 822 francs. The primary school property was
                    valued at 137,534,597 francs (86,647,507 in 1871). The expense was 14,781,610
                    francs (8,708,174 in 1871). The communes contributed 8,349,697 francs and the
                    state 2,825,722. The expense per scholar was 34·1. For the school children who
                    are too poor to obtain proper food and clothing both public and private
                    assistance is freely rendered. Besides the ordinary public primary schools,
                    there are a considerable number of secondary schools (attended in 1882 by 11,155
                    boys and 8976 girls), preparatory (or intermediate) schools (9556, 2133), infant
                    schools (10,864, 11,242), schools for adults (12,758, 1110), and private schools
                    (6057, 4834). In 1882 there were in all 272,039 males and 244,896 females in
                    receipt of education. Among the preparatory schools are the “colleges” or
                    “gymnasiums” and the industrial schools, one of which exists in almost all the
                    cantonal capitals as well as at Winterthur, Burgdorf, Porrentruy, Einsiedeln,
                    Murten, and Brieg. In Grisons and Neuchâtel normal schools for the education of
                    teachers are attached to the cantonal schools. Separate establishments for this
                    purpose exist in the cantons of Zurich, Bern, Lucerne, Schwyz, Freiburg,
                    Soleure, St Gall, Aargau, Thurgau, Tessin, Vaud, and Valais. Among the more
                    specialized institutions of the preparatory or middle class are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Technitium</hi> at Winterthur, the veterinary colleges at Zurich
                    and Bern, the agricultural schools at Oberstrass and Rütli, and the school of
                    dentistry at Geneva. In the four universities of Basel, Bern, Zurich, and
                    Geneva, each with faculties of law, theology, medicine, and arts (philosophy),
                    the average number of matriculated students per session of six months was,
                    between 1876 (the first year of the Geneva university) and 1881, in theology
                    113, in law 188, in medicine 469, and in arts 288,—a total of 1058, to which
                    must be added 334 non-matriculated. Basel has a preponderance in theology, Bern
                    in law, Zurich in arts. The great federal polytechnicum at Zurich (opened in
                    1855) comprises schools of architecture, civil and industrial engineering,
                    industrial chemistry, forestry, and agriculture.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The total revenue of the Confederation, which was only 22,049,353 francs in 1869,
                    had increased to 44,308,000 on an average in 1879- 1883, and reached 48,392,000
                    in 1885; the expenditure, which was 21,744,459 at the first date, had
                    correspondingly increased to 43,312,510 in 1879-1883, and 46,278,685 in
                    1885.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland there is no standing army, but every male citizen between
                    twenty-four and forty-four years of age is bound to military service and drill.
                    The federal forces consist of the <hi rend="italic">Auszug, Élite,</hi> or
                    regular army (men from twenty to thirty-two years old), and the landwehr (men
                    thirty-two to forty-four years). The whole army was reorganized in 1874, when
                    extensive functions were assigned to the military physician in connexion with
                    the recruiting and calling out of the soldiers. In the ten years 1875-84 there
                    was one new recruit for 111 of the population (foreigners excepted); 49 per
                    cent. of the total were declared fit for service, 19 per cent. remanded, and 32
                    per cent. declared unfit. In the long run, about 61·1 per cent. of the young men
                    of the country passed the standard. In 1886 the regulars numbered 117,179 and
                    the landwehr 84,046.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Railway construction, which began in 1844, proceeded in earnest after the new
                    legislation of 1852, and by the close of 1862 718 miles had been constructed; by
                    1872 the ordinary lines reached a total of 1459 miles, with 5 miles of special
                    lines; for 1882 the corresponding figures were 2667 and 81. The annual railway
                    profits increased from 105,599,970 francs in 1870-74 to 179,151,112 in 1880-84.
                    Tramways began to be laid down in 1862, and rope railways in 1877. The railways
                    are mostly in the northern plateau and connect with the systems of Northern
                    Europe. The only Swiss line which crosses to the south of the Alps is the St
                    Gotthard (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Railways).</hi> The proposed Simplon railway
                    has already been carried up the Rhone valley as far as Brieg. The mountainous
                    character of the country and the special exigencies of. its traffic have
                    successfully stimulated to some striking efforts of. railway engineering. Thus
                    the Rigi railway rises from the Lake of Lucerne to a height of 5739 feet, with a
                    maximum gradient of 250 per thousand; that of the Rorschach-Heiden line is 50
                    per thousand.</p>
                <p>Switzerland is famous for its well-made and well-kept carriage-roads. Some of
                    those that traverse the mountain-passes have been constructed at great expense.
                    One of the most remarkable is the mule-path down an almost perpendicular rock
                    from the Gemmi Pass to Leukerbad, made in 1737-40.</p>
                <p>Bern has been the seat of the international Postal Union since 1874 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Post-Office,</hi> vol. xix. p. 584). The federalization of the
                    national post-office dates from 1848,—the different cantons having previously
                    conducted their postal business according to very different methods. It is to be
                    noted that this department charges itself with the conveyance of passengers as
                    well as mails,—these numbering 831,839 in 1880 and 754,365 in 1885. For other
                    details see the table given in vol. xix. p. 585.</p>
                <p>The length of telegraph lines increased from 1920 kilometres in 1852 to 6874 in
                    1884 (wires from 1920 to 16,618 kilometres), and the number of despatches from
                    2876 in 1852 to 1,127,311 in 1884, the total receipts for the latter year being
                    2,555,687 francs.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland there are thirty-three legalized banks of issue; their average
                    circulation of notes in 1885 was to the value of 123,431,000 francs. There are
                    325 savings banks proper (deposits 246,359,735 francs in 1882) and 162 other
                    institutions which receive deposits (267,298,548 francs in 1882). Most of these
                    are in the hands of companies or private merchants.</p>

                <p>The Swiss Confederation is made up of twenty-two small states, differing from
                    each other in nearly every point,— religious, political, social, industrial,
                    physical, and linguistic; yet it forms a nation the patriotism of whose members
                    is universally acknowledged. History alone can supply us with the key to this
                    puzzle; but Swiss history, while thus essential if we would thoroughly grasp the
                    nature of the Confederation, is very intricate and very local. A firm hold on a
                    few guiding principles is therefore most desirable, and of these there are three
                    which we must always bear in mind. (1) The first to be mentioned is <hi
                    rend="italic">the connexion of Swiss history with that of the empire.</hi> Swiss
                    history is largely the history of the drawing together of bits of each of the
                    imperial kingdoms (Germany, Italy, and Burgundy) for common defence against a
                    common foe—the Hapsburgs; and, when this family have secured to themselves the
                    permanent possession of the empire, the Swiss League little by little wins its
                    independence of the empire, practically in 1499, formally in 1648. Originally a
                    member of the empire, the Confederation becomes first an ally, then merely a
                    friend. (2) The second is <hi rend="italic">the German origin and nature of the
                    Confederation.</hi> Round a German nucleus (the three Forest districts) there
                    gradually gather other German districts; the Confederation is exclusively
                    German; and it is not till 1803 and 1815 that its French-and Italian-speaking
                    “subjects” are raised to political equality with their former masters, and that
                    the Romansch-speaking Leagues of Rhaetia (Graubünden) pass from the status of an
                    ally to that of a member of the Confederation. Even now, though by the
                    constitution three languages (German, French, and Italian) are recognized as
                    official, the overwhelming majority of the population of the Confederation is
                    German-speaking (2,030,792 out of 2,846,102 in 1880), and the capital was fixed
                    at Bern by a law of 1848, having previously shifted between various
                    German-speaking towns, while in olden days the diet always met in some
                    German-speaking place. (3) Swiss history is <hi rend="italic">a study in
                    federalism.</hi> Based on the defensive alliances of 1291 and 1315 made between
                    the three Forest districts, the Confederation is enlarged by the admission of
                    other districts and towns, all leagued with the original three members, but not
                    necessarily with each other. Hence great difficulties are encountered in looking
                    after common interests, in maintaining any real union; the diet was merely an
                    assembly of ambassadors with powers very strictly limited by their instructions,
                    and there was no central executive authority. The Confederation is a <hi
                    rend="italic">Staatenbund,</hi> or permanent alliance of several small states.
                    After the break-up of the old system in 1798 we see the idea of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Bundesstaat,</hi> or an organized state with a central
                    legislative, executive, and judiciary, work its way to the front, an idea which
                    is gradually realized in the constitutions of 1848 and 1874. The whole
                    constitutional history of the Confederation is summed up in this transition to a
                    federal state, which, while a single state in its relations with all foreign
                    powers, in home matters carefully maintains the more or less absolute
                    independence of its several members.</p>
                <p>Swiss history falls naturally into five great divisions: I. the origins of the
                    Confederation—up to 1291<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>For the legendary origin, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tell.</hi></p></note>;
                    II. the shaking off dependence on the Hapsburgs—up to 1394 (1474); III. the
                    shaking off dependence on the empire— up to 1499 (1648); IV. the period of
                    religious divisions and French influence—up to 1814; V. the construction of an
                    independent state as embodied in the constitutions of 1848 and 1874.</p>
                <p>I. On August 1, 1291, the men of the valley ©f Uri (“homines vallis Uranie ”),
                    the free community of the valley of Schwyz (“universitas vallis de Switz ”), and
                    the association of the men of the lower valley or Nidwald (“communitas hominum
                    intramontanorum vallis inferioris ”) formed an Everlasting League for the
                    purpose of self-defence against all who should attack or trouble them, a league
                    which is expressly stated to be a confirmation of a former one (“antiquam
                    confederationis formam juramento vallatam presentibus innovando”). This League
                    was the foundation of the Swiss Confederation.</p>
                <p>What were these districts? and why at this particular moment was it necessary for
                    them to form a defensive league? The legal and political conditions of all
                    differed, (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) In 853 Louis the German granted <hi
                    rend="italic">linter alia)</hi> all his lands (and the rights annexed to them)
                    situated in the “pagellus Uroniae” to the convent of Sts Felix and Regula in
                    Zurich (the present Fraumünster), of which his daughter Hildegard was the first
                    abbess, and gave to this district the privilege of exemption from all
                    jurisdiction save that of the king (<hi rend="italic">Reichsfreiheit).</hi> The
                    abbey thus became possessed of the greater part of the valley of the Reuss
                    between the present Devil’s Bridge and the Lake of Lucerne, for the upper valley
                    of Urseren belonged at that time to the abbey of Dissentis in the Rhine valley,
                    and did not become permanently allied with Uri till 1410. The privileged
                    position of the abbey tenants gradually led the other men of the valley to
                    “commend” themselves to the abbey, whether they were tenants of other lords, or
                    free men as in the Schächenthal. The meeting of all the inhabitants of the
                    valley, for purposes connected with the customary cultivation of the soil
                    according to fixed rules and methods, served to prepare them for the enjoyment
                    of full political liberty in later days. The important post of “protector”
                    (advocatus or vogt) of the abbey was given to one family after another by the
                    emperor as a sign of trust; but, when, on the extinction of the house of
                    Zäringen in 1218, the office was granted to the Hapsburgs, the protests of the
                    abbey tenants, who feared the rapidly rising power of that family, and perhaps
                    also the desire of the emperor to obtain command of the St Gotthard pass (of
                    which the first authentic mention occurs about 1236, when of course it could
                    only be traversed on foot), led to the recall of the grant in 1231, the valley
                    being thus restored to its original privileged position, and depending
                    immediately on the emperor. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In Schwyz we must
                    distinguish between the districts west and east of Steinen, In the former the
                    land was in the hands of many nobles, amongst whom were the Hapsburgs; in the
                    latter there was, at the foot of the Mythen, a free community of men governing
                    themselves, and cultivating their land in common; both, however, were
                    politically subject to the emperor’s delegates, the counts of the Zürichgau, who
                    after 1173 were the ever-advancing Hapsburgs. But in 1240 the free community of
                    Schwyz obtained from the emperor Frederick II. a charter which removed them from
                    the jurisdiction of the counts, placing them in immediate dependence on the
                    emperor, like the abbey men of Uri. In a few years, however, the Hapsburgs
                    contrived to dispense with this charter in practice. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                    In Unterwalden things were very different. The upper valley (Obwald or Sarnen,
                    so called because of its position with regard to the Kernwald) formed part of
                    the Aargau, the lower (Nidwald or Stanz) part of the Zürichgau, while in both
                    the soil was owned by many ecclesiastical and lay lords, among them being the
                    Hapsburgs and the Alsatian abbey of Murbach. Hence in this district there were
                    no privileged tenants, no free community, no centre of unity, and this explains
                    why Obwald and Nidwald won their way upward so much more slowly than their
                    neighbours in Uri and Schwyz. Thus the early history and legal position of these
                    three districts was very far from being the same.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0817-0782"/> In Uri the Hapsburgs, save for a brief space, had
                    absolutely no rights; while in Schwyz, Obwald, and Nidwald they were also, as
                    counts of the Zürichgau and of the Aargau, the representatives of the
                    emperor.</p>
                <p>The Hapsburgs had been steadily rising for many years from the position of an
                    unimportant family in the Aargau to that of a powerful clan of large landed
                    proprietors in Swabia and Alsace, and had attained a certain political
                    importance as counts of the Zürichgau and Aargau. In one or both qualities the
                    cadet or Lauffenburg line, to which the family estates in the Forest districts
                    round the Lake of Lucerne had fallen on the division of the inheritance in 1232,
                    seem to have exercised their legal rights in a harsh manner. In 1240 the free
                    men of Schwyz obtained protection from the emperor; in 1244 the Hapsburgs built
                    the castle of New Hapsburg on a promontory jutting out into the lake not far
                    from Lucerne, with the object of enforcing their real or pretended rights. It is
                    therefore not a matter for surprise that, when, after the excommunication and
                    deposition of Frederick If. by Innocent IV. at the council of Lyons in 1245, the
                    head of the cadet line of Hapsburg sided with the pope, the men of the Forest
                    districts should rally round the emperor. Schwyz joined Sarnen, Nidwald helped
                    Lucerne; the castle of New Hapsburg was reduced to its present ruined state; and
                    in 1248 the men of Schwyz, Sarnen, and Lucerne were threatened by the pope with
                    excommunication if they persisted in upholding the emperor and defying their
                    hereditary lords the counts of Hapsburg. The rapid decline of Frederick’s cause
                    soon enabled the Hapsburgs to regain their authority in these districts. Yet
                    these obscure risings have a double historical interest, for they are the
                    foundation in fact (so far as they have any) of the legendary stories of
                    Hapsburg oppression told of and by a later age, and these fleeting alliances are
                    doubtless what is represented by the “antiqua confederatio” of 1291, Schwyz
                    already taking the lead, while Uri, secure in its privileged position, contented
                    itself with giving a moral support to its neighbours. After this temporary check
                    the power of the Hapsburgs continued to increase rapidly. In 1273 the head of
                    the cadet line sold all his lands and rights in the Forest districts to the head
                    of the elder or Alsatian line, Rudolph, who a few months later was elected to
                    the imperial throne, in virtue of which he acquired for his family in 1282 the
                    duchy of Austria, which now for the first time became connected with the
                    Hapsburgs. Rudolph recognized the privileges of Uri but not those of Schwyz;
                    and, as he now united in his own person the characters of emperor, count of the
                    Zürichgau and of the Aargau, and landowner in the Forest districts (a name
                    occurring first in 1289), such a union of offices might be expected to result in
                    a confusion of rights. On April 16, 1291, Rudolph bought from the abbey of
                    Murbach in Alsace (of which he was “advocate ”) all its rights over the town of
                    Lucerne and the abbey estates in Unterwalden. It thus seemed probable that the
                    other Forest districts would be shut off from their natural means of
                    communication with the outer world by way of the lake. Rudolph’s death, on July
                    15 of the same year, cleared the way, and a fortnight later (August 1) the
                    Everlasting League was made between the men of Uri, Schwyz, and Nidwald (the
                    words “et vallis superioris,” <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., Obwald, were inserted
                    later on the original seal of Nidwald) for the purpose of self-defence against a
                    common foe. We do not know the names of the delegates of each valley who
                    concluded the treaty, nor the place where it was made, nor have we any account
                    of the deliberations of which it was the result. The common seal —that great
                    outward sign of the right of a corporate body to act in its own name without
                    needing to ask the permission of any external authority—appears first in Uri in
                    1243, in Schwyz in 1281, in Nidwald not till this very document of 1291; yet,
                    despite the great differences in their political status, they all joined in
                    concluding this League, and confirmed it by their separate seals, thereby laying
                    claim on behalf of their union to an independent existence. Besides promises of
                    aid and assistance in the case of attack, they agree to punish great criminals
                    by their own authority, but advise that, in minor cases and in all civil cases,
                    each man should recognize the “judex” to whom he owes suit, engaging that the
                    confederates will, in case of need, enforce the decisions of the “judex.” At the
                    same time they unanimously refuse to recognize any “judex” who has bought his
                    charge or is a stranger to the valleys. All disputes between the parties to the
                    treaty are, as far as possible, to be settled by a reference to arbiters, a
                    principle which remained in force for over six hundred years. “Judex” is a
                    general term for any local official, especially the chief of the community,
                    whether named by the lord or by the community; and, as earlier in the same year
                    Rudolph had promised the men of Schwyz not to force upon them a “judex”
                    belonging to the class of serfs, we may conjecture from this very decided
                    protest that the chief source of disagreement was in the matter of the
                    jurisdictions of the lord and the free community, and that some recent event in
                    Schwyz led it to insist on the insertion of this provision. It is stipulated
                    also that every man shall be bound to obey his own lord “convenienter,” or so
                    far as is fitting and right.</p>
                <p>II. In the struggle for the empire, which extended over the years following the
                    conclusion of the League of 1291, we find that the Confederates support without
                    exception the anti-Hapsburg candidate. On October 16, 1291, Uri and Schwyz ally
                    themselves with Zurich, and join the general rising in Swabia against Albert,
                    the new head of the house of Hapsburg. It soon failed, but hopes revived when in
                    1292 Adolf of Nassau was chosen emperor. In 1297 he confirmed to the free men of
                    Schwyz their charter of 1240, and, strangely enough, confirmed the same charter
                    to Uri, instead of their own of 1231. It is in his reign that we have the first
                    recorded meeting of the “landsgemeinde” (or assembly) of Schwyz (1294), that of
                    Uri being heard of as early as 1275. But in 1298 Albert of Hapsburg himself was
                    elected to the empire. His rule was strict and severe, though not oppressive. He
                    did not indeed confirm the charters of Uri or of Schwyz, but he did not attack
                    the ancient rights of the former, and in the latter he exercised his rights as a
                    landowner and did not abuse his political rights as emperor or as count. In
                    Unterwalden we find that in 1304 the two valleys were joined together under a
                    common administrator, a great step forwards to permanent union. The stories of
                    Albert’s tyrannical actions in the Forest districts are not heard of till two
                    centuries later, though no doubt the union of offices in his person was a
                    permanent source of alarm to the Confederation. It was in his time too that the
                    “terrier” (or list of manors and estates, with enumeration of all quit rents,
                    dues, &amp;c., payable by the tenants to their lords) of all the Hapsburg
                    possessions in Upper Germany was begun, and it was on the point of being
                    extended to Schwyz and Unterwalden when Albert was murdered (1308) and the
                    election of Henry of Luxemburg roused the free men to resist the officials
                    charged with the survey. Despite his promise to restore to the Hapsburgs all
                    rights enjoyed by them under his three predecessors (or maintain them in
                    possession), Henry confirmed, on June 3, 1309, to Uri and Schwyz their charters
                    of 1297, and, for some unknown reason, confirmed to Unterwalden all the
                    liberties granted by his predecessor, though as a matter of fact none had been
                    granted. This charter, and the nomination of one imperial bailiff to administer

                    differences) in an identical political position, and that the most privileged
                    yet given to any of them,—the freedom of the free community of Schwyz. A few
                    days later the Confederates made a fresh treaty of alliance with Zurich; and in
                    1310 the emperor placed certain other inhabitants of Schwyz on the same
                    privileged footing as the free community. The Hapsburgs were put off with
                    promises; and, though their request (1311) for an inquiry into their precise
                    rights in Alsace and in the Forest districts was granted, no steps were taken to
                    carry out this investigation. Thus in Henry’s time the struggle was between the
                    empire and the Hapsburgs as to the recognition of the rights of the latter, <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> between the Hapsburgs and those dependent on them as
                    landlords or counts.</p>
                <p>On Henry’s death in 1313 the electors hesitated long between Frederick the
                    Handsome of Hapsburg and Louis of Bavaria. The men of Schwyz seized this
                    opportunity for making a wanton attack on the great abbey of Einsiedeln, with
                    which they had a long-standing quarrel as to rights of pasture. The abbot caused
                    them to be excommunicated, and Frederick (the choice of the minority of the
                    electors), who was the hereditary “advocate” of the abbey, placed them under the
                    ban of the empire. Louis, to whom they appealed, removed the ban; on which
                    Frederick issued a decree by which he restored to his family all their rights
                    and possessions in <hi rend="italic">the three valleys</hi> and Urseren, and
                    charged his brother Leopold with the execution of this order. The Confederates
                    hastily concluded alliances with Glarus, Urseren, Art, and Interlaken to protect
                    themselves from attack on every side. Leopold collected a brilliant army at the
                    Austrian town of Zug in order to attack Schwyz, while a body of troops was to
                    take Unterwalden in the rear by way of the Brünig pass. On November 15, 1315,
                    Leopold, with from 15,000 to 20,000 men, moved forward along the shore of the
                    Lake of Egeri, intending to assail the village of Schwyz by climbing the steep
                    hillside above the southern end of the lake, through the narrow pass of
                    Morgarten between the mountain and the lake. At the summit of the pass waited
                    the valiant band of the Confederates, from 1300 to 1500 strong. The march up the
                    rugged and slippery slope threw the Austrian army into disarray, which became a
                    rout and mad flight when huge boulders and trunks of trees were hurled from
                    above by their foes, who charged down on them, and drove them into the lake. No
                    fewer than 1500 Austrians fell; their brilliant cavalry had completely failed
                    before the onset of the lightly armed Swiss footmen. Leopold fled in hot haste
                    to Winterthur, and the attack by the Brünig was driven back by the men of
                    Unterwalden. On December 9, 1315, representatives of the victorious highlanders
                    met at Brunnen, on the Lake of Lucerne, not far from Schwyz, and renewed the
                    Everlasting League of 1291. In their main lines the two documents are very
                    similar, the later being chiefly an expansion of the earlier. That of 1315 is in
                    German (in contrast to the 1291 League, which is in Latin), and has one or two
                    striking clauses largely indebted to a decree issued by Zurich on July 24, 1291.
                    None of the three districts or their dependents is to recognize a new lord
                    without the consent and counsel of the rest (this is probably meant to provide
                    for an interregnum in or disputed election to the empire, possibly for the
                    chance of the election of a Hapsburg); strict obedience in all lawful matters is
                    to be rendered to the rightful lord in each case, unless he attacks or wrongs
                    any of the Confederates, in which case they are to be free from all obligations;
                    no negotiations, so long as the “Länder” have no lord, are to be entered on with
                    outside powers, save by common agreement of all. Louis solemnly recog nized and
                    confirmed the new League in 1316, and in 1318 a truce was concluded between the
                    Confederates and the Hapsburgs, who treat with them on equal terms. The lands
                    and rights annexed belonging to the Hapsburgs in the Forest districts are fully
                    recognized as they existed in the days of Henry of Luxemburg, and freedom of
                    commerce is granted. But there is not one word about the <hi rend="italic"
                    >political</hi> rights of the Hapsburgs as counts of the Zürichgau and Aargau.
                    This distinction gives the key to the whole history of the relations between the
                    Confederates and Hapsburgs; the rights of the latter as landowners are fully
                    allowed, and till 1801 they possessed estates within the Confederation; it is
                    their political rights which are always contested by the Swiss, who desire to
                    rule themselves, free from the meddling of any external power.</p>
                <p>As early as 1320 we find the name “Swiss” (derived from Schwyz, which had always
                    been the leader in the struggle) applied to the Confederation as a whole, though
                    it was not till after Sempach (1386) that it came into popular use, and it did
                    not form the official name of the Confederation till 1803. This is in itself a
                    proof of the great renown which the League won by its victory at Morgarten.
                    Another is that as years go by we find other members admitted to the privileges
                    of the original alliance of the three Forest districts. First to join the League
                    (1332) was the neighbouring town of Lucerne, which had grown up round the
                    monastery of St Leodegar (whence the place took its name), perhaps a colony,
                    certainly a cell of the great house of Murbach in Alsace, under the rule of
                    which the town remained till its sale in 1291 to the Hapsburgs. This act of
                    Lucerne was opposed by the house of Austria, but, despite the decision of
                    certain chosen arbitrators in favour of the Hapsburg claims, the town clung to
                    the League with which it was connected by its natural position, and thus brought
                    a new element into the pastoral association of the Forest districts, which now
                    surrounded the entire Lake of Lucerne. Next, in 1351, came the ancient city of
                    Zurich, which in 1218, on the extinction of the house of Zäringen, had become a
                    free imperial city in which the abbess of the Fraumünster (the lady of Uri) had
                    great influence, though from 1240 the citizens elected the council which she had
                    previously named. In 1336 there had been a great civic revolution, headed by
                    Rudolph Brun, which had raised the members of the craft guilds to a position in
                    the municipal government of equal power with that of the patricians, who,
                    however, did not cease intriguing to regain their lost privileges, so that Brun,
                    after long hesitation, decided to throw in the lot of the city with the League
                    rather than with Austria. In this way the League now advanced from the hilly
                    country to the plains, though the terms of the treaty with Zurich did not bind
                    it so closely to the Confederates as in the other cases (the right of making
                    alliances apart from the League being reserved, though the League was to rank
                    before these), and hence rendered it possible for Zurich now and again to
                    incline towards Austria in a fashion which did great hurt to its allies. In 1352
                    the League was enlarged by the admission of Glarus and Zug. Glarus belonged to
                    the monastery of Säckingen on the Rhine (founded by the Irish monk Fridolin), of
                    which the Hapsburgs were “advocates,” claiming therefore many rights over the
                    valley, which refused to admit them, and joyfully received the Confederates who
                    came to its aid; but it was placed on a lower footing than the other members of
                    the League, being bound to obey their orders. Three weeks later the town and
                    district of Zug, attacked by the League and abandoned by their Hapsburg masters,
                    joined the Confederation, forming a transition link between the civic and rural
                    members of the League. The immediate occasion of the union of these two
                    districts was the war begun by the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0819-0784"/> Austrian duke against Zurich, which was ended by
                    the Brandenburg peace of 1352, by which Glarus and Zug were to. be restored to
                    the Hapsburgs, who also regained their rights over Lucerne; Zug was won for good
                    by a bold stroke of the men of Schwyz in 1364, but it was not till the day of
                    Näfels (1388) that Glarus recovered its lost freedom. These temporary losses and
                    the treaty made by Brun of Zurich with Austria in 1356 were, however, far
                    outweighed by the entrance into the League in 1353 of the famous town of Bern,
                    which, founded in 1191 by Berthold V. of Zäringen, and endowed with great
                    privileges, had become a free imperial city in 1218 on the extinction of the
                    Zäringen dynasty. Founded for the purpose of bridling the turbulent feudal
                    nobles around, many of whom had become citizens, Bern beat them back at Dornbühl
                    (1298), and made a treaty with the Forest districts as early as 1323. In 1339,
                    at the bloody fight of Laupen, she had broken the power of the nobles for ever,
                    and in 1352 had been forced by a treaty with Austria to take part in the war
                    against Zurich, but soon after the conclusion of peace entered the League as the
                    ally of the three Forest districts, being thus only indirectly joined to Lucerne
                    and Zurich. The special importance of the accession of Bern was that the League
                    now began to spread to the west, and was thus brought into connexion for the
                    first time with the French-speaking land of Savoy. The League thus numbered
                    eight members, the fruits of Morgarten, and no further members were admitted
                    till 1481, after the Burgundian war. But, in order to thoroughly understand the
                    nature of the League, it must be remembered that, while each of the five new
                    members was allied with the original nucleus,—the three Forest districts,—these
                    five were not directly allied to one another: Lucerne was allied with Zurich and
                    Zug; Zurich with Lucerne, Zug, and Glarus; Glarus with Zurich; Zug with Lucerne
                    and Zurich; Bern with no one except the three original members. The
                    circumstances under which each entered the League can alone explain the very
                    intricate relations at this time of its eight members.</p>
                <p>After a short interval of peace the quarrels with Austria broke out afresh; all
                    the members of the League, save the three Forest districts and Glarus, joined
                    the great union of the South German cities; but their attention was soon called
                    to events nearer home. Lucerne fretted much under the Austrian rule, received
                    many Austrian subjects among her citizens, and refused to pay custom duties to
                    the Austrian bailiff at Rothenburg, on the ground that she had the right of free
                    traffic. An attack on the custom-house at Rothenburg, and the gift of the
                    privileges of burghership to the discontented inhabitants of the little town of
                    Sempach a short way off, so irritated Leopold III. (who then held all the
                    possessions of his house outside Austria) that, unmindful of the defeat of his
                    uncle at Morgarten in 1315, he collected a great army, with the intention of
                    crushing his rebellious town. Lucerne meanwhile had summoned the other members
                    of the League to her aid, and, though Leopold’s feint of attacking Zurich caused
                    the troops of the League to march at first in that direction, they discovered
                    their mistake in time to turn back and check his advance on Lucerne. From 1500
                    to 1600 men of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, and Lucerne opposed the 6000 which made
                    up the Austrian army. The decisive fight took place on July 9, 1386, near
                    Sempach, on a bit of sloping meadow-land, cut up by streams and hedges, which
                    forced the Austrian knights to dismount. The great heat of the day, which
                    rendered it impossible to fight in armour, and the furious attacks of the
                    Confederates, finally broke the Austrian line after more than one repulse and
                    turned the day (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Winkelried).</hi> Leopold, with a large
                    number of his followers, was slain, and the Hapsburg power within the borders of
                    the Confederation finally broken. Glarus at once rose in arms against Austria,
                    but it was not till the expiration of the truce made after Sempach that
                    Leopold’s brother, Albert of Austria, brought an army against Glarus, and was
                    signally defeated at Näfels (not far from Glarus) on April 9, 1388, by a handful
                    of Glarus and Schwyz men, the troops of the other Confederates arriving too
                    late.</p>
                <p>In 1389 a peace for seven years was made, the Confederates being secured in all
                    their conquests; an attempt made in 1393 by Austria by means of Schöno, the
                    chief magistrate of Zurich and leader of the patrician party, to stir up a fresh
                    attack failed owing to a rising of the burghers, who sympathized with the
                    Confederates, and on July 16, 1394, the peace was prolonged for twenty years
                    (and again in 1412 for fifty years), various stipulations being made by which
                    the hundred years’ struggle of the League to throw off all political dependence
                    on the Hapsburgs was finally crowned with success. Glarus was freed on payment
                    of 200 pounds annually (in 1389-1395 it bought up all the rights of Säckingen);
                    Zug too was released from Austrian rule. Schwyz was given the town of Einsiedeln
                    (the “advocatia” of the great abbey following in 1397); Lucerne got the
                    Entlibuch, Sempach, and Rothenburg, the last-named being mortgaged only; Bern
                    and Solothurn were confirmed in their conquests. Above all, the Confederation as
                    a whole was relieved from the overlordship of the Hapsburgs, to whom, however,
                    all their rights and dues as landed proprietors were expressly reserved,—Bern,
                    Zurich, and Solothurn guaranteeing the maintenance of these rights and dues,
                    with power in case of need to call on the other Confederates to support them by
                    arms. Thus the distinction always made by the Confederates between the Hapsburgs
                    as rulers and as landowners was once more upheld; and, though that powerful
                    family entertained hopes of recovering its former rights, so that technically
                    the treaties of 1389, 1394, and 1412 were but truces, it finally and for ever
                    renounced all its feudal rights and privileges within the Confederation by the
                    “Everlasting Compact” of 1474.</p>
                <p>It is probable that Bern did not take any active share in the Sempach war because
                    she was bound by the treaty of peace made with the Austrians in 1368; and
                    Solothurn, allied with Bern, was doubtless a party to the treaty of 1394 (though
                    not yet in the League), because of its sufferings in 1382 at the hands of the
                    Kyburg line of the Hapsburgs, whose possessions (Thun, Burgdorf, &amp;c.) in
                    1384 fell into the hands of the two allies.</p>
                <p>We may mention here the foray (known as the English or Gugler war) made in
                    1374-75 by Enguerrand de Coucy (husband of Isabella, daughter of Edward III. of
                    England) and his freebooters (many of them Englishmen and Welshmen), called
                    “Gugler” from their pointed steel caps, with the object of obtaining possession
                    of certain towns in the Aargau (including Sempach), which he claimed as the
                    dowry of his mother Catherine, daughter of the Leopold who was defeated at
                    Morgarten. He was put to rout in the Entlibuch by the men of Bern, Freiburg,
                    Schwyz, and Unterwalden in December 1375. This victory, which gave rise to the
                    first great Swiss war song, was commemorated with great rejoicings as lately as
                    1875.</p>
                <p>III. The great victory at Sempach not merely vastly increased the fame of the
                    Everlasting League but also enabled it to extend both its influence and its
                    territory. The 15th century is the period when both the League and its several
                    members took the aggressive, and the expansion of their power and lands cannot
                    be better seen than by comparing the state of things at the beginning and at the
                    end of this century. The pastoral highlands of Appenzell (Abbatis Cella) and the
                    town of St Gall had<pb break="no"

                    backed by the duke of Austria. Schwyz had given them some help, and in 1411
                    Appenzell was placed under the protection of the League (save Bern), with which
                    in the next year the city of St Gall made a similar treaty to last ten years. So
                    too in 1416-17 several of the “tithings” of the Upper Wallis or Valais <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the upper stretch of the Rhone valley), which in 1388
                    had beaten the bishop and the nobles in a great fight at Visp, became closely
                    associated with Lucerne, Uri, and Unterwalden. It required aid in its final
                    struggle against the great house of Raron, the countbishop of Sitten (or Sion),
                    and the house of Savoy, which held Lower Wallis,—the Forest districts, on the
                    other hand, wishing to secure themselves against Raron and Savoy in their
                    attempt to permanently conquer the Val d’Ossola on the south side of the Simplon
                    pass. Bern, however, supported its burgher, the lord of Raron; but, by a peace
                    made in 1420, the powers of the bishop and the lord of Raron were greatly
                    diminished; the latter house soon after sold all its lands and rights, and
                    migrated to the district of Toggenburg. Such were the first links which bound
                    these lands with the League; but they did not become full members for a long
                    time—Appenzell in 1513, St Gall in 1803, Wallis in 1815.</p>
                <p>Space will not allow us to enumerate all the small conquests made in the first
                    half of the 15th century by every member of the League; suffice it to say that
                    each increased and rounded off its territory, but did not give the conquered
                    lands any political rights, governing them as “subject lands,” often very
                    harshly. The same phenomenon of lands which had won their own freedom playing
                    the part of tyrant over other lands which joined them more or less by their
                    voluntary action is seen on a larger scale in the case of the conquest of the
                    Aargau, and in the first attempts to secure a footing south of the Alps.</p>
                <p>In 1412 the treaty of 1394 between the League and the Hapsburgs had been renewed
                    for fifty years; but when in 1415 Duke Frederick of Austria helped Pope John
                    XXII. to escape from Constance, where the great council was then sitting, and
                    the emperor Sigismund placed the duke under the ban of the empire, summoning all
                    members of the empire to arm against him, the League hesitated, because of their
                    treaty of 1412, till the emperor declared that all the rights and lands of
                    Austria in the League were forfeited, and that their compact did not release
                    them from their obligations to the empire. In the name, therefore, of the
                    emperor, and by his special command, the different members of the League overran
                    the extensive Hapsburg possessions in the Aargau. The chief share fell to Bern,
                    but certain districts (known as the <hi rend="italic">Freie Aemter)</hi> were
                    joined together and governed as bailiwicks held in common by all the members of
                    the League (save Uri, busied in the south, and Bern, who had already secured the
                    lion’s share of the spoil for herself). This is the first case in which the
                    League as a whole took up the position of rulers over districts which, though
                    guaranteed in the enjoyment of their old rights, were nevertheless politically
                    unfree. As an encouragement and a reward, Sigismund had granted in advance to
                    the League the right of criminal jurisdiction (“haute justice” or “Blutbann ”),
                    which points to the fact that they were soon to become independent of the
                    empire, as they were of Austria. But all through the 15th century it must be
                    carefully borne in mind that the members of the League were constantly
                    recognized as and acknowledged themselves to be members of the empire.</p>
                <p>As the natural policy of Bern was to seek to enlarge its borders at the expense
                    of Austria, and later of Savoy, so we find that Uri, shut off by physical causes
                    from extension in other directions, as steadily turned its eyes towards the
                    south. In 1410 the valley of Urseren was finally joined to Uri; though
                    communications were difficult, and carried on only by means of the “stiebende
                    Brücke,” a wooden bridge suspended by chains over the Reuss, along the side of a
                    great rocky buttress (pierced in 1707 by the tunnel known as the Urnerloch), yet
                    this enlargement of the territory of Uri gave it complete command over the St
                    Gotthard pass, long commercially important, and now to serve for purposes of war
                    and conquest. Already in 1403 Uri and Obwald had taken advantage of a quarrel
                    with the duke of Milan as to custom dues at the market of Varese to occupy the
                    long narrow valley on the south of the pass called the Val Leventina; in 1410
                    the men of the same two lands, exasperated by the insults of the local lords,
                    called on the other members of the League, and all jointly (except Bern)
                    occupied the Val d’Ossola, on the south side of the Simplon pass. But in 1414
                    they lost this to Savoy, and, with the object of getting it back, obtained in
                    1416-17 the alliance of the men of Upper Wallis, then fighting for freedom, and
                    thus regained the valley, despite the exertions of the great Milanese general
                    Carmagnola. In 1419 Uri and Obwald bought from its lord the town and district of
                    Bellinzona. This rapid advance, however, did not approve itself to the duke of
                    Milan, and Carmagnola reoccupied both valleys; the Confederates were not at one
                    with regard to these southern conquests; a small body pressed on in front of the
                    rest, but was cut to pieces at Arbedo near Bellinzona in 1422. A bold attempt in
                    1425 by a Schwyzer, Peter Rissi by name, to recover the Val d’Ossola caused the
                    Confederates to send a force to rescue these adventurers; but the duke of Milan
                    intrigued with the divided Confederates, and finally in 1426, by a payment of a
                    large sum of money and the grant of certain commercial privileges, the Val
                    Leventina, the Val d’Ossola, and Bellinzona were restored to him. Thus the first
                    attempt of Uri to acquire a footing south of the Alps had failed, but the wish
                    to recover its lost conquests still continued, and a later attempt was more
                    successful, leading to the inclusion in the Confederation of what has been
                    called “Italian Switzerland.”</p>
                <p>The original contrasts between the social condition of the different members of
                    the League became more marked when the period of conquest began, and led to
                    quarrels and ill-feeling in the matter of the Aargau and the Italian conquests
                    which a few years later ripened into a civil war, brought about by the dispute
                    as to the succession to the lands of Frederick, count of Toggenburg, the last
                    male representative of his house. Count Frederick’s predecessors had greatly
                    extended their domains, so that they took in not only the Toggenburg or upper
                    valley of the Thur, but Uznach, Sargans, the Rhine valley between Feldkirch and
                    Sargans, the Prättigau, and the Davos valley. He himself, the last great feudal
                    lord on the left bank of the Rhine, had managed to secure his vast possessions
                    by making treaties with several members of the League, particularly Zurich
                    (1402) and Schwyz (1417),— from 1428 inclining more and more to Schwyz (then
                    ruled by Ital Reding), being disgusted with the arrogant behaviour of Stüssi,
                    the burgomaster of Zurich. His<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0821-0786"/> death (April 30, 1436) was the signal for the
                    breaking out of strife. The Prättigau and Davos valley formed the League of the
                    Ten Jurisdictions in Rhaetia (see below), while Frederick’s widow sided with
                    Zurich against Schwyz for different portions of the great inheritance which had
                    been promised them. After being twice defeated, Zurich was forced in 1440 to buy
                    peace by certain cessions (the Upper March) to Schwyz, the general feeling of
                    the Confederates being opposed to Zurich, several of them going so far as to
                    send men and arms to Schwyz. Zurich, however, was bitterly disappointed at these
                    defeats, and had recourse to that policy which she had adopted in 1356 and
                    1393—an alliance with Austria (concluded in 1442), which now held the imperial
                    throne in the person of Frederick III. Though technically within her rights
                    according to the terms on which she had joined the League in 1351, this act of
                    Zurich caused the greatest irritation in the Confederation, and civil war at
                    once broke out, especially when the Hapsburg emperor had been solemnly received
                    and acknowledged in Zurich. In 1443 the Zurich troops were completely defeated
                    at St Jakob on the Sihl, close under the walls of the city, Stüssi himself being
                    slain. Next year the city itself was long besieged. Frederick, unable to get
                    help elsewhere, procured from Charles VII. of France the despatch of a body of
                    Armagnac free lances (the Écorcheurs), who came, 30,000 strong, under the
                    dauphin Louis, plundering and harrying the land, till, at the very gates of the
                    free imperial city of Basel (which had made a twenty years’ alliance with Bern),
                    by the leper house of St Jakob on the Birs (August 26, 1444), the desperate
                    resistance of a small body of Confederates (1200 to 1500) till cut to pieces,
                    checked the advance of the freebooters, who sustained such tremendous losses
                    that, though the victors, they hastily made peace, and returned whence they had
                    come. Several small engagements ensued, Zurich long declining to make peace
                    because the Confederates required, as the result of a solemn arbitration, the
                    abandonment of the Austrian alliance. At length it was concluded in 1450, the
                    Confederates restoring almost all the lands they had won from Zurich. Thus ended
                    the third attempt of Austria to conquer the League By means of Zurich, which
                    used its position as an imperial free city greatly to the harm of the League,
                    and was the cause of the first civil war which distracted the League.</p>
                <p>These fresh proofs of the valour of the Confederates, and of the growing
                    importance of the League, did not fail to produce important results. In 1452 the
                    “Confederates of the Old League of Upper Germany” (as they styled themselves)
                    made their first treaty of alliance with France, a connexion which was destined
                    to exercise so much influence on their history. Round the League there began to
                    gather a new class of allies (known as “Zugewandte Orte,” or associated
                    districts), more closely joined to it, or to certain members of it, than by a
                    mere treaty of friendship, yet not being admitted to the rank of a full member
                    of the League. Of these associates three, the abbot (1451) and town of St Gall
                    (1454), and the town of Bienne (Biel), through its alliance (1352) with Bern,
                    were given seats and votes in the diet, being called “socii”; while others,
                    known as “confcederati,” were not so closely bound to the League, such as Wallis
                    (1416-17), Schaffhausen (1454), Mühlhausen (1466), Rothweil (1463).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To the class of
                    “confcederati” belonged in later times Neuchâtel (1495-98), the Leagues of
                    Rhaetia (1497-98), Geneva (1519-36), and the bishop of Basel (1579).</p></note>
                    Appenzell, too, in 1452, rose from the rank of a “protected district” into the
                    class of associates, outside which were certain places “protected” by several
                    members of the League, such as Gersau (1359), the abbeys of Engelberg (c. 1421)
                    and Einsiedeln (1397-1434), and the town of</p>
                <p>Rapperschwyl (1458). The relation of the “associates” to the League may be
                    compared with the ancient practice of “commendation”: they were bound to obey
                    orders in the matter of declaring war, making alliances, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In 1439 Sigismund succeeded his father Frederick in the Hapsburg lands in Alsace,
                    the Thurgau, and Tyrol, and, being much irritated by the constant encroachments
                    of the Confederates, in particular by the loss of Rapperschwyl (1458), declared
                    war against them, but fared very badly. In 1460 the Confederates overran the
                    Thurgau, and occupied Sargans. Winterthur was only saved by an heroic defence.
                    Hence in 1461 Sigismund had to give up his claims on those lands and renew the
                    peace for fifteen years, while in 1467 he sold Winterthur to Zurich. Thus the
                    whole line of the Rhine was lost to the Hapsburgs, who retained (till 1802) in
                    the territories of the Confederates the Frickthal only. The Thurgovian
                    bailiwicks were governed in common as “subject” lands by all the Confederates
                    except Bern. The touchiness of the now rapidly advancing League was shown by the
                    eagerness with which in 1468 its members took up arms against certain small
                    feudal nobles who were carrying on a harassing guerilla warfare with their
                    allies Schaffhausen and Mühlhausen. They laid siege to Waldshut, and to buy them
                    off Sigismund in August 1468 engaged to pay 10,000 gulden as damages by June 24,
                    1469; in default of payment the Confederates were to keep for ever the Black
                    Forest, Waldshut, and certain other Black Forest, towns on the Rhine. A short
                    time before (1467) the League had made treaties of friendship with Philip the
                    Good, duke of Burgundy, and with the duke of Milan. All was now prepared for the
                    intricate series of intrigues which led up to the Burgundian War,—a great epoch
                    in the history of the League, as it created a common national feeling,
                    enormously raised its military reputation, and brought about the close connexion
                    with certain parts of Savoy which finally (1803-15) were admitted into the
                    League.</p>
                <p>Sigismund did not know where to obtain the sum he had promised to pay. In this
                    strait he turned to Charles the Bold (properly the Rash), duke of Burgundy, who
                    was then beginning his wonderful career, and aiming at restoring the kingdom of
                    Burgundy. For this purpose Charles wished to marry his daughter and heiress to
                    Maximilian, son of the emperor, and first cousin of Sigismund, in order that the
                    emperor might be induced to give him the Burgundian crown. Hence he was ready to
                    meet Sigismund’s advances. On May 9, 1469, Charles promised to give Sigismund
                    50,000 florins, receiving as security for repayment Alsace, the Breisgau, the
                    Sundgau, the Black Forest, and the four Forest towns on the Rhine (Rheinfelden,
                    Säckingen, Lauffenburg, and Waldshut); in addition, Charles took Sigismund under
                    his protection, specially against the Swiss, and agreed to give him aid in a war
                    if he was attacked by them. It was not unnatural for Sigismund to think of
                    attacking the League, but Charles’s engagement to him is quite inconsistent with
                    the friendly agreement made between Burgundy and the League as late as 1467. The
                    emperor then on his side annulled Sigismund’s treaty of 1468 with the Swiss, and
                    placed them under the ban of the empire. Charles committed the mortgaged lands
                    to Peter von Hagenbach, who proceeded to try to establish his master’s power
                    there by such harsh and severe measures as to cause all the people to murmur,
                    then rise against him.</p>
                <p>The Swiss in these circumstances began to look towards Louis XI. of France, who
                    had confirmed the treaty of friendship made with them by his father in 1452.
                    Sigismund had applied to him early in 1469 to help him in his many troubles, and
                    to give him aid against the Swiss, but Louis had point-blank refused. Anxious to

                    he made a treaty with them on August 13, 1470, to this effect. All the evidence
                    goes to show that Sigismund was not a tool in the hands of Louis, and that
                    Louis, at least at that time, had no definite intention of involving Charles and
                    the Swiss in a war, but wished only to secure his own flank.</p>
                <p>Sigismund in the next few years tried hard to get from Charles the promised aid
                    against the Swiss (the money was paid punctually enough by Charles on his
                    behalf), who put him off with various excuses. Charles on his side, in 1471-72,
                    tried to make an alliance with the Swiss, his efforts being supported by a party
                    in Bern headed by Adrian von Bubenberg. Probably Charles wished to use both
                    Sigismund and the Swiss to further his own interests, but his shifty policy had
                    the effect of alienating both from him. Sigismund, disgusted with Charles, now
                    inclined towards Louis, whose ally he formally became in the summer of 1473,—a
                    change which was the real cause of the emperor’s flight from Treves in November
                    1473, when he had come there expressly to crown Charles. The Confederates on
                    their side were greatly moved by the oppression of their friends and allies in
                    Alsace by Hagenbach, and tried in vain (January 1474) to obtain some redress
                    from his master. Charles’s too astute policy had thus lost him both Sigismund
                    and the Swiss. They now looked upon Louis, who, thoroughly aware of Charles’s
                    ambition, and fearing that his disappointment at Treves would soon lead to open
                    war, aimed at a master stroke—no less than the reconciliation of Sigismund and
                    the Swiss. This on the face of it seemed impracticable, but common need and
                    Louis’s dexterous management brought it to pass, so that on March 30, 1474, the
                    Everlasting Compact was signed at Constance, by which Sigismund finally
                    renounced all Austrian claims on the lands of the Confederates, and guaranteed
                    them in quiet enjoyment of them; they, on the other hand, agreed to support him
                    if Charles did not give up the mortgaged lands when the money was paid down. The
                    next day the Swiss joined the league of the Alsatian and Rhine cities, as also
                    did Sigismund. Charles was called on to receive the money contributed by the
                    Alsatian cities, and to restore his lands to Sigismund. He, however, took no
                    steps. Within a week the oppressive bailiff Hagenbach was captured, and a month
                    later (May 9, 1474) he was put to death, Bern alone of the Confederates being
                    represented. On October 9 the emperor, acting of course at the instance of
                    Sigismund, ordered them to declare war against Charles, which took place on
                    October 25, Bern acting in the name of the Confederates, and alleging that they
                    made war solely by order of the emperor and not as principals. Next day Louis
                    formally ratified his alliance with the Confederates, promising money and
                    pensions, the latter to be increased if he did not send men. Throughout these
                    negotiations and later, Bern directs Swiss policy, though all the Confederates
                    are not quite agreed. She was specially exposed to attack from Charles and
                    Charles’s ally (since 1468) Savoy, and her best chance of extending her
                    territory lay towards the west and south. A forward policy was thus distinctly
                    the best for Bern, and this was the line supported by the French party under
                    Nicholas von Diesbach, Von Bubenberg opposing it, though not with any idea of
                    handing over Bern to Charles. The Forest districts, however, were very
                    suspicious of this movement to the west, by which Bern alone could profit,
                    though the League as a whole might lose; then, too, Uri had in 1440 finally won
                    the Val Leventina, and she and her neighbours favoured a southerly policy—a
                    policy which was crowned with success after the gallant victory won at Giornico
                    in 1478 by a handful of men from Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, and Schwyz over 12,000
                    Milanese troops, though the main body of the Confederates was already on its way
                    home. Thus Uri gained for the first time a permanent footing south of the Alps,
                    not long before Bern had won its first conquests from Savoy.</p>
                <p>The war in the west was begun by Bern and her allies (Freiburg, Solothurn,
                    &amp;c.) by marauding expeditions across the Jura, in which Héricourt (November
                    1474) and Bla-mont (August 1475) were taken, both towns being held of Charles by
                    the “sires” de Neuchâtel, a cadet line of the counts of Montbéliard. It is said
                    that in the former expedition the white cross was borne (for the first time) as
                    the ensign of the Confederates, but not in the other. Meanwhile Yolande, the
                    duchess of Savoy, had, through fear of her brother Louis XI. and hatred of Bern,
                    finally joined Charles and Milan (January 1475), the immediate result of which
                    was the capture, by the Bernese and friends (on the way back from a foray on
                    Pontarlier in the Free County of Burgundy or Franche Comté) of several places in
                    Vaud, notably Granson and Échallens, both held of Savoy by a member of the house
                    of Challon, princes of Orange (April 1475), as well as Orbe and Jougne, held by
                    the same, but under Burgundy. In the summer Bern seized on the Savoyard district
                    of Aigle. Soon after (October-November 1475) the same energetic policy won for
                    her the Savoyard towns of Morat, Avenches, Estavayer, and Yverdun; while
                    (September) the Upper Wallis, which had conquered all Lower or Savoyard Wallis,
                    entered into alliance with Bern for the purpose of opposing Savoy by preventing
                    the arrival of Milanese troops. Alarmed at their success, the emperor and Louis
                    deserted (June-September) the Confederates, who thus, by the influence of Louis
                    and Bernese ambition, saw themselves led on and then abandoned to the wrath of
                    Charles, and very likely to lose their new conquests. They had entered on the
                    war as “helpers” of the emperors, and now became principals in the war against
                    Charles, who raised the siege of Neuss, made an alliance with Edward IV. of
                    England, received the surrender of Lorraine, and hastened across the Jura
                    (February 1476) to the aid of his ally Yolande. On February 21 Charles laid
                    siege to Granson, and after a week’s siege the garrison of Bernese and
                    Freiburgers had to surrender, and, by way of retaliation for the massacre of the
                    garrison of Estavayer in 1475, of the 412 men two only were spared in order to
                    act as executioners of their comrades. This hideous news met a large body of the
                    Confederates gathered together in great haste to relieve the garrison, and going
                    to their rendezvous at Neuchâtel, where both the count and town had become
                    allies of Bern in 1406. An advance body of Bernese, Freiburgers, and Schwyzers,
                    in order to avoid the castle of Vauxmarcus (seized by Charles), by the Lake of
                    Neuchâtel, on the direct road from Neuchâtel to Granson, climbed over a wooded
                    spur to the north, and attacked (March 2) the Burgundian outposts. Charles drew
                    back his force in order to bring down the Swiss to the more level ground where
                    his cavalry could act, but his rear misinterpreted the order, and when the main
                    Swiss force appeared over the spur the Burgundian army was seized with a panic
                    and fled in disorder. The Swiss had gained a glorious victory, and regained
                    their conquest of Granson, besides capturing very rich spoil in Charles’s camp,
                    parts of which are preserved to the present day in various Swiss armouries. Such
                    was the famous battle of Granson. Charles at once retired to Lausanne, and set
                    about reorganizing his army. He resolved to advance on Bern by way of Morat (or
                    Murten), which was occupied by a Bernese garrison under Von Bubenberg, and laid
                    siege to it on June 9. The Confederates had now put away all jealousy of Bern,
                    and collected a large army. The decisive battle took place on the afternoon of
                    June<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n823/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0823-0788"/> 22, after the arrival of the Zurich contingent
                    under Hans Waldmann. English archers were in Charles’s army, while with the
                    Swiss was René, the dispossessed duke of Lorraine. After facing each other many
                    hours in the driving rain, a body of Swiss, by outflanking Charles’s van,
                    stormed his palisaded camp, and the Burgundians were soon hopelessly beaten, the
                    losses on both sides (a contrast to Granson) being exceedingly heavy. Vaud was
                    reoccupied by the Swiss, Savoy having overrun it on Charles’s advance; but Louis
                    now stepped in and procured the restoration of Vaud to Savoy, save Granson,
                    Morat, Orbe, and Échallens, which were to be held by the Bernese jointly with
                    the Freiburgers, Aigle by Bern alone,—Savoy at the same time renouncing all its
                    claims over Freiburg. Thus French-speaking districts first became permanently
                    connected with the Confederation, hitherto purely German, and the war had been
                    one for the maintenance of recent conquests, rather than a purely defensive one
                    against an encroaching neighbour desirous of crushing Swiss freedom. Charles
                    tried in vain to raise a third army; René recovered Lorraine, and on January 5,
                    1477, under the walls of Nancy, Charles’s wide-reaching plans were ended by his
                    defeat and death, many Swiss being with René’s troops. The wish of the Bernese
                    to Overrun Franche Comté was opposed by the older members of the Confederation,
                    and finally, in 1479, Louis, by very large payments, secured the abandonment of
                    all claims on that province, which was annexed to the French crown.</p>
                <p>These glorious victories really laid the foundation of Swiss nationality; but
                    soon after them the long-standing jealousy between the civic and rural elements
                    in the Confederation nearly broke it up. This had always hindered common action
                    save in case of certain pressing questions. In 1370, by the “Parsons’ ordinance”
                    (Pfaffenbrief), agreed on by all the Confederates except Bern and Glarus, all
                    residents, whether clerics or laymen, in the Confederation who were bound by
                    oath to the duke of Austria were to swear faith to the Confederation, and this
                    oath was to rank before any other; no appeal was to lie to any court spiritual
                    or lay (except in matrimonial and purely spiritual questions) outside the limits
                    of the Confederation, and many regulations were laid down as to the suppression
                    of private wars and keeping of the peace on the high roads. Further, in 1393,
                    the “Sempach ordinance” was accepted by all the Confederates and Solothurn; this
                    was an attempt to enforce police regulations and to lay down “articles of war”
                    for the organization and discipline of the army of the Confederates, minute
                    regulations being made against plundering, —women, monasteries, and churches
                    being in particular protected and secured. But save these two documents common
                    action was limited to the meeting of two envoys from each member of the
                    Confederation and one from each of the “socii” in the diet, the powers of which
                    were greatly limited by the instructions brought by each envoy, thus entailing
                    frequent reference to his Government, and included foreign relations, war and
                    peace, and common arrangements as to police, pestilence, customs duties,
                    coinage, &amp;c. The decisions of the majority did not bind the minority save in
                    the case of the affairs of the bailiwicks ruled in common. Thus everything
                    depended on common agreement and goodwill. But disputes as to the division of
                    the lands conquered in the Burgundian war, and the proposal to admit into the
                    League the towns of Freiburg and Solothurn, which had rendered such good help in
                    the war, caused the two parties to form separate unions, for by the latter
                    proposal the number of towns would have been made the same as that of the
                    “Länder,” which these did not at all approve. Suspended a moment by the campaign
                    in the Val Leventina, these quarrels broke out after the victory of Giornico;
                    and at the diet of Stanz (December 1481), when it seemed probable that the
                    failure of all attempts to come to an understanding would result in the
                    disruption of the League, the mediation of Nicholas von der Flüe (or Bruder
                    Klaus), a holy hermit of Sachseln in Obwald, though he did not appear at the
                    diet in person, succeeded in bringing both sides to reason, and the third great
                    ordinance of the League—the “compact of Stanz ”—was agreed on. By this the
                    promise of mutual aid and assistance was renewed, especially when one member
                    attacked another, and stress was laid on the duty of the several Governments to
                    maintain the peace, and not to help the subjects of any other member in case of
                    a rising. The treasure and movables captured in the war were to be equally
                    divided amongst the combatants, the territories and towns amongst the members of
                    the League. As a practical proof of the reconciliation, on the same day the
                    towns of Freiburg and Solothurn were received as full members of the
                    Confederation, united with all the other members, though on less favourable
                    terms than usual, for they were forbidden to make alliances, save with the
                    consent of all or of the greater part of the other members. Both towns had long
                    been allied with Bern, whose influence was greatly increased by their admission.
                    Freiburg, founded in 1178 by Berthold IV. of Zäringen, had on the extinction of
                    that great dynasty (1218) become a free imperial city, but had bowed
                    successively to Kyburg (1249), Austria, the sons of Rudolph (1277), and Savoy
                    (1452); when Savoy gave up its claims in 1477 Freiburg once more became a free
                    imperial city. She had become allied with Bern as early as 1243. The ancient
                    Roman city of Solothurn (or Soleure) had been associated with Bern from 1351,
                    but had in vain sought admission into the League in 1411. Both the new members
                    had done much for Bern in the Burgundian war, and it was for their good service
                    that she now procured them this splendid reward, in hopes perhaps of aid on
                    other important and critical occasions.</p>
                <p>The compact of Stanz strengthened the bonds which joined the members of the
                    Confederation; and the same centralizing tendency is wall seen in the attempt
                    (1483- 89) of Hans Waldmann, the burgomaster of Zurich, to assert the rule of
                    his city over the neighbouring country districts, to place all power in the
                    hands of the guilds (whereas by Bran’s constitution the patricians had an equal
                    share), to suppress all minor jurisdictions, and to raise a uniform tax. But
                    this idea of concentrating all powers in the hands of the Government aroused
                    great resistance, and led to his overthrow and execution. Peter Kistler
                    succeeded (1470) better at Bern in a reform on the same lines, but not of such a
                    sweeping character.</p>
                <p>The early history of each member of the Confederation, and of the Confederation
                    itself, shows that they always professed to belong to the empire, trying to
                    become immediately dependent on the emperor in order to. prevent the oppression
                    of middle lords, and to enjoy practical liberty. The empire itself had now
                    become very much of a shadow; cities and princes were gradually asserting their
                    own independence, sometimes breaking away from it altogether. Now, by the time
                    of the Burgundian war the Confederation stood in a position analogous to that of
                    a powerful free imperial city. As long as the emperor’s nominal rights ware not
                    enforced, all went well; but, when Maximilian, in his attempt to reorganize the
                    empire, erected in 1495 at Worms an imperial chamber which had jurisdiction in
                    all disputes between members of the empire, the Confederates were very unwilling
                    to obey it, partly because they could maintain peace at home by their own
                    authority, and partly because it interfered with their practical independence.

                    cities of South Germany to keep the public peace, gave further offence, as well
                    as their fresh alliances with France. Hence a struggle was inevitable, and the
                    occasion by reason of which it broke out was the seizure by the Tyrolese
                    authorities in 1499 of the Münsterthal, which belonged to the “Gotteshausbund,”
                    one of the three leagues which had gradually arisen in Rhaetia. These were the
                    “Gotteshausbund” in 1367 (taking in all the dependents of the cathedral church
                    at Chur living in the Oberhalbstein and Engadine), the “Oberer or Grauer Bund”
                    in 1395 and 1424 (taking in the abbey of Dissentis and many counts and lords in
                    the Vorder Rhein valley, though its name is not derived, as often stated, from
                    the “grey coats” of the first members, but from “grawen” or “grafen,” as so many
                    counts formed part of it), and the “League of the Ten Jurisdictions”
                    (Zehngerichtenbund), which arose in the Prättigau and Davos valley (1436) on the
                    death of Count Frederick of Toggenburg, but which, owing to certain Austrian
                    claims in it, was not quite so free as its neighbours. The first and third of
                    these became allied in 1450, but the formal union of the three dates only from
                    1524, as documentary proof is wanting of the alleged meeting at Vazerol in 1471,
                    though practically before 1524 they had very much in common. In 1497 the Oberer
                    Bund, in 1498 the Gotteshausbund, made a treaty of alliance with the Everlasting
                    League or Swiss Confederation, the Ten Jurisdictions being unable to do more
                    than show sympathy, owing to Austrian influence, which was not bought up till
                    1649-52. Hence this attack on the Münsterthal was an attack on an “associate”
                    member of the Swiss Confederation, Maximilian being supported by the Swabian
                    League; but its real historical importance is the influence it had on the
                    relations of the Swiss to the empire. The struggle lasted several months, the
                    chief fight being that “an der Calven” or “auf der Malserheide” (May 22, 1499),
                    in which Benedict Fontana, a leader of the Gotteshausbund men, performed many
                    heroic deeds before his death. But, both sides being exhausted, peace was made
                    at Basel on September 22, 1499. By this the matters in dispute were referred to
                    arbitration, and the emperor annulled all the decisions of the imperial chamber
                    against the Confederation; but nothing was laid down as to its future relations
                    with the empire. No further real attempt, however, was made to enforce the
                    rights of the emperor, and the Confederation became a state allied with the
                    empire, enjoying practical independence, though not formally freed till 1648.
                    Thus, 208 years after the origin of the Confederation, it had got rid of all
                    Austrian claims (1394 and (1474), as well as all practical subjection to the
                    emperor. But its further advance towards the position of an independent state
                    was long checked by religious divisions within, and by the enormous influence of
                    the French king on its foreign relations.</p>
                <p>With the object of strengthening the northern border of the Confederation, two
                    more full members were admitted in 1501—Basel and Schaffhausen—on the same terms
                    as Freiburg and Solothurn. The city of Basel had originally been ruled by its
                    bishop, but in the 14th century it became a free imperial city; before 1501 it
                    had made no permanent alliance with the Confederation, though in continual
                    relations with it. Schaffhausen had grown up round the Benedictine monastery of
                    All Saints, and became in the 13th century a free imperial city, but was pledged
                    to Austria from 1330 to 1415, in which last year the emperor Sigismund declared
                    all Duke Frederick’s rights forfeited in consequence of his abetting the flight
                    of Pope John XXII. It had become an “associate” of the Confederation in
                    1454.</p>
                <p>A few years later, in 1513, Appenzell, which in 1411 had become a “protected”
                    district, and in 1452 an “associate” member of the Confederation, was admitted
                    as the thirteenth full member; and this remained the number till the fall of the
                    old Confederation in 1798. Round the three original members had gathered first
                    five others, united with the three, but not necessarily with each other; and
                    then gradually there grew up an outer circle, consisting of five more, allied
                    with all the eight old members, but tied down by certain stringent conditions.
                    Constance, which seemed called by nature to enter the League, kept aloof, owing
                    to a quarrel as to the criminal jurisdiction in the Thurgau, which had been
                    pledged to it before the district was conquered by the Confederates. Neuchâtel
                    in 1495-98 became permanently allied with several members of the
                    Confederation.</p>
                <p>In the first years of the 16th century the influence of the Confederates south of
                    the Alps was largely extended. The system of giving pensions, in order to secure
                    the right of enlisting men within the Confederation, and of capitulations, by
                    which the different members supplied troops, was originated by Louis XI. in
                    1474, and later followed by many other princes. Though a tribute to Swiss valour
                    and courage, this practice had very evil results, of which the first fruits were
                    seen in the Milanese (1500-1516). Both Charles VIII. (1484) and Louis XII. (1499
                    for ten years) renewed Louis XI.’s treaty. The French attempts to gain Milan
                    were largely carried on by the help of Swiss mercenaries, some of whom were on
                    the opposite side; and, as brotherly feeling was still too strong to make it
                    possible for them to fight against one another, Ludovico Sforza’s Swiss troops
                    shamefully betrayed him to the French at Novara (1500). In 1500, too, the three
                    Forest districts occupied Bellinzona at the request of its inhabitants, and in
                    1503 Louis XII. was forced to cede it to them. He, however, often held back the
                    pay of his Swiss troops, and treated them as mere hirelings, so that when the
                    ten years’ treaty came to an end Matthew Schinner, bishop of Sitten (or Sion),
                    induced them to join (1510) the pope, Julius II., then engaged in forming the
                    Holy League to expel the French from Italy. But when, after the battle of
                    Ravenna, Louis XII. became all-powerful in Lombardy, 20,000 Swiss poured down
                    into the Milanese and occupied it, Schmid, the burgomaster of Zurich, naming
                    Maximilian (Ludovico’s son) duke of Milan, in return for which he ceded to the
                    Confederates Locarno, Val Maggia, Mendrisio, and Lugano (1512), while the
                    Rhaetian leagues received Chiavenna, Bormio, and the Valtelline. (The former
                    districts, with Bellinzona and the Val Leventina, were in 1803 made into the
                    canton of Ticino, the latter were held by Rhaetia till 1797.) In 1513 the Swiss
                    completely defeated the French at Novara, and in 1514 Pace was sent by Henry
                    VIII. of England to give pensions and get soldiers. Francis I. at once on his
                    accession (1515) began to prepare to win back the Milanese, and, successfully
                    evading the Swiss awaiting his descent from the Alps, beat them in a pitched
                    battle at Marignano near Milan (September 13, 1515), which broke the Swiss power
                    in North Italy, so that in 1516 a peace was made with France,—Wallis, the
                    Rhaetian leagues, and St Gall being included on the side of the Confederates.
                    Provisions were made for the neutrality of either party in case the other became
                    involved in war, and large pensions were promised. This treaty was extended by
                    another in 1521 (to which Zurich, then under Zwingli’s influence, would not
                    agree, holding aloof from the French alliance till 1614), by which the French
                    king might, with the consent of the Confederation, enlist any number of men
                    between 6000 and 16,000, paying them fit wages, and the pensions were raised to
                    3000 francs annually to each member of the Confederation. These two treaties
                    were<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"

                    interference with Swiss affairs, which became more and more oppressive, and was
                    not finally thrown off till 1814.</p>
                <p>IV. In 1499 the Swiss had practically renounced their allegiance to the emperor,
                    the temporal chief of the world according to mediaeval theory; and in the 16th
                    century a great number of them did the same by the world’s spiritual chief, the
                    pope. The scene of the revolt was Zurich, and the leader Ulrich Zwingli. But we
                    cannot understand Zwingli’s career unless we remember that he was almost more a
                    political reformer than a religious one. In his former character his policy was
                    threefold. He bitterly opposed the French alliance and the pension and mercenary
                    system, for he had seen its evils with his own eyes when serving as chaplain
                    with the troops in the Milanese in 1512 and 1515. Hence in 1521 his influence
                    kept Zurich back from joining in the treaty with Francis I. Then, too, at the
                    time of the Peasant Revolt (1525), he did what he could to lighten the harsh
                    rule of the city over the neighbouring rural districts, and succeeded in getting
                    serfage abolished. Again he had it greatly at heart to secure for Zurich and
                    Bern the chief power in the Confederation, because of their importance and size;
                    he wished to give them extra votes in the diet, and would have given them
                    two-thirds of the “common bailiwicks” when these were divided. In his character
                    as a religious reformer we must remember that he was a humanist, and deeply read
                    in classical literature, which accounts for his turning the canonries of the
                    Grossmünster into professorships, reviving the old school of the Carolinum, and
                    relying on the arm of the state to carry out religious changes. His theology
                    sprang from a single ruling principle—the absolute and unlimited sovereignty of
                    God. Hence his profound respect for the letter of the Bible led him to
                    “legalism” and extreme Sabbatarianism. Hence his view of the incarnation
                    bordered on Unitarianism, and sacraments were mere signs of that which is
                    already given; hence too sprang his denial of man’s free will and his belief in
                    absolute election and reprobation. Nay, God, being the absolute Author of all
                    things, is the Author of evil, though He is not immoral, for He is above law,
                    and what is morally wrong for man is not so for God. Zwingli began to preach the
                    new views as early as 1516, long before and quite independently of Luther; but
                    it was only when at the end of 1518 he was called to Zurich as parish priest
                    that he began to make any noise, and in fact it was even later (1522), when his
                    admirers allowed themselves to eat fish in Lent, that disturbances arose, and
                    the diet forbade all preaching which would disturb the public peace. But, after
                    succeeding at two public disputations, his views rapidly gained ground at
                    Zurich, which long, however, stood quite alone, the other Confederates issuing
                    an appeal to await the decision of the asked-for general council, and proposing
                    to carry out by the arm of the state certain small reforms, while clinging to
                    the old doctrines. Zwingli had to put down the extreme wing of the Reformers—the
                    Anabaptists—by force. Quarrels too arose as to allowing the new views in the
                    “common bailiwicks.” The disputation at Baden (1526) was in favour of the
                    maintainers of the old faith; but that at Bern (1528) resulted in securing for
                    the new views the support of that great town, and so matters began to take
                    another aspect. In 1528 Bern joined the union formed in 1527 in favour of
                    religious freedom by Zurich and Constance <hi rend="italic">(Christliches
                    Burgrecht),</hi> and her example was followed by Schaffhausen, St Gall, Basel,
                    and Mühlhausen. This attempt to virtually break up the League was met in
                    February 1529 by the offensive and defensive alliance made with King Ferdinand
                    of Hungary (brother of the emperor) by the three Forest districts, with Lucerne
                    and Zug, followed (April 1529) by the “Christliche Vereinigung,” or union
                    between these five members of the League. Zurich was greatly moved by this, and,
                    as Zwingli held that for the honour of God war was as necessary as iconoclasm,
                    war seemed imminent; but Bern held back; and the first peace of Kappel was
                    concluded (June 1529), by which the Hungarian alliance was annulled and the
                    principle of “religious parity” (or freedom) was admitted in the case of each
                    member of the League and in the “common bailiwicks.” This was at once a victory
                    and a check for Zwingli. He tried to make an alliance with the Protestants in
                    Germany, but failed at the meeting at Marburg (October 1529) to come to an
                    agreement with Luther on the subject of the eucharist, and the division between
                    the Swiss and the German Reformations was stereotyped. Zwingli now developed his
                    views as to the greater weight which Zurich and Bern ought to have in the.
                    League. Quarrels too went on in the “common bailiwicks,” for the members of the
                    League who clung to the old faith had a majority of votes in matters relating to
                    these districts. Zurich tried to cut off supplies of food from reaching the
                    Catholic members (contrary to the wishes of Zwingli), and, on the death of the
                    abbot of St Gall, disregarding the rights of Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus, who
                    shared with her the office of protectors of the abbey, suppressed the monastery,
                    giving the rule of the land and the people to her own officers. Bern in vain
                    tried to moderate this aggressive policy, and the Catholic members of the League
                    indignantly advanced towards Zurich. Near Kappel, on October 11, 1531, the
                    Zurich vanguard under Göldli was (perhaps owing to his treachery) surprised, and
                    despite reinforcements the men of Zurich were beaten, among the slain being
                    Zwingli himself. Another defeat completed the discomfiture of Zurich, and by the
                    second peace of Kappel (November 1531) the principle of “parity” was recognized,
                    not merely in the case of each member of the League and the “common bailiwicks,”
                    <hi rend="italic">but also in that of each parish or “communes</hi> Thus
                    everywhere the rights of a minority were protected from the encroachments of the
                    majority. The “Christliches Burgrecht” was abolished, and Zurich condemned to
                    pay heavy damages. Bullinger succeeded Zwingli, but this treaty meant that
                    neither side could now try to convert the other wholesale. The League was
                    permanently split into two religious camps: the Catholics, who met at Lucerne,
                    numbered, besides the five already mentioned, Freiburg, Solothurn, Appenzell
                    (Inner Rhoden), and St Gall (with Wallis), thus commanding seventeen votes (out
                    of twenty-nine) in the diet; the Evangelicals were Zurich, Bern, Basel,
                    Schaffhausen, Appenzell (Ausser Rhoden) (with Graubünden), who met at Aarau;
                    while Thurgau and Glarus were divided.</p>
                <p>Bern had her eyes always fixed upon the Savoyard lands to the south-west, in
                    which she had got a footing in 1475, and now made zeal for religious reforms the
                    excuse for resuming her advance policy. In 1526 William Farel, a preacher from
                    Dauphiné, had been sent to reform Aigle, Morat, and Neuchâtel. In 1532 he came
                    to Geneva, an ancient city of which the rule had long been disputed by the
                    prince-bishop, the burgesses, and the house of Savoy, the latter holding the
                    neighbouring districts. She had become in 1519 the ally of Freiburg, in 1526
                    that of Bern also; and in 1530, by their influence, a peace was made between the
                    contending parties. (In 1531 Bonivard, the prior of St Victor, for joining a
                    rising in favour of political liberty, was imprisoned in the castle of Chillon,
                    remaining there till 1536.) The religious changes introduced by Farel greatly
                    displeased Freiburg, which abandoned the alliance (1534), and in 1535 the
                    Reformation was firmly planted in the city. The duke of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0826-0791"/> Savoy, however, took up arms against Bern (1536),
                    who overran Gex, Vaud, and the independent bishopric of Lausanne, as well as the
                    Chablais to the south of the lake. Geneva was only saved by the unwillingness of
                    the citizens. Bern thus ruled north and south of the lake, and carried matters
                    with a high hand. Shortly after this John Calvin, a refugee from Picardy, was,
                    when passing through Geneva, detained by Farel to aid him, and, after an exile
                    from 1538-1541, owing to opposition of the papal party, and of the burghers, who
                    objected to Bernese rule, he set up his wonderful theocratic government in the
                    city, pushing Zwingli’s principles to their ultimate conclusions (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Servetus)</hi> (1553), and in 1555 expelling many who upheld
                    municipal liberty, replacing them by French, English, Italians, and Spaniards as
                    new burghers, whose names are still frequent in Geneva (<hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Candolle, Mallet, Diodati). His theological views led to disputes
                    with the Zurich Reformers, which were partly settled by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consensus Tigurinus</hi> of 1549, and more completely by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helvetic Confession</hi> of 1566, which formed the basis of union between the
                    two parties.</p>
                <p>By the time of Calvin’s death (1564) the old faith had begun to take the
                    offensive; the reforms made by the council of Trent urged on the Catholics to
                    make an attempt to recover lost ground. Emmanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, the
                    hero of St Quentin (1557), and one of the greatest generals of the day, with the
                    support of the Catholic members of the League, demanded the restoration of the
                    districts seized by Bern in 1536, and on October 30, 1564, the treaty of
                    Lausanne confirmed the decision of the other Confederates sitting as arbitrators
                    (according to the old constitutional custom). By this treaty Gex, the Genevois,
                    and the Chablais were to be given back, while Vevey, Chillon, Lausanne, Yverdun
                    were to be kept by Bern, who engaged to maintain the old rights and liberties of
                    Vaud, which in 1565 were further placed under the special protection of France.
                    Thus Bern lost the lands south of the lake, in which St Francis of Sales, the
                    exiled prince-bishop of Geneva, at once proceeded to carry out the restoration
                    of the old faith. In 1555 Bern and Freiburg, as creditors of the debt-laden
                    count, divided the county of Gruyères, thus getting fresh French-speaking
                    subjects. In 1558 Geneva renewed her alliance with Bern, and in 1584 she made
                    one with Zurich.</p>
                <p>The decrees of the council of Trent had been accepted fully by the Catholic
                    members of the League, so far as relates to dogma, but not as regards discipline
                    or the relations of church and state, the sovereign rights and jurisdiction of
                    each state being always carefully reserved. The Counter Reformation, however, or
                    reaction in favour of the old faith, was making rapid progress in the
                    Confederation, mainly through the indefatigable exertions of Charles Borromeo,
                    from 1560 to 1584 archbishop of Milan (in which diocese the Italian bailiwicks
                    were included), and nephew of Pius IV., supported at Lucerne by Ludwig Pfyffer,
                    who, having been (1562-1570) the chief of the Swiss mercenaries in the French
                    wars of religion, did so much till his death (1594) to further the religious
                    reaction at home that he was popularly known as the “Swiss king.” In 1574 the
                    Jesuits, the great order of the reaction, were established at Lucerne; in 1579 a
                    papal nuncio came to Lucerne; Charles Borromeo founded the “Collegium
                    Helveticum” at Milan for the education of forty-two young Swiss, and the
                    Catholic members of the League made an alliance with the bishop of Basel; in
                    1581 the Capuchins were introduced to influence the more ignorant classes. Most
                    important of all was the Golden or Borromean League, concluded (October 5, 1586)
                    between the seven Catholic members of the Confederation (Uri, Schwyz,
                    Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zug, Freiburg, and Solo thurn) for the maintenance of the
                    true faith in their territories, each engaging to punish backsliding members and
                    to help each other if attacked by external enemies, notwithstanding any other
                    leagues, old or new. This league marks the final breaking up of the
                    Confederation into two great parties, which greatly hindered its progress. The
                    Catholic members had a majority in the diet, and were therefore able to refuse
                    admittance to Geneva, Strasburg, and Mühlhausen. Another result of these
                    religious differences was the breaking up of Appenzell into two bits (1597),
                    each sending one representative to the diet—“Inner Rhoden” remaining Catholic,
                    “Ausser Rhoden” adopting the new views. We may compare with this the action of
                    Zurich in 1555, when she received the Protestant exiles from Locarno and the
                    Italian bailiwicks into her burghership, and Italian names are found there to
                    this day (<hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Orelli, Muralt). The duke of Savoy made
                    several vain attempts to get hold of Geneva, the last (in 1602) being known as
                    the “Escalade.”</p>
                <p>In the Thirty Years’ War the Confederation remained neutral, being bound both to
                    Austria (1474) and to France (1516), and neither religious party wishing to give
                    the other an excuse for calling in foreign armies, But the troubles in Rhaetia
                    threatened entanglements. Austria wished to secure the Münsterthal (belonging to
                    the League of the Ten Jurisdictions), and Spain wanted the command of the passes
                    leading from the Valtelline (conquered by the leagues of Rhaetia in 1512), the
                    object being to connect the Hapsburg lands of Tyrol and Milan. In the Valtelline
                    the rule of the Three Leagues was very harsh, and Spanish intrigues easily
                    brought about the massacre of 1620, by which the valley was won, the Catholic
                    members of the Confederation stopping the troops of Zurich and Bern. In 1622 the
                    Austrians conquered the Prättigau, over which they still had certain feudal
                    rights. French troops regained the Valtelline in 1624, but it was lost once more
                    in 1629 to the imperial troops, and it was not till 1635 that the French, under
                    Rohan, finally succeeded in holding it. The French, however, wished to keep it
                    permanently; hence new troubles arose, and in 1637 the natives, under George
                    Jenatsch, with Spanish aid drove them out, the Spaniards themselves being forced
                    to resign it in 1639. It was only in 1649-52 that the Austrian rights in the
                    Prättigau were finally bought up by the League of the Ten Jurisdictions, which
                    thus gained its freedom.</p>
                <p>In consequence of Ferdinand II.’s edict of restitution (1629), by which the <hi
                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> of 1552 was re-established —the high-water mark of
                    the Counter Reformation—the abbot of St Gall tried to make some religious
                    changes in his territories, but the protest of Zurich led to the Baden
                    compromise of 1632, by which, in the case of disputes on religious matters
                    arising in the “common bailiwicks,” the decision was to be, not by a majority,
                    but by means of friendly discussion—a logical application of the doctrine of
                    religious parity—or by arbitration.</p>
                <p>But by far the most important event in Swiss history in this age is the formal
                    freeing of the Confederation from the empire. Basel had been admitted a member
                    of the League in 1501, two years after the Confederation had been practically
                    freed from the jurisdiction of the imperial chamber, though the city was
                    included in the new division of the empire into “circles” (1521), which did not
                    take in the older members of the Confederation. Basel, however, refused to admit
                    this jurisdiction; the question was taken up by France and Sweden at the
                    congress of Münster, and formed the subject of a special clause in the treaties
                    of Westphalia, by which the city of Basel and the other “Helvetiorum cantones”
                    were declared to be “in the possession of almost entire liberty and exemption
                    from the empire, and <hi rend="italic">nullatenus</hi> subject<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0827-0792"/> to the imperial tribunals.” This was intended to
                    mean exemption from all obligations to the empire (with which the Confederation
                    was connected hereafter simply as a friend), and to be a definitive settlement
                    of the question. Thus by the events of 1499 and 1648 the Confederation had
                    become an independent European state, which, by the treaty of 1516, stood as
                    regards France in a relation of neutrality.</p>
                <p>In 1668, in consequence of Louis XIV.’s temporary occupation of the Franche
                    Comté, an old scheme for settling the number of men to be sent by each member of
                    the Confederation to the joint army, and the appointment of a council of war in
                    war time, that is, an attempt to create a common military organization, was
                    accepted by the diet, which was to send two deputies to the council, armed with
                    full political powers. This agreement, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Defensionale,</hi> is the only instance of joint and unanimous action in this
                    miserable period of Swiss history, when religious divisions crippled the energy
                    of the Confederation.</p>
                <p>Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the Confederation was practically a
                    dependency of France. In 1614 Zurich for the first time joined in the treaty,
                    which was renewed in 1663 with special provisions as regards the Protestant
                    Swiss mercenaries in the king’s pay and a promise of French neutrality in case
                    of civil war in the League. The Swiss had to stand by while Louis XIV. won
                    Alsace (1648-), Franche Comté (1678), and Strasburg (1681). But, as Louis
                    inclined more and more to an anti-Protestant policy, the Protestant members of
                    the League favoured the Dutch military service; and it was through their
                    influence that in 1707 the “states” of the principality of Neuchâtel, on the
                    extinction of the Longueville line of these princes, decided in favour of the
                    king of Prussia (representing the overlords—the house of Challon-Orange) as
                    against the various French pretenders claiming from the Longueville dynasty by
                    descent or by will. In 1715 the Catholic members of the League, in hopes of
                    retrieving their defeat of 1712 (see below), agreed, while renewing the treaty
                    and capitulations, to put France in the position of the guarantor of the League,
                    with rights of interfering, in case of attack from within or from without,
                    whether by counsel or arms. This last clause was simply the surrender of Swiss
                    independence, and was strongly objected to by the Protestant members of the
                    Confederation, so that in 1777 it was dropped, when all the Confederates made a
                    fresh defensive alliance, wherein their sovereignty and independence were
                    expressly set forth. Thus France had succeeded to the position of the empire
                    with regard to the Confederation, save that her claims were practically asserted
                    and voluntarily admitted.</p>
                <p>Between 1648 and 1798 the Confederation was distracted by religious divisions,
                    and feelings ran very high. A scheme to set up a central administration fell
                    through in 1655, through jealousy of Bern and Zurich, the proposers. In 1656 a
                    question as to certain religious refugees, who were driven from Schwyz and took
                    refuge at Zurich, brought about the first Villmergen war, in which the Catholics
                    were successful, and procured a clause in the treaty asserting very strongly the
                    absolute sovereignty in religious as well as in political matters of each member
                    of the League within its own territories. Later, the attempt of the abbot of St
                    Gall to enforce his rights in the Toggenburg swelled into the second Villmergen
                    war (1712), which turned out very ill for the defeated Catholics. Zurich and
                    Bern were henceforth to hold in severalty Baden, Rapperschwyl, and part of the
                    “common bailiwicks” of the Aargau, both towns being given a share in the
                    government of the rest, and Bern in that of Thurgau and Rheinthal, from which as
                    well as from that part of Aargau she had been carefully excluded in 1415 and
                    1460.</p>
                <p>The only thing that prospered was the principle of “religious parity,” which was
                    established by every treaty.</p>
                <p>The diet had few powers; the Catholics had the majority there; the sovereign
                    rights of each member of the League and the limited mandate of the envoys
                    effectually checked all progress. Zurich, as the leader of the League, managed
                    matters when the diet was not sitting, but could not enforce her orders. The
                    Confederation was little more than a collection of separate atoms, and it is
                    really marvellous that it did not break up through its own weakness.</p>
                <p>In these same two centuries, the chief feature in domestic Swiss politics is the
                    growth of an aristocracy: the power of voting and the power of ruling are placed
                    in the hands of a small class. This is chiefly seen in Bern, Lucerne, Freiburg,
                    and Solothurn, where there were not the primitive democracies of the Forest
                    districts nor the government by guilds as at Zurich, Basel, and Schaffhausen. It
                    was effected by refusing to admit any new burghers, a practice which dates from
                    the middle of the 16th century, and is connected (like the similar movement in
                    the smaller local units of the “communes” in the rural districts) with the
                    question of poor relief after the suppression of the monasteries. Outsiders
                    (Hintersässen or Niedgelassene) had no political rights, however long they might
                    have resided, while the privileges of burghership were strictly hereditary.
                    Further, within the burghers, a small class succeeded in securing the monopoly
                    of all public offices, which was kept up by the practice of co-opting, and was
                    known as the “patriciate.” So in Bern, out of 360 burgher families, 80 (in 1776
                    18 only} formed the ruling oligarchy; and, though to foreigners the government
                    seemed admirably managed, yet the last thing that could be said of it was that
                    it was democratic. In 1749 Henzi made a fruitless attempt to overthrow this
                    oligarchy, like Fario at Geneva in 1707. The harsh character of Bernese rule
                    (and the same holds good with reference to Uri and the Val Leventina) was shown
                    in the great strictness with which Vaud was kept in hand: it was ruled as a
                    conquered land by a benevolent despot, and we can feel no surprise that Davel in
                    1723 tried to free his native land, or that it was in Vaud that the principles
                    of the French Revolution were most eagerly welcomed. Another result of this
                    aristocratic tendency was the way in which the cities despised the neighbouring
                    country districts, and managed gradually to deprive them of their equal
                    political rights and to levy heavy taxes upon them. These and other grievances
                    (the fall in the price of food after the close of the Thirty Years’ War, the
                    lowering of the value of the coin, &amp;c.), combined with the presence of many
                    soldiers discharged after the great war, led to the great Peasant Revolt (1653)
                    in the territories of Bern, Solothurn, Lucerne, and Basel, interesting
                    historically as being the first popular rising since the old days of the 13th
                    and 14th centuries, and because reminiscences of legends connected with those
                    times led to the appearance of the “three Tells,” who greatly stirred up the
                    people. The rising was put down at the cost of much bloodshed, but the demands
                    of the peasants were not granted. Yet during this period of political
                    powerlessness a Swiss literature first arises: Gessner and Tschudi in the 16th
                    century are succeeded by Scheuchzer, Haller, Lavater, Bodmer, De Saussure,
                    Rousseau, J. von Müller; the taste for Swiss travel is stimulated by the
                    publication of Ebel’s guide-book, based on the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deliciae</hi>; industry throve greatly. The residence of such brilliant foreign
                    writers as Voltaire and Gibbon within or close to the territories of the
                    Confederation helped on this remarkable intellectual revival. Political
                    aspirations were not, however, wholly crushed, and found their centre in the
                    Helvetic Society, founded in 1762 by Balthasar and others.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0828-0793"/> The Confederation and France had been closely
                    connected for so long that the outbreak of the French Revolution could not fail
                    to affect the Swiss. The Helvetian Club, founded at Paris in 1790 by several
                    exiled Vaudois and Freiburgers, was the centre from which the new ideas were
                    spread in the western part of the Confederation, and risings directed or stirred
                    up. In 1790 Lower Wallis rose against the oppressive rule of the upper
                    districts; in 1792 Porrentruy defied the prince-bishop of Basel, despite the
                    imperial troops he summoned, declared the “Rauracian” republic, and three months
                    later became the French department of the Mont Terrible; Geneva was only saved
                    (1792) from France by a force sent from Zurich and Bern; and the massacre of the
                    Swiss guard at the Tuileries on August 10, 1792, aroused intense indignation.
                    The rulers, however, unable to enter into the new ideas, contented themselves
                    with suppressing them by force, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Zurich in the case
                    of Stäfa (1795). St Gall managed to free itself from its abbot (1795-97), but
                    the Leagues of Rhaetia so oppressed their subjects in the Valtelline that in
                    1797 Bonaparte (after conquering the Milanese from the Austrians) joined them to
                    the Cisalpine republic. The diet was distracted by party struggles, and the fall
                    of the old Confederation was not far distant. The rumours of the vast treasures
                    stored up at Bern, and the desire of securing a bulwark against Austrian attack,
                    specially turned the attention of the Directory towards the Confederation; and
                    this was utilized by the heads of the reform party in the Confederation,—Ochs,
                    the burgomaster of Basel, and La Harpe, who had left his home in Vaud through
                    disgust at Bernese oppression, both now wishing for aid from outside in order to
                    free their land from the rule of the oligarchy. Hence, when La Harpe, at the
                    head of twenty-two exiles from Vaud and Freiburg, called (November 20, 1797) on
                    the Directory to protect the liberties of Vaud, which France by the treaty of
                    1565 was bound to guarantee, his appeal found a ready answer. In 1798 French
                    troops occupied Mühlhausen and Bienne (Biel), as well as those parts of the
                    lands of the princebishop of Basel (St Imier and the Münsterthal) as regards
                    which he had been since 1579 the ally of the Catholic members of the
                    Confederation. Another army entered Vaud (February 1798), when the “Lemanic
                    republic” was proclaimed, and the diet broke up in dismay without taking any
                    steps to avert the coming storm. Brune and his army occupied Freiburg and
                    Solothurn, and, after fierce fighting at Neueneck, entered (March 5) Bern,
                    deserted by her allies, and distracted by quarrels within. With Bern, the
                    stronghold of the aristocratic party, fell the old Confederation. The Revolution
                    triumphed throughout the Confederation. Brune, on March 19, put forth a
                    wonderful scheme by which the Confederation with its “associates” and “subjects”
                    was to be split into three republics —the Tellgau (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    the Forest districts), the Rhodanic (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Vaud, Wallis,
                    the Bernese Oberland, and the Italian bailiwicks), and the Helvetic (<hi
                    rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the north and east portions); but the Directory
                    disapproved of this (March 23) and on March 29 the Helvetic republic, one and
                    indivisible, was proclaimed. This was accepted by ten out of the thirteen
                    members of the old Confederation, as well as the constitution drafted by Ochs.
                    By the new scheme the territories of the Everlasting League were split up into
                    twenty-three (later nineteen, Rhaetia only coming in in 1799) administrative
                    districts, called “cantons,” a name now officially used in Switzerland for the
                    first time, though it may be found employed by foreigners in the French treaty
                    of 1452, in Comines and Machiavelli, and in the treaties of Westphalia (1648). A
                    central Government was set up, with its seat at Lucerne, comprising a senate and
                    a great council, together forming the legislature, with an executive of five
                    directors chosen by the legislature, and having four ministers as subordinates
                    or “chief secretaries.” A supreme court of justice was set up; a status of Swiss
                    citizenship was recognized; and absolute freedom to settle in any canton was
                    given, the political “communes” being now composed of all residents, and not
                    merely of the burghers. For the first time an attempt was made to organize the
                    Confederation as a single state, but the change was too sweeping to last, for it
                    largely ignored the local patriotism which had done so much to create the
                    Confederation, though more recently it had made it politically powerless. The
                    three Forest districts rose in rebellion against the invaders and the new
                    constitutions which destroyed their ancient prerogatives; but the valiant
                    resistance of the Schwyzers, under Alois Reding, on the heights of Morgarten
                    (April and May), and that of the Unterwaldners (September), were put down by
                    French armies. The proceedings of the French, however, soon turned into disgust
                    and hatred the joyful feelings with which they had been hailed as liberators.
                    Geneva was annexed to France (1798); Gersau, after an independent existence of
                    over 400 years, was made a mere district of Schwyz; immense fines were levied
                    and the treasury at Bern pillaged; the land was treated as if it had been
                    conquered. The new republic was compelled to make a very close offensive and
                    defensive alliance with France, and its directors were practically nominated
                    from Paris. In 1799 Zurich, the Forest cantons, and Rhaetia became the scene of
                    the struggles of the Austrians (welcomed with joy) against the French and
                    Russians. The manner too in which the reforms were carried out alienated many,
                    and, soon after the Directory gave way to the Consulate in Paris (18 Brumaire or
                    November 10, 1799), the Helvetic directory (January 1800) was replaced by an
                    executive committee.</p>
                <p>The scheme of the Helvetic republic had gone too far in the direction of
                    centralization; but it was not easy to find the happy mean, and violent
                    discussions went on between the “unitary” (headed by Ochs and La Harpe) and
                    “federalist” parties. Many drafts were put forward, and one actually submitted
                    to but rejected by a popular vote (May 20, 1802). In July 1802 the French troops
                    were withdrawn from Switzerland by Bonaparte, ostensibly to comply with the
                    treaty of Amiens, really to show the Swiss that their best hopes lay in
                    appealing to him. The Helvetic Government was gradually driven back by armed
                    force, and the federalists seemed getting the best of it, when (October 4)
                    Bonaparte offered himself as mediator, and summoned many of the chief Swiss
                    statesmen to Paris to discuss matters with him (the “Consulta”—December 1802).
                    He had long taken a very special interest in Swiss matters, and in 1802 had
                    given to the Helvetic republic the Frickthal (ceded to France in 1801 by
                    Austria), the last Austrian possession within the borders of the Confederation.
                    On the other hand, he had made (November 1802) Wallis into an independent
                    republic. In the discussions he pointed out that Swiss needs required a federal
                    constitution and a neutral position guaranteed by France. Finally (February 19,
                    1803) he laid before the Consulta the Act of Mediation which he had elaborated,
                    and which they had perforce to accept—a document which formed a new departure in
                    Swiss history, and the influence of which is visible in the present
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>Throughout, “Switzerland” is used for the first time as the official name of the
                    Confederation. The thirteen members of the old Confederation before 1798 are set
                    up again, and to them are added six new cantons,—two (St Gall and Graubünden or
                    Grisons) having been formerly “associates,” and the four others being made up of
                    the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0829-0794"/> subject lands conquered at different
                    times,—Aargau (1415), Thurgau (1460), Ticino or Tessin (1440, 1500, 1512), and
                    Vaud (1536). In the diet, six cantons which had a population of more than
                    100,000 (viz., Bern, Zurich, Vaud, St Gall, Graubünden, and Aargau) were given
                    two votes, the others having but one apiece, and the deputies were to vote
                    freely within limits, though not against their instructions. Meetings of the
                    diet were to be held alternately at Freiburg, Bern, Solothurn, Basel, Zurich,
                    and Lucerne,—the Government of each of these cantons becoming, by virtue of the
                    presence of the diet, the executive of the Confederation, its chief magistrate
                    being named the “landamman of Switzerland.” The “lands-gemeinden,” or popular
                    assemblies, were restored in the democratic cantons, the cantonal governments in
                    other cases being in the hands of a “great council” (legislative) and the “small
                    council” (executive),—a property qualification being required both for voters
                    and candidates. No canton was to form any political alliances abroad or at home.
                    The “communes” were given larger political rights, the burghers who owned and
                    used the common lands becoming more and more private associations. There was no
                    Swiss burghership, as in 1798, but perfect liberty of settlement in any canton.
                    There were to be no privileged classes or subject lands. A very close alliance
                    with France (on the basis of that of 1516) was concluded. The whole constitution
                    and organization were far better suited for the Swiss than the more symmetrical
                    system of the Helvetic republic; but, as it was guaranteed by Bonaparte, and his
                    influence was predominant, the whole fabric was closely bound up with him, and
                    fell with him. Excellent in itself, the constitution set forth in the Act of
                    Mediation failed by reason of its setting.</p>
                <p>For ten years Switzerland enjoyed peace and prosperity under the new
                    constitution. Pestalozzi and Fellenberg worked out their educational theories;
                    K. Escher of Zurich embanked the Linth, and was thence called “von der Linth”;
                    the central Government prepared many schemes for the common welfare. On the
                    other hand, the mediator (who became emperor in 1804) lavishly expended his
                    Swiss troops, the number of which could only be kept up by a regular blood tax,
                    while the “Berlin decrees” raised the price of many articles. In 1806 the
                    principality of Neuchâtel was given to Marshal Berthier; Tessin was occupied by
                    French troops from 1810 to 1813, and in 1810 Wallis was made into the department
                    of the Simplon, so as to secure that pass. At home, the liberty of moving from
                    one canton to another (though given by the constitution) was, by the diet in
                    1805, restricted by requiring ten years’ residence, and then not granting
                    political rights in the canton or a right of profiting by the communal property.
                    As soon as Napoleon’s power began to wane (1812—13), the position of Switzerland
                    became endangered. Despite the personal wishes of the czar (a pupil of La
                    Harpe’s), the Austrians, supported by the reactionary party in Switzerland, and
                    without any real resistance on the part of the diet, as well as the Russian
                    troops, crossed the frontier on December 21, 1813, and a few days later the diet
                    was induced to declare the abolition of the 1803 constitution, guaranteed, like
                    Swiss neutrality, by Napoleon. Bern headed the party which wished to restore the
                    old state of things, but Zurich and the majority stood out for the nineteen
                    cantons. The powers exercised great pressure to bring about a meeting of
                    deputies from all the nineteen cantons at Zurich (April 6, 1814, “the long
                    diet”), but party strife was so bitter that many questions had to be referred to
                    the congress sitting at Vienna. The congress decided (March 20, 1815) that
                    Wallis, Neuchâtel, and Geneva should be raised from the rank of “associates” to
                    that of full members of the confederation (thus making up the familiar
                    twenty-two), and as compensation gave Bern the town of Bienne (Biel) and all
                    (save a small bit which went to Basel) of the territories of the prince-bishop
                    of Basel (“the Bernese Jura”); but the Valtelline was granted to Austria, and
                    Mühlhausen was not freed from France.</p>
                <p>The diet accepted this decision, and on August 7, 1815, the new constitution was
                    sworn to by all the cantons save Nidwald, the consent of which was only obtained
                    by armed force, a delay for which she paid by seeing Engelberg and the valley
                    above (acquired by Nidwald in 1798) given to Obwald. By the new constitution the
                    sovereign rights of each canton were fully recognized, and a return made to the
                    lines of the old constitution, though there were to be no subject lands, and
                    political rights were not to be the exclusive privilege of any class of
                    citizens. Each canton had one vote in the diet, where an absolute majority was
                    to decide all matters save foreign affairs, when a majority of three-fourths was
                    required. The management of current business, &amp;c., shifted every two years
                    between the Governments of Zurich, Bern, and Lucerne (the three “Vororte”). The
                    monasteries were guaranteed in their rights and privileges; and no canton was to
                    make any alliance contrary to the rights of the Confederation or of any other
                    canton. Provision was made for a federal army. Finally the congress, on November
                    20, 1815, placed Switzerland and parts of North Savoy (Chablais, Faucigny, and
                    part of the Genevois) under the guarantee of the great powers, who engaged to
                    maintain their neutrality, thus freeing Switzerland from her 300 years’
                    subservience to France, and compensating in some degree for the reactionary
                    nature· of the new Swiss constitution when compared with that of 1803.</p>
                <p>V. The cities at once secured for themselves in the cantonal great councils an
                    overwhelming representation over the neighbouring country districts, and the
                    agreement of 1805 as to migration from one canton to another was renewed by
                    twelve cantons. For some time there was little talk of reforms, but in 1819 the
                    Helvetic Society definitely became a political society, and the foundation in
                    1824 of the Marksmen’s Association enabled men from all cantons to meet
                    together. A few cantons (notably Tessin) were beginning to make reforms, when
                    the influence of the July revolution (1830) in Paris and the sweeping changes in
                    Zurich led the diet to declare (December 27) that it would not interfere with
                    any reforms of cantonal constitutions provided they were in agreement with the
                    pact of 1815. Hence for the next few years great activity in this direction was
                    displayed, and most of the cantons reformed themselves, save the most
                    conservative <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Uri, Glarus) and the advanced who
                    needed no changes <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Geneva, Graubünden). Provision
                    was always made for revising these constitutions at fixed intervals, for the
                    changes were not felt to be final, and seven cantons— Zurich, Bern, Lucerne,
                    Solothurn, St Gall, Aargau, and Thurgau—joined together to guarantee their new
                    free constitutions (Siebener Concordat of March 17, 1832). Soon after, the
                    question of revising the federal pact was brought forward by a large majority of
                    cantons in the diet (July 17), whereon, by the league of Sarnen (November 14),
                    the three Forest cantons, with Neuchâtel, the city of Basel, and Wallis, agreed
                    to maintain the pact of 1815 and to protest against the separation of Basel in
                    two halves (for in the reform struggle Schwyz and Basel had been split up,
                    though the split was permanent only in the latter case). A draft constitution
                    providing for a federal administration distinct from the cantons could not
                    secure a majority in its favour; a reaction against reform set in, and the diet
                    was forced to sanction (1833) the division of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n830/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0830-0795"/> Basel into the “city” aud “country” divisions
                    (each with half a vote in the diet), though fortunately in Schwyz the quarrel
                    was healed. Religious quarrels further stirred up strife in connexion with
                    Aargau, which was a canton where religious parity prevailed, later in others. In
                    Zurich the extreme pretensions of the radicals and freethinkers (illustrated by
                    offering a chair of theology in the university to Strauss because of his recent
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus)</hi> brought about a great reaction in 1839,
                    when Zurich was the “Vorort.” In Aargau the parties were very evenly balanced,
                    and, when in 1840, on occasion of the revision of the constitution, the radicals
                    had a popular majority, the aggrieved clerics stirred up a revolt (1840), which
                    was put down, but which gave their opponents (headed by A. Keller) the excuse
                    for carrying a vote in the great council to suppress the eight monasteries in
                    the canton. This was flatly opposed to the pact of 1815, which the diet by a
                    small majority decided must be upheld, though after many discussions it
                    determined (August 31, 1843) to accept the compromise by which four only were to
                    be suppressed, and declared that the matter was now settled. On this the seven
                    Catholic cantons—Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, Zug, Freiburg, and
                    Wallis—formed (September 7, 1843) a “Sonderbund” or separate league, which
                    (February 1844) issued a manifesto demanding the reopening of the question and
                    the restoration of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the monasteries. Like the radicals
                    in former years the Catholics went too far and too fast, for in October 1844 the
                    clerical party in Lucerne (in the majority since 1841, and favouring the
                    reaction in Wallis) officially invited in the Jesuits and gave them high posts,
                    an act which created all the more sensation because Lucerne was the “Vorort.”
                    Twice (December 1844 and March 1845) parties of Free Lances tried to capture the
                    city. In December 1845 the Sonderbund turned itself into an armed confederation,
                    ready to appeal to war in defence of the rights of each canton. The radicals
                    carried Zurich in 1845 and Bern in 1846, but a majority could not be secured in
                    the diet till Geneva (October 1846) and St Gall (May 1847) were won by the same
                    party. On July 20, 1847, the diet, by a small majority, declared that the
                    Sonderbund was contrary to the federal pact, which on August 16 it was resolved
                    to revise, while on September 3 it was decided to invite each canton to expel
                    the Jesuits. Most of the great powers favoured the Sonderbund, but England took
                    the contrary view. On October 29 the deputies of the unyielding cantons left the
                    diet, which ordered on November 4 that its decree should be enforced by arms.
                    The war was short (November 11—29), mainly owing to the ability of Dufour, and
                    the loss of life trifling. One after another the rebellious cantons were forced
                    to surrender, and, as the Paris revolution of February 1848 occupied all the
                    attention of the great powers (who by the constitution of 1815 should have been
                    consulted in the revision of the pact), the Swiss were enabled to settle their
                    own affairs quietly. Schwyz and Zug abolished their “landsgemeinden,” and the
                    seven were condemned to pay the costs of the war (ultimately defrayed by
                    subscription), which had been waged rather on religious than on strict
                    particularist or states-rights grounds. The diet meanwhile debated the draft
                    constitution drawn up by Kern of Thurgau and Druey of Vaud, which in the summer
                    of 1848 was accepted by fifteen and a half cantons, the minority consisting of
                    the three Forest cantons, Wallis, Zug, Tessin, and Appenzell (Inner Rhoden), and
                    it was proclaimed on September 12.</p>
                <p>The new constitution inclined rather to the Act of Mediation than to the system
                    which prevailed before 1798. A status of “Swiss citizenship” was set up, closely
                    joined to cantonal citizenship: a man settling in a canton not being his
                    birthplace got cantonal citizenship after two years, but was excluded from all
                    local rights in the “commune” where he might reside. A federal or central
                    Government was set up, to which the cantons gave up a certain part of their
                    sovereign rights, retaining the rest. The federal legislature (or assembly) was
                    made up of two houses—the council of states (Stände Rath), composed of two
                    deputies from each canton, whether small or great<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The method of election and length of term of
                    office were left to the cantonal Governments; at present (1887), in eleven
                    cantons (or half cantons) the people, in fourteen the “great council, elect;
                    twelve elect for one year and twelve for three, Wallis holding to the mean of
                    two years.</p></note> (44 in all), and the national couneil (National Rath),
                    made up of deputies (now 145 in number) elected for three years, in the
                    proportion of one for every 20,000 souls or fraction over 10,000, the electors
                    being all Swiss citizens. The federal council or executive (Bundesrath)
                    consisted of seven members elected by the federal assembly; they are jointly
                    responsible for all business, though for sake of convenience there are various
                    departments, and their chairman is called the president of the Confederation.
                    The federal judiciary (Bundesgericht) is made up of eleven members elected by
                    the federal assembly for three years; its jurisdiction is chiefly confined to
                    civil cases, in which the Confederation is a party (if a canton, the federal
                    council may refer the case to the federal tribunal), but takes in also great
                    political crimes,—all constitutional questions, however, being reserved for the
                    federal assembly. A federal university and a polytechnic school were to be
                    founded; the latter only has as yet been set up, and is fixed at Zurich. All
                    military capitulations were forbidden in the future. Every canton must treat
                    Swiss citizens who belong to one of the Christian confessions like their own
                    citizens, for the right of free settlement is given to all such, though they
                    acquired no rights in the “commune.” All Christians were guaranteed the exercise
                    of their religion, but the Jesuits and similar religious orders were not to be
                    received in any canton. German, French, and Italian were recognized as national
                    languages.</p>
                <p>The constitution as a whole marked a great step forwards; though very many rights
                    were still reserved to the cantons, yet there was a fully organized central
                    government. Almost the first act of the federal assembly was to exercise the
                    power given them of determining the home of the federal authorities, and on
                    November 28, 1848, Bern was chosen, though Zurich still ranks as the first
                    canton in the Confederation.</p>
                <p>By this early settlement of disputes Switzerland was protected from the general
                    revolutionary movement of 1848, and in later years her political history has
                    been uneventful, though she has felt the weight of the great European crisis in
                    industrial and social matters.</p>
                <p>The position of Neuchâtel, as a member of the Confederation (as regards its
                    government only) and as a principality ruled by the king of Prussia, whose
                    rights had been expressly recognized by the congress of Vienna, was uncertain.
                    She had not sent troops in 1847, and, though in 1848 there was a revolution
                    there, the prince did not recognize the changes. Finally, a royalist conspiracy
                    in September 1856 to undo the work of 1848 caused great excitement and anger in
                    Switzerland, and it was only by the mediation of Napoleon III. and the other
                    powers that the prince renounced (1857) all his rights, save his title, which
                    his successor (the German emperor) has also dropped. Since that time Neuchâtel
                    has been an ordinary member of the Confederation. In 1859-60 the cession of
                    Savoy (part of it neutralized in 1815) to France aroused considerable
                    indignation, and in 1862 the long-standing question of frontiers in the Vallee
                    de Dappes was finally arranged<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0831-0796"/> with France. In 1871 many French refugees,
                    especially Bourbaki’s army, were most hospitably received and sheltered. The
                    growth of the Old Catholics after the Vatican council (1870) caused many
                    disturbances in western Switzerland, especially in the Bernese Jura. The attack
                    was led by Bishop Lachat of Basel, whose see was suppressed by several cantons
                    in 1873. The Old Catholics have been recognized by nine cantons and the see of
                    Basel set up again, though Bern does not recognize it. The appointment by the
                    pope of the abbé Mermillod as “apostolic vicar” of Geneva, which was separated
                    from the diocese of Freiburg, led to Monseigneur Mermillod’s banishment from
                    Switzerland (1872), but in 1883 he was raised to the vacant see of Freiburg and
                    allowed by the federal authorities to return, though Geneva still refuses to
                    recognize him. Perhaps the latest event of importance to Switzerland was the
                    opening of the St Gotthard tunnel, which was begun in 1871 and ended in 1880; by
                    it the Forest cantons seem likely to regain the importance which was theirs in
                    the early days of the Confederation.</p>
                <p>From 1848 onwards the cantons continually revised their constitutions, always in
                    a democratic sense, though after the Sonderbund War Schwyz and Zug abolished
                    their “landsgemeinde.” The chief point was the introduction of the <hi
                    rend="italic">referendum,</hi> by which laws made by the cantonal legislature
                    may (facultative <hi rend="italic">referendum)</hi> or must (obligatory <hi
                    rend="italic">referendum)</hi> be submitted to the people for their approval,
                    and this has obtained such general acceptance that Freiburg alone does not
                    possess the <hi rend="italic">referendum</hi> in either of its two forms, Tessin
                    having accepted it in its optional form in 1883. It was therefore only natural
                    that attempts should be made to revise the federal constitution of 1848 in a
                    democratic and centralizing sense, for it had been provided that the federal
                    assembly, on its own initiative or on the written request of 50,000 Swiss
                    electors, could submit the question of revision to a popular vote. In 1866 the
                    restriction of certain rights (mentioned above) to Christians only was swept
                    away; but the attempt at final revision in 1872 was defeated by a small
                    majority, owing to the efforts of the anti-centralizing party. Finally, however,
                    another draft was better liked, and on April 19, 1874, the new constitution was
                    accepted by the people—14½ cantons against 7½ (those of 1848 without Tessin, but
                    with Freiburg and Lucerne) and 340,199 votes as against 198,013. This
                    constitution is that now in force, and is simply an improved edition of that of
                    1848. The federal tribunal (now of nine members only) was fixed (by federal law)
                    at Lausanne, and its jurisdiction enlarged, especially in constitutional
                    disputes between cantons and the federal authorities, though jurisdiction in
                    administrative matters <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> educational, religious,
                    election, commercial) is given to the federal council, a division of functions
                    which is very anomalous, and does not work well. A system of free elementary
                    education was set up, and many regulations made on ecclesiastical matters. A man
                    settling in another canton was, after a residence of three months only, given
                    all cantonal and communal rights, save a share in the common property (an
                    arrangement which as far as possible kept up the old principle that the
                    “commune” is the true unit out of which cantons and the Confederation are
                    built), and the membership of the “commune” carries with it cantonal and federal
                    rights. The <hi rend="italic">referendum</hi> was introduced in its
                    “facultative” form; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all federal laws must be
                    submitted to popular vote on the demand of 30,000 Swiss electors or of eight
                    cantons. If the revision of the federal constitution is demanded by one of the
                    two houses of the federal assembly or by 50,000 Swiss citizens, the question of
                    revision must be submitted to a popular vote, as also the draft of the revised
                    constitution,—these provisions, contained already in the constitution of 1848,
                    forming a species of “obligatory <hi rend="italic">referendum.”</hi> It was
                    supposed that this plan would lead to radical and sweeping changes; but as a
                    matter of fact there have been (1874-86) about one hundred and seven federal
                    laws and resolutions passed by the assembly, of which nineteen were by the <hi
                    rend="italic">referendum</hi> submitted to popular vote, thirteen being
                    rejected, while six only were accepted,—the rest becoming law as no <hi
                    rend="italic">referendum</hi> was demanded. There has been a very steady
                    opposition to all schemes aiming at increased centralization. By the
                    constitutions of 1848 and 1874 Switzerland has ceased to be a mere union of
                    independent states joined by a treaty, and has become a single state with a
                    well-organized central Government, to which have been given certain of the
                    rights of the independent cantons, but increased centralization would destroy
                    the whole character of the Confederation, in which the cantons are not
                    administrative divisions but living political communities. Swiss history teaches
                    us, all the way through, that Swiss liberty has been won by a close union of
                    many small states, and we cannot doubt that it will be best preserved by the
                    same means, and not by obliterating all local peculiarities, nowhere so striking
                    and nowhere so historically important as in Switzerland.</p>

                    literature. She has a literature in French and a literature in German, but these
                    literatures are not the expression of a common intellectual life, for the German
                    and French cantons have always been to some extent dominated by different ideas
                    and sympathies. Political union has been only in part associated with the deeper
                    union which relates to purely ideal interests. Even the difference between the
                    French and the German literatures of Switzerland does not give a complete
                    conception of the diversity of thought and sentiment which exists in the
                    country. Switzerland has also produced Italian writers and writers who use the
                    Romansch dialect of the Grisons. The Romansch and Italian branches of her
                    literature are not, however, sufficiently important to deserve more than passing
                    notice.</p>
                <p>During the struggles against the Hapsburgs the members of the Confederation were
                    too seriously occupied in defending their political rights and in adding to
                    their territory to be very eager for the satisfaction of intellectual needs.
                    They produced some vigorous war songs, but in other respects they were content
                    with such literature as<pb break="no"

                    countries. At the time of the Reformation there was much intellectual activity
                    in Switzerland, but it related chiefly to the controversy of the Protestants
                    with the Church of Rome; and Zwingli, Bullinger, and the other Reformers of the
                    German cantons were not, like Luther, wise enough to write important treatises
                    in the language of the people. They wrote chiefly in Latin, reserving the use of
                    German for sermons and hymns. One good writer of this period whose interest was
                    not confined to theology was Francois Bonnivard, who, although a native of
                    Savoy, had, as prior of the monastery of St Victor, been associated with Geneva
                    before the Reformation. He was one of the most resolute of those who opposed the
                    ambition of Charles III., duke of Savoy; and it is he whose sufferings in the
                    service of his adopted country have been immortalized by Byron in “The Prisoner
                    of Chillon.” After his release from imprisonment he became a Protestant, and
                    wrote in French several important books, the chief of which is his <hi
                    rend="italic">Chroniques de Genève.</hi> This work is written in a bright and
                    animated style, and is especially valuable for its account of events with which
                    the author himself was connected. Another vigorous writer of the 16th century
                    was Aegidius Tschudi, who remained loyal to the Roman Church. He devoted himself
                    with enthusiasm to the study of history. The only result of his labours given to
                    the world in his lifetime was <hi rend="italic">Die uralt wahrhafftig alpisch
                    Phatia,</hi> but several other works have since been published, the most
                    important being his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon Helveticum</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Hauptschlüssel zu verschiedenen Alterthümern.</hi></p>
                <p>After the Reformation a respect for learning was maintained by the university of
                    Basel, the Carolinum of Zurich, and various other educational institutions in
                    the leading towns of the Confederation; but for a long time Switzerland took
                    little part in the literary movement of Europe. Theology was still generally
                    thought to be the only subject worthy of study by serious minds, and theologians
                    continued to write their books in Latin (as, for example, C. Gessner of Zurich).
                    In this respect their example was followed by men of science. In the few
                    instances in which scholars belonging to German cantons wished to appeal to
                    readers who were not specialists, they wrote in French, for Switzerland was so
                    intimately associated in politics with France that the French language was
                    spoken by the educated classes in all parts of the country. French literature
                    was the only modern literature of which they had any real knowledge.</p>
                <p>Early in the 18th century there were many signs of an intellectual awakening both
                    in the German and in the French districts. The literary activity manifested in
                    the German cantons was indirectly connected with the fact that they had been
                    gradually acquiring a stronger sense of political independence. They had been
                    alienated from France by the arrogance of the French Government, and had been
                    forced to consider whether it might not be possible for Switzerland to defend
                    her own interests without foreign patronage. Here and there scholars began to
                    interest themselves in Swiss history, and to take pride in the achievements of
                    the forefathers of the republic; and, in proportion as patriotic sentiment
                    increased, thoughtful men became less inclined to take all their ideas from the
                    country to which alone they had hitherto looked for intellectual guidance. They
                    studied with greater earnestness the literatures of Greece and Rome, and some of
                    them turned to English literature, with which they had not up to this time had
                    the slightest acquaintance. These influences gave a powerful impetus to the best
                    aspirations of the German population of Switzerland, and it was not in
                    literature only that important results were achieved. Members of the family of
                    Bernoulli at the university of</p>
                <p>Basel had already been doing great work in mathematics; and now the fame of
                    Switzerland as a country favourable to the development of science was extended
                    by many investigators, the best known of whom were Euler, Haller, Scheuchzer,
                    and Muralt.</p>
                <p>The writer who first gave expression to the most characteristic literary
                    conceptions of his time in Switzerland was J. J. Bodmer, a native of Zurich. He
                    was a good classical scholar, and in youth had made himself familiar with some
                    of the masterpieces of English, French, and Italian literature. In 1721, in
                    association with his friend Breitinger, a learned Protestant clergyman in
                    Zurich, he began to issue the <hi rend="italic">Discurse der Maler,</hi> written
                    in imitation of the style of the English essayists. In this periodical the two
                    friends criticized freely the works of some popular German versifiers, and they
                    wrote with so much force and confidence that they soon exercised considerable
                    influence not only in Switzerland but in Germany. When the value of their work
                    was beginning to be recognized, a high place was taken among German men of
                    letters by Gottsched, a professor at Leipsic. He was an ardent admirer of the
                    classic drama of France, and gathered around him a number of enthusiastic
                    disciples, known as the Saxon school. For some time he was on friendly terms
                    with the Swiss critics, with whom he agreed in condemning the wild extravagance
                    of Lohenstein and his imitators. But when Bodmer and Breitinger went on to
                    praise English literature, and to call attention especially to the splendid
                    qualities of Milton, Gottsched denounced their opinions as utterly false and
                    misleading. The result was that a bitter controversy broke out between the Saxon
                    and Swiss schools, Bodmer and Breitinger presenting an elaborate statement of
                    critical doctrine, the former in <hi rend="italic">Vom Wunderbaren in der
                    Poesie</hi> (1740), the latter in <hi rend="italic">Kritische Dichtkunst</hi>
                    (1740). The controversy was followed with great interest by many readers, and,
                    although it was by and by almost forgotten, it helped to prepare the way for the
                    outburst of German literature begun by Klopstock, Wieland, and Lessing. The
                    theories of all the combatants were to some extent crude and even grotesque, but
                    Bodmer and Breitinger did excellent service by the vigour with which they
                    protested against the notion that poetry is merely the work of the understanding
                    acting in subjection to rigid rules, and by their enthusiastic appreciation of
                    great English writers. Bodmer also opened fresh sources of inspiration by
                    editing a part of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> and some poems of
                    the Minnesinger,—undertakings in which he anticipated the labours of the
                    Romantic school. He wrote an epic, the <hi rend="italic">Noachide,</hi> and
                    several dramas, but his work as a poet is feeble and unimportant in comparison
                    with his achievements as an editor and critic.</p>
                <p>A. von Haller, who made his fame chiefly as a man of science (see vol. xi. p.
                    396), ranked in literature also among the foremost men of his day. His poems are
                    too directly didactic to give much pleasure to modern readers, but in some of
                    them—especially <hi rend="italic">Die Alpen—</hi> there are passages of striking
                    force and beauty. Haller knew the Alps not merely from books but by having
                    visited them, and to him belongs the credit of having revealed that they appeal
                    powerfully to the imagination, and of having associated them with great thoughts
                    and aspirations. He wrote several prose romances, but outside of Switzerland
                    these works, which had many readers at the time of their publication, are now
                    practically forgotten.</p>
                <p>A Swiss writer of the 18th century who, as a poet, became more famous even than
                    Haller was Solomon Gessner. At Berlin and Hamburg he came under the influence of
                    Rarnler and Hagedorn, and after his return to his native town Zurich, where he
                    lived as an artist, he published a series of idyllic poems which excited
                    universal<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0833-0798"/> admiration. The most popular of his writings was
                    his prose idyl, <hi rend="italic">Der Tod Abel’s</hi> (1758). This work was
                    translated into many languages, and was received with not less favour in
                    Germany, France, and England than in Switzerland. There is not much serious
                    thought in Gessner’s works, and his sentiment sometimes degenerates into
                    sentimentalism, but a permanent place is secured for him in literature by his
                    simple, lucid style and by the delicate grace of his sketches of ideal scenery.
                    These qualities were warmly appreciated by Lessing and afterwards by Goethe.</p>
                <p>Of the German Swiss poets who were born after Gessner had become famous the best
                    were J. G. Salis-Seewis and J. M. Usteri. Salis-Seewis was acquainted with
                    Goethe, Schiller, Herder, and Wieland, but he was not so much influenced by them
                    as by a greatly inferior poet, Matthison, whose ideas and methods closely
                    resembled his own. There is little variety of sentiment in the poems of
                    Salis-Seewis, but their uniformity of tone is prevented from being tiresome by
                    his perfect sincerity and by the vividness of his diction. Usteri wrote at least
                    one song—“Freut euch des Lebens ”—which became popular among Germans of all
                    classes, but his most important writings were some clever stories in the German
                    dialect of Zurich.</p>
                <p>Philosophy, in the strict sense of the term, was not profoundly studied in the
                    German cantons in the 18th century, but philosophical problems, especially those
                    relating to ethics, were discussed in a popular style by a good many more or
                    less able writers. Of these writers one of the most renowned was J. G.
                    Zimmermann. His chief writings are <hi rend="italic">Ueber die Einsamkeit</hi>
                    (1755) and <hi rend="italic">Vom Nationalstolze</hi> (1758). These works present
                    a strange combination of cynicism and sentimentalism, but they profoundly
                    impressed Zimmermann’s contemporaries, and were translated into most European
                    languages. J. G. Sulzer spent the greater part of his life in Berlin, where he
                    was held in much esteem at the time when Lessing was beginning to make a name as
                    a critic and dramatist. His principal work is his <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine
                    Theorie der schonen Künste,</hi> in which he tried to present a complete
                    exposition of the laws of art, starting with the philosophical principles of
                    Wolf, and combining them with critical doctrines derived from English and French
                    writers. His style is somewhat cold and formal, and to later generations his
                    governing thoughts have seemed meagre and unfruitful. H. K. Hirzel wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Bild eines wahren Patrioten</hi> (1767) and various other
                    works, in which he displayed a considerable power of expounding and illustrating
                    great moral principles. He is remembered chiefly, however, by a charming
                    description which he wrote of a day spent by Klopstock and himself with some
                    friends on the Lake of Zurich,—a day celebrated by Klopstock in one of the
                    finest of his early odes. J. K. Lavater made some reputation as a poet, but he
                    owed his fame chiefly to his <hi rend="italic">Physioqnomische Fragmente</hi>
                    (1775-78), in which he sought to develop the idea that the face presents a
                    perfect indication of character, and that physiognomy may therefore be treated
                    as a science. His notions are arbitrary and rather mystical, but he expressed
                    them with so much vigour and enthusiasm that he found many admirers and
                    disciples. J. H. Pestalozzi was a less pretentious but infinitely more useful
                    writer than Lavater. Early in life, mainly through the influence of Rousseau, he
                    became impressed by the necessity of a radical change in the methods of popular
                    education; and with splendid selfsacrifice he devoted his energies to the task
                    of realizing his ideas and of inspiring others with a sense of their importance.
                    His writings—of which <hi rend="italic">Lienhard und Gertrud</hi> is the
                    best—are not distinguished by any remarkable literary qualities, but his
                    theories made his name famous all over the civilized world, and children in
                    every good school may still be said to profit indirectly by his labours.</p>
                <p>In the 18th century the German cantons produced many writers on historical
                    subjects. One of the most distinguished of them was I. Iselin, who, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der Menschheit</hi> (1768), offered suggestions akin to
                    those which were afterwards set forth with wider knowledge and deeper insight by
                    Herder. J. H. Tschudi and J. J. Tschudi, descendants of Aegidius Tschudi, also
                    did much good work as historians. Greater than any of these—the foremost
                    historical writer of Switzerland—was J. von Müller, whose writings marked an era
                    in German literature. His masterpiece is his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der
                    schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft</hi> (1780). Müller had not an adequate
                    appreciation of the laws of evidence in historical inquiry, but he was
                    indefatigable in research, and no German historian of his time had so great a
                    power of bringing out the significance of facts by his method of grouping them.
                    His style, although sometimes obscure and rhetorical, was often made warm and
                    glowing by his eager love of freedom and justice.</p>
                <p>The literary movement of the French districts in the 18th century had little
                    direct relation with that of the German cantons. It sprang chiefly from the
                    influence of French refugees, who flocked in great numbers to western
                    Switzerland after the revocation of the edict of Nantes. The most energetic of
                    the French writers of Switzerland in the first half of the 18th century was
                    Bourguet, the son of a refugee. He travelled in Italy and Holland, and on his
                    return to Geneva founded the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Italique,</hi> which
                    appeared from 1729 to 1734. In carrying on this periodica], which extended to
                    eighteen volumes, Bourguet was aided by a good many Swiss writers—among others
                    by Abraham Ruchat and Loys de Bochat of Lausanne. Bourguet’s colleagues also
                    contributed articles to French periodicals of a similar kind in Holland, three
                    of which— the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle et Historique,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Choisie,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne—</hi> were conducted by Jean le Clerc, a
                    native of Geneva. In 1732 Bourguet started at Neuchâtel the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercure Suisse,</hi> which went on until 1784 and did much to stimulate the
                    interest of its readers in science, literature, history, and archaeology. The
                    indefatigable editor and his colleagues did not confine themselves to
                    journalistic work. One of his books— <hi rend="italic">Traité des
                    Petrifactions—</hi> was an important contribution to geology; and Loys de Bochat
                    wrote a careful book entitled <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Critiques sur
                    l’Histoire Ancienne de la Suisse.</hi> Ruchat was the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire de la Reformation de la Suisse</hi> and of <hi
                    rend="italic">Délices de la Suisse.</hi> The writings of J. P. de Crousaz, a
                    friend of Bourguet, display no remarkable qualities, but two of them, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Examen</hi> of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> and his
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentaire</hi> on the same poem, have some interest for
                    English readers. An English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Examen</hi> by
                    Mrs Elizabeth Carter was published in 1739, and led to the intervention of
                    Warburton, who considered it necessary to prove that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> was not in any way hostile to religion.</p>
                <p>During the second half of the 18th century all Europe was reading the works of a
                    Swiss writer, by far the most illustrious man of letters whom Switzerland has
                    produced —J. J. Rousseau. He moved civilized mankind by many a doctrine which no
                    one now holds to be true, but he owed his astonishing influence not so much to
                    his fallacies as to his passionate zeal for the rights of the poor, to his
                    enthusiasm for the free development of individual character, and to the power
                    with which he reflected in his writings the beauty and the splendour of the
                    external world. Of his own happiness he made shipwreck; but, if we judge his
                    work simply by the practical results which sprang from it, he was perhaps the
                    greatest literary force of modern times. His family was of French origin, but it
                    had been so long settled at Geneva that it had become thoroughly Swiss, and to
                    this fact were due some of the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0834-0799"/> most striking characteristics of his genius. Free
                    and republican Switzerland was the only Continental country whose institutions
                    were favourable to the growth of the ideas with which Rousseau shook to its
                    centre the political and social system of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>Of the other French writers of Switzerland in this age the most eminent was
                    perhaps H. B. de Saussure, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Voyages dans les
                    Alpes</hi> (1776-79), presented in a lucid and attractive style the results of
                    much careful observation. He was one of the founders of geology, and made
                    important contributions to several other sciences. Another distinguished
                    scientific writer of this time was Charles Bonnet, the author of several
                    valuable works on natural history and psychology. His general conception of the
                    order of the world he developed systematically in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contemplation de la Nature</hi> (1764). Much good work was also done by the
                    brothers De Luc, one of whom, Jean-André de Luc, gave in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres sur Quelques Parties de la Suisse</hi> (1787) a very vivid picture of
                    the physical, social, and political peculiarities of a portion of
                    Switzerland.</p>
                <p>Some clever books were written by Madame de Charrière, a native of Utrecht, who
                    settled with her husband in the principality of Neuchâtel in 1771. Much interest
                    was excited by her lively <hi rend="italic">Lettres Écrites de Lausanne</hi> and
                    by her <hi rend="italic">Lettres Neuchäteloises,</hi> and both in Switzerland
                    and in France there were many admirers of her <hi rend="italic">Mari
                    Sentimental</hi> and of the corresponding work <hi rend="italic">Lettres de
                    Mistress Henley.</hi> Samuel Constant, the father of Benjamin Constant, wrote
                    <hi rend="italic">Camille</hi> and some other romances in the form of letters;
                    and <hi rend="italic">Cantes Moraux,</hi> in the style of Marmontel, were
                    written by J. Senebier, who did better work as an investigator in physics and
                    physiolog.</p>
                <p>In the second half of the 18th century there were in French Switzerland many
                    ardent students of history. One of the ablest of them was P. H. Mallet, who took
                    as his special subject the antiquities of northern Europe, but wrote also works
                    on the general history of Denmark, Brunswick, and Hesse. Béranger was the author
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Genève;</hi> and Lamberty, who had served as
                    secretary of several legations in Holland and Germany, brought together in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> many interesting details about events of which
                    he had personal knowledge. A good history of Switzerland to the 17th century was
                    written by De Watteville, and Philibert dealt with the same subject in a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Les Révolutions de la Haute-Allemagne,</hi> in which
                    he brought the story down to 1468. G. E. von Haller wrote several excellent
                    historical works, the most important of which was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothek der Schweizergeschichte.</hi></p>
                <p>From the latter part of the 18th century onwards French Switzerland has produced
                    many influential writers, but they have been so intimately connected with France
                    that their works properly belong to French literature. Necker, who played so
                    great a part in France before the Revolution, was one of the greatest writers of
                    his age on politics and finance; and his daughter Madame de Stael, whom,
                    although she was born in Paris, Switzerland may also claim, stands in the front
                    rank of women who have devoted themselves to literature. Her most brilliant
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Corinne,</hi> was perhaps of less real importance than
                    <hi rend="italic">De l'Allemagne,</hi> from which Frenchmen obtained for the
                    first time authentic information as to the intellectual development of Germany.
                    Benjamin Constant wrote a work oh the source, forms, and history of religion; he
                    was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Adolphe,</hi> a romance, and adapted
                    Schiller’s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> for the French stage. But his
                    principal work is the collection of his <hi rend="italic">Discours Prononcés à
                    la Chambre des Députés,</hi> in which he eloquently defends, from many points of
                    view, the principles of constitutional government. De Sismondi dis played
                    astonishing energy as a writer on history, literature, and political economy,
                    and it is still necessary for students of the subjects on which he wrote to
                    consult his works. His <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Français,</hi> although
                    planned on too vast a scale, is a wonderful monument of industry, learning, and
                    literary skill, and not less valuable in their own way are his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire de la Renaissance de la Liberté en Italie</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">De la Littérature du Midi de l'Europe.</hi> A. Vinet, an eminent
                    Protestant theologian, produced a great impression by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discours sur Quelques Sujets Religieux</hi> and various other theological
                    works, which are full of vigorous thought expressed in a clear, direct, and
                    manly style. Among Swiss novelists R. Töpffer, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Heritage, Traversée,</hi> and many other works,
                    takes a distinguished place. His early writings attracted the attention of
                    Goethe, who read them with pleasure; and Sainte-Beuve, in praising Töpffer’s
                    methods, gave utterance to the general opinion of educated Frenchmen. The three
                    brothers André, Antoine Elisée, and Joel Cherbuliez, and their sisters Adrienne
                    and Madame Tourte-Cherbuliez, were all well known writers; and Victor
                    Cherbuliez, the son of André, is one of the brightest and most fertile novelists
                    of the present day in France. He commands respect also as a writer on
                    politics.</p>
                <p>In the later literature of the German cantons there are not so many famous names
                    as in the later literature of the French cantons. Of a group of writers who
                    connected the influences of the 18th century with those of the 19th, J. B.
                    Albertini was the most original; but he appealed to a comparatively small class.
                    He was a bishop in the church of the Moravian Brethren, and his poems give
                    powerful expression to the deeply religious sentiment of his sect. A romance by
                    J. C. Appenzeller— <hi rend="italic">Gertrud von Wart</hi> (1813)—was so popular
                    that it was translated into French, Dutch, and English; but it has not
                    maintained the high place which was for some time attributed to it. J. R. Wyss
                    edited the <hi rend="italic">Alpenrosen</hi> from 1811 for about twenty years,
                    and for this periodical he wrote many poems, taking his subjects chiefly from
                    Swiss history and legends. He completed and published a story begun by his
                    father, <hi rend="italic">Der Schweizerische Robinson,</hi> translations of
                    which have been widely circulated in France, Spain, England, and America. He
                    also wrote “Rufst du, mein Vaterland,” the great national song of Switzerland.
                    A. E. Fröhlich was a good writer of fables, and J. A. Henne made a considerable
                    reputation, not only as a poet but as the writer of a work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Manethos, die Origines unserer Geschichte und Chranologie,</hi> in
                    which he sought to prove the European origin of the Aryan race. T. Meyer-Merian,
                    author of the well-known song, “Ich ging so ganz alleine,” was also a vigorous
                    dramatist. Dramatic and lyrical poems of some power were written by T.
                    Bornhauser, but they were too plainly intended to serve a political party to
                    have permanent significance. A more poetical writer was B. Reber, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Bilder aus den Burgunder-Kriegen</hi> present a series of glowing
                    pictures from one of the most splendid periods of Swiss history.</p>
                <p>All these writers were surpassed by Albert Bitzius, known as Jeremias Gotthelf
                    from the title of his first book. He was the vicar of Lützelflüh, and for many
                    years found ample scope for his energies in quiet works of benevolence. <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Bauerspiegel, oder Lebensgeschichte des Jeremias
                    Gotthelf,</hi> published in 1836, when he was nearly forty years of age, at once
                    made his name famous, and it was followed by <hi rend="italic">Uli der Knecht,
                    Uli der Pachter, Leiden und Freuden eines Schulmeisters,</hi> and other powerful
                    tales. The charm of his writings springs from the fact that they are an accurate
                    representation of the thoughts, feelings, and habits of the people among whom he
                    laboured. Bitzius was a man of an ardent and impulsive temper, but a close
                    observer, capable of penetrating far below the<pb break="no"

                    faculty of reproducing his impressions in striking imaginative pictures. His
                    style is often rough and careless, but his artistic defects are never serious
                    enough to interrupt the free development of his fresh and vivid conceptions.</p>
                <p>Another German writer of Switzerland whose name is well known beyond the limits
                    of his own country is Gottfried Keller. He established his reputation by his
                    romance <hi rend="italic">Der Grüne Heinrich</hi> (1854), and afterwards he
                    published <hi rend="italic">Die Leute von Seldwyla,</hi> a series of tales of
                    village life, and <hi rend="italic">Sieben Legenden.</hi> He is also the author
                    of some volumes of poems.</p>
