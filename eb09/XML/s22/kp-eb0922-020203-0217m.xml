                    fatty acids with soda and potash. Soap both as a medicinal and as a cleansing
                    agent was known to Pliny (<hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xxviii. 51), who speaks
                    of two kinds—hard and soft—as used by the Germans. He mentions it as originally
                    a Gallic invention for giving a bright hue to the hair (“rutilandis capillis ”).
                    There is reason to believe that soap came to the Romans from Germany, and that
                    the detergents in use in earlier times and mentioned as soap in the Old
                    Testament (Jer. ii. 22; Mal. iii. 2, &amp;c.) refer to the ashes of plants and
                    other such purifying agents (comp. vol. x. p. 697).</p>
                <p>Till Chevreul’s classical researches on fatty bodies (1811- 23) it was believed
                    that soap consisted simply of a binary compound of fat and alkali. Claude J.
                    Geoffroy in 1741 pointed out that the fat or oil recovered from a soap solution
                    by neutralization with a mineral acid differs from the original fatty substance
                    by dissolving readily in alcohol, which is not the case with ordinary fats and
                    oils. The significance of this observation was overlooked; and equally unheeded
                    was a not less important discovery by Scheele in 1783. In preparing lead plaster
                    by boiling olive oil with oxide of lead and a little water—a process palpably
                    analogous to that of the soap-boiler—he obtained a sweet substance which, called
                    by himself “Oelsüss” (“principium dulce oleorum”), is now known as “glycerin.”
                    These discoveries of Geoffroy and Scheele formed the basis of Chevreul’s
                    researches by which he laid bare the constitution of oils and the true nature of
                    soap. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Oils,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 740, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Glycerin,</hi> vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">x.</hi> p. 697.) In
                    those articles it is pointed out that all fatty oils and fats are mixtures of

                <p>Of the natural fats or glycerides contained in oils the most important in
                    addition to palmitin are stearin and olein, and these it may be sufficient to
                    regard as the principal fatty bodies concerned in soap-making.</p>
                <p>The general characters of a soap are a certain greasiness to the touch, ready
                    solubility in water, with formation of viscid solutions which on agitation yield
                    a tenacious froth or “lather,” an indisposition to crystallize, readiness to
                    amalgamate with small proportions of hot water into homogeneous slimes, which on
                    cooling set into jellies or more or less consistent pastes. Soaps give an
                    alkaline reaction and have a decided acrid taste; in a pure condition—a state
                    never reached in practice—they have neither smell nor colour. Almost without
                    exception potash soaps even if made from the solid fatty acids are “soft,” and
                    soda soaps, although made with fluid olein, are “hard”; but there are
                    considerable variations according to the prevailing fatty acid in the compound.
                    Almost all soda soaps are precipitated from their watery solutions by the
                    addition of a sufficiency of common salt. Potash soap with the same reagent
                    undergoes double decomposition—a proportion being changed into a soda soap with
                    the formation of chloride of potassium. Soap when dissolved in a large amount of
                    water suffers hydrolysis, with formation of a precipitate of alkaliferous fatty
                    acid and a solution containing free alkali. Its cleansing power is ordinarily
                    explained by this reaction; but it is difficult to see why a solution which has
                    just thrown off most of its fatty acids should be disposed to take up even a
                    glyceride. It is more likely that the cleansing power of soap is due to the
                    inherent property of its solution to emulsionize fats.</p>
                <p>Resin soaps are compounds of soda or potash with the complex acids (chiefly
                    abietic) of which coniferous resins consist. Their formation is not due to a
                    true process of saponification; but they occupy an important place in compound
                    soaps.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Manufacture.</hi> —The varieties of soaps made are numerous;
                    the purposes to which they are applied are varied; the materials employed
                    embrace a considerable range of oils, fats, and other bodies; and the processes
                    adopted undergo many modifications. As regards processes of manufacture soaps
                    may be made by the direct combination of fatty acids, separated from oils, with
                    alkaline solutions. In the manufacture of stearin for candles, &amp;c., the
                    fatty matter is decomposed, and the liquid olein, separated from the solid fatty
                    acids, is employed as an ingredient in soap-making. A soap so made is<pb

                    combination, as is the case also with resin soaps. All other soaps result from
                    the combination of fatty oils and fats with potash or soda solutions under
                    conditions which favour saponification. The soap solution which results from the
                    combination forms soap-size and is a mixture of soap with water, the excess
                    alkali, and the glycerin liberated from the oil. In such condition ordinary soft
                    soaps and certain kinds of hard soap are brought to the market. In curd soaps,
                    however, which form the basis of most household soap, the uncombined alkali and
                    the glycerin are separated by “salting out,” and the soap in this condition
                    contains about 30 per cent, of water. Soap may be framed and finished in this
                    state, but almost invariably it receives a further treatment called “refining”
                    or “fitting,” in which by remelting with water, with or without the subsequent
                    addition of other agents to harden the finished product, the soap may be made to
                    contain from 60 to 70 per cent. of water and yet present a firm hard
                    texture.</p>
                <p>Among the raw materials used by the soap-boiler the principal fatty bodies are
                    tallow, lard, palm oil, palm-kernel oil, olive oil, cotton-seed oil, sesame oil,
                    and cocoa-nut oil for hard soaps, and fish oils, linseed oil, marrow fat, and
                    the lower qualities of other oils obtained by extraction, &amp;c., for potash or
                    soft soaps. Almond oil, spermaceti, cocoa-butter, ground-nut oil, and some
                    others form the basis of certain toilet and medicinal soaps. Resin and colophony
                    form essential ingredients in yellow soaps. The alkalis are used almost
                    exclusively in the condition of caustic lyes,—solutions of their respective
                    hydrates in water. Caustic soda is now obtained direct from the soda
                    manufacturer, and one operation, causticizing the soda, is thus spared the
                    soap-boiler. Potash lyes are, however, principally sharpened or causticized by
                    the soap-boiler himself from potash carbonate, the process for which is
                    described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Potassium Metals</hi> (vol. xix. p.
                    589).</p>
                <p>The process of soap-boiling is carried out in large iron boilers called “soap
                    pans” or “coppers,” some of which have capacity for a charge of 30 tons or more.
                    The pan proper is surmounted by a great cone or hopper called a curb, to provide
                    for the foaming up of the boiling mass and to prevent loss from overflowing.
                    Formerly the pans were heated by open firing from below; but now the almost
                    universal practice is to boil by steam injected from perforated pipes coiled
                    within the pan, such injection favouring the uniform heating of the mass and
                    causing an agitation favourable to the ultimate mixture and saponification of
                    the materials. Direct firing is used for the second boiling of the soap mixture;
                    but for this superheated steam may with advantage be substituted, either applied
                    by a steam-jacket round the pan or by a closed coil of pipe within it. In large
                    pans a mechanical stirring apparatus is provided, which in some cases, as in
                    Morfit’s steam “twirl,” is formed of the steam-heating tubes geared to rotate.
                    Closed cylinders in which the materials are boiled under pressure are also
                    employed for certain soaps.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Curd Soap.—</hi> The oil mixture used differs in the several
                    manufacturing countries, and the commercial name of the product is
                    correspondingly varied. In Germany tallow is the principal fat; in France olive
                    oil occupies the chief place and the product is known as Marseilles or Castile
                    soap; and in England tallow and palm oil are largely used. But in all countries
                    a mixture of several oils enters into the composition of curd soaps and the
                    proportions used have no fixity. For each ton of soap to be made from 12 to 16
                    cwts. of oil is required. The soap pan is charged with the tallow or other fat,
                    and open steam is turned on. So soon as the tallow is melted a quantity of weak
                    lye is added, and the agitation of the injected steam causes the fat and lye to
                    become intimately mixed and produces a milky emulsion. As the lye becomes
                    absorbed, a condition indicated by the taste of the goods, additional quantities
                    of lye of increasing strength are added. After some time, the contents of the
                    pan begin to clear and become in the end very transparent. Lye still continues
                    to be poured in till a sample tastes distinctly alkaline,—a test which indicates
                    that the whole of the fatty acids have been taken up by and combined with the
                    alkali. Then without further addition of alkali the boiling is continued for a
                    few minutes, when the soap is ready for salting out or “graining.” Either common
                    salt or strong brine in measured quantity is added to the charge, and, the soap
                    being insoluble in such salt solution, a separation of constituents takes place:
                    the soap collects on the surface in an open granular condition, and the spent
                    lye sinks to the bottom after it has been left for a short time to settle.
                    Supposing now that a pure soap without resin is to be made—a product little seen
                    in the market—the spent lye is run off, steam is again turned on, pure water or
                    very weak lye run in, and the contents boiled up till the whole is thin, close,
                    and clear. The soap is from this again grained off or salted out, and the
                    underlye so thrown down carries with it coloured impurities which may have been
                    in the materials or which arise from contact with the boiler. Such washing
                    process may have to be repeated several times when impure materials have been
                    used. The spent lye of the washing being drained off, the soap now receives its
                    strengthening boil. Steam is turned on, and, the mass being brought to a clear
                    condition with weak lye or water, strong lye is added and the boiling continued
                    with close steam till the lye attains such a state of concentration that the
                    soap is no longer soluble in it, and it will separate from the caustic lye as
                    from a common salt solution. The contents of the pan are once more allowed to
                    cool and settle, and the soap as now formed constitutes a pure curd soap,
                    carrying with it some proportion of uncombined alkali, but containing the
                    minimum amount of water. It may be skimmed off the underlye and placed direct in
                    the frames for solidification; but that is a practice scarcely at all followed,
                    the addition of resin soap in the pan and the subsequent “crutching in” of
                    silicate of soda and adulterant mixings being features common to the
                    manufacture. The lye from the strengthening boil contains much alkali and is
                    used in connexion with other boilings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mottled Soap.—</hi> A pure curd soap always carries with it
                    into the cooling frame a considerable amount of coloured impurity, such as iron
                    sulphate, &amp;c. When it is permitted to cool rapidly the colouring matter
                    remains uniformly disseminated throughout the mass; but when means are taken to
                    cause the soap to cool and solidify slowly a segregation takes place: the
                    stearate and palmitate form a semi - crystalline solid, while the oleate,
                    solidifying more slowly, comes by itself into translucent veins, in which the
                    greater part of the coloured matter is drawn. In this way mottled or marbled
                    soap is formed, and such mottled appearance was formerly highly valued as an
                    indication of freedom from excess of water or other adulteration, because in
                    fitted soaps the impurities are either washed out or fall to the bottom of the
                    mass in cooling. Now, however, the most perfect mottle can be produced by
                    working colouring matter into the soap in the frame, and mottling is very far
                    from being a certificate of excellence of quality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Yellow Soap</hi> consists of a mixture of any hard fatty soap
                    with a variable proportion—up to 40 per cent. or more—of resin soap. That
                    substance by itself has a tenacious gluey consistence, and its intermixture in
                    excess renders the resulting compound soft and greasy. The ordinary method of
                    adding resin consists in stirring it in small fragments into the fatty soap in
                    the stage of clear-boiling; but a better result is obtained by separately
                    preparing a fatty soap and the resin soap, and combining the two in the pan
                    after the underlye has been salted out and removed from the fatty soap. The
                    compound then receives its strengthening boil, after which it is fitted by
                    boiling with added water or weak lye, continuing the boil till by examination of
                    a sample the proper consistency has been reached. On settling a dark-coloured
                    “nigger” or underlye separates out, which, because it contains some soap and
                    alkali, is saved for future use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Marine Soap.—</hi> Cocoa-nut oil behaves as regards
                    saponification quite differently from all other oils and fats in relation to the
                    caustic alkalis. It does not form an emulsion with weak alkalis; these even
                    under prolonged boiling have no influence on the fat. With strong alkaline
                    solutions, on the other hand, it saponifies with the utmost readiness even
                    without heat, and forms without the separation of any underlye a soap of stiff
                    firm consistence notwithstanding the presence of a very large percentage of
                    water. Such soap is not insoluble in a strong solution of salt; hence it forms a
                    lather and can be used for washing with sea-water, from which peculiarity it
                    derives its name “marine soap.” Being thus soluble in salt water it cannot of
                    course be salted out like common soaps; but if a very concentrated salt solution
                    is used precipitation is effected, and a curd soap is separated so hard and
                    refractory as to be practically useless. Cocoa-nut soap is usually prepared by
                    the so-called cold method, in which the fat heated to 80° C. is treated with a
                    calculated quantity of caustic soda solution of sp. gr. 1∙350, the two
                    constituents being stirred together till the setting and hardening of the
                    combination prevents further agitation. The property that cocoa-nut soap
                    possesses of absorbing large proportions of water, and yet presenting the
                    appearance of a hard solid body, makes the material a favourite basis for highly
                    sophisticated compounds, in which water, sulphate of soda, and other alkaline
                    solutions, soluble silicates, fuller’s earth, starch, &amp;c., play an important
                    and bulky part. Cocoa-nut soap is little prepared by itself; but it forms a
                    principal ingredient in compound soaps meant to imitate curd and yellow soaps.
                    Two principal methods of preparing such compound soaps are employed. In the
                    first way the ordinary oil and the cocoa-nut oil are mixed and saponified
                    together with such a measured quantity of alkaline solution as serves to produce
                    a hard soap without any salting out or separation of underlye. According to the
                    second plan, the ordinary oil is treated as for the preparation of a curd soap,
                    and to this the cocoa-nut soap separately saponified is added in the pan and
                    both are boiled together till they form a homogeneous soap.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Silicate Soaps.—</hi> A further means of enabling a soap to
                    contain large proportions of water and yet present a firm consistence is found
                    in the use of silicate of soda. The silicate in the form of a concentrated
                    solution is crutched or stirred into the soap in a mechanical mixing machine
                    after the completion of the saponification, and it appears to enter into a
                    distinct chemical combination with the soap. While silicate soaps bear heavy
                    watering, the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n219/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0219-0204"/> soluble silicate itself is a powerful detergent,
                    and it possesses certain advantages when used with hard waters, so that, taking
                    its cheapness into account, the question whether its introduction into soap is a
                    fraud may be fairly discussed and much said in its defence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Framing.—</hi> The frames into which hard soaps are ladled for
                    cooling and solidification consist of rectangular boxes made of iron plates and
                    bound and clamped together in a way that allows the sides to be removed when
                    required. The solidification is a very gradual process, depending, of course,
                    for its completion on the size of the block; but before cutting into bars it is
                    essential that the whole should be set and hardened through and through, else
                    the cut bars would not hold together. Many ingenious devices for forming bars
                    have been produced; but generally a strong frame is used, across which steel
                    wires are stretched at distances equal to the size of the bars to be made, the
                    blocks being first cut into slabs and then into bars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soft Soap.—</hi> As already said, soft soaps are made with
                    potash lyes, although in practice a small quantity of soda is also used to give
                    the soap some consistence. There is no separation of underlyes in potash soap,
                    consequently the product contains the whole constituents of the oils used, as
                    the operation of salting out is quite impracticable owing to the double
                    decomposition which results from the action of salt, producing thereby a hard
                    principally soda soap with formation of chloride of potassium. Owing to this
                    circumstance it is impossible to “fit” or in any way purify soft soap, and all
                    impurities which go into the pan of necessity enter into the finished product.
                    The making of soft soap, although thus a much less complex process than hard
                    soap making, is one that demands much skill and experience for its success. From
                    the conditions of the manufacture care must be taken to regulate the amount and
                    strength of the alkali in proportion to the oil used, and the degree of
                    concentration to which the boiling ought to be continued has to be determined
                    with close observation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Toilet Soaps,</hi> &amp;c.—Soaps used in personal ablution in
                    no way differ from the soaps previously alluded to, and may consist of any of
                    the varieties. It is of consequence that they should, as far as possible, be
                    free from excess of alkali and all other salts and foreign ingredients which may
                    have an injurious effect on the skin. The manufacturer of toilet soap generally
                    takes care to present his wares in convenient form and of agreeable appearance
                    and smell; the more weighty duty of having them free from uncombined alkali is
                    in many cases entirely overlooked. Transparent soaps are prepared by dissolving
                    ordinary soap in strong alcohol and distilling off the greater portion of the
                    alcohol till the residue comes to the condition of a thick transparent jelly.
                    This, when cast into forms and allowed to harden and dry slowly, comes out as
                    transparent soap. A class of transparent soap may also be made by the cold
                    process, with the use of cocoa-nut oil, castor oil, and sugar. It generally
                    contains a large amount of uncombined alkali, and that, with its unpleasant
                    odour of cocoa-nut oil, makes it a most undesirable soap for personal use.
                    Toilet soaps of common quality are perfumed by simple melting and stirring into
                    the mass some cheap odorous body that is not affected by alkalis under the
                    influence of heat. The finer soaps are perfumed by the cold method; the soap is
                    shaved down to thin slices, and the essential oil kneaded into and mixed with it
                    by special machinery, after which it is formed into cakes by pressure in
                    suitable moulds.</p>
                <p>Glycerin soap ordinarily consists of about equal parts of pure hard soap and
                    glycerin (the latter valuable for its emollient properties). The soap is melted
                    by heat, the glycerin is stirred in, and the mixture strained and poured into
                    forms, in which it hardens but slowly into a transparent mass. With excess of
                    glycerin a fluid soap is formed, soap being soluble in that body, and such fluid
                    soap has only feeble lathering properties. Soap containing small proportions of
                    glycerin, on the other hand, forms a very tenacious lather, and when soap
                    bubbles of an enduring character are desired glycerin is added to the solution.
                    Soaps are also prepared in which large proportions of fine sharp sand, or of
                    powdered pumice, are incorporated, and these substances, by their abrading
                    action, powerfully assist the detergent influence of the soap on hands much
                    begrimed by manufacturing operations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    soaps for external use are only employed in cases of skin ailments and as

                    carbonate of potash, the whole being made into a stiff paste with water.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Soap Analysis.—</hi> Here it will be sufficient to mention a
                    few tests which can be executed without special chemical knowledge. To determine
                    the water in a soap—a most important question—a few thin slices are weighed and
                    dried in a stove at 105°C. so long as loss of weight continues. The loss of
                    weight is the measure of uncombined water in the sample. Added salts, such as
                    alkaline silicates, sulphates, &amp;c. and insoluble earthy admixtures are
                    detected by boiling a sample with alcohol, in which only the soap proper
                    dissolves. The residue is collected in a filter, washed with hot alcohol, and
                    weighed. An excessive proportion of surplus alkali can be detected by dissolving
                    the soap in hot water and adding a sufficiency of saturated solution of common
                    salt to salt it out. The alkali remains in solution and can be determined by the
                    amount of a standard acid solution it neutralizes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> Marseilles has long been recognized as the most
                    important centre of the soap trade, a position that city originally achieved
                    through its ready command of the supplies of olive oil. The city is still very
                    favourably situated for obtaining supplies of oils both local and foreign,
                    including sesame, ground nut, castor oil, &amp;c. In England the soap trade did
                    not exist till the 16th century. In the reign of Charles I. a monoply of
                    soap-making was farmed to a corporation of soap-boilers in London,—a proceeding
                    which led to serious complications. From 1712 to 1853 an excise duty ranging
                    from 1d. to 3d. was levied on soap made in the United Kingdom, and that heavy
                    impost (equal when 3d. to more than 100 per cent.) greatly impeded the
                    development of the industry. In 1793, when the excise duty was 2 ¼ d. on hard
                    and 1 ¾ d. on soft soap, the revenue yielded was a little over £400,000; in 1815
                    it was almost £750,000; in 1835, when the duty was levied at 1 ½ d. and 1d.
                    respectively (and when a drawback was allowed for soap used in manufactures),
                    the revenue was almost £1,000,000; and in 1852, the last year in which the duty
                    was levied, it amounted to £1,126,046, with a drawback on exportation amounting
                    to £271,000. What the manufacture has risen to since that time there is no
                    accurate way of estimating. (W. D.—J. PA.)</p>
