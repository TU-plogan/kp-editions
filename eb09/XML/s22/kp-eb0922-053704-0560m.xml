                    have other helps for distinguishing prominences of small parts besides those by
                    which we distinguish distances in general, as to their degrees of light and
                    shade, and the prospect we have round them. Again, by the parallax, on account
                    of the distance betwixt our eyes, we can distinguish, besides the front part,
                    the two sides of a near object not thicker than the said distance, and this
                    gives a visible rilievo to such objects, which helps greatly to raise or detach
                    them from the plane in which they lie. Thus the nose on a face is the more
                    remarkably raised by our seeing both sides of it at once.” This was undoubtedly
                    a considerable step towards a sound theory of binocular vision, but it cannot be
                    said to have anticipated the invention of the stereoscope. This instrument owes
                    its origin entirely to the experimental researches of Sir Charles Wheatstone on
                    binocular vision, and the following passage from Mayo’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Outlines of Human Physiology,</hi> p. 288, published in 1833, is the first
                    clear enunciation of the principle on which it is constructed:—“A solid object,
                    being so placed as to be regarded by both eyes, projects a different perspective
                    figure on each retina; now if these two perspectives be actually copied on
                    paper, and presented one to each eye, so as to fall on corresponding parts, the
                    original solid figure will be apparently reproduced in such a manner that no
                    effort of the imagination can make it appear as a representation on a plane
                    surface.” Sir Charles Wheatstone’s “Contributions to the Physiology of Vision,
                    Part the First” appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> of 1838, but this paper was the result of investigations
                    extending over a period of years, and there is evidence that reflecting
                    stereoscopes were constructed for Wheatstone by Newman, a well-known
                    philosophical instrument maker, so early as the winter of 1832. Wheatstone no
                    doubt also, as early as 1845, employed photographic pictures for his reflecting
                    stereoscope. The subject was taken up by Sir David Brewster, and was developed
                    more particularly in two papers read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
                    January 1843 and April 1844. These researches led Brewster to the invention of
                    the lenticular or refracting stereoscope. The discoveries of Daguerre and
                    Talbot, and the rapid development of the art of photography, enabled photographs
                    to be taken suitable for the stereoscope, thus superseding the geometrical
                    drawings previously employed, and in 1849 Duboscq, a Parisian optician, began
                    the manufacture of lenticular stereoscopes and executed a series of binocular
                    daguerrotypes of living individuals, statues, bouquets of flowers, and objects
                    of natural history. For many years the refracting stereoscope of Brewster was
                    one of the most popular of scientific instruments, and was to be found, along
                    with an appropriate collection of pictures, in every drawing-room, but of late
                    years it has somewhat fallen into the background, and the manufacture by
                    photographers of stereoscopic views now forms but a small portion of their work.
                    Whilst much credit is due to Brewster for his writings on binocular vision, and
                    for the efforts he made to introduce the stereoscope to the public, there is no
                    doubt that Wheatstone was not only the real inventor of the instrument but he
                    also laid down in his paper published in 1838, and in a second contribution

                <p>When we look at an external object with both eyes it is seen generally as a
                    single object, although there must be two retinal pictures, one for each eye.
                    This depends on the fact that the excitation of certain associated spots on the
                    two retinae is referred to the same point in space, or, in other words, that the
                    luminous impression which originates by the irritation of two associated points
                    appears as one point in the visual field. Such associated points or areas of the
                    retina are said to be corresponding or identical. When an object is seen single
                    by two eyes, the two images must fall on corresponding points of the retina. If
                    one eye be pushed to the side, the image on the retina of that eye is displaced
                    from its appropriate identical point, and a double image is the result. Now the
                    term <hi rend="italic">horopter</hi> is applied to represent an imaginary
                    surface containing “all those points of the outer world from which rays of light
                    passing to both eyes fall upon identical points of the retina, the eyes being in
                    a certain position.” The horopter varies with the different positions of the
                    eyes (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eye,</hi> vol. viii. p. 826). But it is a
                    familiar experience that we not only see a single object with two eyes, but the
                    object, say a cube or a book lying on the table, is seen in relief, that is, we
                    take cognizance of the third dimension occupied by the body in space, although
                    the two retinal pictures are on a plane. It is clear that the two images of the
                    object which do not coincide with the horopter cannot be completely united so as
                    to furnish one single visual impression. Further, it can readily be demonstrated
                    that the two retinal pictures are dissimilar, and yet the two images are fused
                    into one and give the impression of a single object occupying three dimensions.
                    To explain these phenomena, Wheatstone put forward the theory that the mind
                    completely fused the dissimilar pictures into one, and that whenever there
                    occurs such complete mental fusion of images really dissimilar, and incapable of
                    mathematical coincidence, the result is a perception of depth of space, or
                    solidity, or relief. The objection to this theory as stated by Wheatstone is
                    that complete fusion does not take place. It is always possible by close
                    analysis of visual perceptions to distinguish between the two retinal pictures.
                    Further, if the fusion is mental, as stated by Wheatstone, it is an example of
                    unconscious cerebration. Another explanation has been suggested by Brücke.<note

                    attributed to Brücke, but something very similar to it was taught by Brewster.
                    Brewster, however, did not attach importance to muscular sensations as an
                    element in the question, and was content with pointing out that, in looking at
                    the stereoscopic pictures of a bust, for example, “the eyes will instantly, by
                    means of their power of convergence, unite the separated points of the eyes, and
                    then the still more separated points of the ears, running over each part of the
                    bust with the rapidity of lightning, and uniting all the corresponding points in
                    succession, precisely as it does in looking at the bust itself.” See his article
                    “Stereoscope,” in <hi rend="italic">Encyc. Britan.,</hi> 8th ed., vol. xx. p.
                    689.</p></note> When we look at objects near at hand the optic axes are
                    converged strongly, and they become less and less converged as we gaze at
                    objects farther and farther away. There is thus a series of axial adjustments,
                    the necessary muscular movements giving rise to definite sensations, by which we
                    estimate the relative distance of objects in the field of view. A man with one
                    eye cannot judge by this method. We habitually depend upon binocular vision for
                    the guidance of all such movements as require an exact estimate of the
                    respective proximity of two or more objects. “A very good test experiment is to
                    suspend a curtain ring in such a manner as to present its edge at the distance
                    of four or five feet from the eye, and then to try to push sideways through its
                    hoop the curved handle of a walking stick held by the lower end; in this<pb

                    guidance of binocular vision, large odds may be laid that success will not be
                    attained when one eye is closed, until a succession of trials shall have enabled
                    the experimenter to measure the distance of the ring by the muscular movements
                    of his arm.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Carpenter,
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> 1858.</p></note> According to Brücke,
                    the two eyes are continually in a state of motion, and their position of
                    convergence, now greater now less, passes from one side to the other, so that
                    the observer combines successively the different parts of the two pictures, thus
                    giving rise to sensations of depth of space and of subjects standing out in
                    relief. Brücke’s theory, in short, is that our perception of depth depends on
                    the fusion of muscular sensations, or rather of nervous impressions arising from
                    the muscles of the eyeballs. It was, however, pointed out by Dove that the
                    sensation of relief, solidity, or perspective is perfect even when natural
                    objects or stereoscopic pictures are seen momentarily by an electric flash
                    lasting only <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 24,000</hi>
                    of a second during which time it is inconceivable that there can be any change
                    in the degree of convergence of the optic axes. This experiment is fatal to
                    Brücke’s theory, and Wheatstone was right in asserting that the sensation of
                    relief is instantaneous. A third theory is that of Joseph Le Conte, advanced in
                    1871, and thus stated by himself :—“All objects or points of objects either
                    beyond or nearer than the point of sight are doubled, but differently,—the
                    former homonymously, the latter heteronymously. The double images in the former
                    case are united by less convergence, in the latter case by greater convergence,
                    of the optic axes. Now, the observer knows instinctively and without trial, in
                    any case of double images, whether they will be united by greater or less optic
                    convergence, and therefore never makes a mistake, or attempts to unite by making
                    a wrong movement of the optic axes. In other words, the eye (or the mind)
                    instinctively distinguishes homonymous from heteronymous images, referring the
                    former to objects beyond, and the latter to objects this side of, the point of
                    sight.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">American Journal of Science and Arts,</hi> vol. ii.,
                    1871.</p></note> Thus, according to Le Conte, the mind perceives relief <hi
                    rend="italic">instantly</hi> but not <hi rend="italic">immediately,</hi> and it
                    does so by means of double images. This theory does not possess the merit of
                    simplicity, and, whilst it may explain the phenomenon of relief as experienced
                    by those who have been specially trained to the analysis of visual perceptions,
                    it does not satisfactorily account for the experience of everyday life. We are
                    therefore obliged to fall back on the theory of Wheatstone, somewhat modified,
                    namely, that there are, behind the phenomena referred to the retina, psychical
                    operations, unconsciously performed, which fuse together the results of the
                    retinal impressions. In the language of Hermann, “corresponding points are
                    therefore such points as furnish images, which, as experience teaches, are
                    habitually combined or fused. But, as it appears necessary to effect these
                    combinations in order to obtain correct impressions of objects, we get into the
                    habit of fusing also the images of the two not perfectly corresponding points
                    which, under ordinary circumstances, we should perceive as double. It can easily
                    be demonstrated that simultaneous images which fall upon corresponding points
                    are not united, although it is true that they do not form second images. When
                    the mind must unite images which do not fall upon corresponding points, the
                    process must be associated with the conception that the corresponding points in
                    the object occupy the situation for which the eye would have to be arranged, in
                    order that the image should coincide.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>To obtain binocular pictures suitable for the stereoscope, the camera must be
                    placed successively in two points of the circum ference of a circle of which the
                    object is the centre, and the points at which the camera is so placed must have
                    the angular distance representing the convergence of the optic axes when the
                    object is to be viewed in the stereoscope. For example, if the pictures are to
                    be seen in the stereoscope at a distance of 8 inches before the eyes, the
                    convergence will be 18°, and the camera must be stationed at two points on the
                    circle at the same angular distance. This <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> of the
                    camera from the object only affects the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of the
                    picture. Usually two cameras are employed, fixed at the proper angular
                    positions. Wheatstone gives the following table of the inclination of the optic
                    axes at different distances, and it also shows “the angular positions of the
                    camera required to obtain binocular pictures which shall appear at a given
                    distance in the stereoscope in their true relief.”</p>

                <p>Suppose two stereoscopic pictures thus taken are presented to the two eyes; it is
                    possible by an effort so to converge the eyes as to throw the images on
                    corresponding points, and when this is done the objects are seen in relief (fig.
                    1).</p>
                <p>Such an effort, however, soon causes fatigue, and few persons can so control
                    their eyes and keep them in the forced position as to view the pictures in their
                    natural perspective with any comfort. The object of all stereoscopes is to throw
                    the two pictures on corresponding points with the eyes in an ordinary
                    position.</p>
                <p>The principle of Wheatstone’s reflecting stereoscope is illustrated in fig. 2. It
                    consisted of two plane mirrors, about 4 inches square, fixed in frames and so
                    adjusted that their backs form an angle of 90° with each other. These mirrors
                    are fixed to an upright against the middle line of a vertical board cut away so
                    as to allow the eyes to be placed be fore the mirrors. On each side there is a
                    panel bearing a groove above and below into which the correspond ing pictures
                    can be slid. Mechanical ar rangements also exist for the purpose of moving the
                    pictures to or from the mirrors and also for inclining the pictures at any angle
                    (fig. 3). There is one position in which the binocular image will be immediately
                    seen single, of its proper size, and without fatigue, “because in this position
                    only the ordinary relations between the magnitude ... .</p>
                <p>of the pictures in the retina, the inclination of the optic axes, and the
                    adaptation of the eve to distinct vision at different distances are preserved”
                    (Wheatstone). Although somewhat cumbrous, the reflecting stereoscope is a most
                    useful instrument, and enables one<pb break="no"

                    binocular vision than can be carried out easily with the more common form.</p>
                <p>Wheatstone also invented a form of stereoscope in which the pictures were brought
                    on corresponding points of the retina by refraction instead of by reflexion.
                    This had a form very like the ordinary stereoscope, but, instead of lenses in
                    the apertures to which the eyes are directed, it had “a pair of glass prisms
                    having their faces inclined 15° and their refractive angles turned towards each
                    other. . . . A pair of plate-glass prisms, their faces making with each other an
                    angle of 12°, will bring two pictures, the corresponding points of which are 2½
                    inches apart, to coincide at a distance of 12 inches, and a pair with an angle
                    of 15° will occasion coincidence at 8 inches.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The form of stereoscope generally used is that invented by Sir David Brewster,
                    and is known as the refracting stereoscope. The arrangement is shown
                    diagrammatically in fig. 4. Let the left eye be at A and the right at B; let <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the corresponding pic tures

                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, two prisms of glass. A prism
                    refracts rays of light so that the object seen through the prism appears to be
                    nearer to the refracting edge; the prism <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> therefore refracts the ray <hi rend="italic">ap</hi><hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A, as if it proceeded from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    The prism <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> refracts the ray
                    <hi rend="italic">bp</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> so that to the eye at B it
                    also appears to proceed from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The effect of this is
                    that the object really appears to be at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> And as the
                    points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> combine to form the
                    point <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, so <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi

                    rend="italic">i</hi> (Weinhold). This stereoscope consists of a pyramidal box
                    blackened inside and having a lid for the admission of light (fig.</p>
                <p>5). At the narrow end of the box are two tubes carrying the lenses. The tubes
                    move up and down to suit eyes of different focal lengths, and sometimes convex
                    or concave lenses are in serted over the prisms to meet the wants of
                    long-sighted or short sighted persons. Fig. 6</p>
                <p>shows the upper end of the stereoscope, with the lenses in position.</p>
                <p>A. Stroh (without knowing that H. Grubb had described the essentials of the
                    apparatus in 1879) has recently invented a new form of stereoscope based on the
                    well-known effects of the persistence of vision. Two stereoscopic pictures are
                    simultaneously projected by two lanterns on a screen so as to overlap, and disks
                    having suitable slits are rotated in front of the lan terns and also in front of
                    the eyes of the observer, in such a way that only one picture is thrown on the
                    screen at a time, and also that the view of the picture is seen with the right
                    and left eyes alternately. Further, the connexion between the disks is so
                    arranged that the time of obscuring the view of the observer’s right eye or left
                    eye coincides with the time when the light is shut off from the right or left
                    lantern, and thus the left eye sees the picture of the left lantern and the
                    right eye that of the right lantern. The two eyes never see at the same time,
                    and each eye views its picture after the other, but the impressions come so fast
                    as to be fused in consciousness, and the result is, the image stands out “in
                    solid relief” (<hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> No. 244, vol. xl., April
                    1, 1886).</p>
                <p>During his researches into the physiology of vision, Wheatstone was led to study
                    what he termed conversions of relief. Sometimes when we look at a geometrical
                    figure such as a cube or rhomboid it may be imagined to represent one of two
                    dissimilar figures. In fig. 7 the rhomboid AX is drawn so that the solid angle A
                    should be seen nearest, and solid angle X farthest, and face ABCD foremost,
                    while XDC is behind. Look steadily and the posi tion will change: X will appear
                    nearest, solid angle</p>
                <p>A farthest; face ACDB will recede behind XDC.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The effects are most obvious when seen with one eye, and “no illusion of this
                    kind can take place when an object of three dimensions is seen with both eyes
                    while the optic axes make a sensible angle with each other, because the
                    appearance of two dissimilar figures, one to each eye, prevents the possibility
                    of mistake” (Wheatstone). The conversion of a cameo into an intaglio and of an
                    intaglio into a cameo is a well-known instance of this illusion. Wheatstone
                    observed the conversion of relief exhibited by binocular pictures in the
                    stereoscope when they are transposed, reflected, or inverted, and this led him
                    to the invention of the <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscope,</hi> an instrιιment which
                    conveys to the mind false perceptions of all external objects. “Two rectangular
                    prisms of flint glass, the faces of which are 1·2 inch square, are placed in a
                    frame with their hypo-thenuses parallel and 2·1 inches from each other; each
                    prism has a motion on an axis corresponding with the angle nearest the eyes,
                    that they may be adjusted so that their bases may have any inclination towards
                    each other” (Wheatstone’s <hi rend="italic">Scientific Papers,</hi> p. 275). In
                    fig. 8 there is a diagram of the instrument. If a spherical surface be exa mined
                    with this instrument, it will appear hollow; whilst a hollow surface will appear
                    convex. It is remarkable, however, that the converting powers of this instrument
                    are greatest where the new forms can be conceived without effort. Thus a cameo
                    and an intaglio, a plaster cast in relief and its mould, or any object similar
                    in its op posite reliefs is at once changed by the pseudoscope into the converse
                    form. As pointed out by Dr Carpenter, by gazing we can reverse the interior of a
                    mask so as to see the countenance stand out in relief; it is more difficult to
                    throw the features of a bust into the shape of a mould; whilst it is impossible
                    to effect any conversion upon the features of the living face. “The op tical
                    change is identically the same in its nature in every one of these cases; and
                    there is nothing in the form of the features which refuses to present a
                    converse, this converted shape being presented by the mask; but the mind, which
                    will admit the conception of the converted form when suggested by the inanimate
                    mask or bust, is steeled by its previous experience against the notion that
                    actual flesh and blood can undergo such a metamorphosis’’(Car penter, <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Re</hi><hi rend="italic">view,</hi> 1858, p. 460).</p>
                <p>A little consideration will show that the pictures of objects placed at a great
                    distance from the eye are practically if not wholly identical. Here there is
                    scarcely any stereoscopic<pb break="no"

                    as in a picture. To obtain a stereoscopic view of a landscape Von Helmholtz
                    invented the <hi rend="italic">Telestereoscope,</hi> an instrument which places
                    as it were the point of view of both eyes wide apart. It consists of two mirrors
                    L and R, each of which projects its image upon <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> to which the eyes O and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> are
                    directed. The eyes O and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> are placed as it were at O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, according to the distance between L and R; consequently two dissimilar
                    pictures arc obtained; these are mentally combined, with the result that the
                    landscape is seen like a stereoscopic view.</p>
                <p>The principle of the stereoscope was successfully applied by Wenham in 1854 to
                    the construction of the binocular microscope. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Microscope</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 272), and also two papers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jour. Roy. Micr. Soc.,</hi> 1884 :—(1) “On the Mode of Vision with
                    Objectives of Wide Aperture,” by Prof. E. Abbe, p. 20; and (2) “On the
                    Physiology of Binocular Vision with the Microscope,” by Dr Carpenter, p. 486.
                    Prof. Abbe shows, however, that “oblique vision in the microscope is entirely
                    different from that in ordinary vision, inasmuch as there is no perspective, so
                    that we have no longer the dissimilarity which is the basis of the ordinary
                    stereoscopic effect, but an essentially different mode of dissimilarity between
                    the two pictures.” In the microscope there is no perspective foreshortening.
                    There is no difference in the outline of an object viewed under the microscope
                    by an axial or by an oblique pencil. There is simply a lateral displacement of
                    the image—an entirely different phenomenon to that which occurs in
                    non-microscopic vision. Thus, whilst the mode of formation of dissimilar
                    pictures in the binocular microscope is different from the production of
                    ordinary stereoscopic pictures, the brain mechanism by which they are so fused
                    as to give rise to sensations of solidity, depth, ∣and perspective is the same.
