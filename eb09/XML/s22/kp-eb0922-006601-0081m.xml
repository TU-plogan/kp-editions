                    (1779-1864), American chemist and geologist, was born in 1779 at Trumbull (then
                    called North Stratford), Connecticut. His father, Gold Selleck Silliman, was
                    brigadier-general in the war of the revolution, and had also held important
                    civil positions. The history of the family points to an Italian origin, but
                    Daniel Silliman, the first to settle in the United States, came from Holland.
                    Silliman received his early education at Fairfield, Connecticut, at that time
                    the residence of his father’s family, and in 1792 he entered Yale College, where
                    he graduated in 1796. He then studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1802,
                    while a tutor in Yale College, to which position he had been appointed in 1799.
                    In 1802 a professorship of chemistry and natural history was established in the
                    college, and he was at once elected to fill it. He spent portions of 1801 and
                    1802 in Philadelphia in preparation for his work, and the year 1804 he spent in
                    Europe, chiefly in England and Scotland, where he attended the lectures of Hope
                    and Gregory, and also formed the acquaintance of Davy, Wollaston, Brewster,
                    Leslie, and other eminent men of science. As a result of this visit he published
                    <hi rend="italic">A Journal of Travels in England, Holland, and Scotland, and of
                    Two Passages over the Atlantic in the years 1805 and 1806</hi> (2 vols., 1810),
                    which had a marked success. In 1813 he began service with the medical department
                    of Yale College as professor of chemistry and pharmacy, and continued to give
                    instruction there for many years. In 1818 he founded the <hi rend="italic"
                    >American Journal of Science and Arts,</hi> a periodical devoted to the physical
                    sciences, which has been, and is, the most important American scientific serial.
                    In 1851 he made a second journey to Europe, of which he likewise published an
                    account in two volumes, edited by his son, who had accompanied him. In 1853 he
                    became professor <hi rend="italic">emeritus,</hi> but he continued to lecture
                    for a year or two longer. His closing years were quietly spent in unabated
                    mental activity at New Haven until his death in 1864. Though devoted to
                    scientific pursuits, he interested himself in the public movements of the
                    time.</p>
                <p>One of Silliman’s earliest scientific publications was an account of the famous
                    meteorite which fell in Weston, Conn., December 14, 1807. This account, which
                    excited great public interest in the country, was reproduced abroad, and was
                    read before the Royal Society of London, and also before the French Academy.
                    Among his other scientific labours may be mentioned his experiments upon the
                    fusibility of various substances in the flame of the compound blowpipe of Hare,
                    then a novelty in science, and upon the vaporization and transference of the
                    carbon in the voltaic arc from the positive to the negative pole, which he was
                    the first to observe. He also repeated the experiment by which Gay-Lussac had
                    separated potassium from its hydrate, and obtained the element in its metallic
                    form, doubtless for the first time in the United States. Other professional
                    labours were an exploration of the coal formations of Pennsylvania in 1830, and
                    an examination of the gold mines of Virginia in 1836. In 1832 and 1833, by
                    appointment of the United States Government, he made a scientific investigation
                    of the culture and manufacture of sugar, embodying his results in a voluminous
                    report published by the Government. Though Silliman published a large number of
                    scientific papers upon chemical and geological subjects, his reputa tion was
                    more especially due to the courses of public lectures which he delivered in the
                    college and in various cities and towns of the United States. The happy
                    combination of a graceful and interesting style with unwonted splendour of
                    experimental illustration gave these lectures an unprecedented popularity, and
                    they exerted a powerful influence in awakening and developing a taste for
                    scientific matters throughout the country.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, Silliman published in 1808 an American
                    edition of Henry's <hi rend="italic">Chemistry,</hi> with notes, in 1827 an
                    edition of Bakewell's <hi rend="italic">Geology,</hi> and in 1830 <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Chemistry,</hi> in two volumes. An account of his
                    life, bv Prof. George P. Fisher, of Yale College, was published in two volumes
                    in 1866.</p>
