                <p><label type="entry">SIRENS</label>, fabulous creatures of Greek mythology, that,
                    like the Loreley of German legend, lured mariners to destruction by their sweet
                    song. In the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> Ulysses sails past their island;
                    but, warned by Circe, he had stopped the ears of his crew with wax and caused
                    himself to be bound to the mast. In Homer they are two in number, but in later
                    writers they are generally three, and are located on the coast of Italy, near
                    Sorrento and Capri, or on the Straits of Messina. The tomb of one of them,
                    Parthenope by name, was shown at Naples in Strabo’s time. A sanctuary of the
                    Sirens stood on a headland near Sorrento. According to Eratosthenes the Sirens
                    were a three-headed rock separating the Bay of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno;
                    but Strabo says they were three rocky islands on the southern side of the cape.
                    The cape itself (now Cape Campanella) was sometimes called the Cape of the
                    Sirens. When the Argonauts drew near the isle of the Sirens, Orpheus struck up
                    and drowned their song. According to Hyginus the Sirens were daughters of the
                    river Achelous and the muse Melpomene, and because they had not rescued
                    Proserpine from Pluto they were turned by Ceres into winged creatures, who were
                    to live only so long as no one passed by them as they sang. So, when Ulysses had
                    eluded them, they flung themselves into the sea. According to another story,
                    they were<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n113/mode/1up"

                    singing; the Muses were victorious, and plucked the feathers from the Sirens and
                    made crowns for themselves out of them. In art they are usually represented with
                    the bodies of women and the legs of birds, with or without wings. More rarely
                    they appear as birds with only the heads of women. They seem to have had a
                    funereal significance, and were often represented on tombs. For representations
                    of them see J. E. Harrison, <hi rend="italic">Myths of the Odyssey.</hi></p>
