                    awoke to the consciousness of her national unity; and he died before the
                    inevitable disintegration had begun. Among his friends were all the foremost men
                    of the day,—kings and princes like Hipparchus and Hiero and the Aleuadae and
                    Scopadae, statesmen like Pausanias and Themistocles, and poets like Aeschylus,
                    Epicharmus, and his own nephew Bacchylides. Pindar alone among his
                    contemporaries seems to have depreciated Simonides, perhaps not without a touch
                    of jealousy; by all the rest he was revered as the poet laureate of emancipated
                    Greece. He lived for the most part with his friends, whose praises he had sung
                    for money; we hear of him at the court of Hipparchus in Athens, with the
                    Scopadae in Thessaly, and finally at the court of Hiero of Syracuse, where he
                    died in 469 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>His reputation as a man of learning and ingenuity is shown by the tradition that
                    he added two new letters to the alphabet—η and ω—the truth being probably that
                    he was one of the first authors to use these symbols, before the archonship of
                    Euclides. So unbounded were his popularity and influence that he was felt to be
                    a power even in the political world; we are told that he reconciled Thero and
                    Hiero on the eve of a battle between their opposing armies. For his poems he
                    could command almost any price: later writers, from Aristophanes onwards, accuse
                    him of avarice, probably not without some reason. From the numerous anecdotes
                    preserved about him we see that he was what we should infer from his poems, a
                    genial and courtly man, “dwelling with flowers,—like the bee, seeking yellow
                    honey” (Fr. 47), yet not without a vein of gentle irony. To Hiero’s queen, who
                    asked him whether it was better to be born rich or a genius, he replied “Rich,
                    for genius is ever found at the gates of the rich.”</p>
                <p>Of his poetry we possess two or three short elegies (Fr. 85 seems from its style
                    and versification to belong to Simonides of Amorgos, or at least not to be the
                    work of our poet), several epigrams, and about ninety fragments of lyric poetry.
                    The epigrams, written in the usual dialect of elegy, Ionic with an epic
                    colouring, were intended partly for public and partly for private monuments.
                    There is strength and sublimity in the former, with a simplicity that is almost
                    statuesque, and a complete mastery over the rhythm and forms of elegiac
                    expression. Those on the heroes of Marathon and Thermopylae are the most
                    celebrated. In the private epigrams there is more warmth of colour and feeling,
                    but here it is hard to decide which are genuine and which spurious; few of them
                    rest on any better authority than that of the Palatine anthology. One
                    interesting and undoubtedly genuine epigram of this class is upon Archedice, the
                    daughter of Hippias the Pisistratid, who, “albeit her father and husband and
                    brother and children were all princes, was not lifted up in soul to pride.” The
                    lyric fragments vary much in character and length: one is from a poem on
                    Artemisium, and celebrates those who fell at Thermopylae; another is an ode in
                    honour of Scopas; the rest represent odes on victors in the games, hyporchemes,
                    dirges, hymns to the gods, and other varieties. The poem on Thermopylae is
                    reverent and sublime, breathing an exalted patriotism and a lofty national
                    pride; the others are full of tender pathos and deep feeling, such as evoked
                    from Catullus the line "Maestius lacrimis Simonideis,” with a genial worldliness
                    befitting one who had “seen the towns and learnt the mind of many men.” For
                    Simonides requires no standard of lofty unswerving rectitude. “It is hard,” he
                    says (Fr. 5), “to become a truly good man, perfect as a square in hands and feet
                    and mind, fashioned without blame.</p>
                <p>Whosoever is bad, and not too wicked, knowing justice, the benefactor of cities,
                    is a sound man. I for one will find no fault with him, for the race of fools is
                    infinite I praise and love all men who do no sin willingly; but with necessity
                    even the gods do not contend.” Virtue, he tells us elsewhere in language that
                    recalls Hesiod, is set on a high and difficult hill (Fr. 58); let us seek after
                    pleasure, for “all things come to one dread Charybdis, both great virtues and
                    wealth” (Fr. 38), and “what life of mortal man, or what dominion, is to be
                    desired apart from pleasure, without which even the gods’ existence is not to be
                    envied” (Fr. 71). Yet Simonides is far from being a hedonist; his morality, no
                    less than his art, is pervaded by that virtue for which Ceos was renowned— <hi
                    rend="italic">σωφροσύνη</hi> or self-restraint. His most celebrated fragment,
                    and one of the most exquisite and touching remains of ancient poetry, is a
                    dirge, in which Danae, adrift with the infant Perseus on the sea in a dark and
                    stormy night, takes comfort from the peaceful slumber of her babe. Simonides
                    here illustrates his own saying that “poetry is vocal painting, as painting is
                    silent poetry” (one of the opening remarks in Lessing’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laocoon)</hi>: from the picture of the sleeping child, standing out as if in
                    relief against the background of surging waves, and Danae in tears, we can well
                    understand how Longinus should have commended this power of vivid presentation
                    as a distinguishing feature in another of Simonides’s poems. This poem has been
                    often translated. One of the best translations is that by Symonds, in the first
                    series of his <hi rend="italic">Studies on the Greek Poets.</hi></p>

                    Cean Simonides from those of his namesake. Sterling <hi rend="italic">(Essays
