                <p><label type="entry">SYRIA</label>. Etymologically, “Syria” is merely an
                    abbreviation of “Assyria,” a name which covered the subject-lands of the
                    Assyrian empire, the subject-peoples being also called “Syrians.” Afterwards, in
                    the Graeco-Roman period, the shorter word came to be restricted to the territory
                    west of the Euphrates,—the designation “Syrians,” however, being given to the
                    great mass of the Semitic populations dwelling between the Tigris and the
                    Mediterranean, who are more accurately called Aramaeans (Gen. x. 22; comp. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Semitic Languages,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 645 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> The present article deals with Syria only in its geographical
                    significance. For a map, see vol. xvi. pl. VIII.</p>
                <p>Syria is the designation of the country which extends for about 380 miles
                    (between 36° 5' and 31° N. lat.) along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean;
                    its eastern limit properly speaking is formed by the middle portion of the
                    course of the Euphrates, but in point of fact it insensibly merges into the
                    steppe country which naturally belongs more or less to Arabia. It is only the
                    oases lying nearest the western border of the steppe (<hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g</hi>., Aleppo, Palmyra) that can be reckoned as belonging to Syria.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the cuneiform inscriptions
                    Syria is called <hi rend="italic">Mát Haiti, “</hi> the land of the Cheta,” a
                    designation transferred from the north Syrian people of that name (see below) to
                    the region as a whole; <hi rend="italic">Mat Aharri,</hi> the “hinder” or
                    “western” land, denotes more properly the southern portion, but is also used for
                    the whole. By the Arabs it is called <hi rend="italic">Esh-Shám.</hi> (more
                    properly <hi rend="italic">Esh-Sha'm),</hi> “the land on the left hand,” as
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Yemen,</hi> “the land on the right”; but
                    the designation originally implied a wider region than the Syria defined above,
                    including as it did a portion of Arabia.</p></note> From time immemorial the
                    land between Egypt and the Euphrates has been the battlefield for the empires of
                    western Asia on the one hand and those of Egypt and Africa on the other. It has
                    also been the territory which the trading caravans of these empires have had to
                    traverse; and by its position on the Mediterranean it has been the medium for
                    transmitting the civilizing influences of the East to the West and again of the
                    West to the East. Hence it is easy to understand how the peoples of Syria should
                    only in exceptional cases have played an independent part either in politics or
                    in art and science; none the less on that account is their place in history one
                    of the highest interest and importance.</p>
                <p>The surface configuration of the country is a uniform one; the mountains for the
                    most part stretch from north to south in parallel ridges, connecting the
                    Cilician Taurus with the Red Sea range. The continuity is broken for short
                    intervals at one or two points. Immediately connected with the Cilician Taurus
                    in the north, and forming part of it, is the Alma Dagh (ancient Amanus). At its
                    highest it does not rise much above 6000 feet, but it has an abrupt descent
                    towards the sea, and terminates at its southern extremity in a bold headland,
                    the Rás el-Khanzír. Here the Orontes reaches the sea through a depression in the
                    chain, and the same outlet forms an important pass into the interior of the
                    country. Frequently in ancient times it was only the territory to the south of
                    the lower Orontes valley that was reckoned as constituting Syria. Farther south
                    is the isolated Jebel Akra', about 6000 feet high (the Mons Casius of the
                    ancients), which was held sacred by the Phoenicians; still farther to the south
                    are the low Ansairi Hills, which derive their name from the people inhabiting
                    them. Beyond those the Nahr el-Kebír (Eleu-</p>
                <p>therus) falls into the sea, and here north Syria may be held to terminate. To the
                    south of this begins the Lebanon district (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lebanon,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 393); an imaginary line drawn eastwards from a point
                    a little to the south of Tyre will represent the southern boundary of what may
                    be designated as middle Syria. Occasionally Syria is spoken of in a narrow
                    sense, as distinguished from Palestine; but there is no scientific ground for
                    such a practice, for the mountains of <hi rend="smallcaps">Palestine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the southern third of Syria, can be described as a
                    southward continuation of the mountain masses already referred to, and
                    cis-Jordanie as well as trans-Jordanie Palestine is simply a portion of Syria.
                    Indeed the district as far as Sinai can be spoken of as a fourth division of the
                    same country. A glance at a geological map reveals this very clearly. Cretaceous
                    limestone constitutes the bulk of the hills and plateaus of Syria, and extends
                    towards Sinai, where the zone of primitive rocks is reached. In the south of
                    Palestine, nummulitic limestone and Nubian sandstone make their appearance from
                    Sinai and northern Arabia. In addition to these, alluvial soils are principally
                    met with. In middle Syria especially, eastwards from the upper course of the
                    Jordan, great basaltic masses occur; in the Hauran (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bashan,</hi> vol. iii. p. 410) there are basalt peaks nearly 6000 feet in
                    height. The basalt mountains are often much broken up so as to be quite
                    inaccessible (Harra); but the basalt when decomposed forms the best of arable
                    soils. It is only in isolated cases that the igneous formation extends into
                    western Syria. The tableland to the east of the principal mountain chains
                    consists partly of good clay soil; the steppe <hi rend="italic">(bádiyet
                    esh-sham,</hi> also called <hi rend="italic">hamád),</hi> which has an average
                    elevation of about 1800 feet, extends towards the Euphrates with a gradual
                    slope.</p>
                <p>The direction of the principal valleys is determined by that of the mountains.
                    The chief river of Syria in the narrower sense is the Orontes (Arabic <hi
                    rend="italic">El-'Asi),</hi> which rises in the Beká', the mountain valley
                    between Libanus and Antilibanus, and follows a northerly course. At Antioch,
                    where it is augmented by the stream which flows from the great lake of Ak Deniz,
                    it turns westwards, falling into the sea near the ancient Seleucia. Not far from
                    the source of the Orontes is that of the Lítáni (formerly Líta), which runs
                    southwards through the Beká', and afterwards westwards through a deep gorge of
                    its own excavation, having its mouth a little to the north of Tyre; in its lower
                    course it bears the name of El-Kásimíye. The principal river of south Syria is
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jordan</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Like it, most
                    of the other streams of Syria rising on the eastern side of the watershed
                    terminate in inland lakes. Of these may be named the El-A'waj and the Barada
                    (Pharpar and Abana) of Damascus, which lose themselves in the lakes and marshes
                    to the east of the city. In like manner the river of Aleppo falls into the lake
                    El-Math. The 'Afrína (Ufrenus of the ancients) falls into the Ak Deniz lake, and
                    so into the Orontes; the Sádjúr is a tributary of the Euphrates. Other lakes are
                    the great salt lake to the south-east of Aleppo and the remarkable lake near
                    Homs, in the neighbourhood of which the ruins of the old Hittite city of Kadesh
                    have recently been discovered. The coastal streams have been enumerated under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Lebanon</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Palestine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>Two distinct floral regions meet in Syria (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lebanon).</hi> That of the coast is Mediterranean, and is characterized by a
                    number of evergreen shrubs, with small leathery leaves, and of quickly flowering
                    spring plants. On the coast of Phcenicia (comp. vol. xviii. p. 801) and
                    southwards towards Egypt more southern forms of the same vegetation occur, as,
                    for example, <hi rend="italic">Ficus Sycomorus,</hi> and especially date-palms.
                    This region is separated from the easterly one, that of the steppe flora, by the
                    ridge of Lebanon and the mountains of Palestine. It is distinguished by the
                    variety of its species, by the dry and thorny character of its shrubs, and by
                    its marked poverty in trees. The Jordan valley has on account of its low level a
                    sub-tropical character. As regards cultivated species, Syria is the home of the
                    olive tree, which, like the vine, is found in all parts; but the white mulberry
                    for silk is limited to a small district. Syria is throughout far from unfertile;
                    the district of the Hauran is one magnificent corn-field, while the orchard land
                    about Damascus is renowned far and wide. In former times, however, cultivation
                    was carried on with much greater zeal, and the arrangements for irrigation—a
                    necessity everywhere, especially on the side bordering on the steppe—were much
                    more considerable and more carefully seen to. The numerous ruins on the lands
                    at<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n857/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0857-0822"/> present under cultivation and still more on those
                    to the east of them indicate that the limits of agriculture were once more
                    extensive and the population much denser than at present. During the Roman
                    period frontier fortresses on the edge of the steppe served to check the
                    rapacity and barbarizing influence of the Bedouin hordes.</p>
                <p>Syria presents great diversities of climate. The mountains, though sometimes not
                    absolutely very high, arrest the west winds blowing from the Mediterranean, so
                    that the atmospheric precipitation is much greater on the western than on the
                    eastern slopes. Hence the springs on the eastern versant are fewer, and
                    cultivation is therefore confined to isolated areas resembling oases. The
                    rainfall drains off with great rapidity, the beds of the streams soon drying up
                    again. Within historic times the climate, and with it the productivity of the
                    country, cannot have greatly changed; at most the precipitation may have been
                    greater, the area under wood having been more extensive. Except for Jerusalem,
                    we have hardly any accurate meteorological observations; there the mean annual
                    temperature is about 63° Fahr.; in Beyrout it is about 68°. The rainfall in
                    Jerusalem is 36·22 inches, in Beyrout 21·66. The heat at Damascus and Aleppo is
                    great, the cooling winds being kept off by the mountains. Frost and snow are
                    occasionally experienced among the mountains and on the inland plateaus, but
                    never along the coast. Even the steppe exhibits great contrasts of temperature;
                    there the rainfall is slight and the air exceedingly exhilarating and healthy.
                    The sky is continuously cloudless from the beginning of May till about the end
                    of October; during the summer months the nights as a rule are dewy, except in
                    the desert. Rain is brought by the west wind; the north-west wind, which blows
                    often, moderates the heat. On the other hand, an ozoneless east wind (sirocco)
                    is occasionally experienced—especially during the second half of May and before
                    the beginning of the rainy season—which parches up everything and has a
                    prejudicial influence on both animal and vegetable life. On the whole the
                    climate of Syria—if the Jordan valley and the moister districts are excepted —is
                    not unhealthy, though intermittent fevers are not uncommon in some places.</p>
                <p>Of the political relations of Syria in ancient times we know but little. Each
                    town with its surrounding district seems to have constituted a small separate
                    state; the conduct of affairs naturally devolved upon the noble families. At a
                    very early period—as early probably as the 15th century B.c.—Syria became the
                    meetingplace of Egyptian and Babylonian elements, resulting in a type of western
                    Asiatic culture peculiar to itself, which through the commerce of the
                    Phoenicians was carried to the western lands of the Mediterranean basin.
                    Industry especially attained a high state of development; rich garments were
                    embroidered and glass and the like were manufactured. The extant inventories of
                    spoil carried off by the ancient conquerors include a variety of utensils and
                    stuffs. The influence exercised at all times on Syrian art by the powerful
                    neighbouring states is abundantly confirmed by all the recent finds. The Syrians
                    were more original in what related to religion: every place, every tribe, had
                    its “lord” (Ba'al) and its “lady” (Ba'alat); the latter is generally called
                    'Ashtar or 'Ashtaret. Besides the local Baal there were “the god of heaven” (El)
                    and other deities; human sacrifices as a means of propitiating the divine wrath
                    were not uncommon. But in the Syrian mythology foreign influences frequently
                    betray themselves. Over against its want of originality must be set the fact,
                    not merely that Syrian culture spread extensively towards the west, but that the
                    Syrians (as is shown by recently discovered inscriptions) long before the
                    Christian era exercised over the northern Arabs a perceptible influence, which
                    afterwards, about the beginning of tho 1st century, became much stronger through
                    the kingdom of the Nabataeans. The art of writing was derived by the Arabs from
                    the Syrians.</p>
                <p>Something about the ancient political and geographical relations of Syria can be
                    gleaned from Egyptian sources, especially in connexion with the campaigns of
                    Thothmes III. in western Asia. The Egyptians designated their Eastern neighbours
                    collectively as 'Amu. Syria up to and beyond the Euphrates is called more
                    precisely Sahi (or Zabi), and is regarded as consisting of the following parts
                    (1) Rutenu, practically the same as Palestine (occasionally Palestine with
                    Coelesyria is called Upper Rutenu, as distinguished from Lower Rutenu extending
                    to the Euphrates); (2) the land of the Cheta (sometimes reckoned as belonging to
                    Rutenu), with Kadesh on the Orontes as its capital; (3) Naharina, the land on
                    both sides of the Euphrates (extending, strictly speaking, beyond the Syrian
                    limits); (4) Kaftu, the coast land of the Phoenicians (Fenchu), along with
                    Cyprus. The Canaanites in general are called Chara. From these lands the
                    Egyptian kings often derived rich booty, so that in those days Syria must have
                    been civilized and prosperous. Moreover, we possess enumerations of towns in the
                    geographical lists of the temple of Karaak and in a hieratic papyrus dating
                    about 200 years after Thothmes III. Some of these names can be readily
                    identified, such as Aleppo, Kadesh, Sidon, and the like, as well as many in
                    Palestine. These materials, however, do not enable us to form even a moderately
                    clear conception of the condition of the country at that time. It is certain
                    that most of the cities are of very great antiquity. It appears that the Cheta
                    very probably were a non-Semitic people and that their power for a time extended
                    far beyond the Syrian limits. Their inscriptions have not yet been deciphered
                    with certainty. Within Syria their kingdom extended westwards from the middle
                    course of the Eu-</p>
                <p>phrates to the neighbourhood of Hamath; their capital appears to have been
                    Carchemish. The most prevalent opinion identifies Carchemish with Jerábís on the
                    Euphrates, an identification which is favoured by the recent discovery of
                    important “Hittite” monuments at the place. Before then the so-called “Hamath
                    stones” were the most important inscriptions of the Cheta we possessed, but
                    numerous others, as well as various other remains, are now at our command, and
                    show that the influence of the powerful Cheta kingdom extended far into Asia
                    Minor (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Hittites).</hi> The kingdom disappeared at
                    an early date, but some of the minor Cheta states continued to subsist down to
                    the 12th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>Next to the Cheta the Aramaeans were the people who held the most important towns
                    of Syria, gradually advancing until at last they occupied the whole country. Of
                    the Aramaean stocks named in Gen. x. 23, xxii. 21 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    very little is known, but it is certain that Aramaeans at an early period had
                    their abode close on the northern border of Palestine (in Maachah). A great part
                    was played in the history of Israel by the state of Aram Dammesek, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the territory of the ancient city of Damascus (see vol.
                    vi. p. 790); it was brought into subjection for a short time under David. The
                    main object of the century-long dispute between the two kingdoms was the
                    possession of the land to the east of the Jordan (Hauran, and especially
                    Gilead). Another Aramaean state often mentioned in the Bible is that of Aram
                    Zobah. That Zobah was situated within Syria is certain, though how far to the
                    west or north of Damascus is not known; in any case it was not far from Hamath.
                    Hamath in the valley of the Orontes, at the mouth of the Beká' valley, was from
                    an early period one of the most important places in Syria; according to the
                    Bible, its original inhabitants were Canaanites. The district belonging to it,
                    including amongst other places Riblah (of importance on account of its
                    situation), was not very extensive. In 733 B.C. Tiglath-Pileser II. compassed
                    the overthrow of the kingdom of Damascus; he also took Arpád (Tell Arfad), an
                    important place three hours to the north of Aleppo. Hamath was taken by Sargon
                    in 720. Henceforward the petty states of Syria were at all times subject to one
                    or other of the great world-empires, even if in some cases a certain degree of
                    independence was preserved.</p>
                <p>The foundation of numerous Greek cities shortly after Alexander’s time was of
                    great importance for Syria; <hi rend="smallcaps">Antioch</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> founded about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by Seleucus,
                    became the capital of the Syrian kingdom of the Seleucids. Among other
                    influential Greek towns were Apamea on the Orontes and Laodicea. The Seleucids
                    had severe struggles with the Ptolemies for the possession of the south-era part
                    of Syria (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 420).</p>
                <p>After having been reckoned for a short time (from 83 to 69 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c</hi>.) among the dominions of Tigranes, king of Armenia, the country was
                    conquered for the Romans by Pompey (64-63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). It is
                    impossible here to follow in detail the numerous changes in the distribution of
                    the territory and the gradual disappearance of particular dynasties which
                    maintained a footing for some time longer in Chalcis, Abila, Emesa, and
                    Palestine; but it is of special interest to note that the kingdom of the Arab
                    Nabataeans (comp. vol. xvii. p. 160) was able to subsist for a considerable
                    period towards the north as far as Damascus. In the year 40 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Syria had to endure a sudden but brief invasion by the Parthians. The
                    country soon became one of the most important provinces of the Roman empire; its
                    proconsulship was from the first regarded as the most desirable, and this
                    eminence became still more marked afterwards. Antioch, adorned with many
                    sumptuous buildings, as the chief town of the provinces of Asia, became in point
                    of size the third city of the empire; its port was Seleucia, surnamed Pieria.
                    The high degree of civilization then prevailing in the country is proved by its
                    architectural remains dating from the early Christian centuries; the
                    investigations of De Vogué have shown that from the 1st to the 7th century there
                    prevailed in north Syria and the Hauran a special style of architecture,—partly
                    no doubt following Graeco-Roman models, but also showing a great deal of
                    originality in details.</p>
                <p>The administrative divisions of Syria during the Roman period varied greatly at
                    different times; subjoined is an enumeration of them as they existed at the
                    beginning of the 5th century. (1) Syria Euphratensis, which had for its capital
                    Hierapolis (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Mabóg</hi>; Arab. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mambidj;</hi> Gr. B <hi rend="italic">αμβύκη).</hi> The kingdom of Commagene,
                    beyond the limits of Syria, belonged to Syria Euphratensis; its capital was
                    Samosata, at the point where the Euphrates leaves the mountains, and it had
                    other important towns on that river, such as Europus (the modern Barbalissus).
                    (2) Syria I., or Coelesyria, having Antioch as its capital. The name Coelesyria
                    (<hi rend="italic">ἡ κoιλὴ Συρία)</hi> originally, no doubt, was applied to the
                    valley between Libanus and Antilibanus, but was afterwards extended<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n858/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0858-0823"/> to the district stretching eastwards from the
                    latter range. (3) Syria II., or Syria Salutaris, with Apamea (Arab. <hi
                    rend="italic">Fámíya,</hi> the modern Kal'at el-Mudík) on the Orontes as
                    capital. (4) Phoenice Maritima; capital, Tyre. (5) Phoenice ad Libanum; capital,
                    Emesa (Hims). To this division Damascus and Palmyra belonged; occasionally they
                    were reckoned to Coelesyria, the middle strip of coast being designated
                    Syrophcenicia. (6, 7, 8) Palestina I., IL, and III. For these, which from the
                    time of Vespasian had governors of their own, see vol. xviii. p. 177. (9) Arabia
                    (capital, Bostra), which embraced all the region from the Hauran to the Arnon,
                    and skirted the Jordan valley, stretching southwards to Petra. Through the
                    kingdom of the Nabataeans Roman influence penetrated from Syria far into
                    northern Arabia.</p>
                <p>In 616 Syria was subjugated for a brief period by the Persian Chosroes II.; from
                    622 till 628 it was again Byzantine; 636 and the immediately following years saw
                    its conquest by the Mohammedans (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohammedanism,</hi>
                    vol. xviii. p. 562). Mo'àwija, the first Ommayad caliph, chose Damascus for his
                    residence; but in 750 the capital of the empire was removed by the 'Abbasids to
                    Baghdad. Under the early caliphs the Arabs divided Syria into the following
                    military districts <hi rend="italic">(gonds).</hi> (1) Filistin (Palestine),
                    consisting of Judaea, Samaria, and a portion of the territory east of Jordan;
                    its capital was Ramleh, Jerusalem ranking next. (2) Urdun (Jordan), of which the
                    capital was Tabaríye (Tiberias); roughly speaking, it consisted of the rest of
                    Palestine as far as Tyre. (3) Damascus, a district which included Baalbec,
                    Tripoli, and Beyrout, and also the Hauran. (4) Hims, including Hamath. (5)
                    Kinnasrín, corresponding to northern Syria; the capital at first was Kinnasrín
                    to the south of Haleb (Aleppo), by which it was afterwards superseded. (6) The
                    sixth district was the military frontier (' <hi rend="italic">awásim)</hi>
                    bordering upon the Byzantine dominions in Asia Minor. The struggles of the
                    Mohammedan dynasties for the possession of Syria cannot be gone into here;
                    suffice it to say that throughout their course the country still enjoyed a
                    considerable degree of prosperity.</p>
                <p>In the crusading period the kingdom of Jerusalem, whose rulers were never able to
                    establish a foothold to the east of the Jordan, extended northwards to Beyrout;
                    next it was the countship of Tripoli on the coast; and beyond that in north
                    Syria was the principality of Antioch. Syria suffered severely from the Mongol
                    invasions (1260), and it never recovered its former prosperity. In 1516 the
                    Ottomans took it from the Egyptian Mamelukes. Under the Turks its administrative
                    divisions again varied at different times; out of the five pashalics of Aleppo,
                    Tripoli, Damascus, Sidon (later 'Akka), and Jerusalem two vilayets were
                    subsequently formed, having their capitals at Aleppo and Damascus. Quite
                    recently south Palestine has been made a separate vilayet from that of
                    Damascus.</p>
                <p>Rude stone monuments (circles and dolmens) and other prehistoric remains show
                    that Syria must have been inhabited from a very early period. Within historic
                    times a great number of different nationalities have fought and settled within
                    its borders, the majority belonging to the Semitic stock. This last circumstance
                    has rendered possible a considerable degree of fidelity in the tradition of the
                    oldest local names. After the Aramaeans had absorbed what remained of the
                    earlier population, they themselves were very powerfully influenced by
                    Graeco-Roman civilization, but as a people they still retained their Aramaean
                    speech. At present an Aramaic dialect largely mixed with Arabic is spoken in
                    three villages on the eastern slope of Antilibanus (in Ma'lúla, Bakh'a, and
                    Jub'adín), but this small survival is on the point of disappearing. Throughout
                    the whole country elsewhere the language spoken is Arabic, but with Aramaic
                    elements, especially in the language of the peasants. Ethnographically the
                    Aramaic element of the population admits of being distinguished from the Arabic
                    type; it is specially strong in the mountain districts. The majority of the
                    Christians dwelling in Syria may be regarded as representatives of the Aramaean
                    race. No traces of the earlier races, such as the Canaanites or Phoenicians, can
                    any longer be distinguished; and every trace of the presence of Greeks, Romans,
                    and Franks has completely disappeared.</p>
                <p>In the Arab immigration, two principal types are to be distinguished,—the pure
                    Arab type of the nomad tribes (Bedouins) and the type of the sedentary town
                    Arabs and peasants, which shows an intermixture of foreign and older elements.
                    The two confront each other in sharp contrasts. Bedouin tribes are scattered
                    throughout the whole country; despising agriculture and the settled life, they
                    are found with their camels, sheep, and goats on the borders of the territories
                    appropriated by the peasants. Being more or less independent of the Government,
                    especially in the district bordering on the steppe, they are able to exact black
                    mail from their sedentary brethren. Taxed thus on both hands, the life of the
                    peasant is economically far from an easy one; hence it should be the duty of
                    Government to restrain the influence of the nomads and to force them as far as
                    possible to form fixed settlements. In this respect the policy of the Turks
                    during the 19th century to ensure the safety of the peasants and of travellers
                    has been on the whole successful. In the districts bordering on the coast there
                    are no large nomadic tribes, and on the higher plateaus of the cultivated land
                    the power of the Bedouins is much reduced; but south of Palestine and everywhere
                    on the edge of the steppe they continue much as before. The most powerful tribe
                    of the Syrian desert is that of the 'Aneze, falling into numerous subdivisions,
                    of which the Ruwala, Wuld' Alí, Hesene, and Bischer may be mentioned. The tribe,
                    estimated to number 300,000 in all, extends far into Arabia and reaches the
                    Euphrates. The other Bedouin tribes of Syria have for the most part tolerably
                    definite and circumscribed territories. East of the Jordan the best known are
                    the 'Adwín on the Balka and the Bani Sakhr in Moab. The Bedouins to the south of
                    the Dead Sea are called Ahi el-Kibli (“the people of the south ”) in
                    contradistinction to those of the north (Ahi esh-Shemál). Finally, there occur
                    sporadically in central and northern Syria nomadic Turkish tribes. Gipsy hordes
                    are also met with in considerable numbers.</p>
                <p>The religious as well as the ethnographical types are strongly divergent. The
                    bulk of the population are Mohammedan; the Bedouins have not much religion of
                    any kind, but they profess Islam. Besides orthodox Moslems there are also
                    Shi'ite sects, such as that of the Metáwile (especially in northern Palestine),
                    as well as a number of religious communities whose doctrine, combining
                    philosophical and Christian with Mohammedan elements, is the outcome of the
                    process of fermentation that characterized the first centuries of Islam. To this
                    last class belong the Ishmaelites, Nosairians, and especially the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Druses</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> In many cases it is
                    obvious that the political antipathy of natives against the Arabs has found
                    expression in the formation of such sects. The Nosairians, for instance, and no
                    doubt the Druses also, were originally survivals of the Syrian population. The
                    Jews are found exclusively in the larger centres of population; in every case
                    they have immigrated back from Europe. The Christians are an important element,
                    constituting probably as much as a fifth of the whole population; the majority
                    of them belong to the Orthodox Greek Church, which has two patriarchs in Syria,
                    at Antioch and Jerusalem. Catholics— United Greeks, United Syrians, and
                    Maronites—are numerous. The mission of the American Presbyterian Church, which
                    has had its centre in Beyrout for the last sixty years, has done much for Syria,
                    especially in the spread of popular education; numerous publications issue from
                    its press, and its medical school has been extremely beneficial. The Catholic
                    mission has done very good work in what relates to schools, institutes, and the
                    diffusion of literature. The Christians constitute the educated portion of the
                    Syrian people; but the spirit of rivalry is producing stimulative effects on the
                    Mohammedans, who have greatly fallen away from that zeal for knowledge which
                    characterized the earlier centuries of their faith.</p>
                <p>Accurate statistics of any kind for Syria cannot be had; even the area of the
                    land under cultivation is unknown. The returns of population are, according to
                    the Turkish official documents, only approximations. The total population may
                    safely be put at less than 2,000,000; an official estimate in 1872-73 gave
                    1,365,680, of whom 976,322 were Mohammedans. Probably, however, this was an
                    under-estimate. Reclus <hi rend="italic">(Nouν. Géogr. Univ.,</hi> Paris, 1884)
                    gives the area of Syria as 183,000 square kilomètres (70,638 square miles) and
                    the population as 1,450,000.</p>
                <p>From the Egyptian and Assyrio-Babylonian monuments we learn that in ancient times
                    one of the principal exports of Syria was timber; this has now entirely ceased.
                    But it continues to export wheat, and with good roads the amount could be very
                    largely increased. Other articles of export are silk cocoons, wool, hides,
                    sponges, and fruits (almonds, raisins, and the like); the amounts of cotton,
                    tobacco, and wine sent out of the country are small. The only good harbours are
                    those of Beyrout and Alexandretta (Scanderoon). The caravan trade with the East
                    has almost entirely ceased, and the great trade routes from Damascus northwards
                    to Aleppo and eastwards through the wilderness are quite abandoned. The traffic
                    with Arabia has ceased to be important, being limited to the time of the going
                    and returning of the great pilgrim caravan to Mecca, which continues to have its
                    mustering-place at Damascus. The native industries in silk, cotton, and wool
                    have been almost entirely destroyed by the import trade from Europe. The land is
                    poor in minerals, including coal; water-power also is deficient, so that the
                    introduction of European industries is attended with difficulties even apart
                    from the insecurity of affairs, which forbids such experiments as the
                    improvement of agriculture by means of European capital. As regards the
                    cultivation of the soil Syria remains stable; but the soil is becoming
                    relatively poorer, the value of the imports constantly gaining upon that of the
                    exports.</p>
