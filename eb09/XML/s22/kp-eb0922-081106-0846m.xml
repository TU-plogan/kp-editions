                    dissociated from the ancient ritual of the altar, may be found in the circle of
                    the prophets and their disciples (see especially Isa. viii. 16 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqj)</hi>; but the synagogue as an institution characteristic of Judaism arose
                    after the work of Ezra, and is closely connected with the development of that
                    legal Judaism to which his reformation gave definite shape. From the time of
                    Ezra downwards it was the business of every Jew to know the law; the school <hi
                    rend="italic">(beth ham-midrāsh)</hi> trained scholars, but the synagogue, where
                    the law was read every Sabbath (Acts xv. 21), was the means of popular
                    instruction. Such synagogues existed in all parts of Judaea in the time of Psalm
                    lxxiv. 8 (probably a psalm of the Persian period); in Acts xv. 21 it appears
                    that they had existed for many generations “in every city.” This held good not
                    only for Palestine but for the Dispersion; in post-Talmudic times the rule was
                    that a synagogue must be built wherever there were ten Jews. And, though the
                    name “synagogue” varies with <hi rend="italic">προσευχή</hi> (“place of prayer
                    ”), it appears that everywhere the assemblage was primarily one for instruction
                    in the law: the synagogue, as Philo puts it, was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >διδασκαλειov</hi>. A formed institution<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0847-0812"/> of this sort required some organization: the
                    general order of the service was directed by one or more “rulers of the
                    synagogue” (<hi rend="italic">ἀρχισυνάγωγοι</hi>, Luke xiii. 14; Acts xiii. 15),
                    who called on fit persons to read, pray, and preach; alms were collected by two
                    or more “collectors” (<hi rend="italic">gabbâe sedākā}·,</hi> and a “minister”
                    (<hi rend="italic">hazzān, ὑπηρέτης,</hi> Luke iv. 20) had charge of the sacred
                    books (preserved in an “ark”) and of other ministerial functions, including the
                    teaching of children to read. The discipline of the congregation was enforced by
                    excommunication (<hi rend="italic">hērem)</hi> or temporary exclusion (<hi
                    rend="italic">niddûy),</hi> and also by the minor punishment of scourging (Matt.
                    x. 17), inflicted by the <hi rend="italic">hazzân.</hi> The disciplinary power
                    was in the hands of a senate of elders (<hi rend="italic">πpεσβύτεpoι,
                    γερουσία),</hi> the chief members of which were <hi rend="italic">ἄρχοντες.</hi>
                    The principal service of the synagogue was held on Sabbath morning, and
                    included, according to the Mishnah, the recitation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >shema</hi> (Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21; Numb. xv. 37-41), prayer, lessons from
                    the law and prophets with Aramaic translation, a sermon (<hi rend="italic"
                    >derashah)</hi> based on the lesson (Acts xiii. 15), and finally a blessing
                    pronounced by the priest or invoked by a layman. On Sabbath afternoon and on
                    Monday and Thursday there was a service without a lesson from the prophets;
                    there were also services for all feast-days. Synagogues were built by preference
                    beside water for the convenience of the ceremonial ablutions (comp. Acts xvi.
                    13); and remains of very ancient buildings of this class exist in several parts
                    of Galilee; they generally lie north and south, and seem to have had three doors
                    to the south, and sometimes to have been divided by columns into a nave and two
                    aisles.</p>
                <p>Jewish tradition has a great deal to say about a body called “the great
                    synagogue,” which is supposed to have been the supreme religious authority from
                    the cessation of prophecy to the time of the high priest Simeon the Just, and is
                    even said (by modern writers since Elias Levita) to have fixed the Old Testament
                    canon (cp. vol. V. p. 3 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> But Kuenen in his essay
                    “Over de Mannen der Groote Synagoge” (<hi rend="italic">Verslagen</hi> of the
                    Amsterdam Academy, 1876) has shown that these traditions are fiction, and that
                    the name <hi rend="italic">keneseth haggadôla</hi> originally denoted, not a
                    standing authority, but the great convocation of Neh. viii.-x.</p>
