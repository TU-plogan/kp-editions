                    eruption, which, after passing through various stages, dries up, leaving more or
                    less distinct cicatrices. Few diseases have been so destructive to human life as
                    smallpox, and it has ever been regarded with horror alike from its fatality, its
                    loathsome accompaniments and disfiguring effects, and from the fact that no age
                    and condition of life are exempt from liability to its occurrence. Although in
                    most civilized countries its ravages have been greatly limited by the protection
                    afforded by vaccination, yet epidemic outbreaks are far from uncommon, affecting
                    especially those who are unprotected, or whose protection has become weakened by
                    lapse of time.</p>
                <p>Much obscurity surrounds the early history of smallpox. It appears to have been
                    imported into Europe from Asia, where it had been known and recognized from
                    remote antiquity. The earliest accounts of its existence reach back to the
                    middle and end of the 6th century, when it was described by Procopius and
                    Gregory of Tours as occurring in epidemic form in Arabia, Egypt, and the south
                    of Europe. In one of the narratives of the expedition of the Abyssinians against
                    Mecca (c. 550) the usual miraculous details are combined with a notice of
                    smallpox breaking out among the invaders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Perser . . .
                    aus Tabari</hi> (Leyden, 1879), p. 218. Nöldeke thinks that this notice may be
                    taken from genuine historical tradition, and seems to find an allusion to it in
                    an old poem.</p></note> Not a few authorities, however, regard these accounts as
                    referring not to smallpox but to plague. The most reliable statements as to the
                    early existence of the disease are found in Rhazes (see vol. xv. p. 805), by
                    whom its symptoms were clearly described, its pathology explained by a humoral
                    or fermentation theory, and directions given for its treatment. During the
                    period of the crusades smallpox appears to have spread extensively through
                    Europe, and hospitals for its treatment were erected in many countries. But at
                    this period and for centuries afterwards the references to the subject include
                    in all likelihood other diseases, since no precise distinction appears to have
                    been made between the different forms of eruptive fever until a comparatively
                    recent date. Smallpox was known in England as early as the 13th century, and had
                    probably existed there before. It appears to have been introduced into America
                    shortly after the discovery of that continent, and there, as in Europe and
                    throughout the known world, destructive epidemics were of frequent occurrence
                    during succeeding centuries.</p>
                <p>The only known factor in the origin of smallpox is contagion,—this malady being
                    probably the most contagious of all diseases. Its outbreak in epidemic form in a
                    locality may frequently be traced to the introduction of a single case from a
                    distance. The most direct means of communicating smallpox is inoculation (see
                    below). By far the most common cause of conveyance of the disease, however, is
                    contact with the persons or the immediate surroundings of those already
                    affected. The atmosphere around a smallpox patient is charged with the products
                    of the disease, which likewise cling tenaciously to clothing, furniture, &amp;c.
                    The disease is probably communicable from its earliest manifestations onwards to
                    its close, but it is generally held that the most infectious period extends from
                    the appearance of the eruption till the drying up of the pustules. Smallpox may
                    also readily be communicated by the bodies of those who have died from its
                    effects. No age is exempt from susceptibility to smallpox. Infants are
                    occasionally born with the eruption or its marks upon their bodies, proving that
                    they had undergone the disease <hi rend="italic">in utero.</hi> Dark-skinned
                    races are said to suffer more readily and severely than whites. One attack of
                    smallpox as a rule confers immunity from any recurrence, but there are numerous
                    exceptions to this rule. Overcrowding and all insanitary surroundings favour the
                    spread of smallpox where it has broken out; but the most influential condition
                    of all is the amount of protection afforded to a community by previous attacks
                    and, especially in the present day, by vaccination. Such protection, although
                    for a time most effectual, tends to become exhausted, unless renewed. Hence in a
                    large population there is always likely to be an increasing number of
                    individuals who have become susceptible to smallpox. This probably explains its
                    occasional and even apparently<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0178-0163"/> periodic epidemic outbreaks in large centres, and
                    the well-known fact that the most severe cases occur at the commencement,—those
                    least protected being necessarily more liable to be first and most seriously
                    attacked.</p>
                <p>While the symptoms of smallpox are essentially the same in character in all
                    cases, they are variously modified according to the form which the disease may
                    assume, there being certain well-marked varieties of this as of most other
                    infectious maladies. The following description applies to an average case. After
                    the reception into the system of the smallpox contagion the onset of the
                    symptoms is preceded by a period of incubation, during which the patient may or
                    may not complain. This period is believed to be from about ten to fourteen days.
                    In cases of direct inoculation of the virus it is considerably shorter. The
                    invasion of the symptoms is sudden and severe, in the form of a rigor followed
                    by fever (the <hi rend="italic">primary fever),</hi> in which the temperature
                    rises to 103° or 104° Fahr. or higher, notwithstanding that perspiration may be
                    going on. A quick pulse is present, together with thirst and constipation, while
                    intense headache accompanied with vomiting and pain in the back is among the
                    most characteristic of the initial symptoms. Occasionally the disease is ushered
                    in by convulsions. Some authorities hold that the more violent the invasion the
                    more severe the attack is likely to prove. These symptoms continue with greater
                    or less intensity throughout two entire days, and during their course there may
                    occasionally be noticed on various parts of the body, especially on the lower
                    part of the abdomen and inner sides of the thighs, a diffuse redness accompanied
                    by slight spots of extravasation (<hi rend="italic">petechise),</hi> the
                    appearance somewhat resembling that of scarlet fever. These “prodromal rashes,”
                    as they are termed, appear to be more frequent in some epidemics than in others,
                    and they do not seem to have any special significance. They are probably more
                    frequently seen in cases of the mildest form of smallpox (varioloid), referred
                    to below. On the third day the characteristic eruption begins to make its
                    appearance. It is almost always first seen on the face, particularly about the
                    forehead and roots of the hair, in the form of a general redness; but upon this
                    surface there may be felt by the finger numerous elevated points more or less
                    thickly set together. The eruption, which is accompanied by heat and itching,
                    spreads over the face, trunk, and extremities in the course of a few
                    hours,—continuing, however, to come out more abundantly for one or two days. It
                    is always most marked on the exposed parts; but in such a case as that now
                    described the individual “pocks” are separated from each other (discrete). On
                    the second or third day after its appearance the eruption undergoes a
                    change,—the pocks becoming vesicles filled with a clear fluid. These vesicles
                    attain to about the size of a pea, and in their centre there is a slight
                    depression, giving the characteristic umbilicated appearance to the pock. The
                    clear contents of these vesicles gradually become turbid, and by the eighth or
                    ninth day they are changed into pustules containing yellow matter, while at the
                    same time they increase still further in size and lose the central depression.
                    Accompanying this change there are great surrounding inflammation and swelling
                    of the skin, which, where the eruption is thickly set, produce much
                    disfigurement and render the features unrecognizable, while the affected parts
                    emit an offensive odour, particularly if, as often happens, the pustules break.
                    The eruption is present not only on the skin but on mucous membranes, that of
                    the mouth and throat being affected at an early period; and the swelling
                    produced here is not only a source of great discomfort but even of danger from
                    the obstruction thus occasioned in the upper portion of the air-passages. The
                    voice is hoarse and a copious flow of saliva comes from the mouth. The mucous
                    membrane of the nostrils is similarly affected, while that of the eyes may also
                    be involved, to the danger of permanent impairment of sight. The febrile
                    symptoms which ushered in the disease undergo marked abatement on the appearance
                    of the eruption on the third day, but on the eighth or ninth, when the vesicles
                    become converted into pustules, there is a return of the fever (<hi
                    rend="italic">secondary</hi> or <hi rend="italic">suppurative fever),</hi> often
                    to a severe extent, and not unfrequently accompanied by prominent nervous
                    phenomena, such as great restlessness, delirium, or coma. On the eleventh or
                    twelfth day the pustules show signs of drying up (desiccation), and along with
                    this the febrile symptoms decline. Great itching of the skin attends this stage.
                    The scabs produced by the dried pustules gradually fall off and a reddish brown
                    spot remains, which, according to the depth of skin involved in the disease,
                    leaves a permanent white depressed scar,—this “pitting” so characteristic of
                    smallpox being specially marked on the face. Convalescence in this form of the
                    disease is as a rule uninterrupted.</p>
                <p>There are certain varieties of smallpox depending upon the form it assumes or the
                    intensity of the symptoms. <hi rend="italic">Confluent smallpox {variola
                    confluens),</hi> while essentially the same in its general characters as the
                    form already described, differs from it in the much greater severity of all the
                    symptoms even from the onset, and particularly in regard to the eruption, which,
                    instead of showing itself in isolated pocks, appears in large patches run
                    together, giving a blistered aspect to the affected skin. This confluent
                    condition is almost entirely confined to the face, and produces shocking
                    disfigurement, while subsequently deep scars remain and the hair may be lost.
                    The mucous membranes suffer in a similar degree of severity, and dangerous
                    complications may arise from the presence of the disease in the mouth, throat,
                    and eyes. Both the primary and secondary fevers are extremely severe. The
                    mortality is very high, and it is generally estimated that at least 50 per cent.
                    of such cases prove fatal, either from the violence of the disease or from one
                    or other of the numerous complications which are specially apt to attend upon
                    it. Convalescence is apt to be slow and interrupted. Another variety is that in
                    which the eruption assumes the <hi rend="italic">haemorrhagic</hi> form owing to
                    bleeding taking place into the pocks after their formation. This is apt to be
                    accompanied with haemorrhages from various mucous surfaces (particularly in the
                    case of females), occasionally to a dangerous degree and with symptoms of great
                    prostration. Many of such cases prove fatal. A still more serious form is that
                    termed <hi rend="italic">malignant smallpox,</hi> in which, as in the malignant
                    forms of other infectious diseases (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Measles</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Scarlet Fever),</hi> the patient is from the onset
                    overwhelmed with the poison and quickly succumbs,—the rash scarcely, if at all,
                    appearing or showing the haemorrhagic or purpuric character. Such cases are,
                    however, comparatively rare. The term <hi rend="italic">varioloid</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">modified smallpox</hi> is applied to cases occurring in persons
                    constitutionally but little susceptible to the disease, or in whom the
                    protective influence of vaccination or a previous attack of smallpox still to
                    some extent exists. Cases of this mild kind are of very common occurrence where
                    vaccination has been systematically carried out. As compared with an average
                    case of the unmodified disease as above described, this form is very marked, the
                    differences extending to all the phenomena of the disease. (1) As regards its
                    onset, the initial fever is much milder and the premonitory symptoms altogether
                    less in severity. (2) As regards the eruption, the number of pocks is smaller,
                    often only a few and mostly upon the body. They not unfrequently abort before
                    reaching the stage of suppuration; but should they proceed to this stage the
                    secondary fever is extremely slight or even<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n179/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0179-0164"/> absent. There is little or no pitting. (3) As
                    regards complications and injurious results, these are rarely seen and the risk
                    to life is insignificant.</p>
                <p>Various circumstances affect the mortality in ordinary smallpox and increase the
                    dangers attendant upon it. The character of the epidemic has an important
                    influence. In some outbreaks the type of the disease is much more severe than in
                    others, and the mortality consequently greater. Smallpox is most fatal at the
                    extremes of life, except in the case of vaccinated infants, in whom there is
                    immunity from the disease. Again, any ordinary case with discrete eruption is
                    serious, and a case of confluent or even semi-confluent character is much more
                    grave, while the haemorrhagic variety is frequently and the malignant always
                    fatal. Numerous and often dangerous complications, although liable to arise in
                    all cases, are more apt to occur in the severer forms, and in general at or
                    after the supervention of the secondary fever. The most important are
                    inflammatory affections of the respiratory organs, such as bronchitis, pleurisy,
                    or pneumonia, diphtheritic conditions of the throat, and swelling of the mucous
                    membrane of the larynx and trachea. Destructive ulceration affecting the eyes or
                    ears are well-known and formidable dangers, while various affections of the
                    skin, in the form of erysipelas, abscess, or carbuncles, are of not infrequent
                    occurrence. Persons of enfeebled health, and those whose constitutions are
                    impaired by intemperance, readily succumb to attacks of smallpox, even of
                    comparatively mild character, as do also pregnant women, to whom this disease is
                    peculiarly dangerous.</p>
                <p>The most important of all the conditions tending to affect the mortality from
                    smallpox, alike in the individual and the community, is the protection afforded
                    by <hi rend="smallcaps">Vaccination (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> During
                    the first decade of life, if vaccination has been fully and successfully
                    accomplished in infancy, the risk of death from smallpox is <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil</hi>; but, should the disease be caught—which is improbable—it will in all
                    likelihood show itself in the mild form of varioloid. As regards revaccination,
                    it has been found in all smallpox hospitals that the attendants and nurses
                    escape the disease when revaccinated. In the experience of the late Dr Waller
                    Lewis in the case of an average of 10,504 persons permanently employed in the
                    General Post Office, London, all of whom had to be revaccinated on admission, it
                    was proved that in the ten years 1870-79 not a single fatal case of smallpox
                    occurred, and only ten mild cases were seen during a period embracing two
                    epidemics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> The treatment of smallpox is conducted upon
                    the same general principles as that for the other infectious diseases (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cholera, Diphtheria, Measles, Scarlet Fever).</hi> The
                    establishment of smallpox hospitals separated as far as possible from populous
                    localities, and the prompt removal of cases of the disease where practicable, as
                    well as the diligent prosecution of vaccination and revaccination, are among the
                    first requirements. The plan introduced into several large towns of compulsory
                    notification of infectious diseases has much to recommend it. The special
                    treatment applicable to a person suffering from smallpox includes in the first
                    place the providing competent nurses, who, together with all others in the
                    neighbourhood of the patient, should be duly protected by recent vaccination.
                    The patient should lie on a soft bed in a well-ventilated but somewhat darkened
                    room and be fed with the lighter forms of nutriment, such as milk, soups,
                    &amp;c. The skin should be sponged occasionally with tepid water, and the mouth
                    and throat washed with a solution of chlorate of potash, Condy’s fluid, or other
                    safe disinfectant. In a severe case, with evidence of much prostration,
                    stimulants may be advantageously employed. The patient should be always
                    carefully watched, and special vigilance is called for where delirium exists.
                    This symptom may sometimes be lessened by sedatives, such as opium, the
                    bromides, or chloral. With the view of preventing pitting many applications have
                    been proposed, but probably the best are cold or tepid compresses of light
                    weight kept constantly applied over the face and eyes. The water out of which
                    these are wrung may be a weak solution of carbolic or boracic acid. When the
                    pustules have dried up the itching this produces may be much relieved by the
                    application of oil or vaseline. Complications are to be dealt with as they arise
                    and the severer forms of the disease treated in reference to the special
                    symptoms presented. In cases where the eruption is tardy of appearing and the
                    attack threatens to assume the malignant form, the writer has seen marked
                    benefit attend the use of the wet pack. Disinfectants should be abundantly
                    employed in the room and its vicinity, and all clothing, &amp;c., in contact
                    with the patient should be burnt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inoculation.—</hi> Previous to the introduction of vaccination
                    the method of preventive treatment by what was known as inoculation had been
                    employed. This consisted in introducing into the system—in a similar way to the
                    method now commonly employed in vaccination—the smallpox virus from a mild case
                    with the view of reproducing the disease also in a mild form in the person
                    inoculated, and thus affording him protection from further attack. This plan had
                    apparently been resorted to by Eastern nations from an early period in the
                    history of the disease. It was known to be extensively practised in Turkey in
                    the beginning of the 18th century, when, chiefly through the letters of Lady
                    Mary Wortley Montagu, it became known and was speedily adopted in England. There
                    is no doubt, both from the statistics of the Smallpox and Inoculation Hospital,
                    London, and from the testimony of physicians throughout the country, that this
                    practice made a marked impression upon the fatality of the disease, and was
                    itself attended with extremely little risk to life. The objections to it,
                    however, were great, for, although usually conveying the smallpox in a mild
                    form, it not unfrequently took effect severely, and, while death might be
                    averted, the disfiguring results of the disease remained. Further, each
                    inoculated person upon whom the operation took effect became for the time being
                    a possible source of infection to others, and in point of fact the practice
                    tended to spread the disease and so to increase the general mortality. Although
                    inoculation continued to be practised for a number of years subsequently to
                    Jenner’s great discovery, it gradually became displaced by that vastly superior
                    and safer preventive. In 1840 an Act of Parliament was passed rendering smallpox
                    inoculation unlawful in England. (<hi rend="smallcaps">j. o. a)</hi></p>
