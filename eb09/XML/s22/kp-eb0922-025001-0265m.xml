                    taking its name from its chief town. As it consists simply of the territories
                    won by the city, its irregular shape is easily accounted for. It takes in most
                    of the valley of the Aar between the towns of Soleure and Olten, but stretches
                    across the eastern Jura to Dornach not far from Basel, while to the south it
                    tends in the direction of Bern. The total area is 305·9 square miles, of which
                    all but 25·4 square miles is classed as “productive,” 103·3 square miles of this
                    being covered by forests. In other words, 91·7 per cent. is fertile. The highest
                    point in the canton is the Hasenmatte (4754 feet), in the range behind the town
                    of Soleure, in which too is the Weissenstein (4213 feet), so well known as a
                    great centre for the air and whey cure, as also for its fine view. In 1880 the
                    population of the canton was 80,424 (an increase of 5754 on the census of 1870),
                    the women outnumbering the men by 1704. Of these no fewer than 79,514 are
                    German-speaking.</p>
                <p>Soleure now includes 63,037 Roman Catholics to 17,114 Protestants, but in the ten
                    years 1870-1880 the latter increased by 4666, the former only by 965.
                    Ecclesiastically the districts now forming part of the canton belonged till 1814
                    to the dioceses of Lausanne, Basel, and Constance; but since the complete
                    reorganization of 1828 it is part of the diocese of Basel, and the bishop of
                    Basel lives in the city of Soleure.</p>
                <p>The only places of any size in the canton are its capital, Soleure (7668
                    inhabitants), which possesses the finest armoury in Switzerland, and Olten
                    (3979). It is counted as one of the most fertile and productive cantons in the
                    Confederation, and exports iron, wood, marl, marble, glass, &amp;c. In
                    educational matters it takes a high place, and its two chief towns are connected
                    by a railway, Olten being one of the principal railway junctions in Switzerland,
                    and the meeting-place of the St Gotthard railway with the main lines branching
                    off to the north, east, and west.</p>
                <p>An old rhyme claims for the town of Soleure the fame of being the oldest place in
                    “Gallia” save Treves. Certainly its name Salodurum” is found in Roman
                    inscriptions (the termination possibly pointing to a Celtic origin), and its
                    position as commanding the approach to the Rhine from the south-west has led to
                    its being more than once strongly fortified. Situated just on the borders of
                    Alamannia and Burgundy, it seems to have inclined to the latter allegiance, and
                    it was at Soleure that in 1038 the Burgundian nobles made their final submission
                    to the emperor Conrad II. The mediaeval town grew up round the house of secular
                    canons founded in honour of St Ursus and St Victor (two of the Theban legion who
                    are said to have been martyred here in the 3d century) by Queen Bertha, either
                    the mother of Charlemagne and wife of Pippin (8th century) or the more famous
                    wife of Rudolph II., king of Burgundy (10th century), and was naturally in the
                    diocese of Lausanne. The prior and canons had many rights over the town, but
                    criminal jurisdiction and the “advocatia” of the house remained with the kings
                    of Burgundy, passed to the Zäringen dynasty, and on its extinction in 1218
                    reverted to the emperor. The city thus became a free imperial city, and in 1252
                    shook off the jurisdiction of the canons and took them under its protection. In
                    1295 we find it allied with Bern, and this connexion is the key to its later
                    history. It helped Bern in 1298 in the great fight against the nobles at the
                    Dornbühl, and again at Laupen in 1339 against the jealous Burgundian nobles. It
                    was besieged in 1322 by Duke Leopold of Austria (the defeated of Morgarten)
                    during the struggle for the empire, but he was compelled to withdraw. In the
                    14th century the government of the town fell into the hands of the guilds, which
                    practically filled all the public offices. Through Bern (which became a member
                    in 1353) Soleure was drawn into association with the Swiss Confederation. An
                    attempt to surprise it in 1382, made by the decaying Kyburg branch of the
                    Hapsburgs, was foiled, and resulted in the admittance of Soleure in 1385 into
                    the Swabian League and in its sharing in the Sempach war. Though Soleure took no
                    part in that battle, she is included in the Sempach ordinance of 1393 and in the
                    great treaty of 1394 by which the Hapsburgs renounced their claims to all
                    territories within the Confederation. In 1411 she in vain sought to be admitted
                    into the Confederation, a privilege only granted to her in 1481 at the diet of
                    Stanz, after she had taken part in the Aargau, Italian, Toggenburg, and
                    Burgundian wars. It was also in the 15th century that by purchase or conquest
                    the town acquired the main part of the territories forming the present canton.
                    In 1529 the majority of the “communes” went over to the Reformers, and men were
                    sent to fight on Zwingli’s side at Kappel (1531), but in 1533 the old faith
                    regained its sway, and in 1586 Soleure was a member of the Golden or Borromean
                    League. Though the city ruled the surrounding districts, the peasants were
                    fairly treated, and hence their revolt in 1653 was not so desperate as in other
                    places. Soleure was the usual residence of the French ambassador, and no doubt
                    this helped on the formation of a “patriciate,” for after 1681 no fresh citizens
                    were admitted, and later we find only twenty-five ruling families distributed
                    over the eleven guilds. Serfage was abolished by Soleure in 1785. The old system
                    of the city ruling over eleven bailiwicks came to an end in March 1798, when
                    Soleure opened its gates to the French army. She was one of the six
                    “directorial” cantons under the 1803 constitution. In 1814 the old aristocratic
                    government was set up again, but this was finally broken down in 1839, Soleure
                    in 1832 joining the League of the Seven to guarantee the maintenance of the new
                    cantonal constitutions. Though distinctly a Roman Catholic canton, she did not
                    join the “Sonderbund,” and voted in favour of the federal constitutions of 1848
                    and 1874. Since 1830 she has revised her constitution in 1840, 1850, 1856, and
                    1875, besides three partial revisions of 1867, 1869, and 1881. The present
                    constitution may be described as an ultramontane democracy, the priests having
                    very great influence. The “Kantonsrath” or legislative assembly is elected by
                    all citizens over twenty years of age, in the proportion of one member to 800
                    inhabitants. This assembly selects the “Regierungsrath” or executive, consisting
                    of five members. In both cases the period of office is five years, though on the
                    demand of 4000 citizens a popular vote must be taken as to whether the existing
                    members shall continue to sit or not. In the canton the “obligatory referendum”
                    and the “initiative” are legal. By the former all laws passed by the assembly,
                    and all financial resolutions involving the expenditure of 100,000 francs or of
                    an annual sum of 20,000 francs, must be approved by a popular vote. By the
                    latter 2000 citizens can compel the assembly to consider any proposal for making
                    a new law or for amending an old one. Further, the demand of the majority of the
                    assembly or of 3000 citizens is sufficient to necessitate a popular vote as to
                    the advisability of revising the constitution, the revised draft itself
                    requiring a further popular vote.</p>
