                    is the cathedral, a very large and imposing basilica of red sandstone, and one
                    of the noblest examples of Romanesque architecture now extant. Beyond the
                    general interest attaching to it as one of the old</p>
                <p>Romanesque churches of the Rhineland, Spires cathedral has a peculiar importance
                    in the history of architecture as probably the earliest Romanesque basilica in
                    which the nave as well as the side arcades was vaulted from the first. Built in
                    1030-61 by Conrad II. and his successor, this church has had a chequered
                    history, its disasters culminating in 1689, when the soldiers of Louis XIV.
                    burned it to the bare walls and scattered the ashes of the eight German emperors
                    who had been interred in the kings’ choir. Restored in 1772-84 and provided with
                    a vestibule and façade, it was again desecrated by the French in 1794; but in
                    1846-53 it was once more thoroughly restored and adorned in the interior with
                    gorgeous frescos at the expense of the king of Bavaria. The large cathedral bowl
                    (Domnapf) in front of the west façade formerly marked the boundary between the
                    episcopal and municipal territories. Each new bishop on his election had to fill
                    the bowl with wine, while the burghers emptied it to his health. The heathen
                    tower to the east of the church, on foundations supposed to be Roman, was
                    probably part of the town wall built in 1080 by Bishop Rudger. Of the Retscher,
                    or imperial palace, so called because built after the model of the Hradschin at
                    Prague, only a mouldering fragment of wall remains. It was in this palace that
                    the famous diet of Spires met in 1529, at which the Reformers first received the
                    name of Protestants. The Altpörtel (alta porta), a fine old gateway of 1246, is
                    a relic of the free imperial city. Among the modern buildings are several
                    churches and schools, a museum and picture gallery, Ac. Spires, although rebuilt
                    in 1697, has never recovered from the cruel injuries inflicted by the French in
                    1689. Its trade is insignificant, although it still has a free harbour on the
                    Rhine. Its manufactures include paper, tobacco and cigars, sugar, sugar of lead,
                    vinegar, beer, and leather. Vines and tobacco are grown in the neighbourhood.
                    The population in 1880 was 15,589 and in 1885 16,228.</p>
                <p>Spires, known to the Romans as <hi rend="italic">Augusta Nemetum</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemetae,</hi> and to the Gauls as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naνiomagus,</hi> is one of the oldest towns on the Rhine. The modern name
                    appears first, under the form Spira, about the 7th century. Captured by Julius
                    Caesar in 47 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it was repeatedly destroyed by the
                    barbarian hordes in the first few centuries of the Christian era. The town had
                    become an episcopal seat in the 4th century; but heathenism supervened, and the
                    present bishopric dates from 610. In 830 Spira became part of the Frankish
                    empire, the emperors having a “palatium” here; and it was especially favoured by
                    the Salic imperial house. The contentions between the bishops and the citizens
                    were as obstinate and severe as in any other city of Germany. The situation of
                    the town opposite the mouths of several roads through the Rhine valley early
                    fostered its trade; in 1294 it rose to be a free imperial city, although it
                    owned no territory beyond its walls and had a population of less than 30,000. It
                    enjoyed great renown as the seat of the imperial supreme court from 1527 till
                    1689; it was fifth among the free cities of the Rhine, and had a vote in the
                    Upper Rhenish diet. Numerous imperial diets assembled here. From 1801 till 1814
                    it was the capital of a department of France; but it was restored to Bavaria in
                    the latter year. By the peace of Spires in 1544 the Hapsburgs renounced their
                    claims to the crown of Sardinia.</p>
