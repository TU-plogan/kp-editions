                    the first dawn of history to the present time. It is said to have been a
                    Lelegian city before the Greek colonists settled in Asia Minor. The name, which
                    is said to be derived from an Amazon called Smyrna, is indubitably Anatolian,
                    having been applied also to a quarter of Ephesus, and (under the cognate form
                    Myrina) to a city of Aeolis, and to a tumulus in the Troad. The Aeolic settlers
                    of Lesbos and Cyme, pushing eastwards by Larissa and Neonteichus and over the
                    Hermus, seized the valley of Smyrna. It was the frontier city between Aeolis on
                    the north and Ionia on the south, and was more accessible on the south and east
                    than on the north and west. At the same time it was by virtue of its favourable
                    situation necessarily a commercial city, like the Ionian colonies. It is
                    therefore not surprising that the Aeolic element grew weaker; strangers or
                    refugees from the Ionian Colophon settled in the city, and finally Smyrna passed
                    into the hands of the Colophonians and became the thirteenth of the Ionian
                    states. The change had taken place before 688, when the Ionian Onomastus of
                    Smyrna won the boxing prize at<pb break="no"

                    The Colophonian conquest is mentioned by Mimnermus (before 600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who counts himself equally a Colophonian and a
                    Smyrnaean. The Aeolic form of the name, <hi rend="italic">∑µύρvα,</hi> was
                    retained even in the Attic dialect, and the epithet “Aeolian Smyrna” remained
                    long after the conquest. The favourable situation of Smyrna on the path of
                    commerce between Lydia and the west raised it during the 7th century to the
                    height of power and splendour. It lay at the eastern end of an arm of the sea,
                    which reached far inland and admitted the Greek trading ships into the heart of
                    Lydia. One of the great trade routes which cross Anatolia from east to west
                    descends the Hermus valley past Sardis, and then diverging from the valley
                    passes south of Mount Sipylus and crosses a low pass into the little valley,
                    about 7 miles long and 2 broad, where Smyrna lies between the mountains and the
                    sea. Miletus, and at a later time Ephesus, situated at the sea end of the other
                    great trade route across Anatolia, competed for a time successfully with</p>
                <p>Smyrna for the conveyance of traffic from the interior; but both Ephesus and
                    Miletus have long ago lost their harbours, and Smyrna now remains without a
                    rival. It was of necessity in close relation with the Lydians, and when the
                    Mermnad kings raised the</p>
                <p>Lydian power and aggressiveness it was one of the first points of attack.</p>
                <p>Gyges (687-653) was, however, defeated in a great battle on the banks of the</p>
                <p>Hermus; the situation of the battle field shows that the power of Smyrna extended
                    far to the east, and probably included the valley of Nymphaeum</p>
                <p>(Nif). A strong fortress, the ruins of whose ancient and massive walls are still
                    imposing, on a hill in the pass between Smyrna and Nymphaeum, was probably built
                    by the Smyrnaean</p>
                <p>Ionians to command the valley of</p>
                <p>Nymphaeum. According to the poet</p>
                <p>Theognis (about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), “pride de stroyed Smyrna.”
                    Mimnermus laments the degeneracy of the citizens of his day, who could no longer
                    stem the Ly dian advance. Finally, Alyattes (610-</p>
                <p>563) conquered the city, and Smyrna for 300 years lost its place in the list of
                    Greek cities. It did not entirely cease to exist, but the Greek life and
                    political unity were destroyed, and the Smyrnaean state was organized on the
                    village system (<hi rend="italic">ᾠκειτo κωµηδόν</hi>). It is mentioned in a
                    fragment of Pindar, about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and in an
                    inscription of 388 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A small fortification of early
                    style, rudely but massively built, on the lowest slope of a hill behind
                    Burnabat, is perhaps a fortified village of this period. Alexander the Great
                    conceived the idea of restoring the Greek city; the two Nemeses who were
                    worshipped at Smyrna are said to have suggested the idea to him in a dream. The
                    scheme was, according to Strabo, carried out by Antigonus (316-301), and
                    Lysimachus enlarged and fortified the city (301-281). The acropolis of the
                    ancient city had been on a steep peak about 1250 feet high, which overhangs the
                    north-eastern extremity of the gulf; its ruins still exist, probably in much the
                    same condition as they were left by Alyattes. The later city was founded on the
                    site which it still occupies, partly on the slopes of a rounded hill called
                    Pagus near the south-east end of the gulf, partly on the low ground between the
                    hill and the sea. The beauty of the city when seen from the sea, clustering on
                    the low ground and rising tier over tier on the hillside, is frequently praised
                    by the ancients and is celebrated on its coins; the same impression still
                    strikes the spectator, and must in ancient times have been much stronger, when
                    magnificent buildings, an imposing acropolis, and the wide circle of massive
                    walls combined with the natural scenery in one splendid picture. Smyrna is shut
                    in on the west by a hill now called Deirmen Tepe, with the ruins of a temple on
                    the summit. The walls of Lysimachus crossed the summit of this hill, and the
                    acropolis occupied the top of Pagus. Between the two the road from Ephesus
                    entered the city by the “Ephesian gate,” near which was a gymnasium. Closer to
                    the acropolis the outline of the stadium is still visible, and the theatre was
                    situated on the northern slopes of Pagus. The line of the walls on the eastern
                    side is unknown; but they certainly embraced a greater area than is included by
                    the Byzantine wall, which ascends the castle hill (Pagus) from the Basmakhané
                    railway station. Smyrna possessed two harbours,—the outer, which was simply the
                    gulf, and the inner, which was a small basin, with a narrow entrance closed by a
                    rope in case of need, about the place now occupied by bazaars. The inner harbour
                    was partially filled up by Timur in 1402, but it had not entirely disappeared
                    till the beginning of the 19th century. The modern quay has encroached
                    considerably on the sea, and the coast-line of the Greek time was about 90 yards
                    farther to the south. The streets were broad, well paved, and regularly laid out
                    at right angles; many were named after temples: the main street, called the
                    Golden, ran across the city from west to east, beginning probably from the
                    temple on Deirmen Tepe, and continuing towards Tepejik outside the city on the
                    east, where probably the temple of Cybele, the Metroon, stood. Cybele,
                    worshipped under the name of Meter Sipylene, from Mount Sipylus, which bounds
                    the Smyrna valley on the north,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n202/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0202-0187"/> was the tutelar goddess of the city. The plain
                    towards the sea was too low to be properly drained, and hence in rainy weather
                    the streets were deep with mud and water.</p>
                <p>The river Meles, which flowed by Smyrna, is famous in literature and was
                    worshipped in the valley. The most common and consistent tradition connects
                    Homer with the valley of Smyrna and the banks of the Meles; his figure was one
                    of the stock types on Smyrnaean coins, one class of which was called Homerian;
                    the epithet “Melesigenes” was applied to him; the cave where he was wont to
                    compose his poems was shown near the source of the river; his temple, the
                    Homereum, stood on its banks. The steady equable flow of the Meles, alike in
                    summer and winter, neither swollen after rain nor dry during drought, its
                    pleasant water, its short course, beginning and ending near the city, are
                    celebrated by Aristides and Himerius. The description applies admirably to the
                    stream which rises from abundant fountains, now known as Diana’s Bath, some way
                    to the east of the city, and flows into the south-eastern extremity of the gulf.
                    The common belief that the torrent, dry except after rains, which flows by
                    Caravan Bridge is the ancient Meles flatly contradicts the ancient
                    descriptions.</p>
                <p>In the Roman period Smyrna was the seat of a <hi rend="italic">conventus</hi>
                    which included southern Aeolis and great part of the Hermus valley. It vied with
                    Ephesus and Pergamum for the title “First (city) of Asia.” A Christian church
                    existed here from a very early time, having its origin in the considerable
                    Jewish colony. <hi rend="smallcaps">Polycarp (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>)
                    was bishop of Smyrna. The bishops of Smyrna were originally subject to the
                    metropolitan of Ephesus; afterwards they became independent (<hi rend="italic"
                    >αὐτoκέϕαλoι</hi>), and finally were honoured with metropolitan rank, having
                    under them the bishops of Phocaea, Magnesia ad Sipylum, Clazomenae, Sosandrus
                    (Nymphaeum?), Archangelus (Temnos?), and Petra (Menemen?).</p>
                <p>When Constantinople became the seat of government the trade between Anatolia and
                    the west lost in importance, and Smyrna declined apace. A Turkish freebooter
                    named Tsacha seized Smyrna in 1084 and maintained himself there for some time,
                    but it was recovered by the generals of Alexius Comnenus. The city was several
                    times afterwards ravaged by the Turks, and had become quite ruinous when the
                    emperor John Ducas Vatatzes about 1222 rebuilt it. The famous chieftain Aidin
                    conquered it about 1330 and made his son Amur governor. Soon afterwards the
                    knights of Saint John established themselves in the town, but failed to conquer
                    the citadel. In 1402 Timur stormed the town and massacred almost all the
                    inhabitants. The Mongol conquest was only temporary, but Smyrna has remained
                    till the present day in Mohammedan hands. It is now the greatest commercial city
                    in the Levant; its population is about 200,000, of whom nearly half are Greeks.
                    It is the terminus of the railway system which is gradually spreading over
                    Anatolia. Two lines start from Smyrna: one ascends the Hermus valley by Magnesia
                    and Sardis to Alashehr (Philadelphia), about 110 miles; the other goes south by
                    Ephesus to the Maeander valley beside Magnesia on the Maeander and then ascends
                    the valley to the neighbourhood of Laodicea on the Lycus, 143 miles. Since the
                    revival of the Levant trade by the Genoese and Venetians Smyrna has been the
                    emporium for the whole produce of Anatolia; the chief raw products exported are
                    valonea, figs, raisins, opium, madder, liquorice, cotton, sponges, emery,
                    &amp;c.; almost the only articles of native manufacture which are exported from
                    Smyrna are the carpets woven at Geurdiz, Coula, Ushak, and other places in the
                    interior. Smyrna has frequently been partially destroyed by earthquakes; that of
                    178 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> is the most famous, and in 1688, 1768, and
                    1880 the town suffered severely. (<hi rend="smallcaps">w. m. ra.)</hi></p>
