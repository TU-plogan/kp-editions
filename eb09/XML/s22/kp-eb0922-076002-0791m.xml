                <p><label type="entry">SWIFT</label>, a bird so called from the extreme speed of its
                    flight, which apparently exceeds that of any other British species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hirundo apus</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Cypselus apus
                    or muramus of</hi> modern ornithologists, who have at last learned that it has
                    only an outward resemblance but no near affinity to the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Swallow</hi><hi rend="italic">(ante,p.</hi> 729) or its allies. Well known as a
                    summer-visitor throughout the greater part of Europe, it is one of the latest to
                    return from Africa, and its stay in the country of its birth is of the shortest,
                    for it generally disappears from England very early in August, though
                    occasionally to be seen for even two months later.</p>
                <p>The Swift commonly chooses its nesting-place in holes under the eaves of
                    buildings, but a crevice in the face of a quarry, or even a hollow tree, will
                    serve it with the accommodation it requires. This indeed is not much, since
                    every natural function, except sleep, oviposition, and incubation, is performed
                    on the wing, and the easy evolutions of this bird in the air, where it remains
                    for hours together, are the admiration of all who witness them. Though
                    considerably larger than a Swallow, it can be recognized at a distance less by
                    its size than by its peculiar shape. The head scarcely projects from the
                    anterior outline of the pointed wings, which form an almost continuous curve, at
                    right angles to which extend the body and tail, resembling the handle of the
                    crescentic cutting-knife used in several trades, while the wings represent the
                    blade. The mode of flight of the two birds is also unlike, that of the Swift
                    being much more steady, and, rapid as it is, ordinarily free from jerks. The
                    whole plumage, except a greyish-white patch under the chin, is a sooty black,
                    but glossy above. Though its actual breeding-places are by no means numerous,
                    its extraordinary speed and discursive habits make the Swift widely distributed;
                    and throughout England scarcely a summer’s day passes without its being seen in
                    most places. A larger species, <hi rend="italic">C. melba</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">C. alpinus,</hi> with the lower parts dusky white, whieh has its
                    home in many of the mountainous parts of central and southern Europe, has
                    several times been observed in Britain, and two examples of a species of a very
                    distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Acanthyllis</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chaetura),</hi> which has its home in northern Asia, but regularly emigrates
                    thence to Australia, have been obtained in England (<hi rend="italic">Proc.
                    Zool. Society,</hi> 1880, p. 1).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This species, <hi rend="italic">A. caudacuta,</hi> has been
                    generally, but Mr Hume says <hi rend="italic">{Stray Feathers,</hi> ix. p. 230)
                    wrongly, identified with the <hi rend="italic">Ηirundo eiris</hi> of Pallas. So
                    many authors have recently ascribed the foundation of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaetura</hi> to Stephens in the year 1825 that it may not be
                    amiss to state that its origin dates only from 1826, the same year in which Boie
                    established the commensurate genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acanthyllis.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Among other peculiarities the Swifts, as long ago described (probably from John
                    Hunter’s notes) by Home (<hi rend="italic">Phil. Tran</hi> s., 1817, pp. 332 <hi
                    rend="italic">et seqq.,</hi> pl. xvi.), are remarkable for the development of
                    their salivary glands, the secretions of which serve in most species to glue
                    together the materials of which the nests are composed, and in the species of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Collocalia</hi> form almost the whole substance of
                    the structure. These are the “edible” nests so eagerly sought by Chinese
                    epicures as an ingredient for soup, and their composition, though announced many
                    years since by Home <hi rend="italic">{ut supra),</hi> whose statement was
                    confirmed by Bernstein <hi rend="italic">{Act. Soc. Sc. Indo-Néerlandicae,</hi>
                    iii. Art. 5, and <hi rend="italic">Journ, fur Ornithologie,</hi> 1859, pp.
                    111-119), has of late been needlessly doubted in favour of the popular belief
                    that they were made of some kind of sea-weed, <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> or
                    other vegetable matter collected by the birds.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence one species has been called <hi
                    rend="italic">Collocalia fuciphaga.</hi></p></note> It may be hoped that the
                    examination and analysis made by Mr J. R. Green <hi rend="italic">{Journal of
                    Physiology,</hi> vi. pp. 40-45) have settled that question for all time. These
                    remarkable nests consist essentially of mucus, secreted by the salivary glands
                    above mentioned, which dries and looks like isinglass. Their marketable value
                    depends on their colour and purity, for they are often intermixed with feathers
                    and other foreign substances. The Swifts that construct these “edible” nests
                    form a genus <hi rend="italic">Collocalia,</hi> of which the number of species
                    is uncertain; but they inhabit chiefly the islands of the Indian Ocean from the
                    north of Madagascar eastward, as well as many of the tropical<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0792-0761"/> islands of the Pacific so far as the
                    Marquesas,—one species occurring in the hill-country of India. They breed in
                    caves, to which they resort in great numbers, and occupy them jointly and yet
                    alternately with Bats—the mammals being the lodgers by day and the birds by
                    night.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr H. Pryer has
                    given one of the latest accounts of some of these caves in North Borneo (<hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1885, pp. 532-538), which may be read to
                    advantage.</p></note></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Cypselus,</hi> as noted by Willughby, with its
                    American ally <hi rend="italic">Panyptila,</hi> exhibits a form of pedal
                    structure not otherwise observed among birds. Not only is the hind-toe
                    constantly directed forwards, but the other three toes depart from the rule
                    which ordinarily governs the number of phalanges in the Bird’s foot,—a rule
                    which applies to even so ancient a form as <hi rend="italic">Archseopteryx</hi>
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 728),—and in the two
                    Cypseline genera just named the series of digital phalanges is 2, 3, 3, 3,
                    instead of 2, 3, 4, 5, which generally obtains in the Class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aves.</hi> Other Swifts, however, do not depart from the normal arrangement,
                    and the exception, remarkable as it is, must not be taken as of more value than
                    is needed for the recognition of two sections or subgenera admitted by Mr
                    Sclater in his monographical essay on the Family (Proc. <hi rend="italic">Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1865, pp. 593-617). There seem to be about half a dozen good
                    genera of <hi rend="italic">Cypselidae,</hi> and from fifty to sixty species.
                    Their geographical distribution is much the same as that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hirundinidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Swallow,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ut supra);</hi> but it should be always and most clearly borne in
                    mind that, though so like Swallows in many respects, the Swifts have scarcely
                    any part of their structure which is not formed on a different plan; and,
                    instead of any near affinity existing between the two groups, it can scarcely be
                    doubted by any unprejudiced investigator that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypselidae</hi> not only differ far more from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirundinidae</hi> than the latter do from any other Family of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres,</hi> but that they belong to what in the present state of ornithology
                    must be deemed a distinct Order of Birds—that which in the present series of
                    articles has been called <hi rend="italic">Picarae.</hi> That the relations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cypselidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Trochilidae
                    (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Humming-Bird,</hi> vol, xii. pp. 357 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi> are close, as has been asserted by L’Herminie and
                    Nitzsch, Dr Burmeister and Prof. Huxley, is denied by Dr Shufeldt <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1885, pp. 886-914), but the views of
                    the last have since been controverted by Mr F. Lucas <hi rend="italic"
