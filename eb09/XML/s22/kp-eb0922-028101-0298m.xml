                    and the same year wrote several Latin verses to congratulate Cromwell on
                    concluding peace with the Dutch, which were published in a collection of
                    university poems. The following year he published a Latin poem, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Musica Incantans.</hi> After commencing M.A. in 1657 he was in the
                    habit before obtaining orders in 1658 of preaching as the champion of Calvinism
                    against Socinianism and Arminianism. He was also at this time a strong supporter
                    of Presbyterianism, but on the approach of the Restoration his views on church
                    government under-<pb break="no"

                    the triumphant party as represented by Cromwell, Charles, James, and William,
                    and there are substantial grounds for the assertion of Anthony Wood that he was
                    much indebted for his preferments to his zeal for “the powers that be.” On 10th
                    August 1660 he was chosen public orator of the university, and in 1661 domestic
                    chaplain to Lord Clarendon. In March 1663 he was made prebend of Westminster,
                    and shortly afterwards he received from his university the degree of D.D. In
                    1667 he became chaplain to the duke of York. He was a zealous advocate of the
                    doctrine of passive obedience, and also strongly opposed the Toleration Act,
                    declaiming in unmeasured terms against the various nonconformist sects. In 1676
                    he was appointed chaplain to Lawrence Hyde (afterwards earl of Rochester),
                    ambassador-extraordinary to the king of Poland, and of his visit he sent an
                    interesting account to Dr Edward Pocock in a letter, dated Dantzic, 16th
                    December 1677, which was printed along with South’s <hi rend="italic">Posthumous
                    Works</hi> in 1717. In 1678 he was promoted by the chapter of Westminster to the
                    rectory of Islip, Oxfordshire. Owing, it is said, to a personal grudge, South in
                    1693 published <hi rend="italic">Animadversions on Dr Sherlock’s Book, entitled
                    a Vindication of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity,</hi> in which the views of
                    Sherlock were attacked with much sarcastic bitterness. Sherlock, in answer,
                    published a <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> in 1694, to which South replied in
                    <hi rend="italic">Tritheism Charged upon Dr Sherlock's New Notion of the
                    Trinity, and the Charge Made Good.</hi> The controversy was carried by the rival
                    parties into the pulpit, and occasioned such keen feeling that the king
                    interposed to stop it. During the greater part of the reign of Anne South
                    remained comparatively quiet, but in 1710 he showed himself a keen opponent of
                    Sacheverell. He died 8th July 1716, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>The style of South is vigorous, pungent, and brilliant, though tending to
                    exuberance. His sermons are strongly practical, but his theory of life is not
                    ascetic. His wit generally inclines towards sarcasm, and it was probably the
                    knowledge of his quarrelsome temperament that prevented his promotion to a
                    bishopric. If he sacrificed principle to his desire for preferment, his ambition
                    was not of a sordid kind, for he was noted for the extent of his charities. He
                    published a large number of single sermons, and they appeared in a collected
                    form in 1692 in six volumes, reaching a second edition in his lifetime in 1715.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Opera Posthuma Latina,</hi> including his will, his Latin
                    poems, and his orations while public orator, with memoirs of his life, appeared
                    in 1717. His <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> were published with a memoir by the
                    Clarendon press in 1823, and have been several times reprinted. The contemporary
                    notice of South by Wood in his <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi> is characterized
                    by a strongly hostile tone, partly to be explained by a criticism of South at
                    Wood’s expense.</p>
