                    parents, who claimed descent from Spartan kings, at Cyrene about 375. While

                    Pentapolis to the imperial court to ask for remission of taxation and other
                    relief. His stay in Constantinople, which lasted three years, was wearisome and
                    otherwise disagreeable; the leisure it forced upon him he devoted in part to
                    literary composition (see his <hi rend="italic">De Providentia).</hi> The
                    oration he delivered when at last admitted to the presence of Arcadius is also
                    extant (<hi rend="italic">De Regno).</hi> Returning abruptly to Cyrene in 400,
                    he spent the next ten years partly in that city, when unavoidable business
                    called him there, but chiefly on an estate in the interior of the province,
                    where<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n848/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0848-0813"/> he was able to enjoy the literary leisure that
                    was most congenial to him, varying his studies with gardening and hunting and
                    the quiet pleasures of domestic life. His marriage took place at Alexandria in
                    403; in the previous year he had visited Athens. In 409 or 410 Synesius, whose
                    Christianity had until then been by no means very pronounced, was popularly
                    chosen to be bishop of Ptolemais, and, after long hesitation on personal and
                    doctrinal grounds, he ultimately accepted the office thus thrust upon him, being
                    consecrated by Theophilus at Alexandria. One personal difficulty at least was
                    obviated by his being allowed to retain his wife, to whom he was much attached;
                    but as regarded orthodoxy he expressly stipulated for personal freedom to
                    dissent on the questions of the soul’s creation, a literal resurrection, and the
                    final destruction of the world, while at the same time he agreed to make some
                    concession to popular views in his public teaching (<hi rend="italic">τὰ μὲv
                    οἴκοι φιλοσόφων, τά δ’ ἔξω φιλομαθών).</hi> His tenure of the bishopric, which
                    was comparatively brief, was troubled not only by domestic bereavements but also
                    by barbaric invasions of the country, and by conflicts with the prefect
                    Andronicus, whom he excommunicated for interfering with the church’s right of
                    asylum. The date of his death is unknown, but he died probably not later than
                    414.</p>
