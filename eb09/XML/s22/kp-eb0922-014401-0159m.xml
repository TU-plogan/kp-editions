                    Asiatic frontier of Russia, we shall find their language the dominant tongue of
                    Galicia and all the southern parts of Russia till we come to the Caucasus. It is
                    also spoken in a strip of territory in the north of Hungary. (c) The White

                    those in Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola, amounting to 1,287,000.</p>

                <p>Total number of Slavs in both divisions 89,499,683.</p>
                <p>Originally the Slavs were spread over a great part of northern Germany, extending
                    as far as Utrecht, which was anciently called Wiltaburg and was a city of the
                    Wilzen. Thus Slavonic was certainly spoken in Pomerania, Mecklenburg,
                    Brandenburg, Saxony, west Bohemia, Lower Austria, the greater part of Upper
                    Austria, north Styria and north Carinthia, a large part of what is now Hungary,
                    and in the localities now occupied by Kiel, Lübeck, Magdeburg, Halle, Leipsic
                    (=Lipsk, the city of lime-trees), Baireuth, Linz, Salzburg, Gratz (=Gradetz,
                    Gorodetz), and Vienna. The names of the old Slavonic tribes originally settled
                    in these parts of Germany are given in Schafarik’s <hi rend="italic">Slawische
                    Alterthümer,</hi> to which work the reader desiring further information must be
                    referred. They are mentioned frequently in such writers as Helmold, Dietmar,
                    Arnold, Wittekind, and others. We hear of a commercial city of importance, which
                    some writers have rather fantastically termed the Slavonic Amsterdam, called
                    Wolin, on an island of the same name, which was known as Winetha to the Germans
                    and as Julin to the Danes. Schafarik even wished to see the Slavonic tribe of
                    the Wilzen in English Wiltshire. This, however, cannot be accepted; the original
                    name is Wilsaetas and that of the town Wil-tun, the town on the river Wily. It
                    has long been a generally received opinion that the modern Greeks have a large
                    Slavonic admixture. This opinion was boldly asserted some years ago by
                    Fallmerayer and has not been upset even by the labours of M. Sathas. He dwells
                    much upon the form <hi rend="italic">∑θλαβηvoι</hi> as distinct from <hi
                    rend="italic">Σκλαβηvoι;</hi> but this corruption seems to be owing to some such
                    false analogy as <hi rend="italic">εσθλός</hi>. Miklosich, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Etymologisches Wörterbuch der slawischen Sprachen</hi> (1886),
                    considers the two forms to be identical. In like fashion Procopius connects
                    Serbi with Σπόροι and Constantine Porphyrogenitus turns Svatopluk into <hi
                    rend="italic">Σϕεvδόπλoκoς</hi>. Mediaeval Greece, especially the Peloponnesus,
                    abounded with Slavonic names, which are now being replaced by others drawn from
                    classical sources. Kollar and Wolanski wished to find a Slavonic population in
                    Italy; but their opinions are considered the wild dreams of unscientific
                    patriots, though these views found their way into such works as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Varronianus</hi> of Dr Donaldson. Equally unfounded appears to be
                    the belief that a Slavonic element may be traced in Spain and Asia Minor. If the
                    Slavs have lost in the west of Europe, they have gained in the east
                    considerably, as Russia has encroached upon the Ugro-Finnish tribes of the
                    northern and eastern portions of its empire, and many of these races are now in
                    various stages of Russification.</p>
                <p>As to the original home of the Slavonic race there are three leading opinions
                    :—(1) the Slavs settled in Europe at a period contemporaneous with or shortly
                    after the arrival of the Teutonic and other Indo-European families; (2) they
                    first made their appearance in Europe with the Huns, Avars, and other Asiatic
                    barbarians in the 3d century after Christ; (3) they originated in Europe, as did
                    the so-called Indo-European race altogether. This last view has been maintained
                    by Penka<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Origines Ariacae,</hi> Vienna, 1883.</p></note> and Schrader<note

                    >Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte,</hi> 1885.</p></note> (see below).</p>
                <p>The first of these views has been supported by Schafarik. He considers that the
                    Slavs left Asia in very early times for the following reasons :—(<hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>) the fact that the Slavonic languages are more closely
                    connected with European tongues than with those of Asia, even granting the many
                    affinities of Slavonic with Zend or (as has been recently shown by Hübschmann)
                    with Armenian; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the similarity of the manners and
                    customs of the Slavs to those of the Celts, Germans, and other European
                    populations; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the occurrence of many mountains,
                    rivers, and towns having Slavonic names which are mentioned long before the
                    Slavs themselves are found in history; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the fact that
                    the Slavs are always spoken of by the earlier writers in terms which show that
                    these writers considered them to be an ancient European nation, and were struck
                    with the large area over which their populations extended. Moreover, the arrival
                    at a comparatively late period of such large hordes would have made a great
                    impression upon the surrounding nations at the time, and this would certainly
                    have found an echo in their historians and chroniclers.</p>
                <p>Schafarik believes that the Slavs or Wends (as they were called by their Teutonic
                    neighbours) were settled at a very early period on the southern coast of the
                    Baltic. The word “Wend” he connects with a Slavonic (v <hi rend="italic"
                    >oda)</hi> and Lithuanian <hi rend="italic">(wandů)</hi> root meaning “water”;
                    thus it would signify the people dwelling about the water. He appears to include
                    under the Slavs all people bearing the name Wends, notably the Veneti on the
                    Adriatic. Other writers, however, consider that the word was applied generally
                    to any maritime people; and this view appears probable. The name also occurs in
                    Switzerland. The Wends then, according to Schafarik, were the earliest
                    inhabitants of the Baltic coast; but they were expelled by the Goths in the 4th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Nestor makes other tribes of Slavs to
                    have been established at an early period on the Danube and to have been driven
                    thence by the Vlachs, a people whom scholars are inclined to identify with the
                    Latin colonists from whom in a great measure the modern Roumans are descended.
                    We find other tribes settled in the neighbourhood of the Carpathians. The first
                    historian who relates anything about the Slavs is probably Herodotus, whose
                    account of the north of Europe is very vague. Among the Scythian tribes
                    mentioned by him two have been<pb break="no"

                    considerable probability,—the Budini and the Neuri. Of the former we are told
                    that they were a large nation and had blue eyes and red hair. The description of
                    the country they inhabited corresponds pretty closely to Volhynia and portions
                    of White Russia. The Neuri are placed by Schafarik on the river Bug, which flows
                    through Podolia. There at the present day we find a river named Nureff, and the
                    surrounding country is called Nurska. This opinion is supported by Schrader, who
                    places the original home of the Slavs in Scythia. Pösche<note anchored="true"

                    historischen Anthropologie,</hi> Jena, 1878.</p></note> goes so far as to
                    consider the eastern part of Europe—especially that portion of Russia which
                    constitutes the basin of the Pripet, the Beresina, and the Dnieper—as the
                    primary abode of the Indo-European race. Dr Kurd von Schlözer interprets Herod.
                    iv. § 6— the story of Targitaus and his three children—as an allusion to the
                    Slavs. The falling of a plough with its yoke from heaven would hardly be a
                    characteristic tale of a nomad people. We seem to have an echo of the stories of
                    the peasants Mikoula, Selianinovich, Piast, and Přemysl, all dear to Slavonic
                    legend. The view that the ancestors of the Slavs are to be found among the
                    Scythian tribes has been supported in recent times by the Russian author
                    Zabielin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, however,
                    the arguments on the other side in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Scythia.</hi></p></note> He also thinks that their original settlement was in
                    Volhynia and White Russia. The specimens of the Scythian language which have
                    come down in Herodotus and elsewhere can certainly best be explained by
                    Indo-European roots. The name Slav does not occur in any writer before the time
                    of Jordanes, unless it be in the <hi rend="italic">∑τavavoί</hi> of Ptolemy.
                    Jordanes says of them—“quorum nomina licet nunc per varias familias et loca
                    mutentur, principaliter tamen Sclavini et Antes.” It is probably connected with
                    the root <hi rend="italic">slovo,</hi> “the word,” which is related to the Greek
                    κλύω (Slav. <hi rend="italic">slît,</hi> “to be called”); and in a Polabish
                    vocabulary we get the form <hi rend="italic">slivo.</hi> The Slav thus comes to
                    mean “the intelligibly speaking man” in contrast to “the dumb man,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Niemetz,</hi> which in the modern Slavonic languages has come to
                    mean simply “German.” Miklosich <hi rend="italic">(Etym. Wörterb.)</hi> thinks
                    that the termination <hi rend="italic">-ene</hi> in Slovene shows the word to be
                    derived from the name of a place and rejects the explanation from <hi
                    rend="italic">slovo.</hi> Some Slavonic scholars have sought an explanation of
                    the name in the word <hi rend="italic">slava,</hi> “glory.”</p>
                <p>Penka,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Op. cit.,</hi> p. 126.</p></note> however, attempts to upset the ordinary
                    etymology. According to him the Slavs are non-Aryan and belong rather to the
                    Ugro-Finnish race. Their name, he tells us, shows that they were subjected by
                    the Aryans and became their dependants. He considers it to be derived from the
                    present participle of the root <hi rend="italic">klu (“</hi> to hear,” Slav. <hi
                    rend="italic">slî),</hi> and thus identifies it with “client.” The name Wend is
                    used by Tacitus, who speaks of the Peucini, the Venedi, and the Fenni. Ptolemy
                    also alludes to the Wendic mountains. He tells us that Sarmatia, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all the territory east of the Vistula and north of
                    Dacia, was inhabited by widely scattered races and that the Wenedae were
                    established along the whole of the Wendish gulf. Jordanes calls them Winidae.
                    The other name, Antes, applied by this historian to the Slavs, which, like the
                    word Wend, they never used themselves, Schafarik connects with a Gothic root.
                    Duchinski, Henri Martin, and others have denied to the Russians the right of
                    being called Aryan. Penka,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Op. cit.,</hi> p. 125.</p></note> as stated before,
                    carries this opinion much further and refuses the appellation to the whole
                    Slavonic family. Finding that many of the Slavs have chestnut-coloured curly
                    hair and dark eyes, that the White Russians are blond, that the southern Slavs
                    are darker and have a shorter head than those in the north, he is inclined to
                    see in the Slavs a very mixed race, and quotes Procopius<note anchored="true"

                    Elbe, Moldau, Sale, Spree, as also those living south of the Danube, were not
                    living in juxtaposition in the Bronze Age, but wandered into those regions some
                    centuries after the birth of Christ. In proof of this assertion he cites many
                    names of objects which are common to the Slavonic languages and yet could not
                    have been known to any people in the Bronze Period,—as, for example, iron (O.S.

                    dwelt together in a comparatively narrow space,— according to Wocel between the
                    Baltic, the Vistula, and the Dnieper; otherwise, according to this author, if we
                    suppose that the Lutitzes, Obotrites, Sorbs, and Chekhs were autochthonous, it
                    is difficult to see how they could have had the same names for many objects
                    which did not exist in the Bronze Age, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> iron, as the
                    Slavs on the Dnieper, the Balkans, and the Adriatic had. Wocel considers the
                    Slavs to have been a pastoral people who entered Europe through the passes of
                    the Caucasus. He compares the agricultural words which all branches of the
                    family have in common, as <hi rend="italic">ploug,</hi> "plough” (and also <hi
                    rend="italic">ralo); lemesh,</hi> “ploughshare”; <hi rend="italic">zhito,</hi>
                    “corn”; <hi rend="italic">pshenitze,</hi> “wheat”; <hi rend="italic"

                    as Wocel maintains, objects connected with civilization the knowledge of which
                    only dates from the introduction of Christianity have not a common name in the
                    Slavonic languages, such as “paper,” “pavement,” “steel,” “velvet,” &amp;c. So
                    also there is no common term for “property” or “inheritance,” for the simple
                    reason that the Slavs knew nothing of private property,—the land being held in
                    common under the care of the <hi rend="italic">vladika</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    that the minute details of house-building point to a habit of living in fixed
                    residences,—thus the house <hi rend="italic">(dom),</hi> the stable <hi

                    of Hehn, who contends that all the words used among the Slavs for stone
                    buildings are borrowed, and seeks to prove that till comparatively<pb break="no"

                    and led a half nomadic life. Certainly municipal institutions are no feature of
                    Slavonic life, and the paucity of large towns in Russia is striking even at the
                    present day. According to Kreck, words are to be found very early which show the
                    development of the nation from the family. Thus the commune (o <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Leaving now the attempts to determine the primitive home of the Slavs and the
                    date of their immigration into Europe, and also the names which they have in
                    common, whether used by themselves or given by foreigners, we will trace as far
                    as possible the derivation of the chief appellations of the Slavonic peoples.
                    (1) <hi rend="italic">Russians.—</hi> For an analysis of this name see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Russia</hi> (vol. xxi. p. 87 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> (2)
                    <hi rend="italic">Bulgarians.—By</hi> the 3d century we find Slavs settled
                    between the Danube and the Balkans. Immigrations were going on till the middle
                    of the 7th century, as these hordes were driven southwards by new invaders.
                    About 681 the Slavonic settlers fell under the yoke of the Bulgarians, a
                    Ugro-Finnish race, if we accept the views of Schafarik, Drinoff, and others. The
                    origin of the Bulgarians themselves is obscure. Some have made them Tatars.
                    Professor Ilovaiski believes them to have been Slavs. The theory which connects
                    the name “Bulgarian,” “Bolgare,” with the Volga is now no longer held. Early
                    modifications of the name, such as Burgari, Wurgari, &amp;c., show its analogy
                    with forms like Onoguri, Uturguri, Kutriguri. The elements of the word are <hi
                    rend="italic">bul</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gari.</hi> Professor Vambéry
                    attempts to derive the name from the Turkish verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulga-mak,</hi> “to revolt”; but this seems little better than a guess. We are
                    told that Koubrat, a Bulgarian prince, made himself independent of the Avars,
                    and that on his death his territories were divided among his five sons. The
                    eldest remained in the ancient settlement on the Volga, where the ruins of their
                    former capital, Bolgari, are still to be seen. The third son, Asparoukh, crossed
                    the Dnieper and the Dniester, and settled in a place called Onklus, probably the
                    Old Slavonic <hi rend="italic">ongl, “</hi> angulus,”</p>

                    localities which they have since occupied, where they became mixed with the
                    original settlers, to whom they gave their name, just as the German Franks
                    imposed theirs on the Gauls, and a branch of the Slavonians took the Finnish
                    name of their conquerors.</p>

                    >Chekhs.—</hi></p>
                <p>The word “Bohemia ”—“home of the Boii,” a Celtic tribe —has nothing to do with
                    the Slavs who came into the country about 495, after the Marcomanni, who had
                    dispossessed the Boii. The derivation of the name “Chekh” or Czech has never
                    been satisfactorily traced. Dobrovsky sought to connect it with a word <hi
                    rend="italic">četi,</hi> signifying “to begin,” and thus makes the name imply
                    the original inhabitants. Schafarik, however, does not endorse this etymology.
                    Perwolf<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Arch. f. slaw. Phil.,</hi> vii. 622.</p></note> connects it with a
                    root <hi rend="italic">čak, “</hi> to beat,” and thus makes the name mean “the
                    warriors.” Whatever the word “Chekh” may signify, it occurs, as Schafarik has
                    shown, in other Slavonic countries. (7) <hi rend="italic">Lusatian Wends</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Sorbs.—</hi> The word “Lusatia” (German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lausitz)</hi> is derived from the Slavonic <hi rend="italic">lug</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">luza,</hi> signifying a low, marshy country.</p>

                <p>This division, however, has been repeatedly challenged. Schleicher insisted upon
                    the two following as important principles: (1) primitive Slavonic <hi

                    dialects <hi rend="italic">dz</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> (<hi rend="italic"

                    western dialects, but disappear in the south-eastern. Upon this last canon

                    round.’” He also criticizes two of the principles of difference given by
                    Schafarik. The nom. sing. masc. of pronouns appears in western Slavonic to be
                    increased by <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, thus Chekh, Polish, Lower Sorb, <hi
                    rend="italic">ten</hi>; Upper Sorbish, <hi rend="italic">ton</hi>; Polabish, <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi>; this, however, occurs in the Freisingian monuments, the
                    earliest form of Slovenish, as ton. This <hi rend="italic">n</hi> belongs to the
                    stem, and is not a particle which has become fused with it; <hi rend="italic"
                    >ten, ton</hi>, original form <hi rend="italic">t'n</hi>, correspond to the Old
                    Prussian <hi rend="italic">tans</hi>. The use of the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">vi</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">iz</hi> is not a criterion;
                    <hi rend="italic">vî</hi> is as much used in Russian as in west Slavonic, thus

                    Slovenish; it is only in Bulgarian and Servian that it is entirely wanting. The

                <p>Various opinions have been held as to what languages are to be considered the
                    closest congeners of the Slavonic branch. That they stand in intimate relations
                    to Lithuanian and Lettish has long been agreed; and as a convenient
                    classification it is customary to speak of them together as the Litu-Slavic
                    family. In Russia there are 1,900,000 Lithuanians (including the Samogitians or
                    Zhmudes). There are also 1,100,000 Letts. The rest of the Lithuanians, numbering
                    146,312, are in Eastern Prussia, commencing not far from Königsberg and
                    extending along the shores of the Kurisches Haff. The Lithuanian language in
                    many respects exhibits an earlier type than the Slavonic. It has preserved the
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> of the nominative singular, as in Sanskrit; but, on the
                    other hand, the verb exhibits a much poorer form. As Leskien truly remarks,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Prοc. Phil.
                    Sοc.,</hi> 1877, p. 49.</p></note> “it has degenerated most remarkably in its
                    conjugation, and in this respect is far inferior to the oldest known Slavonic.”
                    He adds that Lithuanian is of primary importance in the comparative treatment of
                    the Slavonic languages. Very closely connected with Lithuanian was Old Prussian,
                    which died out in the 16th century; the remains which have come down to us
                    belong to the 15th and 16th centuries. Old Prussian extended from the lower
                    Vistula (from Thorn downwards) to the Niemen. The exact course of the
                    boundary-line which separated it from Lithuanian can only be approximately
                    determined by historical arguments. Leskien has proposed “Baltic” as a generic
                    name for Lithuanian, Lettish, and Prussian. The general opinion of philologists
                    is that Litu-Slavic is most closely connected with the Germanic branch of the
                    Indo-European family. Jacob Grimm was the first to assert this. Hübschmann has
                    shown that Slavonic has affinities with Armenian, and he seeks to make the
                    latter language a link between the European and Asiatic branches of this family.
                    Kuhn<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zur ältesten Gesch. d. indοg. Völker,</hi> Berlin, 1845, p. 324.</p></note>
                    writes, “The Slavonic languages remained a longer time in close connexion with
                    the Indian or more probably with the Zend and Persian than with the remaining
                    Indo-</p>
                <p>European languages.” Bopp regards the separation of the Litu-Slavic languages as
                    having taken place before the division of the Asiatic branch of the family into
                    Indian and Iranian.</p>
                <p>If we examine the Old or Palaeo-Slavonic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Sometimes called “the church language.”</p></note> the
                    oldest known form of the Slavonic languages, we may note the following
                    characteristics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Hovelacque, <hi rend="italic">Science of Language,</hi> p. 280, London,

                    guttural <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> a short <hi rend="italic">e</hi> sometimes
                    pronounced as <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> and the semi-mutes <hi rend="italic"
                    >ĭ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ŭ.</hi> It has also two nasals equivalent to the
                    French <hi rend="italic">in</hi> and <hi rend="italic">on,</hi> now only found
                    in Polish and Kashoubish, and in some of the Bulgarian dialects; traces of them,
                    however, occur in Slovenish and in the words which Magyar has borrowed from
                    Slovenish.</p>
                <p>The Aryan diphthongs have been contracted to single vowels and the hiatus is
                    frequently avoided by the interposition of <hi rend="italic">j</hi> ( = Eng. <hi
                    rend="italic">y)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> both of which constantly
                    occur at the beginning of words which formerly commenced with a vowel. The
                    addition of a <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sound before vowels is one of the great
                    characteristics of the Slavonic languages, called “praeiotization”; and the
                    inability to mark this distinctly is one of the deficiencies of the Cyrillic
                    alphabet. It is also worthy of note that in the provincial dialects <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> is frequently put before vowels, as by the lower classes in
                    Bohemia and Russia. The Aryan aspirates <hi rend="italic">gh, dh, bh</hi> have
                    been changed into the simple explosives <hi rend="italic">g, d, b</hi>; on the
                    other hand, a number of fricatives have been developed, as <hi rend="italic">sh,
                    z,</hi> and the French <hi rend="italic">j—</hi> all unknown to the common
                    Aryan—and <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is frequently changed to the palatal <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi>. Servo-Croatian, Slovenish, Slovakish, and Bohemian
                    possess the vocal <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> while the vocal <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> is found in both Bohemian and Slovakish. The latter has also <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, both short and long.</p>
                <p>As regards grammar, the following peculiarities of the Slavonic family may be
                    noted. A trace of the article exists in the adjectival termination, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">velik-i</hi>; but this has been forgotten, and attempts have been
                    made to supply it in the use of the demonstrative pronoun in Sorbish, which
                    appears to have been used in the more corrupt stages of Slovenish also, but has
                    been expelled since the regeneration of the language. Primus Truber, who
                    translated the New Testament into Slovenish in the 16th century, was not free
                    from this vice. The languages being in a high state of synthesis, the nouns and
                    adjectives are fully declined, having three genders and seven cases, —the
                    nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, instrumental, and
                    prepositional. Sorbish and Slovenish have the dual number in both nouns and
                    verbs. More of the numerals are declined than in most Aryan languages. The verbs
                    have the so-called aspects, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the iterative, perfect,
                    imperfect, &amp;c., whereby very delicate shades of meaning are expressed, and
                    this partly atones for the poverty of tenses in some of them: Russian, for
                    example, has only one past tense, which is inflected according to gender, having
                    been originally a past participle. Traces of these verbal aspects have been
                    detected in Celtic and in Greek.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to classify the Slavonic languages according to their dialects.

                    Siberian Russian is spoken by the descendants of prisoners and convicts who have
                    settled in that vast tract of northern Asia since Yermak conquered it for Ivan

                    the southern governments of Russia. As current in Galicia and Bukovina it is
                    called Red Russian; an interesting variety is the Gouzoulian dialect in which

                    Partitzki of Lemberg the Ruthenish-German portion never appeared; the
                    vocabularies of Piskunoff and Verkhratzki are but fragmentary. A good
                    dictionary, however, is now in course of publication by Professor Żelechowski of
                    Stanislau, which promises to be all that could be desired. The orthography of
                    Malo or Little Russian is not yet settled. A peculiar type is used for some of
                    the books issued at Lemberg, especially the excellent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chitanka</hi> (Reading Book) of Alexander Barvinski. An altogether whimsical
                    orthography was adopted by Hatzouk in his <hi rend="italic">Ouzhinok Ridnogo

                <p>The following are some of the chief characteristics which mark off the Little
                    from the Great Russian language. The G. R. <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> passes into
                    <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">povist</hi> = <hi rend="italic"
                    >poviest,</hi> L. R. <hi rend="italic">richka</hi> = G. R. <hi rend="italic"
                    >riechka</hi>; <hi rend="italic">o</hi> undergoes the same mutation, especially
                    in monosyllables, L.R. <hi rend="italic">pid</hi> = <hi rend="italic">G.B.
                    pod,</hi> L.R. <hi rend="italic">kin</hi> = <hi rend="italic">G.</hi> R. <hi
                    rend="italic">kon,</hi> L.R. <hi rend="italic">vivsa</hi> = <hi rend="italic"
                    >G.B. ovsa,</hi> where we may note the tendency to put <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    before the initial vowel already alluded to. The Russian <hi rend="italic"
                    >ou</hi> is changed into L.R. <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vice versa,</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">vmirayou</hi> = G. R. <hi rend="italic"
                    >oumirayou; ouchora,</hi> on the other hand, is G. R. <hi rend="italic"
                    >vchcra.</hi> The Russian <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi>; the strong ł (Polish <hi rend="italic">l</hi>) is changed
                    (especially at the end of a word or before other consonants) into <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ou,</hi> thus G. R. <hi rend="italic"
                    >pisal,</hi> L. R. <hi rend="italic">pisaou.</hi> The Russian î is wanting, and
                    L.R. changes the Old Slavonic <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> and French <hi rend="italic">j</hi>
                    offener than Russian does. In the conjugations and declensions Little very much
                    resembles Great Russian. It has, however, like Polish, lost the present
                    participle passive, which is retained in Russian, and it possesses infinitive
                    forms with diminutive meanings. Moreover, the accent differs considerably from
                    Russian. The peculiarities of the Little Russian spoken in the north of Hungary
                    are fully treated by De Voilant in his <hi rend="italic">Ougrο-Rοusskia Narodnîa
                    Piesni</hi> (Ugro-Russian Popular Songs), St Petersburg, 1885.</p>
                <p>White Russian abounds with Polonisms, and in its orthography expresses the
                    unaccented Russian <hi rend="italic">o</hi> as <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which
                    is in accordance with the pronunciation; thus we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >starana</hi> for <hi rend="italic">storona, kago</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >kogo.</hi> As in Malo-Russian, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">aharod,</hi> “a garden”; gutturals
                    are softened before <hi rend="italic">ie,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">na
                    routzie,</hi> “on the hand.” The collection of poems published at Vilna in 1844,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Piosnki Wie'sniacze</hi> (Rustic Songs), in what is
                    called the Krevichian dialect, is in reality White Russian. There is a good
                    White Russian dictionary by Nosovich.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bulgarian.—</hi> Connected with the Bulgarian division is the
                    difficult question as to which of the Slavonic languages, ancient or modern,
                    exhibits the earliest form. The original tongue is, of course, lost, and only an
                    elder sister remains, but to which language shall that title be assigned? In the
                    early days of Slavonic philology many curious ideas prevailed on this point.
                    According to the old-fashioned views the church language was the old and stately
                    mothertongue from which all the living dialects had sprung. Russians considered
                    it to be Old Russian, Serbs Old Servian, and those who used the Glagolitic
                    ritual held it to be Old Croatian. These opinions were very natural. The
                    fragments of the Old Slovenish language had not yet been found at Freising, and
                    the only accessible manuscripts in the infantine state of the study of Slavistic
                    were recent ones, in which Russian, Servian, and Croatian forms were mixed. The
                    Russians had forgotten many of their historical traditions during their long
                    servitude under the Mongols, and the same was the case with the Serbs and
                    Bulgarians under the yoke of the Turks. The names of Cyril and Methodius were
                    hardly remembered. The two precursors of Dobrovsky, but of inferior intellectual
                    calibre, were the Bohemian Fort. Durich (1738-1802), who was the first to have
                    sound views on the relations of Old Slavonic to the later languages, and the
                    Russian Kalaidovich (1792-1832), who threw considerable light on the question by
                    his edition of the works of John, the exarch of Bulgaria. He, however,
                    considered the Palaeo-Slavonic to be Old Moravian. But the foundation of
                    Slavonic scholarship was laid by Dobrovsky (1753-1829) and Vostokoff
                    (1781-1864); the former treated the subject scientifically in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutiones Linguae Slavieae Dialecti Veteris</hi> (Vienna,
                    1822), and the latter edited the <hi rend="italic">Ostromir Codex,</hi> a
                    Palaeo-Slavonic manuscript of the Gospels, written in Russia in the 11th
                    century. Dobrovsky at first considered Palaeo-</p>
                <p>Slavonic to be Old Servian, afterwards an early language out of which both
                    Servian and Bulgarian were formed. Vostokoff was nearer the truth when he
                    discovered elements of Old Slovenish.</p>
                <p>The views held by scholars with regard to the country from which the
                    Palaeo-Slavonic, as preserved to us, has come may be briefly stated as follows.
                    (1) It is Old Bulgarian. This opinion has been held by Schleicher, Schafarik, J.
                    Schmidt, and Leskien. In the latter part of his life Schafarik<note

                    Ursprung und die Heimath des Glagolitismus,</hi> Prague, 1858.</p></note>
                    appears to have somewhat modified his views and to have looked upon it as a
                    mixture of Bulgarian and Slovenish. (2) It is Old Slovenish, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the older form of the language now spoken in Styria, Carinthia, and
                    a part of southern Hungary. This opinion was first held by Kopitar and
                    afterwards by his pupil Miklosich. Among its supporters may also be mentioned
                    Danichich and Jagić. (3) Geitler,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    theory that the Russian language is a much earlier form of Slavonic than Old
                    Slovenish. The case for Old Slovenish is clearly put by Miklosich<note

                    >Altslovenische Formenlehre in Paradigmen,</hi> Vienna, 1874.</p></note> as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>“So far as the linguistic grounds of the Bulgarian hypothesis are concerned, it
                    is undoubtedly true that Old Slovenish [Palaeo-Slavonic] agrees with a dialect
                    of Bulgarian with regard to the combinations <hi rend="italic">št</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">žd</hi>, whereas the Carinthian (Carantanian) Slovenish employs
                    generally <hi rend="italic">č</hi> and <hi rend="italic">j</hi>; but how do we
                    know that the Pannonian Slovenes pronounced č and not <hi rend="italic">šd</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">žd</hi>? The Hungarian <hi
                    rend="italic">mοstοha</hi> (pr. <hi rend="italic">moshtoha), pest</hi> (pr. <hi
                    rend="italic">pesht),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palast (palasht)</hi> for the
                    Old Slovenish <hi rend="italic">mašteha, pešt,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >plašt,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rozsda</hi> (pr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >rozhda)</hi> for the Old Slovenish <hi rend="italic">ržda,</hi> postulate the
                    existence of <hi rend="italic">št</hi> and <hi rend="italic">žd</hi> in the
                    dialect of the Pannonian Slovenes. The nasalized syllables (to express the Old
                    Slavonic nasals) in (modem) Slovenish and in the oldest loan words in Magyar
                    from Slavonic separate the language from which these words are borrowed from
                    Bulgarian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But, as
                    previously stated, nasals have been found in Bulgarian dialects.</p></note> Let
                    us also consider the following fact: Modem Bulgarian is more unlike
                    Palaeo-Slavonic than any other language of the eastern branch. Perhaps it may be
                    observed with reference to this that these corruptions have only crept in during
                    the last centuries. But the language of the <hi rend="italic">Tale of the Trojan
                    War</hi> (of date 1350) is already Bulgarian, and, whatever may be said to the
                    contrary, Modem Bulgarian. In the same stage of vocalic corruption is the Gospel
                    of Trnov (Timova), which belongs to the year 1273. And does not the same remark
                    hold good of the Psalter of Bologna, of the date 1186-1196? A Bulgarian language
                    identical with Palaeo-Slavonic fades from our eyes like a <hi rend="italic">fata
                    morgana</hi> however far we follow it.” The same author considers that even
                    before the 9th century the Slavonic languages were separated as they are to-day.
                    The most able exponent of the Old Bulgarian theory, Schleicher, writes as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>“The proofs which Kopitar and Miklosich have brought forward in support of their
                    opinion appear capable of being overthrown, while facts speak irresistibly for
                    the opposite opinion that church Slavonic was the language of the Old
                    Bulgarians, especially the softening of original Aryan <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> into <hi rend="italic">sht</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">zhd.</hi> And besides linguistic there are also historical
                    grounds. Cyril and his Slavonic fellow-workers were Bulgarians.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is rather strongly
                    stated. They are said to have been of Greek origin, but had probably become
                    thoroughly Bulgarized; yet the argument used by Schleicher remains quite as
                    strong, for they would use the form of Slavonic with which they were
                    familiar.</p></note> Why, then, should they not have written in their own
                    language, especially since they found no written language among the other Slavs
                    ?”</p>
                <p>Schleicher asks, “How came the Bulgarisms in the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                    Sup-rasliensis</hi> [see below], which, according to the opinion of Miklosich,
                    was written ‘in ipsa linguae palaeoslovenicae patria’?” He sums up: “We
                    therefore hold the language which we regard in this work<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Die Formerilere der
                    Kirchen-slawischen Sprache,</hi> Bonn, 1852.</p></note> as alone the oldest to
                    be Old Bulgarian.” Schleicher appears to the present writer to have the best of
                    the argument.</p>
                <p>Modern Bulgaria embraces ancient Moesia, Thrace, and Macedonia; the Danube
                    separates it from Roumania; on the west it has Servian, on the south-west
                    Albanian, and on the south Greek, which begins to prevail from a line drawn from
                    Salonica to Constantinople. Its area is dotted by Turkish colonies—the Turks,
                    however, are now fast emigrating—and there is a considerable admixture of
                    Greeks. Modern Bulgarian is a very corrupt form of Slavonic. The vocabulary, to
                    begin with, is full of Turkish words. The wonder is that the language did not
                    altogether disappear. It uses the Slavonic demonstrative pronoun as an article,
                    which is placed at the end of words, as in Rouman, Albanian, and the
                    Scandinavian languages. The cases are very defective, and are mostly expressed
                    by prepositions. There is no regular form of the infinitive, for which a
                    periphrasis is used. The language has only been resuscitated of late years. An
                    American missionary named Riggs published a sketch of the grammar and a short
                    vocabulary. In 1852 the brothers Tzankoff compiled a grammar in which Latin
                    letters were employed. There are other grammars in Bulgarian by Momchiloff and
                    Grouyeff. A dictionary (Bulgarian-French) has since been published by Bogo-roff,
                    and there are indications that the language will be scientifically treated, to
                    judge by some excellent papers in the <hi rend="italic">Archiv fur slawische
                    Philologie.</hi> From these we learn that in the Bulgarian dialects the nouns
                    are much more fully inflected, and traces of nasals are found. The Upper Moesian
                    dialect is also called the <hi rend="italic">Shopsko narechie</hi> or dialect of
                    the Shopi. Jirečxek says that these Shopi differ very much in language, dress,
                    and habits from the other Bulgarians, who regard them as simple folk. Their name
                    he connects with the old Thracian tribe of the Sapaei. Those Bulgarians who have
                    embraced Islam are called Pomaks,—a word of which no satisfactory derivation has
                    been given.<pb break="no"

                    originally belonged to the monks of the abbey of Suprasl near Bialystok in
                    Poland. They have been edited by Miklosich. The half Cyrillic and half
                    Glagolitic manuscript called the <hi rend="italic">Texte du Sacre</hi> must not
                    be forgotten, because on it the French kings were accustomed to take the oath at
                    their coronation at Rheims; part of it is of the 14th century. There are also
                    many translations from the Byzantine writers in Old Bulgarian, as from John
                    Malalas, George Hamartolus, and others. (2) <hi rend="italic">Modern

                    The popular songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians collected by Verkovich; of this

                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Veda Slovena, in</hi> which he professes to have
                    discovered Old Bulgarian ballads relating to Orpheus; but the production is
                    regarded by most critics as an imposture. (c) The collection published in 1875

                    Bulgarian literature is altogether recent. The father of it was the monk Paisi,
                    who lived towards the end of the 18th century. He wrote a book on the history of
                    Bulgaria in Bulgarian, which may be compared to the similar one of Raich in
                    Servian. One of his pupils was Sophronius, bishop of Vracha (Vratza), who wrote
                    his own life and adventures (1804). A translation of the New Testament was
                    published by Sapernoff in 1821. George Venelin (1802-1834), a Little Russian
                    from the neighbourhood of the Carpathians, travelled in Bulgaria in search of
                    manuscripts and had some remarkable adventures there, which are related in the
                    account of him by Bezsonoff; he may be said to have revealed the existence of
                    Bulgaria to the west. Among other writers may be mentioned Rakovski, the author
                    of some eccentric works, but a true patriot, and Slaveikoff. Vazoff is a living
                    poet of some reputation. The Bulgarian Literary Society has now been removed
                    from Braila to Sofia, where it issues its journal (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Periodichesko Spisanie).</hi><hi rend="italic">Servo-Croatian and
                    Slovenish.—</hi> Of these languages the southern or Herzegovinian dialect has
                    become the literary language of Servia. It is sometimes called the
                    “shtokavstchina” from its use of the word <hi rend="italic">shto</hi> for the
                    interrogative "what.” The language of the coast or Dalmatian littoral is called
                    "chakavstchina” from the use of <hi rend="italic">cha</hi> in the same way, and
                    Slovenish “kajkavstchina” from the use of <hi rend="italic">kaj.</hi> There is
                    practically no difference between the Servian and Croatian dialects, but a
                    quasi-difference has been created between them, much more apparent than real, by
                    the employment of the Latin alphabet by the Croats and of the Cyrillic by the
                    Serbs. The reasons for this divergence being theological, it is probable that it
                    will not soon be put an end to. The Servian language is the softest of all the
                    Slavonic tongues and elides many of the consonants. It is rich in tense forms,
                    having preserved the Old Slavonic aorist. The accent is capricious.<note

                    Servo-Croatian is especially difficult. Professor Grote of St Petersburg has

                    Leipsic is now publishing a work, <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen über

                    incorporated many Turkish words; but these will probably be gradually eliminated
                    as the nation wakes to greater self-consciousness. For an account of Servian

                <p>The Slovenes are sometimes called “Wends” and their language “Windish” or
                    “Wendish,” an inconvenient term, as it causes some confusion with the tongue of
                    the Lusatian Wends, of which more will be said shortly. Slovenish begins in
                    Styria just south of Klagenfurt (Celovec). Besides Carinthia and Carniola, it is
                    also the vernacular of a small part of Hungary, being spoken in the corner
                    adjoining the river Mur. It is somewhat tiresome to find the few books printed
                    in this part of the country using Magyar orthography. These Slovenish provinces
                    formed a margravate and have long been attached to the domains of the house of
                    Hapsburg. In 1883 they celebrated the six hundredth anniversary of this union
                    and a handsome volume was published in commemoration of the event. For a time
                    they were seized by Ottocar of Bohemia, but regained by Rudolph I., who divided
                    them among his sons. The theory that Old Slovenish exhibits the oldest known
                    form of Slavonic has already been discussed. The language has preserved a dual
                    both in the noun and the verb and its vocabulary teems with interesting Slavonic
                    forms. The attempt of Ljudevit Gaj to fuse Slovenish and Servo-Croatian and make
                    one great South Slavonic literary language is alluded to in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Servia</hi> (vol. xxi. p. 691). Slovenish exhibits an older form of Slavonic
                    than Servian, just as Slovak is earlier than Bohemian. A good grammar was
                    published by Kopitar at Laibach in 1808. To this is prefixed a valuable essay on
                    the Slavonic languages, which was the first treatment of Slavonic philology in a
                    scientific way; nothing so valuable appeared till the epoch-making <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> of Dobrovsky (1822). Grammars were afterwards
                    published by Metelko and Murko, but these have been far surpassed by that of
                    Suman, a pupil of Miklosich.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    improved and it is to be hoped that some of the Germanisms which now disfigure
                    it will be expelled. The Slovenes must banish from their vocabulary such words
                    as <hi rend="italic">farba</hi> (farbe), <hi rend="italic">farar</hi> (pfarrer),
                    and <hi rend="italic">britoff</hi> (friedhof).</p>
                <p>The earliest specimens of the literature are the manuscripts from Freising in
                    Bavaria now preserved in the library of Munich. They have been assigned to the
                    9th or 10th century and are written in Latin letters. From that time we find no
                    more trace of the language till the Reformation, when Truber (in 1557)
                    translated the New Testament into Slovenish. He was obliged, however, to quit
                    his country. In 1584 the whole Bible appeared at Tübingen under the
                    superintendence of Juri Dalmatin; in 1584 the first Slavonic grammar was
                    published by Bohorić, a schoolmaster of Laibach and pupil of Melanchthon; and in
                    1592 appeared the first Slovenish dictionary by Megiser.<note anchored="true"

                    After the Protestant movement had been stopped by Ferdinand II., the country
                    fell into a torpor, as did Bohemia. In this condition it remained during almost
                    the whole of the 18th century,—the only productions of that barren period being
                    a few plays and religious works without merit, and the grammars of Pochlin and
                    Gutsmann. Valentine Vodnik (1758-1819) was a poet of some eminence. He
                    flourished during the existence of the short-lived Illyrian kingdom which had
                    been evoked by Napoleon and was destined to fall to pieces rapidly. About this
                    time he composed his <hi rend="italic">Iliria Oživljena</hi> (The Revival of
                    Illyria); but, sympathizing too much with the French, he incurred the wrath of
                    the Austrians when they came back into possession, and was deprived of his
                    posts, dying soon afterwards in poverty. Other writers are Jarnik and Ravnikar.
                    The most celebrated poet was Francis Prešern (1800-1849), whose lyrics enjoy
                    great popularity among his countrymen. The Matica Slovenska (Slovenish Literary
                    Society) issues a journal and publishes useful works. In a recent number there
                    is an interesting article by M. Erjavec, entitled “Fragments from a Traveller’s
                    Wallet,” where we have lists of words gathered by the author from rural
                    districts inhabited by Slovenes. The Resanian dialect of Slovenish may be said
                    to have been discovered by Professor Baudouin de Courtenay; certainly no one
                    before his time had made any study of it. The Rezani, amounting to about 27,000,
                    live on the north-eastern corner of the Italian frontier, in two valleys of the
                    Julian Alps, and are Italian subjects. There is also a work on this dialect by
                    Carlo Podrecca, called <hi rend="italic">Slavia Italiana.</hi> The
                    Ugro-Slovenish dialect, although it has not been used much as a literary
                    language, is interesting, because it shows some connexion with Slovakish, and is
                    thus a link between the south-eastern and western branches of the Slavonic
                    languages.</p>

                    of Great Poland has become the literary language. It is a vigorous tongue, but
                    has incorporated too many German and Latin words. The “macaronic” style of
                    Polish writing which did so much to disfigure the language is discussed in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Poland</hi> (vol. xix. p. 301). Polish has preserved the nasals
                    <hi rend="italic">ą</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ȩ</hi>. Its accent is almost
                    invariably on the penultimate. There are excellent grammars by Małecki and
                    Malinowski, and the monuments of Old Polish have been well edited by Nehring and
                    Baudouin de Courtenay. The splendid lexicon of Linde in six large volumes is a
                    monumental work. The Silesian dialect is threatened with rapid extermination by
                    the encroachment of the Germans. It has been treated of by Malinowski. <hi

                    persons according to Hilferding (others, however, make the number less) in the
                    neighbourhood of Dantzic. This dialect presents some very interesting
                    variations: among others the accent is free and not confined to the penultimate
                    as in Polish, and it has more nasals. Its philology has been treated by Dr

                    collected their songs and published a small volume of dialogues and literary
                    miscellanies. The word “Kashoub” appears to be a nickname, their proper
                    appellation being “Slovintzi.” Schafarik makes the word signify “goats.” The
                    position of Kashoubish in the Slavonic family has formed the subject of
                    controversy. In his <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur Slavischen

                    opposition to the opinions of Schleicher and Hilferding, who have connected it
                    with the extinct Polabish. The pamphlet contains curious details on the
                    varieties of Kashoubish: the author tells us that every district has its own
                    local dialect. For Kashoubish and its dialects Prince Lucien Bonaparte proposes
                    the term “Baltic”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Trans.
                    Phil. Soc., 1883.</p></note>; this appellation, however, would be more
                    appropriate to group together Lithuanian, Lettish, and Old Prussian, and in this
                    way it has been used by Leskien.</p>

                <p>Bohemian literature may be divided into the three following periods, in which we
                    follow Tieftrunk in his <hi rend="italic">History</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Second ed., Prague, 1880.</p></note>:—(1) the
                    early period, the productions of which are chiefly of poetry from the beginning
                    of Chekh literature till the Hussite wars (1410); (2) the second period, which
                    shows a great development of prose, but also a great decline in literature
                    generally, extends from the time of Hus to the latter part of the 18th century;
                    (3) from the renaissance of Chekh literature till the present time.</p>
                <p>(1) The earliest period of Bohemian civilization was subjected to both
                    Latin-German and Greek - Slavonic influences. The Latin alphabet may have been
                    introduced even in heathen times. Rosti-slaff of Moravia invited to his kingdom
                    Methodius, who was appointed archbishop of the country by the pope. We hear even
                    in the 11th century of a Slavonic school in the Vyšehrad (Wyscherad, Prague)
                    where St Procopius studied, to whom tradition assigned a hand in the
                    transcription of the <hi rend="italic">Texte du Sacre,</hi> previously alluded
                    to. Professor Jagić has printed an extract from an old service book the language
                    of which shows Chekh influences. He has assigned the book to the 10th century.
                    Some other very early specimens of the language are contained in the so-called
                    Glagolitic fragments, <hi rend="italic">Zlomky Hlaholské.</hi> Two ancient hymns
                    belonging to this orthodox period of the Bohemian Church have come down to us,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hospodine, pomiluf ny</hi> (Lord, have mercy upon us) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Svaty Vá'clave, Vevodo České Zeme</hi> (Holy Wenceslaus, Lord of
                    the Bohemian land). In 1817 a fragment called <hi rend="italic">Libušin
                    Soud</hi> (The Judgment of Libuša) was anonymously forwarded to the newly
                    founded Bohemian museum. The sender was afterwards found to have been one Kovař,
                    the steward of Count Colloredo. Some critics assigned it to the 9th century;
                    according to others it is a forgery. With the limited space at our disposal it
                    would be impossible to discuss the question here. The same year also witnessed
                    the discovery by Hanka of the so-called Königinhof manuscript <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Kralodvorsky Rukopis},</hi> consisting of epic and lyric pieces, the
                    authenticity of which some critics have attempted to bring into doubt. The chief
                    hand in these forgeries is alleged to have been Wenceslaus Hanka (1791-1861),
                    who was for some time head of the museum library and the author of some mediocre
                    verse. The next poem of any importance is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandreis,</hi> a free Chekh version of the Latin work of Philip Walter ab
                    Insulis, surnamed “De Castellione.” The Bohemian version was composed by an
                    unknown author probably between 1240 and 1253. To this time belong many
                    versified lives of saints and legends, such as those of St Procopius and St
                    Catherine. The manuscript of the latter poem has been brought back from Sweden,
                    whither it had been removed during the Thirty Years’ War, and is now preserved
                    at Brünn in Moravia. The so-called <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of Dalimil,
                    a work of some importance, belongs to the 14th century. It is a tedious
                    production, written in octosyllabics, and extends from the creation of the world
                    till 1314. The author is supposed to have been a Bohemian knight, but there is
                    no ground for believing that his name was Dalimil. The work is inspired by great
                    hatred of the Germans. We have a good deal of tedious moral poetry belonging to
                    the 13th century. More interesting matter can be found in the “Satires on
                    Craftsmen” <hi rend="italic">(Satyry o Remeslnicich},</hi> and a poem on the Ten
                    Commandments. Most of these pieces are anonymous, but the name of one author is
                    known, Smil of Pardubitz, surnamed “Flaska,” a leading Bohemian of his day. But
                    little is known of the events of his life, except that he was killed in a
                    skirmish in 1403. His chief work is the <hi rend="italic">New Council,</hi> one
                    of the beast epics so much in vogue in the Middle Ages. Others, however, are
                    assigned to him, of which the most original and amusing is the “Dialogue between
                    the Groom and Scholar” <hi rend="italic">(Podkoni a Žak).</hi> A valuable legal
                    document belonging to this period is the <hi rend="italic">Book of the Old Lord
                    of Rosenberg,</hi> which is one of the earliest specimens of Bohemian prose.
                    Rosenberg was royal chamberlain from 1318 to 1346 and died the following year.
                    Another legal work of importance is the “Exposition of the Law of the Land of
                    Bohemia”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(Vyklad na Bravo Zeme Česke),</hi> by Andrew of Duba, chief
                    justice of the country. Considerable portions of the Bible were translated into
                    Bohemian during the 13th and 14th centuries. The version was completed at the
                    beginning of the 15th century. Wickliffe says of Anne of Luxemburg, the first
                    wife of Richard II., “Nobilis regina Angliae, soror Caesaris, habet evangelium
                    in lingua triplici exaratum, scilicet in lingua Bohemica, Teutonica, et Latina.”
                    There are two early versions of the Psalter,—the Clementine at the end of the
                    13th or beginning of the 14th century, and the Wittenberg also at the beginning
                    of the 14th. The doubts which have been thrown on the fragments of the early
                    version of the Gospel of St John appear to be completely dissipated by the
                    well-timed work of Dr Jan Gebauer. Dr Adolf Patera has discovered recently
                    another religious poem of this period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Arch. f. slaw. Phil.,</hi> vol.
                    vii.</p></note> Another early prose chronicle deserving of mention is that of
                    Pulkava, a priest, who died in 1380. It extends from the earliest times to the
                    year 1330, and was originally written in Latin, but he afterwards translated it
                    into Chekh. “The Weaver” (<hi rend="italic">Tkadleček),</hi> called after the
                    name of its author, who lived in the first half of the 14th century, is a
                    curious prose poem, in which the author celebrated the fair Adlička, one of the
                    beauties of the Bohemian court. The piece is full of the usual conceits of the
                    age; it has not yet been ascertained whether it is original or only an
                    adaptation. It very much resembles <hi rend="italic">Der Ackermann aus
                    Böhmen,</hi> of which four manuscripts have been preserved. Perhaps, as Gebauer
                    has surmised, they are both adaptations of a piece which is now lost. Passing
                    over a quantity of mediaeval legends and tales, such as <hi rend="italic">Flore
                    et Blanch-flore,</hi> we need only mention, as dealing with native subjects, the
                    two chronicles of <hi rend="italic">Stilfrid</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bruncvik,</hi> supposed to have been originally written in verse. The most
                    remarkable Bohemian writer of the 14th century is Thomas of Štitny, who writes
                    on ethical and religious subjects. He was born of a noble family about 1330, and
                    probably lived till the close of the century. He appears to have studied at the
                    university of Prague, then newly founded. His chief works are a treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">General Christian Matters,</hi> in six books (edited in 1852), and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Books of Christian Instruction,</hi> printed with an
                    introduction by Vrtátko in 1873. His style is easy and flowing. Loserth has
                    rightly said that the object of Stitny was to put in a popular form the sum
                    total of the scholastic knowledge of his age. There is also a Chekh version of
                    the <hi rend="italic">History of the Trojan War,</hi> composed by Guido di
                    Colonna from Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius; it was one of the first
                    printed in Bohemian, and was issued from the press at Pilsen in 1468.</p>
                <p>(2) The second period begins with the great name of Hus, whose Bohemian writings
                    were edited by Erben in 1865-68. Hus developed his native language as Luther did
                    German. He corrected the translation of the Bible, and improved Bohemian
                    orthography. We have nine letters written by him while in prison at Constance.
                    During the period of the Hussite wars there was abundance of political and
                    religious pamphlets. Most of these productions, however, were of ephemeral
                    interest. The travels of Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville were translated into
                    Bohemian. Peter Chelcicky, one of the leaders of the United Brethren, was a
                    popular writer. He was a cobbler by trade, hence he was nicknamed “Kopyta,” or
                    the Shoe-Last. His works, written between 1430 and 1456, have a strongly marked
                    democratic tone; among them may be especially mentioned his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Postils</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Net of Faith (Sit Vîry).</hi> In 1488
                    the complete Bible was printed in Bohemia, the first regular printing press at
                    Prague having been set up the year before. In 1506 a Calixtine Bible appeared at
                    Venice. The national literature made distinct progress under George Poděbrad, a
                    native king. Vavrinec z Brezové (1370-1455) wτote in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia de Bello Hussitico',</hi> of which there is an early Chekh
                    translation. There is a satire in Latin by Jan Hasisteinsky z Lobkovic, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Lament of St Wenceslaus over the Morals of the Chekhs.</hi> He
                    was also a considerable traveller in the East. The Chekhs were fond of making
                    pilgrimages to the Holy Land; Martin Kabatnik was a traveller of this kind. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Peregrinations</hi> were first printed in 1518. Works on law
                    were written by Ctibor and Viktorin, and many translations from the classics
                    appeared. Gregory Hruby z Jelene (called Gelenius) and his son Sigismund<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n167/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0167-0152"/> were very industrious in this way; the latter
                    published at Basel in 1536 a curious dictionary, <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                    Symphonum,</hi> an early attempt at comparative philology, in which he compares
                    Greek, Latin, German, and Slavonic. We must find space for a mention of the
                    writings of Dubravins (c. 1489-1553), bishop of Olmiitz, although he used the
                    Latin and not the Bohemian language. His work on fish-ponds and fish <hi
                    rend="italic">(Libellus de Piscinis et Piscium qui in eis aluntur Natura,</hi>
                    1547) is not altogether unknown to Englishmen owing to the citations in Izaak
                    Walton, with whom the bishop was a great authority. His most important work,
                    however, was his <hi rend="italic">History of Bohemia</hi> in thirty-three
                    books, from the earliest times to the coronation of Ferdinand I. at Prague in
                    1527, the termination of Bohemian independence. In 1533 appeared the first Chekh
                    grammar, by Beneš Optat. Verse-writers abounded at this time, but no poet of
                    eminence. Veleslavin (1545-1599) was an indefatigable worker, being, like
                    Caxton, both printer and author. The Latin herbal of Andrew Matthiolus,
                    physician to the archduke Ferdinand, was translated by Thaddeus Hajek. Some good
                    works on law appeared, and there are quantities of sermons. Simon Lomnicky (b.
                    1560) wrote a great deal of poetry; he was the laureate of Rudolph II., and also
                    wrote a triumphal song for the elector Frederick when chosen king of Bohemia by
                    the Protestants. He was severely wounded at the battle of the White Mountain and
                    spent the rest of his days in poverty; but there appears to be no truth in the
                    story that he became a public beggar. The claims of Lomnicky to be considered a
                    poet are but meagre; he writes little better than rhymed prose. There is some
                    merit, however, in his comic pieces and satires. At this period flourished the
                    chronicler Hajek, who appears to have been a priest, and who died in 1553. His
                    work is interesting, but altogether uncritical, and he does not seem to have
                    cared much about truth. He gives us all the old Chekh sagas, and fortunately
                    uses the Chekh language. His book attained great popularity, and was translated
                    into German. Indeed, it was almost the chief authority for Bohemian history till
                    towards the close of the 18th century. The travels of Christopher Harant in the
                    Holy Land are full of learning and of curious matter. A new edition was
                    published in 1854. The author perished on the scaffold on the memorable 19th
                    June 1621, when Bohemia lay completely at the feet of the Hapsburg conqueror.
                    Harant started for his journey in 1598, he and his companions being dressed as
                    Franciscan friars. There is also the account by Wenceslaus Vratislav of
                    Mitrovitz (1576-1635) of his three years’ captivity at Constantinople,—a work
                    full of picturesque incidents. The letters of Karl ze Žerotin (d. 1636), one of
                    the Moravian Brethren, who was for some time in the service of Henry IV. of
                    France, have been edited by Brandi. With the battle of the White Mountain in
                    1620 terminates what has been called the golden age of Chekh literature. In 1615
                    the diet had made a resolute effort to protect the national language. But now
                    the country became Germanized, and books in Chekh were eagerly sought out and
                    destroyed. In addition to its sufferings during the Thirty Years’ War, Bohemia
                    had the misfortune to lose many of its most valuable manuscripts, which were
                    carried off by the conquerors. For nearly 200 years Bohemia ceased to be counted
                    among the nationalities of Europe. Here and there a patriot laboured in the
                    interest of his country, such as the Jesuit Balbin or Balbinus (1621-1688), who
                    was professor of rhetoric at Prague and author of <hi rend="italic">Epitome
                    Rerum Bohemicarum</hi> (1677) and also <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea Rerum
                    Bohemicarum</hi> (1680-81). His services to Bohemian literature were
                    considerable, but his writings are in Latin. Many authors of repute were,
                    however, at this time in exile, and of these no one has earned a greater renown
                    than Jan Amos Komensky (frequently styled by the Latin form of his name,
                    Comenius). This eminent man was born at Nivnitz near Hungarian Brod in Moravia
                    and was the last bishop of the Moravian Brethren. After the battle of the White
                    Mountain he fled to Poland, which at that time had not altogether lost its
                    spirit of toleration. Here he was joined by some Polish dissidents and formed
                    the nucleus of a religious society. In 1631 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Janua Linguarum Reserata,</hi> in which he developed a new theory of learning
                    languages. This work became very popular and has been repeatedly translated. He
                    afterwards visited England and Sweden, and in 1659 gave to the world his <hi
                    rend="italic">Orbis Pictus,</hi> which also enjoyed great reputation as an
                    educational work. He died at Amsterdam in 1670. It would be impossible in a
                    brief sketch like the present to give a detailed list of the writings of
                    Komensky. Of his Bohemian works we may mention the prose poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Labyrint Světa a Raj Srdce</hi> (The Labyriηth of the World and Paradise of the
                    Heart) and his <hi rend="italic">Informatorium Školy Mateřske.</hi> He also
                    translated the Psalms into Chekh. In 1656, on the destruction of the town of
                    Leszno by fire, Komensky lost some of his most valuable works still in
                    manuscript; we may especially regret his <hi rend="italic">Poklad Jazyka
                    Českého</hi> (Treasury of the Bohemian Language), upon which he had been engaged
                    from 1612. During the latter part of the 17th century and the greater part of
                    the 18th the language and literature of Bohemia steadily declined. A few
                    scribblers appeared, such as Rosa, Pohl, and Šimek, but their names are hardly
                    deserving of mention. But Gelasius Dobner and Martin Pelzel were valuable
                    workers in the field of Bohemian history.</p>
                <p>(3) The true study of the Slavonic languages may be said to have begun with
                    Joseph Dobrovsky. In 1809 he published <hi rend="italic">A usführliches
                    Lehrgebäude der böhm. Sprache.</hi> In 1822 appeared at Vienna his great work
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutiones Linguae Slavieae Dialecti Veteris.</hi>
                    Dobrovsky died in 1829. The strange thing about him is that, in spite of all his
                    labours, he had no faith in his native language and despaired of its revival.
                    But, like Columbus, he was destined to accomplish greater results than he
                    expected. Joseph Jungmann (1773-1847), another regenerator of the Chekh
                    language, was author of the great dictionary and an esteemed translation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> Besides these works he wrote a history of
                    Bohemian literature. Kollar (1793-1852) and Čelakovsky (1799-1852) both earned a
                    considerable reputation as poets,—the first by a series of sonnets called <hi
                    rend="italic">Slavy Dcera</hi> (The Daughter of Glory), under which title he
                    celebrates the praises of all Slavonic lands and at the same time his love for
                    the daughter of a German pastor; the second by his “Echo of Russian Songs” (<hi
                    rend="italic">Ohlas Pisni Ruskych)</hi> and the “Rose with a Hundred Leaves”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Růze Stolista).</hi> A good poetical style was now formed for
                    the Bohemians, and a host of minor poets appeared for whose names we cannot find
                    space. Karel Erben (1811-1870) has left some excellent ballads in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Kytice</hi> (Garland). His genius was kindled by the folk tales
                    with which Bohemia abounds. He conferred a benefit upon Slavonic students by his
                    interesting collection of national tales previously alluded to; moreover, he was
                    a sound scholar and an indefatigable antiquary. <hi rend="italic">Re gesta
                    diplomatica necnon epistolaria Bohemiae et Moraviae,</hi> extending to 1253, and
                    editions of Harant’s <hi rend="italic">Journey to the Holy Land</hi> and
                    Nestor’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> are monuments of his industry. A great
                    impulse to Bohemian poetry was given by the discovery of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libušin Soud</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Kralodvorsky Rukopis</hi> by
                    Hanka. Vitezslav Halek (1835-1874) has left two volumes of poems, which were
                    reprinted in 1879 under the editorship of Ferdinand Schütz. Halek presents a
                    twofold appearance, first as the writer of a series of narrative pieces of a
                    half dramatic character, reminding us of the <hi rend="italic">Idyls</hi> of
                    Tennyson, secondly as a lyrical poet. In his “Heirs of the White Mountain” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dedicové Bile Hory)</hi> he has chosen a patriotic subject which
                    must find its way to the heart of every Bohemian. He has been fortunate in
                    having some of his poems wedded to the music of Dvořák. Jan Neruda (b. 1834),
                    still living, has written “Flowers of the Churchyard” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hrbitovni Kviti),</hi> published in 1858, and a volume of poems called “Cosmic
                    Songs” <hi rend="italic">(Pisne Kosmicke).</hi> According to some Bohemian
                    critics the greatest of their modern lyric poets is Adolf Heyduk, born in 1836
                    and still living at Pisek. Much of his poetry has been inspired by the south of
                    Europe. His “Forest Flowers” <hi rend="italic">(Lesni Kviti)</hi> were gathered,
                    as he tells us, while wandering amidst the delightful scenery of the Šumava or
                    Böhmerwald. Heyduk, although a Slovak, has avoided the Slovakish dialect, which
                    has been used by Holly, Sladković, and others. His patriotism is very
                    conspicuous in <hi rend="italic">Cymbal and Guitar.</hi> One of his most popular
                    works is <hi rend="italic">Deduυ Odkaz</hi> (The Grandfather’s Bequest), the
                    grandfather being the genius of the country, who instructs the poet. Some very
                    elegant verses, showing a true feeling for nature with feminine delicacy of
                    expression, have been published by Mademoiselle Henrietta Pech, who writes under
                    the name of “Eliška Krasnohorska.” Her first volume was published in 1870 and
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Z Maje Žiti</hi> (Life in May). Her “Poetical
                    Pictures” <hi rend="italic">(Basnicke Kresby)</hi> show great power of
                    word-painting. M. Josef Vaclav Sládek (b. 1845), who has published several
                    volumes of original poems, besides translations from English and other
                    languages, shows considerable lyrical power. The most voluminous, however, of
                    the modern writers is Emil Bohus Frida (b. 1853), who uses the pseudonym of
                    “Jaroslav Vrchlicky.” He has been astonishingly active; among his principal
                    productions may be mentioned the following,— <hi rend="italic">Mythy</hi>
                    (Myths), which he divides into two cycles; the miscellaneous collection “From
                    the Depths” <hi rend="italic">(Z Hlubin),</hi> which is inscribed to Vitezslav
                    Halek, and seems to be inspired by the same scenery as kindled Halek’s fancy;
                    <hi rend="italic">Duch a Svet</hi> (The Spirit and the World), fine lyrics, the
                    motive of which has been supplied by Greek mythology. He has subsequently
                    published <hi rend="italic">Dejmy a Rozmary</hi> (Impressions and Fancies), and,
                    besides other translations from various languages, a version of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Divina Commedia</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">terza rima</hi> of
                    the original. He is also the author of some plays which are much esteemed,
                    especially <hi rend="italic">Drahomíra.</hi> Dr J. Durdik, J. J. Kolár, and L.
                    Strupeznicky have attained celebrity in this branch of literature. Some good
                    poetry has been written by Svatopluk Čech. Some critics rank him as the greatest
                    poet of the modern school since the death of Halek. In addition to poetry he has
                    also published three volumes of tales <hi rend="italic">(Povidky, Arabcsky, a
                    Humoresky),</hi> collected by him from his various contributions to magazines.
                    Many of these show considerable humour. Another poet by no means to be passed
                    over in this brief sketch (which only attempts to grasp the salient facts with
                    regard to these authors) is M. Zeyer, who has published a series of epic pieces,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Vyšehrad,</hi> after the well-known Chekh stronghold or
                    acropolis at Prague. The subjects are all taken from the Old Bohemian legends on
                    Libusa, Vlasta, Lumír, &amp;c. Zeyer has adopted the Slavonic metre as we find
                    it in the Servian songs collected by Vuk Stephanovich. Besides these poems<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0168-0153"/> lie has written a good historical novel entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Andrew Chernisheff,</hi> which deals with the reign of
                    Catherine II. of Russia. In 1880 appeared two other tales by the same writer,
                    <hi rend="italic">Romance concerning the Faithful Friendship of Amisa and
                    Amil,</hi> and a strange book of Oriental tales styled <hi rend="italic">Baje
                    Šošsany</hi> (Stories of Susannah). As with us, the social romance or novel of
                    domestic life has latterly been much cultivated among the Chekhs. The legends
                    and tales current among the peasantry have also been carefully collected, first
                    by Bozěna Nemcova (1820-1862), whose <hi rend="italic">Slovenske Povesti</hi>
                    had a very great success. She was followed by Madame Muzak, authoress of some of
                    the most popular of the modern Bohemian novels. Her “Country Romance” (<hi
                    rend="italic">Vesnicky Roman)</hi> has been translated into French. Excellent
                    pictures of rural life have also been given by Vaclaff Smilovsky (a <hi
                    rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> of Smilauer), who has written a great many
                    novels, as the “Old Organist” (<hi rend="italic">Stary Varharnik), Martin
                    Oliva,</hi> &amp;c., much in the style of Auerbach and Zschokke. Other writers
                    of historical novels are M. Bohumil Cidlinsky and Vaclaff Vlcek. Madame Zofie
                    Podlipska, sister of Madame Muzak, is known as a popular writer of social
                    romances. For an account of the historical labours of Francis Palacky, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Palacky.</hi> Among the pupils of the great historian the first
                    place must be given to Vaclaff Vladivoj Tomek (b. 1818), now professor of
                    Austrian history in the university of Prague, whose chief production is a
                    history of that city, which he has carried to a fifth volume. In 1849 he
                    published the first volume of a history of the university of Prague, which seems
                    never to have been completed, and in 1880 a biography of the Bohemian hero
                    Zižka. He appears throughout as a most accurate and painstaking writer. Vocel
                    (1803-1871) is the author of a valuable work, “The Early Days of Bohemia” (<hi
                    rend="italic">Pravěk Zem</hi> ě <hi rend="italic">České),</hi> which we have
                    quoted already when treating of Slavonic ethnology. Alois Šembera (1807-1882),
                    whose literary activity extended over a long period, wrote voluminously on
                    Bohemian history and literature. He was professor of the Bohemian language at
                    the university of Vienna. In a work on the western Slavs (<hi rend="italic">O
                    Západnich Slovanech)</hi> he maintained that the Chekhs, Moravians, Slovaks, and
                    Polabes were settled much earlier in the countries which they at present occupy
                    than many historians have been willing to admit. As a critic, Professor Šembera
                    is an iconoclast and has attacked many of the (supposed) early monuments of the
                    Chekh language. Dr Antonine Gindely, born at Prague in 1829, has proved himself
                    to be a most conscientious and enthusiastic worker in the field of historical
                    research. In order to collect materials for his publications he travelled in
                    various parts of Bohemia, Poland, Germany, France, Belgium, Holland, and Spain.
                    The results of this diligence have appeared in a collection of valuable
                    historical works, such as the <hi rend="italic">History of the Bohemian
                    Brethren, Rudolph II. and his Times,</hi> and later a <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Bohemian Revolt of 1618.</hi> The brothers Joseph and Hermenegild Jireček
                    have won a reputation in Bohemian literature by many useful works. They have
                    conjointly published a book in defence of the <hi rend="italic">Kralodvorsky
                    Rukopis</hi> which is well worthy the attention of those who wish to make
                    themselves acquainted with the literature of this vexed question. Joseph is now
                    occupied in editing in a cheap form some of the most interesting monuments of
                    early Bohemian literature. In 1880 Hermenegild published a valuable <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection of Slavonic Laws,</hi> containing an almost complete
                    series of the early codes of the Slavs in the original languages. Joseph Jireček
                    is also author of a useful chrestomathy of Bohemian literature with biographical
                    and critical notices. Joseph Constantine Jireček (son of Joseph, born in 1854),
                    formerly a <hi rend="italic">privatdocent</hi> of the university of Prague, has
                    devoted himself to Bulgarian history and bibliography. In 1872 he published a
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliography of Modern Bulgarian Literature,</hi> and has
                    written a <hi rend="italic">History of Bulgaria,</hi> of which a German
                    translation has appeared. Joseph Emler and Karl Tieftrunk have been co-operators
                    with Dr Gindely in his “Old Monuments of Bohemian History” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Stare Pamiti Dejin Čekych).</hi> The former has also edited the second volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Regesta Bohemica</hi> and since 1870 has been editor of
                    the “Journal” <hi rend="italic">{casopis)</hi> of the Bohemian museum. Karl
                    Tieftrunk has written several useful works, among them the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Bohemian Literature</hi> from the earliest period to the present
                    time, and the interesting monograph on the opposition of the Bohemian states to
                    Ferdinand I. in 1547. The <hi rend="italic">History of Bohemian Literature</hi>
                    is very carefully written and gives in a short compass much valuable
                    information. An elaborate work is now appearing in parts by F. Backovsky,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Zevrubηe Dejiny Českého Pisemnictví Doby Nové</hi> (A
                    Complete History of Modern Bohemian Literature) from the year 1774 to the
                    present time. There is also a work by Jerábek, <hi rend="italic">Early Days of
                    Romantic Poetry.</hi> Many valuable contributions to Bohemian history have
                    proceeded from the pen of Dr Joseph Kalousek (b. 1838). Vincent Brandi and Beda
                    Dudik have devoted particular attention to Moravian history and antiquities. The
                    former, among other works, has edited the letters of Karl ze Žerotin, previously
                    mentioned. Beda Dudik, a Benedictine monk and historiographer of Moravia, has
                    published some valuable works on the history of that portion of the Bohemian
                    kingdom and has also written a <hi rend="italic">History of Moravia.</hi> Like
                    the great work of Palacky, it was first written in German, but has since
                    appeared in the Bohemian lan guage. Extracts from the interesting diary of
                    Žerotin have been edited by him in the <hi rend="italic">Mährische
                    Geschichtsquellen</hi> Through his efforts twenty-one Bohemian manuscripts which
                    had been carried away to Sweden at the time of the Thirty Years’ War have been
                    restored, and are now preserved in the state archives of Briinn. Among these is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Legend of St Catherine,</hi> many words in which are said
                    to explain difficult passages in the <hi rend="italic">Kralodvorsky Rukopis</hi>
                    and to furnish testimony to its authenticity. Jakub Maly (d. 1885) was the
                    author of many important articles in the <hi rend="italic">Slovnik Naučny,</hi>
                    the Chekh <hi rend="italic">Conversations-Lexicon,</hi> and of a popular history
                    of the Bohemian people. He also wrote a grammar of Chekh for Englishmen, besides
                    assisting in the translation of Shakespeare, which has been produced by the
                    joint labours of many Bohemian scholars. In 1868 was published under the
                    editorship of Erben the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Vybor z
                    Literatury České,</hi> a very important work, containing specimens of the old
                    Bohemian authors. The first volume had been edited by Schafarik, for an account
                    of whose literary activity see <hi rend="smallcaps">Schafarik.</hi> Valuable
                    works on philology have been written by Martin Hattala, by birth a Slovak, who
                    is now professor of Slavonic philology at the university of Prague. One of his
                    most important productions is in Latin, <hi rend="italic">De Contiguarum
                    Consonantium Imitatione in Linguis Slavicis.</hi> He is a defender of the
                    genuineness of the two celebrated manuscripts, the Zelenohorsky (<hi
                    rend="italic">ie.,</hi> “that which contains the judgment of Libuša”) and the
                    Kralodvorsky. Among sound philologists are reckoned Drs Gebauer and Geitler. The
                    former has contributed some valuable papers to the <hi rend="italic">Archiv fur
                    slawische Philologie,</hi> edited by Professor Jagić of St Petersburg. The
                    latter, born in 1847, is at present professor of Slavonic philology at the
                    university of Agram. He commenced his studies at Prague under Alfred Ludwig, the
                    translator of the <hi rend="italic">Vedas,</hi> and Hattala, and at Vienna under
                    Miklosich. Having begun with a dissertation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Časopis</hi> on the present condition of comparative philology, he published in
                    the same year a work on the Old Bulgarian language. In 1873 he made a tour in
                    Russian and Prussian Lithuania, that, like Schleicher, he might study that
                    interesting language from the mouths of the people. He afterwards published the
                    results of his travels in his <hi rend="italic">Lithauische Studien.</hi> He has
                    since written a treatise on the Albanian alphabet (<hi rend="italic">Die
                    Albanesischen und Slavischen Schriften,</hi> Vienna, 1883). In this an attempt
                    is made to connect the Glagolitic and Albanian alphabets. A valuable work was
                    written by Antonin Matzenauer (b. 1823), entitled “Foreign Words in Slavonic
                    Languages” (<hi rend="italic">Cizi Slova ve Slovanskych Řečech).</hi> Excellent
                    works on classical philology have been published by A. Kvičala and Vaniček.
                    Natural science was successfully cultivated by Jan Svatopluk Presl (1791-1849),
                    professor in the university of Prague, and Jan Ev. Purkyně (1787-1869),
                    professor of physiology in the same university. As regards moral philosophy, the
                    first part of Dr J. Durdik’s <hi rend="italic">History of Recent Philosophy</hi>
                    has just appeared, which extends from Kant to Herbart. Throughout the whole
                    period of the resuscitation of Bohemian literature the society called the Matice
                    Ceska has worked energetically, printing its excellent journal or <hi
                    rend="italic">Časopis</hi> four times a year, and also issuing some of the old
                    Bohemian classic and meritorious works by modern authors. It was a great triumph
                    for the Chekhs when a part of the instruction of the university was allowed to
                    be carried on in the Bohemian language. A new magazine (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Slovansky Sbornik)</hi> made its appearance at the beginning of 1884. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Listy Philologické</hi> (Philological Leaves) is still published.
                    Recently a new literary journal (<hi rend="italic">The Athenaeum)</hi> has been
                    started, which seems to be more or less modelled upon its English namesake.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Slovak.—</hi> This language or dialect is spoken in the
                    north-western corner of the kingdom of Hungary. It is generally considered to
                    exhibit an earlier form of Chekh, and this is proved by many of its grammatical
                    peculiarities being found in the older Chekh literature. One characteristic of
                    the language is the use of diphthongs in cases where the other Slavonic tongues
                    use simple vowels. For a long time the Slovaks employed Chekh in all their
                    published writings. About the close of the 18th century a separatist movement
                    began. The first Slovak grammar was published by Bernolak at Presburg in 1790.
                    It was followed by those of Dianiška and Viktorin. There is a Slovak dictionary
                    by Loos. The attempt to form a new literary language was to be deplored on many
                    grounds, for both the Magyar and the German have to be resisted. For a short
                    time a literary society existed among the Slovaks, which published useful books
                    and a journal. The Magyars, however, suppressed it, because it was “contra
                    integritatem patriae,” as we were told by one of their ecclesiastics. The
                    Bohemian naturally resents the attempts at separation by the Slovak, and in 1846
                    the Chekh Literary Society issued a work entitled “Opinions in Favour of One
                    Written Language for the Chekhs, Moravians, and Slovaks” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Hlasove o potřebě Jednoty Spisovného Jazyka pro Čecby, Moravany, a
                    Slovaky).</hi> The Slovaks have produced a few poets of repute, such as Holly,
                    Sladković, and Chalupka, but their literature is meagre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lusatian Wendish.—</hi> This language is divided into two
                    dialects, Upper and Lower, although even these are capable of subdivision. The
                    word “Wend,” as previously explained, is a purely German name and is never used
                    by the Slavs themselves. The Lusatians are also<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n169/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0169-0154"/> sometimes called Serbs and Sorbs. They are the
                    remnants of the powerful tribes which once occupied nearly the whole of north
                    Germany. The Lusatians in the earlier period of their history were under the
                    dominion of the Poles and afterwards of the Chekhs. In the early part of the
                    17th century the bulk of them had been annexed to the electorate of Saxony, with
                    the exception of the small part about Kottbus, which had belonged to Brandenburg
                    since 1445. In 1815, however, when the states of Europe were rearranged, in most
                    instances with very small regard to the nationalities under their sway, many
                    more of the Lusatians were handed over to Prussia; and, according to the
                    statistics of Boudilovich, at the present time (1886) all the Lower Lusatians,
                    amounting to 40,000, belong to Prussia, as well as 44,000 of the Upper
                    Lusatians. Besides the two dialects specified there are other minor ones, to
                    judge from an article in the Bohemian Literary Journal; but they are too minute
                    to be specified here. The Upper Lusatian dialect shows most affinity with Chekh,
                    especially in substituting <hi rend="italic">h</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>; the Lower more resembles Polish, and has the strong or barred <hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> as in ł <hi rend="italic">os,</hi> “hair.” The Upper
                    dialect has been the most cultivated; come good grammars have been published by
                    Seiler, Jordan, and Pfuhl, and there is a copious dictionary edited by Pfuhl in
                    conjunction with others. The language is full of Germanisms and German words and
                    cannot hold out long against the vigorous attempts at denationalization made by
                    its Teutonic neighbours. There is a small Lower Lusatian dictionary by Zwahr, a
                    posthumous work of very little merit. The Macíca Serbska, the literary society
                    of the Sorbs, founded on the model of the Bohemian Society in 1847, publishes
                    its journal twice a year, which contains interesting articles on folk-tales and
                    folk-lore generally, with popular songs taken down from the mouths of the
                    people.</p>
                <p>The first printed book in the Upper Sorbish language was the little catechism of
                    Luther, published in 1597 by the pastor Worjech. This was not, however, the
                    first time that any Lusatian or Sorbish words had been printed, for we find the
                    names of plants in that language given in Franke’s <hi rend="italic">Hortus
                    Lusatiae,</hi> published in 1594. In 1706 Michael Brancel or Frencel published a
                    translation of the New Testament into Sorbish; a little before, in 1689, a
                    grammar had appeared by Zacharias Bierling, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didlascalia seu Orthographia Vandalica.</hi> In 1693-96 Abraham Frencel, son of
                    Michael, published a dictionary. In 1806 Möhn translated some extracts from
                    Klopstock’s <hi rend="italic">Messiah.</hi> From 1837 a new impulse was given to
                    Sorbish literature: newspapers were printed in the language and useful books
                    translated into it. One poet has appeared among them, Andrew Seiler, a
                    clergyman, who died in 1872. Lower Sorbish has always been much less developed
                    than Upper. The first book printed in it was a collection of hymns and a
                    catechism, by Albin Moller, in 1574. Chojnan, a pastor in Lubin, wrote the first
                    grammar between 1642 and 1664; in the latter half of the same century Körner
                    compiled a dictionary. At the commencement of the 18th century Bohumil
                    (Gottlieb) Fabricius published his translation of the New Testament (first
                    edition in 1709); at the end of the same century a version of the Old Testament
                    by Frico appeared. A good collection of Sorbish songs has been edited by Haupt
                    and Schmaler. According to an interesting article by Hornik in the second volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Slavianski Sbornik,</hi> a number of these Wends
                    emigrated to America and settled in Bastrop county, Texas, where they have
                    divine service performed in their own language, and publish some newspapers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Polabish.—</hi> Of the Slavonic languages spoken in the north
                    of Germany the Lusatian Wendish and Kashoubish are alone living. Of those which
                    are extinct Polabish is the only one of which any memorials have come down to
                    us, and these are but scanty. The language affords a parallel to Cornish, not
                    only in the few fragments which remain, but also in the date of its decline and
                    extinction. It is considered by Schleicher,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    tribe on the Elbe (Slav. <hi rend="italic">Laba).</hi></p></note> expired in the
                    first quarter of the 18th century in the eastern corner of the former kingdom of
                    Hanover, principally in the circuit of Lüchow, which even at the present time is
                    called Wendland. Between 1691 and 1786 certain vocabularies and dialogues in
                    this language (including also a song) were taken down, and from them Schleicher
                    has taken the materials for his grammar and the valuable little dictionary
                    appended to it. Dr Pfuhl printed these memorials in their entirety in 1863-64.
                    The spelling is altogether phonetic, and, owing to the ignorance of the Slavonic
                    peasant and his German interrogators, the former of German and the latter of
                    Slavonic, there are some ludicrous blunders. The two most important of these
                    documents are a German-Wendish dictionary, compiled at the end of the 17th
                    century by Christopher Henning, by birth a Lusatian, and pastor of Wustrow near
                    Lüchow. Divine service is said to have been held in that town in Wendish as late
                    as 1751. Secondly, we have the Slavonic words and dialogues collected by a
                    farmer named Johann Parum-Schultz. His manuscript is still in the possession of
                    his descendants. There is a valuable monograph on the dialect of the Lüneburg
                    Slavs by Biskupski. In the 15th century Slavonic had ceased to be spoken in the
                    island of Rügen, and in the same century it could only be heard from peasants in
                    the market-place of Leipsic, a town (as already stated) with a Slavonic name.
                    What the Slavs, however, have lost in the West they have partly gained in the
                    East, and few languages have a more magnificent prospect than Russian,—the
                    dignity and strength of which fit it to be the tongue of an imperial people. (W.
