                    greatest breadth is about 230 miles. In area it is estimated that Sumatra, with

                    island is in large measure a dependency. The northern half runs obliquely
                    parallel to the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by the Strait of
                    Malacca, and the southern end is separated by the narrow Sunda Strait from Java.
                    Unlike Java, Sumatra has a series of considerable islands (Nias Islands,
                    Mentawei Islands, &amp;c.) arranged like outworks in front of the coast that
                    faces the open Indian Ocean. The general physical features of the island are
                    simple and striking: a range of lofty mountains extends throughout its whole
                    length, their western slopes descending rapidly towards the ocean and their
                    eastern looking out over a vast alluvial tract of unusual uniformity. This
                    mountain range is known as Bukit Barisan or Chain Mountain. It varies in average
                    height from 1500 to 6000 feet, and consists of three or four ridges separated by
                    plateau-like valleys. Among its more remarkable summits are Ya Mura or Gold
                    Mountain, near the north end (6879 feet); Seret Berapi or Merapi (5857 feet), in
                    0° 44' N. lat.; Pasaman or Mount Ophir (10,866); Merapi (9563); Indrapura, in 1°
                    36' S. lat. (11,800), which has the reputation of being the culminating point of
                    the whole island; Dempo (10,000); and Abong Abong (10,000). The summit of
                    Indrapura was reached by the Central Sumatran Expedition of 1877-79. Towards the
                    north end of the island the spurs •of the main chain sometimes extend towards
                    the neighbourhood of the east coast. Owing to this configuration of the island,
                    the water-courses of the western side are comparatively short: only very few of
                    them are large enough to be navigable. Those of the eastern slope, on the other
                    hand—such as the Tamiang, the Simpang, the Asahan, the Kubu, the Siak, the
                    Indragiri, the Jambi, the Kampas, the Palembang—are longer, and can not
                    unfrequently carry vessels of considerable burden. In their lower courses they
                    form enormous inosculating deltas. The mountainous regions contain numerous
                    lakes, many of them evidently the craters of extinct volcanoes. When, as
                    sometimes happens, two or three of these craters have merged into one, the lake
                    attains a great size. Amongst the larger lakes may be mentioned the Tao
                    Silalahi, with its offshoots Tao Muara and Tao Balige; Manindji, to the west of
                    Fort de Kock; Sinkarah, south-east of Fort de Kock; Korintji, inland from
                    Indrapura; Ranau, inland from Tampah; and the lake of the X. Kotas, in the
                    Padang Highlands.</p>

                    three craters, one of which is filled with molten sulphur. Junghuhn registered
                    sixteen Sumatran volcanoes, and others have since been discovered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> A large part of the Sumatran highlands consists
                    of very old (probably Silurian or Devonian) slates and clay schists, combined
                    with hornblende talc and other schists, and traversed by veins of quartz.
                    Granite also plays a considerable part, though it does not come so much to the
                    surface. Carboniferous rocks (marls, sandstones, limestones, Ac.) are in some
                    places well developed. Between the Carboniferous period and the Tertiary there
                    is a great blank all through the island. Augite-andesite of late Eocene origin
                    has greatly modified the surface of the country, and constitutes, <hi

                    strongly developed in four different divisions. They are usually considered to
                    be Eocene; but this determination rests on badly preserved fossils. The oldest
                    or breccia division consists of débris of carboniferous limestone, syenites, and
                    granites, sometimes in the form of breccia proper, sometimes in that of
                    sandstones or marl clays. The fish remains found in the marls have led some
                    palaeontologists to assign a greater antiquity than that of Eocene to these
                    strata, while others, again, consider them to be Miocene. Above this division
                    (apparently absent in south Sumatra) comes the second of sandstones, clay rocks,
                    coal-beds, and coal. The coal appears to be the result of a vegetation which
                    grew <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi> Above the coal is sandstone, sometimes 1000
                    feet thick. The third division consists of marly sandstones of evidently marine
                    origin; it is well developed in west Sumatra, but is absent from the south of
                    the island. The fourth division is a limestone, rich in remains of corals,
                    molluscs, echinids, and especially in <hi rend="italic">Orbitoides</hi>; it is
                    well developed both in the west and in the south. Miocene deposits are more
                    abundant in the south than in the west. At Lubu Lintang in the Benkulen
                    residency the Ebuma fossils are characteristic.<note anchored="true"

                    Menangkabau and the interior of Padang, and gold-washing is carried on in
                    several of the streams. Tin, which forms the staple of the neighbouring island

                    have advanced to their present position in Sumatra has been a very gradual one,
                    and even yet, though their supremacy is effective all round the coast, much of
                    the interior remains practically unpossessed. The following are the more
                    important political subdivisions of the country.</p>
                <p>A. The Dutch government of the West Coast (area 46,212 square miles), extending
                    along the shore of the Indian Ocean from Trumon, 2° 53' N. lat., to the
                    Mandjuta, 2° 25' S. lat., comprises the residencies Padang, Tapanuli, and the
                    Padang Highlands <hi rend="italic">(Padangsche Bovenlanden).</hi><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0666-0639"/> The governor of the whole government has his
                    residence at Padang. The residency of Padang is bounded south by Benkulen and
                    north by Tapanuli. It contains a large number of separate districts, mostly
                    corresponding to natural divisions formed by mountain-spurs or river valleys.
                    Among the rest are Indrapura, Tapan, Lunang, and Silaut, which form the regency
                    of Indrapura, and are the remains of the ancient kingdom of that name.
                    Administratively Padang is divided into Ayer Bangis and Rau, Priaman, Padang,
                    Painan. The headquarters of Ayer Bangis and Rau is Talu, to the north of Mt
                    Ophir. Ayer Bangis itself is on the coast, and has a good roadstead on one of
                    the islands that protect its bay. At Rau is the Dutch fort of Amerongen, and to
                    the north-west the old fort of Balong or Sevenhoven. Padang is a town of some
                    2000 houses and 15,000 inhabitants, with a Chinese settlement and a European
                    quarter. It is the chief market in Sumatra for gold. Indrapura lies about 8
                    miles up the river of its own name, and is now only an unimportant village of
                    bamboo huts. The residency of Tapanuli is divided into Siboga (which includes
                    the Nias Islands), Natal, Mandeling and Angkola, Padang Lawas. The town of
                    Siboga has considerable commercial importance, the bay on which it stands being
                    one of the finest in all Sumatra. Tapanuli, the ancient capital, and Sinkil, a
                    commercial town, also deserve to be mentioned. In Natal (properly Natar) the
                    leading places are Jambur, Sinkuang, and Natar. Padang Sidem-puan, the chief
                    town of Mandeling and Angkola, lies to the south of Mt Lubu Raya. Fort Elout was
                    formerly the military centre in Great Mandeling. The residency of the Padang
                    Highlands lies east of Padang proper. The whole surface is mountainous, and the
                    natural districts are very numerous. Again, Batipu and the X. Kotas,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Kota” means settlement or

                    the five administrative divisions. Bukit Tinggi, or, as it is usually called,
                    Fort de Kock, is the capital of the residency; other places of note are Bondjol,
                    Padang Pandjang Payakombo, Fort van der Capellen, Pagar Rujung (the residence of
                    the last prince of Menangkabau), Priyangan (the remains of another capital of
                    Menangkabau), Sinkarah, and Solok. To the government of the West Coast belong
                    the following islands :—Banyak Islands, a small limestone group, well wooded and
                    sparsely peopled; Nias Islands, with an area of 2523 square miles; Batu Islands
                    (Pulu Pingi, Pulu Baai, Tanah Masa, Tanah Balla, &amp;c.; area 630 square
                    miles); Mentawei and Pageh or Nassau Islands (area 4200 square miles); Engano
                    (area 360 square miles), annexed by Holland in 1863 and seldom visited. The Nias
                    Islands are a very interesting group (see Dr Schreiber in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petermann’s Mittheil.,</hi> 1881). There are no volcanoes, but earthquakes are
                    very frequent. In the north the villages are mainly perched on steep hills
                    reached by ladders; in the south they are larger and occupy low-lying sites.</p>
                <p>B. The residency of Benkulen or Bencoolen <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Bang
                    Kulon, “west coast ”) lies along the west coast from the Mandjuta to the south
                    end of Sumatra. It is divided into eight districts :—Mokko-Mokko; Lais or Sungei
                    Lama; the district <hi rend="italic">(ommelanden)</hi> of Benkulen; the capital
                    Benkulen; Seluma; Mana and Pasumah Ulu Mana; Kauer; and lastly Kru. Among the
                    noteworthy places are Mokko-Mokko, with the old English fort Anna; Bantal; Lais
                    (Laye), the former seat of the English resident; and Benkulen, the capital, with
                    12,000 inhabitants, Fort Marlborough, and a Chinese kampong (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bencoolen).</hi></p>
                <p>C. The residency of the Lampong districts, separated from Palembang by the
                    Masudji river, is partly mountainous (Lampong Peak 6800 feet), partly so flat as
                    to be under water in the rainy season. It is divided into the districts of Telok
                    Betong, Tulang Bawang, Seputih, Sekampong, Katimbang, and Semangka. The more
                    important places are Telok Betong, chief town of the residency, Menggala (with a
                    good trade), Gunung Sugi, Sukadana, Tandjong Karang, Beniawang.</p>
                <p>D. The residency of Palembang consists of the former kingdom of this name,
                    various districts more or less dependent on that monarchy, and (since 1839) the
                    kingdom of Jambi. With the exclusion of this last it is divided into the
                    administrative districts of Palembang; Tebing Tinggi; Lematang I lu, Lematang
                    Ilir, and the Pasumah country; Komering Ulu, Ogan Ulu, Inim, and the Ranau
                    districts; Musi Ilir; Ogan Ilir, Komering Ilir, and Blidah; and Iliran and Banyu
                    Asin. In the kingdom of Jambi the government is left in the hands of the native
                    chief. The town of Palembang is a large place of 50,000 inhabitants (2500
                    Chinese), with extensive barracks, hospitals, &amp;c., a mosque (1740),
                    considered the finest in the Dutch Indies, and a traditional tomb of Alexander
                    the Great. A good description of the town and its river approaches is given by
                    Mr Forbes.</p>
                <p>E. The kingdom of Indragiri (along with Kwanten and the districts of Retell and
                    Mandah) is administratively subject to the residency of Riouw.</p>
                <p>F. The residency of the East Coast was formed in 1873 of the territory of Siak
                    and its dependencies and the state of Kampar. It consists of five divisions,—the
                    island Bengkalis, Siak proper, Labuan Batu, Asahan, Deli. The island has an area
                    of 529 square miles and a population of 5000. Deli is the most important part of
                    the residency, —having been since 1870 the seat of the Amsterdam Deli Company,
                    engaged in growing tobacco, coffee, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>G. In 1878 the Achin (Atjeh) kingdom was turned into a Dutch government, but the
                    greater part of the territory is still but little known. Compare <hi

                    rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> Though Sumatra is separated from Java by so narrow a
                    strait, the botanist at once finds that he has broken new ground when he crosses
                    to the northern island, and the farther he advances inward the more striking
                    becomes the originality of the flora. The alang fields, which play a great part
                    in Java, have even a wider range in Sumatra, descending to within 700 or 800
                    feet of sea-level; where-ever a space in the forest is clearea this aggressive
                    grass begins to take possession of the soil, and if once it be fully rooted the
                    woodland has great difficulty in re-establishing itself. Among the orders more

                    of the Sumatran forms which do not occur in Java are found in the Malay

                    has advanced almost to the equator, and in the south are a variety of species
                    characteristic of the Australian region. The distribution of species does not
                    depend on elevation to the same extent as in Java, where the horizontal zones
                    are clearly marked; and there appears to be a tendency of all forms to grow at
                    lower altitudes than in that island. A remarkable feature of the Sumatran flora
                    is the great variety of trees that vie with each other in stature and beauty,
                    and as a timber-producing country the island ranks high even among the richly
                    wooded lands of the archipelago.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    however, beginning to tell on certain districts,—the natives often destroying a
                    whole tree for a plank or rafter. The principal cultivated plants, apart from
                    sugar cane aud coffee, are rice (in great variety of kinds), the cocoa-nut palm,
                    the areng palm, the areca and the sago palms, maize (jagung), yams, and sweet
                    potatoes; and among the fruit trees are the Indian tamarind, the blimbing,
                    pomegranate, jambosa, guava, papaw, orange, and lemon. Even before the arrival
                    of Europeans Sumatra was known for its pepper plantations; and these still form
                    the most conspicuous feature of the south of the island. For the foreign market
                    coffee is the most important of all the crops,—the Padang districts being the
                    chief seat of its cultivation. The average value of the coffee brought to market
                    in Padang in the three years 1880-82 was £521,000. Benzoin was formerly obtained

                    but to what extent the Malay has absorbed pre-Malayan blood is still open to
                    investigation. The Kubus, a race or tribe still found in an emphatically savage
                    state in the interior, have been by some regarded as the remains of an
                    aboriginal stock; but Mr J. G. Garson, reporting on Kubu skulls and skeletons
                    submitted to him by Mr Forbes, comes to the conclusion that they are decidedly
                    Malay, though the frizzle in the hair might indicate a certain mixture of
                    Negrito blood <hi rend="italic">(Journ. Anthrop. Inst.,</hi> 1884). They speak
                    the Malay dialect of the district to which they belong.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting of all the savage or semi-savage peoples is the
                    Battaks or Batahs. About these a great deal has been written since Junghuhn
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Die Battaländer</hi> in 1847. It is not known
                    whether they were settled in Sumatra before the Hindu period. Their language
                    contains words of Sanskrit origin and others most readily referred to Javanese,
                    Malay, Menangkabau, Macassar, Sundanese, Niasese, and Tagai influence. At the
                    present time they occupy the country to the south-east of Achin, in the centre
                    of which lies the great Toba Lake; but it is evident that they formerly
                    possessed, or at least were present in, various other districts both north and
                    south. The process of absorption into the Achin and Malay population which is
                    now rapidly going on seems to have been long at work. In many points the Battaks
                    are quite different from the Malay type. The average stature of the men is about
                    5 feet 4 inches, of the women 4 feet 8 inches. In general build they are rather
                    thickset, with broad shoulders and fairly muscular limbs. The colour of the skin
                    ranges from dark brown to a yellowish tint, the darkness apparently quite
                    independent of climatic influences or distinction of race. The skull is rather
                    oval than round. In marked contrast to the Malay type are the large black
                    long-shaped eyes, beneath heavy black or dark brown eyebrows. The cheek bones
                    are somewhat prominent, but less so than among the Malays. J. B. Neumann<note

                    by the Pasumahs, who bear traces of Javanese elements or influence. Full details

                    van Langen <hi rend="italic">(Tijdschr. voor Ind. Taal-, Land-, en
                    Volkcn∙Kunde,</hi> Batavia, xxviii.), to have consisted of the Mantirs, who seem
                    to have been driven inland by the Battaks and the Cheties (Tjeties) or Hindus.
                    The Achinese language is at present spoken in four main dialects, of which the
                    purest or most cultured is that of the XXV. and XXVI. Mukims. It shows, besides
                    the Mantir element, Malay, Battak, Hindu, and Arabic influence. The inhabitants
                    of the Nias Islands have a special tongue, which has been studied by Herr
                    Sundermann.</p>
                <p>The physical conditions of large tracts render it certain that as a whole the
                    island cannot be thickly peopled. In 1881 the Government <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almanac</hi> gave the population of the Dutch possessions as 2,142,873 (2894
                    Europeans, 2,098,984 natives, 11,289 Chinese, 1929 “Arabs,” and 27,777 Orientals
                    of other stock). To this considerable additions must be made, as the kingdom of
                    Achin (356,000 at least), as well as Indragiri and Kwanten (about 30,000).
                    Perhaps a fair estimate for the whole is somewhat under 3,500,000. The Nias
                    Islands would add 230,000 to the total. The most populous region is the
                    government of the West Coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> As far as is known, Sumatran civilization and
                    culture are of Hindu origin; and it is not improbable that the island was the
                    first of all the archipelago to receive the Indian immigrants who played so
                    important a part in the history of the region. Certain inscriptions discovered
                    in the Padang Highlands seem to certify the existence in the 7th century of a
                    powerful Hindu kingdom in Tanah Datar, not far from the site of the later
                    capital of Menangkabau. In these inscriptions Sumatra is called the “first
                    Java.” The traces of Hindu influence still to be found in the island are
                    extremely numerous, though far from being so important as those of Java. There
                    are ruins of Hindu temples at Butar in Deli, near Pertibi, on the Panbi river at
                    Jambi, in the interior of Palembang above Lahat, and in numerous other
                    localities. One of the principal Hindu ruins is at Muara Takus on the Kampar
                    river.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See descriptions

                    40 feet high) may possil&gt;ly date from the 11th century. At Pagar Rujung are
                    several stones with inscriptions in Sanskrit and Menangkabau Malay. Sanskrit
                    words occur in the various languages spoken in the island; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ficus religiosa,</hi> the sacred tree of the Hindu, is also the
                    sacred tree of the Battaks. At a later period the Hindu influence in Sumatra was
                    strengthened by an influx of Hindus from Java, who settled in Palembang, Jambi,
                    and Indragiri, but their attachment to Sivaism prevented them from coalescing
                    with their Buddhist brethren in the north. In the 13th century Mohammedanism
                    began to make itself felt, and in course of time took a firm hold upon some of
                    the most important states. In Menangkabau, for instance, the Arabic alphabet
                    displaced the Kawi (ancient Javanese) character previously employed. Native
                    chronicles derive the Menangkabau princes from Alexander the Great; and the
                    Achinese dynasty boasts its origin from a missionary of Islam. The town of
                    Samudera was at that period the seat of an important principality in the north
                    of the island, whose current name is probably a corruption of this word.<note
