                    Castelfranco in 1655, and at a very early age was admitted as a chorister at St
                    Mark’s in Venice. In 1667 the beauty of his voice attracted the attention of
                    Count Tattenbach, by whom he was taken to Munich, where his education was
                    completed at the expense of Ferdinand Maria, elector of Bavaria, who appointed
                    him “Churfürstlicher Kammer-und Hof-musikus,” and granted him a liberal salary.
                    After receiving instruction from Johann Kaspar Kerl, and possibly Ercole
                    Bernabei, he was sent in 1673 to study in Rome, where, among other works, he
                    composed six motets, the original MSS. of which are now in the Fitzwilliam
                    Museum at Cambridge. On his return to Munich in 1674 he published his first
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Psalmodia Vespertina,</hi> a part of which was reprinted
                    in Martini’s <hi rend="italic">Saggio di Contrappunto</hi> in 1674.</p>
                <p>In 1675 he was appointed court organist, and in 1680 he was ordained priest, with
                    the title of abbate of Lepsing. His ecclesiastical status did not, however,
                    prevent him from turning his attention to the stage, for which, at different
                    periods of his life, he composed works which undoubtedly exercised a potent
                    influence upon the dramatic music of the period. Of his first opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Marco Aurelio,</hi> produced at Munich in 1681, the only copy
                    known to exist is a MS. score preserved in the royal library at Buckingham
                    palace. It was followed by <hi rend="italic">Solone</hi> in 1685, <hi
                    rend="italic">Servio Tullio</hi> in 1686, <hi rend="italic">Alaricο</hi> in
                    1687, and <hi rend="italic">Niobe</hi> in 1688; but of these four last-named
                    works no trace can now be discovered. <hi rend="italic">Niobe</hi> was the last
                    opera Steffani composed at Munich. Notwithstanding the favour shown to him by
                    the elector Maximilian Emanuel, he accepted in 1689 the appointment of
                    kapellmeister at the court of Hanover, where he speedily gained the goodwill of
                    Ernest Augustus, duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (afterwards raised to the dignity of
                    elector of Hanover), the duchess Sophia Charlotte (afterwards electress of
                    Brandenburg), the philosopher Leibnitz, the abbate Ortensio Mauro, and many men
                    of letters and intelligence, and where, in 1710, he showed great kindness to
                    Handel, who was then just entering upon his glorious career. He inaugurated a
                    long series of triumphs in Hanover by composing, for the opening of the new
                    opera-house in 1689, an opera called <hi rend="italic">Enrico il Leone,</hi>
                    which was produced with extraordinary splendour aud achieved an immense
                    reputation. For the same theatre he composed <hi rend="italic">La Lotta d’Ercole
                    con Achilleo</hi> in 1689, <hi rend="italic">La Superbia d’Alessandro</hi> in
                    1690, <hi rend="italic">Orlando Generoso</hi> in 1691, <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Rivali Concordi</hi> in 1692, <hi rend="italic">La Liberta Contenta</hi> in
                    1693, <hi rend="italic">I Trionfi del Fato</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I
                    Baccanali</hi> in 1695, and <hi rend="italic">Briseide</hi> in 1696. The
                    libretto of <hi rend="italic">Briseide</hi> is by Palmieri. Those of most if not
                    all the others are by the abbate Mauro. The scores are preserved at Buckingham
                    palace, where, in company with five volumes of songs and three of duets, they
                    form part of the collection brought to England by the elector of Hanover in
                    1714. But it was not only as a musician that Steffani distinguished himself in
                    his new home. The elevation of Ernest Augustus to the electorate in 1692 led to
                    difficulties, for the arrangement of which it was necessary that an ambassador
                    should visit the various German courts, armed with a considerable amount of
                    diplomatic power. The accomplished abbate was sent on this delicate mission in
                    1696, with the title of envoy extraordinary; and he fulfilled his difficult task
                    so well that Pope Innocent XI., in recognition of certain privileges he had
                    secured for the Hanoverian Catholics, consecrated him bishop of Spiga <hi
                    rend="italic">in partibus infidelium.</hi> In 1698 he was sent as ambassador to
                    Brussels; and after the death of Ernest Augustus in the same year he entered the
                    service of the elector palatine, John William, at Düsseldorf, where he held the
                    offices of privy councillor and protonotary of the holy see. Invested with these
                    high honours, Steffani could scarcely continue to produce dramatic compositions
                    in public without grievous breach of etiquette. But his genius was too real to
                    submit to repression; and in 1709 he ingeniously avoided the difficulty by
                    producing two new operas— <hi rend="italic">Enea</hi> at Hanover and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tassilone</hi> at Düsseldorf—in the name of his secretary and
                    amanuensis Gregorio Piva, whose signature is attached to the scores preserved at
                    Buckingham palace. Another score—that of <hi rend="italic">Arnwnio—</hi> in the
                    same collection, dated Düsseldorf, 1707, and evidently the work of Steffani,
                    bears no composer’s name.</p>
                <p>Steffani did not accompany the elector George to England; but in 1724 the Academy
                    of Antient Musick in London elected him its honorary president for life; and in
                    return for the compliment he sent the association a magnificent <hi
                    rend="italic">Stabat Mater,</hi> for six voices and orchestra,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0553-0530"/> and three fine madrigals. The MSS. of these are
                    still in existence; and the British Museum possesses a very fine <hi
                    rend="italic">Confitebor,</hi> for three voices and orchestra, of about the same
                    period. All these compositions are very much in advance of the age in which they
                    were written; and in his operas Steffani shows an appreciation of the demands of
                    the stage very remarkable indeed at a period at which the musical drama was
                    gradually approaching the character of a mere formal concert, with scenery and
                    dresses. But for the MSS. at Buckingham palace, these operas would be utterly
                    unknown; but Steffani will never cease to be remembered by his beautiful chamber
                    duets, which, like those of his contemporary Carlo Maria Clari (1669-1745), are
                    chiefly written in the form of cantatas for two voices, accompanied by a figured
                    bass. The British Museum possesses more than a hundred of these charming
                    compositions,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Add. MSS.
                    5055 <hi rend="italic">sg.</hi></p></note> some of which were published at
                    Munich in 1679. Steffani visited Italy for the last time in 1729, in which year
                    Handel, who always gratefully remembered the kindness he had received from him
                    at Hanover, once more met him at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome. This
                    was the last time the two composers were destined to meet. Steffani returned
                    soon afterwards to Hanover, and died in 1730 while engaged in the transaction of
                    some diplomatic business at Frankfort.</p>
