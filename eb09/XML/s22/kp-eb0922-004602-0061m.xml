                <p><label type="entry">SIGHTS</label>. A sight for shooting may be defined as an
                    apparatus for determining the point of impact of a projectile, in popular
                    language, for “aiming” or “laying.” In its simplest form it is scarcely
                    recognizable as a sight. When an expert cricketer throws the ball straight to
                    the wicket the eye and the hand assume that relative position which experience
                    has taught to be correct, and the eye may be said to lay the hand on the wicket
                    by means of the intervening muscles, which therefore constitute the sight. The
                    next step towards accuracy is seen in the ordinary shot-gun, where the eye is
                    placed over and behind the centre of the breech, and sees that a bead placed
                    above the centre of the muzzle is in a direct line with the desired point of
                    impact. If we add a notch at the centre of the breech to fix the eye more
                    accurately, we shall have the hind-sight, the fore-sight, and the object brought
                    into line, when the gun is correctly laid.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0062-0047"/> if we could assume (1) that the projectile was
                    not subject to gravity; (2) that it had no tendency to deviate if passing
                    through a calm atmosphere; (3) that the object aimed at was stationary; (4) that
                    the weapon discharged was stationary; (5) that the atmosphere was still.</p>
                <p>(1) The first condition is never realized: the projectile begins to drop towards
                    the earth the moment it leaves the gun, and therefore to make it strike at a
                    given level its first direction must be above this level. Hence the hind-sight
                    must be raised to make the necessary correction, and the angle between the axis
                    of the piece and the straight line connecting the elevated hind-sight with the
                    fore-sight and object is called the “angle of elevation.” Supposing the
                    projectile to move <hi rend="italic">in vacuo</hi> and to drop simply under the
                    action of gravity, the calculation of the amount of elevation to be given for
                    any range at any velocity would be easily made, but the resistance of the air
                    renders the problem an exceedingly complicated and difficult one (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gunnery),</hi> and only approximate solutions have as yet been
                    discovered. Next, supposing the hind-sight to be correctly elevated, it is
                    evidently necessary to keep it upright; deviation to the right will cause the
                    projectile to strike to the right of the object and deviation to the left to
                    strike to the left of it. The amount of error is given by the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> = <hi rend="italic">r</hi> tan <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> tan
                    <hi rend="italic">ϵ</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = error in direction,
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = range, <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> = angle made by plane
                    of elevation with the perpendicular, and <hi rend="italic">ϵ</hi> = angle of
                    elevation. The rifleman should study to keep the hind-sight as upright as
                    possible, and indeed little error is likely to occur with a good shot from this
                    cause. But the case is very different with a gun mounted on an uneven or moving
                    platform, and many devices have been resorted to for automatically overcoming
                    the difficulty. They all, however, belong to either the spirit-level or the
                    pendulum type.</p>
                <p>(2) Secondly, the projectile deviates of its own accord from the vertical plane.
                    If it is unrifled, its imperfections of manufacture cause errors which may be in
                    any direction, and which, therefore, cannot be compensated by any method of
                    sighting. If it is rifled, the spin given to it renders these imperfections of
                    little consequence, but, on the other hand, confers a constant tendency to
                    deviation. If we lay a gun on the face of a clock, and the rifling causes a
                    point on the surface of the shot to turn in the same direction as the hands, the
                    shot will deviate to the right, contrariwise to the left. The cause and extent
                    of this motion have never been thoroughly worked out. It appears to arise from
                    the circumstance that the axis round which the shot rotates points always above
                    the trajectory, since the principle of least resistance causes the direction of
                    the axis to follow tardily the ever-changing curve; hence the pressure of the
                    air, which of course acts in the direction of the trajectory, is greater on the
                    lower than on the upper surface, and the unequal friction thereby set up causes
                    the shot, as it were, to roll sideways; here also the principle of least
                    resistance turns the axis slightly out of the vertical plane of fire towards the
                    actual direction of the projectile. The path is doubly curved,—first, downwards
                    by gravity, secondly, sideways by the rotation; the latter curve, seen in plan,
                    is nearly a parabola. In order to correct this tendency of rifled projectiles to
                    shoot round the corner, as it may be said, the hind-sight is inclined at an
                    angle with the vertical, so that the more it is raised to give elevation the
                    greater becomes the correction, which assumes the form of a curve not very
                    dissimilar to that due to rotation. The amount of error is practically
                    determined on the firing ground, and the proper angle for the sight is given by
                    the formula</p>
                <p>(3) Every one who shoots birds on the wing is acquainted with the difficulties
                    appertaining to the non-fulfilment of the third condition. The expert game-shot
                    aims ahead of the object more or less, according to his judgment of the relative
                    velocities of the projectile and the target and of the distance of the latter.
                    Practice makes this comparatively easy at the short ranges of ordinary sport;
                    but in the case of a heavy fort gun firing at a vessel under full steam 3000
                    yards off, it becomes evident that considerable allowance must be made. Put the
                    mean horizontal velocity of the shot over a 3000 yards range at 1000
                    foot-seconds, the time of flight will be 9 seconds; if the ship is running past
                    at the rate of 20 foot-seconds it will have traversed 180 feet during the shot’s
                    flight, and it will be necessary to direct the gun so much ahead of the desired
                    point of impact. The angle of divergence in the case just given is tan <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -1∙</hi> 02; and, supposing the horizontal velocity of the
                    projectile to be constant throughout its flight, this angle would be correct for
                    a ship running at a speed of 20 foot-seconds whatever the range.</p>
                <p>(4) The fourth condition is rarely met with except on board ship, and it is
                    evident that it obeys the same laws and is subject to the same kind of
                    correction as the third. The correcting angle, however, is here given by the
                    ship’s speed across the line of fire and the starting velocity of the
                    projectile.</p>
                <p>(5) The fifth source of error differs from the others in being variable and
                    uncontrollable. A gust of wind may spoil the best shot; and, though it is
                    possible in practice to allow for deviation due to a steady breeze, yet the
                    force and even the direction of the moving air differ so frequently at different
                    parts of the trajectory that it has hitherto been found impossible to devise any
                    satisfactory correction beyond that obtainable from knowledge of the point of
                    impact of a previous shot. The effect of wind on direction may be calculated
                    from the formula where D = deflexion in feet, W = velocity of wind in feet per
                    second, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> = time of flight in seconds, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ϕ</hi> = angle between direction of wind and line of fire, A = area of
                    longitudinal section of shot in square feet, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = weight
                    of shot in pounds, <hi rend="italic">g =</hi> force of gravity. This formula
                    assumes that the wind steadily carries the shot sideways without changing the
                    parallelism of its axis, an assumption not greatly in error with heavy
                    projectiles having the centre of gravity nearly coincident with the centre of
                    figure. The effect of wind on range may be arrived at by adding or subtracting
                    the velocity of the air, resolved in the direction of the object, to or from the
                    horizontal velocity of the projectile and calculating by the tables (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gunnery)</hi> the loss or gain due to the increased or
                    diminished resistance.</p>
                <p>The accompanying diagrams (figs. 1, 2) represent what are called “speed-sights”
                    in the royal navy, as applied to a 4-inch breechloading gun. The gun is shown
                    elevated at 8° for a range of 4600 yards. The hind or “tangent” sight is sloped
                    sideways at an angle of 1° 30' to correct the constant tendency of the
                    projectile to deviate to the right. The sight is raised in the socket till the
                    lowest visible graduation on the bar reads the required range on the face
                    towards the breech and the elevation in degrees on the face towards the muzzle.
                    A crosshead carries a leaf, which is traversed to the right or left by a
                    double-threaded screw; this leaf is provided with a fine wire strung
                    horizontally between two uprights; hence this form of sight is sometimes known
                    as the H sight. The crosshead is graduated with two scales, one on the
                    muzzle-face reading minutes of deflexion for giving any desired correction for
                    wind or uneven platform, the other on the breech-face for allowing for the speed
                    of the enemy in knots across the line of fire. The fore-sight is fixed in the
                    gun, and cannot be raised or lowered. It has a crosshead provided with a
                    traversing leaf, which carries a round bead on a thin support. The crosshead is
                    graduated to allow for the speed of the firing vessel across the line of fire.
                    In practice the gunner makes all these adjustments as nearly as he can judge,
                    then takes up his<pb break="no"

                    gun, holding the firing lanyard taut; when the object and the bead of the
                    fore-sight appear to be on the centre of the wire across the H of the hindsight
                    he fires.</p>
                <p>The forms of sights preferred by experts for accurate laying are extremely
                    varied, and nothing but practice can determine the most suitable to individual
                    eyesight. Where the eye can be brought close to the hind-sight, one of the best
                    systems is that adopted for British field-guns, where a fine peep-hole
                    constitutes the hind-sight, and the foresight consists of diagonal cross-wires;
                    the first rapid or rough adjustment of the gun is made with the aid of a
                    ⋁-shaped notch on the hind-sight and an acorn point on the fore-sight. Some
                    prefer pointers for the fore-sight, either ⋃-shaped, so that the object appears
                    between the cusps of the ⋃—this is the French method —or placed diagonally like
                    cross-wires with the intersection removed. Silvered vertical lines are preferred
                    by many good shots.</p>
                <p>If the gun is mounted in a fixed position, say on a siege platform, and, if the
                    relative positions of the target and some other object are known, it may be
                    found convenient to lay the gun on the target by directing the sights at the
                    other object. This is principally done in the case of howitzers dropping shells
                    at high elevation into a work. They fire over a protecting bank and are laid by
                    reversed sights from the muzzle backwards at a steeple, a pole, or other
                    convenient object.</p>
                <p>To secure greater accuracy than can be attained by the eye, telescopes are
                    resorted to. It is obviously easy to apply to a match rifle a telescope with
                    sufficient strength to resist the jar of firing, and to provide it with the
                    necessary fittings for elevation, deflexion, &amp;c.; but with ordnance the
                    shock is much greater, and the telescope has to be removed before firing. This
                    renders it difficult to secure a truly accurate attachment; but probably the
                    immediate future will witness a sufficiently satisfactory solution of the
                    problem as regards guns on firm platforms. Efforts have been made from time to
                    time to overcome the necessity for extreme accuracy due to the short bearing of
                    the telescope by bringing the fore-sight into play; this can be done either by
                    great powers of adjustment of focus, so as to view first the fore-sight and then
                    the target, or by adding a half-object lens, and so getting simultaneous images
                    of fore-sight and target.</p>
                <p>The application of electricity to the laying and firing of heavy guns has caused
                    a remarkable development of the systems of sighting introduced recently into the
                    forts which protect the shores of the United Kingdom. Suppose a battery of guns
                    to command a channel, and that it is desired to concentrate their fire on a
                    hostile vessel endeavouring to run past. Each detachment lays its gun both for
                    elevation and direction in accordance with the figures which appear on a dial in
                    the emplacement. Each dial is worked by electricity from an observing station
                    away from the smoke and noise of the fort; as the hostile vessel approaches the
                    observing officer follows its course on a chart. The observing station is placed
                    at a considerable height above the water-line, so that a vertical base of
                    calculation is obtained. Hence the angle of depression given by the telescope
                    when pointing at the object indicates the range, and the direction of the
                    telescope indicates the line of fire; these indications are automatically
                    corrected for the positions of the guns. In practice the officer follows the
                    ship’s course, signals to the battery the line and distance of a point a little
                    ahead of the vessel, and receives a signal from the battery that the guns are
                    laid and ready. He then fires electrically as the ship is coming into the
                    expected position. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. m.)</hi></p>
