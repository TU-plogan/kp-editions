                    previously famous, under his Christian name of Gerbert, first as a teacher and
                    afterwards as archbishop successively of Rheims and Ravenna, was an Aquitanian
                    by birth, and was educated from his boyhood at the abbey of St Gerold in
                    Aurillac. Here he seems to have had Gerald for his abbot and Raymond for his
                    instructor, both of whom were among the most trusted correspondents of his later
                    life. From Aurillac, while yet a young man <hi rend="italic">(adolescens),</hi>
                    he was carried off to the Spanish march by “Borrell, duke of Hither Spain” for
                    the sake of prosecuting his studies in a district where learning, at that time,
                    flourished more luxuriantly than in Aquitania. Borrell entrusted his young
                    protegé to the care of a certain Bishop Hatto, under whose instruction Gerbert
                    made great progress in mathematics. In<pb break="no"

                    letters of Gerbert and the hints of Richer or the later annalists, there is no
                    need to enter here. Gerbert’s policy is to be identified with that of his
                    metropolitan, and was strongly influenced by gratitude for the benefits that he
                    had received from both the elder Ottos.</p>
                <p>According to M. Olleris’s arrangement of the letters, Gerbert was at Mantua and
                    Rome in 985. Then followed the death of Lothaire (2d March 986) and of Louis V.,
                    the last Carolingian king, in May 987. Later on in the same year Adalbero
                    crowned Hugh Capet (1st June) and his son Robert (25th December). Such was the
                    power of Adalbero and Gerbert in those days that it was said their influence
                    alone sufficed to make and unmake kings. The archbishop died 23d January 989,
                    having, according to his secretary’s account, designated Gerbert his successor
                    before his decease. Notwithstanding this, the influence of the empress
                    Theophania secured the appointment for Arnulf, a bastard son of Lothaire. The
                    new prelate took the oath of fealty to Hugh Capet and persuaded Gerbert to
                    remain with him. When Charles of Lorraine, Arnulf’s uncle, and the illegitimate
                    son of Louis D’Outremer, surprised Rheims in the autumn of the same year,
                    Gerbert fell into his hands and for a time continued to serve Arnulf, who had
                    now gone over to his uncle’s side. He had, however, returned to his allegiance
                    to the house of Capet before the fall of Laon placed both Arnulf and Charles at
                    the mercy of the French king (<hi rend="italic underline"> c</hi>. 30th March
                    991). Then followed the council of St Basle, near Rheims, at which Arnulf
                    confessed his treason and was degraded from his office (17th June 991). In
                    return for his services Gerbert was elected to succeed the deposed bishop.</p>
                <p>The episcopate of the new metropolitan was marked by a vigour and activity that
                    were felt not merely in his own diocese but as far as Tours, Orleans, and Paris.
                    Meanwhile the friends of Arnulf appealed to Rome, and a papal legate was sent to
                    investigate the question. As yet Hugh Capet maintained the cause of his nominee
                    and forbade the prelates of his kingdom to be present at the council of Mouzon,
                    near Sedan (June 2, 995). Notwithstanding this prohibition Gerbert appeared in
                    his own behalf. The events of the next few years are somewhat obscure. Council
                    seems to have followed council, but with uncertain results. At last Hugh Capet
                    died in 996, and, shortly after, his son Robert married Bertha, the widow of
                    Odo, count of Blois. The pope condemned this marriage as adulterous; and Abbo of
                    Fleury, who visited Rome shortly after Gregory V.’s accession, is said to have
                    procured the restoration of Arnulf at the new pontiff’s demand. We may surmise
                    that Gerbert left France towards the end of 995, as he was present at Otto
                    III.’s coronation, May 21, 996. Somewhat later he became Otto’s instructor in
                    arithmetic, and had been appointed archbishop of Ravenna before May 998. Early
                    in the next year he was elected pope (April 999), and took the title of
                    Silvester II. In this capacity Gerbert showed the same energy that had
                    characterized his former life. He is generally credited with having fostered the
                    splendid vision of a restored empire that now began to fill the imagination of
                    the young emperor, who is said to have confirmed the papal claims to eight
                    counties in the Ancona march. Writing in the name of the desolate church at
                    Jerusalem he called upon the warriors of Christendom to arm themselves in
                    defence of the Holy City, once “the light of the world,” but now fallen so low.
                    Thus he sounds the first trumpet-call of the crusades, though almost a century
                    was to pass away before his note was repeated by Peter the Hermit and Urban
                    II.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This letter, even if
                    spurious as now suspected, is found in the 11th-century Leyden MS., and is
                    therefore anterior to the first crusade.</p><p>Nor did Silvester II. confine
                    himself to plans on a large scale. He is also found confirming his old rival
                    Arnulf in the see of Rheims; summoning Adalbero or Azelmus of Laon to Rome to
                    answer for his crimes; judging between the archbishop of Mainz and the bishop of
                    Hildesheim; besieging the revolted town of Cesena; flinging the count of
                    Angoulême into prison for an offence against a bishop; confirming the privileges
                    of Fulda abbey; granting charters to bishoprics far away on the Spanish mark;
                    and, on the eastern borders of the empire, erecting Prague as the seat of an
                    archbishopric for the Slavs. More remarkable than all his other acts is his
                    letter to St Stephen, king of Hungary, to whom he sent a golden crown, and whose
                    kingdom he accepted as a fief of the Holy See. It must, however, be remarked
                    that the genuineness of this letter, in which Gerbert to some extent foreshadows
                    the temporal claims of Hildebrand and Innocent III., has been hotly contested,
                    and that the original document has long been lost. All Gerbert’s dreams for the
                    advancement of church and empire were cut short by the death of Otto III., 4th
                    February 1002; and this event was followed a year later by the death of the pope
                    himself, which took place 12th May 1003. His body was buried in the church of St
                    John Lateran, where his tomb and inscription are yet to be seen.</p><p>A few
                    words must be devoted to Silvester II. as regards his attitude to the Church of
                    Rome and the learning of his age. He has left us two detailed accounts of the
                    proceedings of the council of St Basle; and, despite his reticence, it is
                    impossible to doubt that he was the moving spirit in Arnulf’s deposition. On the
                    whole it may be said that his position in this question as to the rights of the
                    papal see over foreign metropolitans resembled that of his great predecessor
                    Hincmar, to whose authority he constantly appeals. But it is useless to seek in
                    his writings for any definition of the relationship of these powers laid down
                    with logical precision. He is rather the practised debater who will admit his
                    opponent’s principles for the moment when he sees his way to moulding them to
                    his own purposes, than the philosophical statesman who has formulated a theory
                    from whose terms he will not move. Roughly sketched, his argument is as follows.
                    Rome is indeed to be honoured as the mother of the churches; nor would Gerbert
                    oppose her judgments except in two cases—(1) where she enjoins something that is
                    contrary to the decrees of a universal council, such as that of Nice, or (2)
                    where, after having been once appealed to in a matter of ecclesiastical
                    discipline and having refused to give a plain and speedy decision, she should,
                    at a later date, attempt to call in question the provisions of the metropolitan
                    synod called to remedy the effects of her negligence. The decisions of a Gregory
                    or a Leo the Great, of a Gelasius or an Innocent, prelates of holy life and
                    unequalled wisdom, are accepted by the universal church; for, coming from such
                    men, they cannot but be good. But who could recognize in the cruel and lustful
                    popes of later days,—in John XII. or Boniface VII., “monsters, as they were, of
                    more than human iniquity,”—anything else than “Antichrist sitting in the temple
                    of God and showing himself as God ?” Gerbert proceeds to argue that the church
                    councils admitted the right of metropolitan synods to depose unworthy bishops,
                    but contends that, even if an appeal to Rome were necessary, that appeal had
                    been made a year before without effect. This last clause prepares us to find him
                    shifting his position still further at the council of Causey, where he advances
                    the proposition that John XVI. was represented at St Basle by his legate Seguin,
                    archbishop of Sens, and that, owing to this, the decrees of the latter council
                    had received the papal sanction. Far firmer is the tone of his later letter to
                    the same archbishop, where he contends from historical evidence that the papal
                    judgment is not infallible, and encourages his brother prelate not to fear
                    excommunication in a righteous cause, for it is not in the power even of the
                    successor of Peter “to separate an innocent priest from the love of
                    Christ.”</p><p>Besides being the most distinguished statesman Gerbert was also
                    the most accomplished scholar of his age. But in this aspect he is rather to be
                    regarded as the diligent expositor of other men’s views than as an original
                    thinker. Except as regards philosophical and religious speculation, his writings
                    show a range of interest and knowledge quite unparalleled in that generation.
                    His pupil Richer has left us a detailed account of his system of teaching at
                    Rheims. So far as the trivium is concerned, his text-books were Victorinus’s
                    translation of Porphyry’s <hi rend="italic">Isagoge,</hi> Aristotle s <hi
                    rend="italic">Categories,</hi> and Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi> with
                    Manlius’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi> From dialectics he urged his
                    pupils to the study of rhetoric; but, recognizing the necessity of a large
                    vocabulary, he accustomed them to read the Latin poets with care. Virgil,
                    Statius, Terence, Juvenal, Horace,</p></note><pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0091-0076"/> Persius, and Lucan are specially named as
                    entering into a course of training which was rendered more stimulating by a free
                    use of open discussion. More remarkable still were his methods of teaching the
                    quadrivium. To assist his lectures on astronomy he constructed elaborate globes
                    of the terrestrial and celestial spheres, on which the course of the planets was
                    marked; for facilitating arithmetical and perhaps geometrical processes he
                    constructed an abacus with twenty-seven divisions and a thousand counters of
                    horn. A younger contemporary speaks of his having made a wonderful clock or
                    sun-dial at Magdeburg; and we know from his letters that Gerbert was accustomed
                    to exchange his globes for MSS. of those classical authors that his own library
                    did not contain. More extraordinary still was his knowledge of music—an
                    accomplishment which seems to have been his earliest recommendation to Otto I.
                    Probably he was beyond his age in this science, for we read of Garamnus, his
                    first tutor at Rheims, whom he attempted to ground in this subject: “Artis
                    difficultate victus, a musica rejectus est.” Gerbert’s letters contain more than
                    one allusion to organs which he seems to have constructed, and William of
                    Malmesbury has preserved an account of a wonderful musical instrument still to
                    be seen in his days at Rheims, which, so far as the English chronicler’s words
                    can be made out, seems to refer to an organ worked by steam. The same historian
                    tells us that Gerbert borrowed from the Arabs (Saraceni) the abacus with ciphers
                    (but see <hi rend="smallcaps">Numerals,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 627). Perhaps
                    Gerbert’s chief claim to the remembrance of posterity is to be found in the care
                    and expense with which he gathered together MSS. of the classical writers. His
                    love for literature was a passion. In the turmoil of his later life he looked
                    back with regret to his student days; and “for all his troubles philosophy was
                    his only cure.” Everywhere —at Rome, at Treves, at Moutier-en-Der, at Gerona in
                    Spain, at Barcelona—he had friends or agents to procure him copies of the great
                    Latin writers for Bobbio or Rheims. To the abbot of Tours he writes that he is
                    “labouring assiduously to form a library,” and “throughout Italy, Germany, and
                    Lorraine (Belgica) is spending vast sums of money in the acquisition of MSS.” It
                    is noteworthy, however, that Gerbert never writes for a copy of one of the
                    Christian fathers, his aim being, seemingly, to preserve the fragments of a
                    fast-perishing secular Latin literature. It is equally remarkable that, despite
                    his residence on the Spanish mark, he shows no token of a knowledge of Arabic, a
                    fact which is perhaps sufficient to overthrow the statement of his younger
                    contemporary Adhemar as to his having studied at Cordova. There is hardly a
                    trace to be found in his writings of any acquaintance with Greek.</p>
                <p>So remarkable a character as that of Gerbert left its mark on the age, and fables
                    soon began to cluster round his name. Towards the end of the 11th century
                    Cardinal Benno, the opponent of Hildebrand, is said to have made him the first
                    of a long line of magician popes. Orderic Vitalis improves this legend by
                    details of an interview with the devil, who prophesied Gerbert’s threefold
                    elevation in the famous line that Gerbert’s contemporaries attributed to the
                    pope himself:</p>
                <p>Transit in R. Gerbertus in R. post papa vigens R.</p>
                <p>A few years later William of Malmesbury adds a love adventure at Cordova, a
                    compact with the devil, the story of a speaking statue that foretold Gerbert’s
                    death at Jerusalem—a prophecy fulfilled, somewhat as in the case of Henry IV. of
                    England, by his dying in the Jerusalem church of Rome,—and that imaginative
                    story of the statue with the legend “Strike here,” which, after having found its
                    way into the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum,</hi> has of late been revived in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Earthly Paradise.</hi></p>
                <p>Gerbert’s extant works may be divided into five classes. (<hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>) A collection of letters, some 230 in number. These are to be found for
                    the most part in an 11th-century MS. at Leyden. Other important MSS. are those
                    of the Barberini Library nt Rome (late 16th century), of Middlehiil (17th
                    century), and of St Peter’s abbey, Salzburg. With the letters may be grouped the
                    papal decrees of Gerbert when Silvester II. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta Concilii Remensis ad Sanctum Basolum,</hi> a detailed account
                    of the proceedings and discourses at the great council of St Basle; a shorter
                    account of his apologetic speeches at the councils of Mouzon and Causey; and
                    drafts of the decrees of two or three other councils or imperial constitutions
                    promulgated when he was archbishop of Ravenna or pope. The important works on
                    the three above-mentioned councils are to be found in the 11th-century Leyden
                    MS. just alluded to. (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) Gerbert's theological works
                    comprise a <hi rend="italic">Sermo de Informatione Episcoporum</hi> and a
                    treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">De Corpore et Sanguine Domini,</hi> both of
                    very doubtful authenticity, (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Of his philosophical
                    works we only have one, <hi rend="italic">Libellus de Rationali et Ratione
                    uti,</hi> written at the request of Otto III. and preserved in an 11th-century
                    MS. at Paris. (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) His mathematical works consist of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Regula de Abaco Computi,</hi> of which a 12th-century MS. is to be
                    found at the Vatican; and a <hi rend="italic">Libellus de Numerorum
                    Divisione</hi> (11th and 12th century MSS. at Rome, Montpellier, and Paris),
                    dedicated to his friend and correspondent Constantine of Fleury. A long treatise
                    on geometry, attributed to Gerbert, is of somewhat doubtful authenticity. To
                    these may be added a very short disquisition on the same subject addressed to
                    Adalbold, and a similar one, on one of his own spheres, addressed to
                    Constantine, abbot of Micy. All the writings of Gerbert are collected in the
                    edition of M. Olleris. (T. A. A.)</p>
