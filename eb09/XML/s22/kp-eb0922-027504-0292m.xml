                    >académie</hi> of that city and of the three faculties of theology, science, and

                    Sorbon, a poor priest of Champagne, who, arriving in Paris about the beginning
                    of the reign of St Louis, attained high repute by his sanctity and eloquence,
                    and was appointed by the king to be his chaplain. Assisted by royal liberality,
                    he built upon Mont Sainte-Geneviève a modest establishment in which were
                    accommodated seven priests charged with the duty of teaching theology
                    gratuitously; to this he added a college of preparatory studies, all under the
                    direction of a provisor, under whom was an annual prior who had the actual
                    management. The new institution was authorized by letters patent of 1255, and
                    canonically sanctioned by Pope Alexander IV. in 1259. Destined originally for
                    poor students, the Sorbonne soon became a meeting-place for all the students of
                    the university of Paris, who resorted thither to hear the lectures of the most
                    learned theologians of the period,—Guillaume de Saint Amour, Eudes de Douai,
                    Laurent l’Anglais, Pierre d’Ailly. At the close of the century it was organized
                    into a full faculty of theology, and under this definitive form it conferred
                    bachelor’s, licentiate’s, and doctor’s degrees, and the severity of its
                    examinations gave an exceptional value to its diplomas. The so-called “thèse
                    Sorbonique,” instituted towards the beginning of the 14th century, became the
                    type of its order by the length and difficulty of its tests. Ultimately the
                    professors of the Sorbonne came to be resorted to, not only for lectures and
                    examinations, but also for dogmatic decisions and judgments in canon law; the
                    clergy of France and of the whole Catholic world had recourse to them in
                    difficult cases, and the Curia Romana itself more than once laid its doubts
                    before them, giving them the title of “Concilium in Gallia subsistens.” The
                    Sorbonne took a leading part in the religious discussions which agitated France
                    during the 16th and 18th centuries, and its influence thus inevitably extended
                    to political questions. During the insanity of Charles VI. it helped to bring
                    about the absolution of Jean Sans-Peur for the assassination of the duke of
                    Orleans. Shortly afterwards it demanded and supported the condemnation of Joan
                    of Arc; during the Reformation it was the animating spirit of all the
                    persecutions directed against Protestants and unbelievers: without having
                    advised the massacre of St Bartholomew, it did not hesitate to justify it, and
                    it inflamed the League by its vigorous anathemas against Henry III. and the king
                    of Navarre, hesitating to recognize the latter even after his abjuration. From
                    this point dates the beginning of its decadence, and, when Richelieu in 1629
                    ordered the reconstruction of its church and buildings, the following prophetic
                    couplet was circulated—</p>

                <p>The declaration of the clergy in 1682, which it subscribed, proved fatal to its

                    during the struggle against Jansenism, but this was its last exploit; it was
                    suppressed like the old universities in 1790. To the Sorbonne belongs the glory
                    of having introduced printing into France in 1469: within its precincts it
                    assigned quarters for Ulric Gering and two companions in which to set up their
                    presses.</p>
                <p>When the university of France was organized in 1808 the Sorbonne became the seat

                    faculties of theology, science, and literature were installed there with their
                    libraries. All the great university functions are held within its great
                    amphitheatre. Since 1861 there has annually been held in the Sorbonne at Easter
                    an official congress in which are represented the learned societies of the
                    departments; there are five sections—those of archeology, history, the moral and
                    political sciences, the physical sciences, geography,—which hold separate
                    sittings. The fine arts form a sixth section, with a special organization.</p>
