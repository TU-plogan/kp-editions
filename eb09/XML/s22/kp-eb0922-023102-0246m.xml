                    (Arabic <hi rend="italic">Sokotrá),</hi> an island of the Indian Ocean, 150
                    miles from Cape Gardafιιi and about 220 from the Arabian coast. Its length from
                    east to west is 71 miles, its greatest breadth 22. A plain 2 to 4 miles wide
                    skirts the greater part of the coast, while the interior is mountainous. The
                    granite peaks behind Tamarída (a village on the north coast and the chief place
                    in the island, but now much decayed) rise to a height of 4000 feet, and a
                    limestone chain connected with these runs north and south with an average height
                    of about 1900 feet. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy, with much rain,
                    especially during the south-west monsoon. At this season the temperature rises
                    to 80° or even 95°, but on the whole the heat is not excessive. The scenery of
                    the island is very striking, with bare rocky heights and fertile valleys; but
                    there is little cultivation, the inhabitants living mainly by their vast flocks
                    of sheep and goats, or on dates, homegrown and imported. Milch cows are numerous
                    near Tamarída. The population is about 5000, of two distinct types. The nomad
                    inhabitants of the uplands are a peculiar race, well built, with good features
                    and long curling but not woolly hair; they resemble neither the Arabs nor the
                    Somál. In Tamarída and other villages and towards the eastern end of the island
                    the population is a mixture of Arab, African, and other elements, even including
                    Portuguese. The native speech is not intelligible to ordinary Arabs, but
                    Wellsted says that it can sometimes be made out by Arabs from the opposite
                    (Mahra) coast. In fact, according to Ibn Mojáwir and Hamdání, the Socotrans in
                    the Middle Ages were regarded as Mahra and spoke the Mahra dialect. Their way of
                    life is rude and simple in the extreme, but they are hospitable and generally
                    well-behaved, though they have almost no government; they are nominally
                    dependent on the sultan of Keshin. A certain dependence (at least of places on
                    the coast) on some sovereign of the Arabian coast has endured for many
                    centuries, except during the short Portuguese occupation of Tamarída by
                    Albuquerque. From 1876 to 1886 the sultan of Keshin was bound by treaty not to
                    cede the island to a foreign power or allow settlements on it without the
                    consent of England. In 1886 it was formally annexed by Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The fauna and flora of Socotra are peculiar. As regards mammalia the civet cat is
                    found, but the ordinary wild beasts of Arabia are unknown. The flora was studied
                    by Professor Bailey Balfour in 1880, and his account of it is about to be
                    published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The most valuable vegetable
                    products are now, as in the Middle Ages, aloes and dragon’s-blood. The Socotran
                    aloes (the French <hi rend="italic">chicotin)</hi> is esteemed the best in the
                    world when unadulterated. In old times the ambergris of Socotra was also
                    famous.</p>
                <p>Socotra was known to the ancients as the isle of Dioscorides; this name, and that
                    by which the island is now known, are usually traced back to a Sanscrit form,
                    Dvípa-Sakhádhára, “the island abode of bliss,” which again suggests an
                    identification with the <hi rend="italic">vησoι εὐδαίµovες</hi> of Agatharchides
                    (§ 103). The <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi> of the Erythraean Sea speaks of the
                    island as peopled only in one part by a mixed race of Arab, Indian, and Greek
                    traders. It was subject to the king of the Incense Country, and was a
                    meeting-place of Arabian and Indian ships. Cosmas in the 6th century says that
                    the people spoke Greek and were largely Christian, with a bishop sent from
                    Persia. The Arab geographers also had a tradition of an early Greek settlement
                    (which they naturally ascribe to Alexander), but also of later Persian
                    influence, followed by a settlement of Mahra tribes, who partly adopted
                    Christianity. The Socotrans remained Nestorian Christians, with a bishop under
                    the metropolitan of Persia, through the Middle Ages (Assemani, <hi rend="italic"
                    >B. O.,</hi> ii. 459; comp. Mohallebí, in Abulfeda, p. 371); but in their
                    isolated position they have gradually lost all trace of Christianity except
                    reverence for the cross, and practise the old South Arabian moon worship. There
                    was much more at least of the forms of Christianity when Europeans first visited
                    the island in the 16th century. In the Middle Ages Socotra was a station of the
                    Indian corsairs who harassed the Arab trade with the far East. The population
                    seems then to have been much larger; Arabian writers estimate the fighting men
                    at 10,000.</p>
