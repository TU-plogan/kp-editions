                    about four miles from Newcastle, on 17th October 1745. His father was a
                    “coalfitter” (or tradesman engaged in the transport of coal); his mother was the
                    daughter of a small tradesman, Atkinson by name; his younger brother John became
                    the famous Lord Chancellor <hi rend="smallcaps">Eldon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> Scott was educated at the Newcastle grammar school under the able
                    tuition of the Rev. Hugh Moises. In February 1761 he gained a Durham scholarship
                    at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and was immediately admitted as a student of
                    the university. In 1764 he graduated as bachelor of arts, and became first a
                    probationary fellow and then—as successor to William (afterwards the well-known
                    Sir William) Jones—a tutor of University College. In 1767 he took his M.A.
                    degree. In 1772 he graduated as bachelor of civil law. As Camden reader of
                    ancient history he rivalled the reputation of Blackstone (1774). Although he had
                    joined the Middle Temple in 1762 (June 24), it was not till 1776 that Scott
                    devoted himself to a systematic study of law. In 1779 (June 23) he graduated as
                    doctor of civil law, and, after the customary “year of silence,” commenced
                    practice in the ecclesiastical courts. His professional success was rapid. In
                    1783 he became registrar of the Court of Faculties, and in 1788 judge of the
                    Consistory Court and advocate-general, in that year too receiving the honour of
                    knighthood; and in 1798 he was made judge of the High Court of Admiralty. Sir
                    William Scott twice contested the representation of Oxford university,—in 1780
                    without success, but successfully in 1801. He also sat for Downton in 1790. Upon
                    the coronation of George IV. (1821) he was raised to the peerage as Baron
                    Stowell. After a life of distinguished judicial service Lord Stowell retired
                    from the bench,—from the Consistory Court in August 1821, and from the High
                    Court of Admiralty in December 1827. His mental faculties became gradually
                    feebler in his old age, and he died on January 28, 1836. Lord Stowell was twice
                    married,—on April 7, 1781, to Anna Maria, eldest daughter and heiress of John
                    Bagnall of Early Court, Berks, and on April 10, 1813, to the dowager marchioness
                    of Sligo. By his first marriage he had four children, of whom two (a son and a
                    daughter) died in infancy, a third (a son) died unmarried in middle life, while
                    the eldest (a daughter) was twice married and survived her father.</p>
                <p>Lord Stowell’s judgments are models alike of literary execution and of judicial
                    reasoning. His style is chaste yet not inornate, nervous without abruptness, and
                    perfectly adjusted in every instance to the subject with which he deals. His
                    decisions in the cases of Dalrymple <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Dalrymple (Dr
                    Dodson’s <hi rend="italic">Report)</hi> and Evans <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Evans (1 Hagg., 35)—from their combined force and grace, from the steadiness
                    with which every collateral issue is set aside, from their subtle insight into
                    human motives, and from the light which they cast on the philosophy and dark
                    history of marriage law—deserve and will repay attentive perusal. Lord Stowell
                    composed with great care, and some of the MSS. which he revised for Haggard and
                    Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">Reports</hi> were as full of interlineations as a
                    bill of the Lower House corrected by the Lords. Stowell’s mind was judicial
                    rather than forensic,—reasoning, not as for a dialectic victory nor so as to
                    convince the parties on whose suit he was deciding, but only with sufficient
                    clearness, fulness, and force to justify the decision at which he had
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>The chief doctrines of international law with the assertion and illustration of
                    which the name of Lord Stowell is identified are these :—the perfect equality
                    and entire independence of all states (Le Louis, <hi rend="italic">2</hi> Dod.,
                    243)—a logical deduction from the Austinian philosophy and still one of the
                    fundamental principles of English jurisprudence; that the elementary rules of
                    international law bind even semi-barbarous states (Hurtige Hans, 2 Rob., 325);
                    that blockade to be binding must be effectual (The “Betsey,” 1 Rob., 93); that
                    there cannot be a legal where there is no actual blockade; and that contraband
                    of war is to be determined by “probable destination” (The “Jonge Margaretha,” 1
                    Rob., 189). In the famous Swedish convoy case (The “Maria,” 1 Rob., 350; see too
                    The “Recovery,” 6 C. Rob., 348-9) Lord Stowell, in defiance of the complaints of
                    those greedy merchants who, as Pufendorf, himself by choice a Swedish civilian,
                    tells us, cared not how things went provided they could but satisfy their thirst
                    of gain, asserted that “a prize court is a court not merely of the country in
                    which it sits but of the law of nations.” “The seat of judicial authority,” he
                    added, in words which have become classic, “is indeed locally here, in the
                    belligerent country, but the law itself has no locality.”</p>
                <p>The judgments of Lord Stowell were, almost without exception, confirmed on
                    appeal, are to this day the international law of England, and have become
                    presumptive though not conclusive evidence of the international law of America.
                    “1 have taken care,” wrote Justice Story, “that they shall form the basis of the
                    maritime law of the United States, and I have no hesitation in saying that they
                    ought to do so in that of every civilized country in the world.”</p>
