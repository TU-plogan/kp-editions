                    market town, and large seaport of Durham, England, is situated at the mouth of
                    the river Wear and on the NorthEastern Railway, 12 miles south-east of
                    Newcastle-on-Tyne and 77 north-north-west of York. The municipal borough
                    includes, besides the township of Sunderland proper on the south bank of the
                    river, the adjoining township of Bishopwearmouth, which embraces about
                    three-fifths of the total inhabitants, and the township of Monkwearmouth, on the
                    north bank of the river. Sunderland proper consists chiefly of the High Street
                    and other streets near the docks. It is connected with Monkwearmouth by a
                    cast-iron bridge, designed by Rowland Burdon, and consisting of one arch with a
                    span of 236 feet and a height above low water of 100 feet. It was opened in 1796
                    and widened in 1858. The only ecclesiastical building of antiquarian interest
                    is</p>
                <p>St Peter’s church, Monkwearmouth, which still retains the tower with other
                    portions of the ancient Saxon building attached to the monastery founded by
                    Benedict Biscop in 674. The modern public buildings embrace the customhouse
                    (1837), the Sunderland and North Durham Liberal club in the Ionic style (1839),
                    the corporation offices, the workmen’s hall, the new general market, the
                    Victoria hall (1871), the assembly hall, and two theatres. The charitable and
                    benevolent institutions are numerous, including Gibson’s almshouses (1725) for
                    twelve poor persons, Bowe almshouses (1725), Trinity Church almshouses (1719,
                    rebuilt in 1876) for eight aged poor, the marine almshouses (1820), the eye
                    infirmary (1836), the sailors’ home (1856), the orphan asylum (1853), the
                    infirmary and dispensary (erected in 1868 and extended in 1882), and the blind
                    institute, for which a new building has recently been erected. For the literary
                    society and subscription library, originally founded in 1793, a new building was
                    erected in 1877. The people’s park at Bishopwearmouth, 17 acres in extent,
                    contains a bronze statue of Sir Henry Havelock, who was born at Ford Hall in the
                    neighbourhood. The park was lately increased by an addition of 10 acres, called
                    the Extension Park, in which there is a statue of Alderman Candlish, and a free
                    library, museum, art gallery, and winter garden. Roker, on the north side of
                    Sunderland, is a favourite bathing-place. The population of the municipal
                    borough (area, 3306 acres) in 1871 was 98,242, and in 1881 it was 116,542 (males
                    57,131, females 59,411). The population of the parliamentary borough (area, 5130
                    acres) in the same years was 104,409 and 124,841 respectively.</p>
                <p>Much of the prosperity of Sunderland is due to the coal and limestone in the
                    neighbourhood of the river Wear, of which it is the port. Its export of coal
                    began in the reign of Henry VII the trade being principally with London and the
                    western coasts of England, although large quantities were also shipped to
                    Holland France, and other parts of the Continent. The coal trade is still of
                    great importance, and the Monkwearmouth colliery is one of the deepest coal-pits
                    in the world,—381 fathoms. Sunderland vies with the Clyde for its iron
                    shipbuilding. The number of iron ships built in 1885 was 31 with a tonnage of
                    30,520 for home and 2 with a tonnage of 1255 for foreigners; of steel ships, 9
                    with a tonnage of 8099 for home and 3 with a tonnage of 3635 for foreigners.
                    Along both banks of the Wear numerous extensive works of various kinds are
                    situated, including anchor and chain cable works, glass and bottle works,
                    roperies, forges, iron-works, chemical works, paper-mills, breweries, and
                    lime-kilns. The modern prosperity of the town has been largely promoted by the
                    enterprise of George Hudson, the “railway king.” The conservation of the port is
                    vested in the Wear commissioners, to whose care the South Dock was transferred
                    by the Wear Navigation and Sunderland Dock Act of 1859. Under their auspices
                    great extensions and improvements have been made, and there are now three large
                    deepwater docks, embracing a total area of 43 acres, viz., Hudson dock north
                    (18), Hudson dock south (14), and Hendon dock (ll). Mouk-wearmnouth dock, 6
                    acres in extent and the property of the railway company, is chiefly used for the
                    export of coal. New piers over half a mile in length are now (1887) being
                    erected. The average annual value of thé imports of foreign and colonial
                    merchandise for the five years ending 1886 was a little over £700,000, and of
                    the exports of produce of the United Kingdom a little over £600,000. The
                    coasting trade, in regard to which specific details are wanting, is, however,
                    more important. The total number of British and foreign vessels, sailing and
                    steam, that entered the port of Sunderland with cargoes or in ballast from
                    foreign countries, British possessions, and coastwise in 1876 was 9708 of
                    2,329,576 tons and in 1885 9451 of 2,764,174 tons. The numbers that cleared in
                    the same years were respectively 9430 of 2,357,430 tons and 9419 of 2,824,218
                    tons.</p>
                <p>The early history of the borough is associated with Monkwearmouth, which existed
                    long before the town on the other side of the river, and had its origin in a
                    convent which was founded by St Bega in the 7th century and converted into a
                    monastery for Benedictines by Biscop in 674. Bede was born at Wearmouth in 673,
                    and in his seventh year was placed under the charge of Biscop. The monastery was
                    reconstituted as a cell of Durham in 1084. About the close of the 12th century
                    the inhabitants of Sunderland received from Bishop Pudsey a charter of free
                    customs and privileges similar to those of Newcastle-on-Tyne. In 1634 the town
                    was incorporated under the title of “mayor, aldermen, and commonalty,” with the
                    privilege of holding a market and annual fairs. In the preamble of the charter
                    it is stated to have been a borough from time immemorial under the name of New
                    Monkwearmouth, and to have been in the enjoyment of various liberties and free
                    customs conferred by the bishops of Durham. Under a special Act in 1851 the town
                    council was constituted the urban sanitary authority. Extensive drainage works
                    have been carried out, as well as important street improvements. Sunderland has
                    returned two members to the House of Commons since 1832. A large number of
                    Scotch families settled in the town in 1640 and gave a considerable impulse to
                    its trade. During the Civil War the inhabitants embraced the cause of the
                    Parliament, while the neighbouring Newcastle held out for the king for two
                    years. The Scottish army under Leslie, earl of Leven, entered Sunderland on 4th
                    March 1644, and the king’s forces followed them; but no engagement took place
                    beyond desultory firing.</p>
