                    records were not without political distinctions. The elder Statius, our poet’s
                    father, was the Orbilius of his time, and taught with distinguished success at
                    Naples and Rome. From boyhood to age he proved himself a champion in the poetic
                    tournaments which formed an important part of the amusements of the early
                    empire. The younger Statius declares that his father was in his time equal to
                    any literary task, whether in prose or verse. Probably our poet inherited a
                    modest competence and was not under the necessity of begging his bread from
                    wealthy patrons. So far as appears he never pursued any occupation but that of
                    poet, as poor an occupation in those days as in ours, if we may believe Juvenal
                    and Martial. Statius certainly wrote poems to order (as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Silvae,</hi> i. 1, 2, ii. 7, and iii. 4), but there is no indication that the
                    material return for them was important to him. In his seventh satire Juvenal
                    speaks of the immense public enthusiasm which attended the recitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thebais,</hi> when the benches “were breaking” with applause; but
                    the poet, he says, might have starved had not Paris, the favourite comedian of
                    the day, bought from him the libretto of a comic opera. This reference<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n490/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0490-0467"/> of Juvenal deserves, however, as little to be
                    accepted literally as his misleading allusions to Quintilian in the same satire.
                    Of events in the life of Statius we know little. He married early a young widow,
                    for whom he expresses tender affection in some of the few obviously sincere
                    verses he ever wrote. From his boyhood he was victorious in poetic
                    contests,—many times at his native city Naples, thrice at Alba, where he
                    received the golden crown from the hand of the emperor. But at the great
                    Capitoline competition (probably on its third celebration in 94 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> Statius failed to win the coveted chaplet of oak
                    leaves. No doubt the extraordinary popularity of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thebais</hi> had led him to regard himself as the supreme poet of the age, and
                    when he could not sustain this reputation in the face of rivals from all parts
                    of the empire he accepted the judges’ verdict as a sign that his day was past,
                    and retired to Naples, the home of his ancestors and of his own young days. We
                    still possess the poem he addressed to his wife on this occasion <hi
                    rend="italic">(Silv.,</hi> iii. 5). It was a hard task to overcome her
                    objections to turning her back upon the great capital. Chief among them was that
                    which arose from a fear lest it should prove difficult to find in Naples a
                    husband for her daughter (by her first marriage; she had no children by
                    Statius). There are hints in this poem which naturally lead to the surmise that
                    Statius was suffering from a loss of the emperor’s favour; he may have felt that
                    a word from Domitian would have won for him the envied garland, and that the
                    word ought to have been given. In the preface to book iv. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Silvae</hi> there is mention of detractors who hated our poet’s
                    style, and these may have succeeded in inducing a new fashion in poetry at
                    court. Such an eclipse, if it happened, must have cut Statius to the heart. He
                    appears to have relished thoroughly the rôle of court-poet. The statement
                    sometimes made that the elder Statius had been the emperor’s teacher, and had
                    bestowed many favours on him, so that the son inherited a debt of gratitude,
                    seems to have no solid foundation. Statius lauds the emperor, not to discharge a
                    debt, but rather to create an obligation. His flattery is as far removed from
                    the gentle propitiatory tone of Quintilian as it is from the coarse and crawling
                    humiliation of Martial. It is in the large extravagant style of a nature in
                    itself healthy and generous, which has accepted the theme and left scruples
                    behind. In one of his prefatory epistles Statius declares that he never allowed
                    any work of his to go forth without invoking the godhead of the divine emperor.
                    The poem on the equestrian statue of Domitian set up on the Capitol <hi
                    rend="italic">(Silv.,</hi> i. 1) is such colossal rodomontade that if the
                    emperor had had a grain of humour in his composition he must have died of
                    merriment on receiving it. Statius had taken the full measure of Domitian’s
                    gross taste, and carefully puts conscience and sincerity out of view, lest some
                    uneasy twinge should mar his master’s enjoyment. But in one poem, that in which
                    the poet pays his due for an invitation to the imperial table, we have sincerity
                    enough. Statius clearly feels all the raptures he expresses. He longs for the
                    power of him who told the tale of Dido’s banquet, and for the voice of him who
                    sang the feast of Alcinous, that he may give forth utterance worthy of the lofty
                    theme. The poet seemed, he says, to dine with great Jove himself and to receive
                    nectar from Ganymede the cup-bearer (an odious reference to the imperial
                    favourite Earinus). All his life hitherto has been barren and profitless. Now
                    only has he begun to live in truth. “O ruler over all the lands, and mighty
                    father of the world which thou hast conquered, do I, <hi rend="italic"
                    >recumbent,</hi> see thee, thou hope of all mankind, and nursling of all the
                    gods? Is it mine to gaze from near at hand on thy features, with the wine-cup
                    and the feast beside me, <hi rend="italic">while I am forbidden to rise</hi> ?"
                    The palace struck on the poet’s fancy like the very hall of heaven; nay, Jove
                    himself marvels at its beauty, but is glad that the emperor should possess such
                    an earthly habitation; he will thus feel less desire to seek his destined abode
                    among the immortals in the skies. Yet even so gorgeous a palace is all too mean
                    for his greatness and too small for his vast presence. “But it is himself,
                    himself, that my eager eye has alone time to scan. He is like a resting Mars or
                    Bacchus or Alcides.” Martial too swore that, were Jove and Domitian both to
                    invite him to dinner for the same day, he would prefer to dine with the greater
                    potentate on the earth. Pliny, however, has sketched for us the state dinners of
                    Domitian, where the coarse contempt of the tyrant overclouded the guests, and
                    where a man who still respected himself had torments to endure. Martial and
                    Statius were no doubt supreme among the imperial flatterers. Each was the
                    other’s only serious rival. It is therefore not surprising that neither should
                    breathe the other’s name. Even if we could by any stretch excuse the bearing of
                    Statius towards Domitian, he could never be forgiven the poem entitled “The Hair
                    of Flavius Earinus,” Domitian’s Ganymede (<hi rend="italic">Silv.,</hi> iii. 4),
                    a poem than which it would be hard to find a more repulsive example of real
                    poetical talent defiled for personal ends. Well for Statius that he did not,
                    like Martial, live on into the days of Nerva to write sorry palinodes!
                    Everything points to the conclusion that he did not survive his emperor—that he
                    died, in fact, a short time after leaving Rome to settle in Naples. Apart from
                    the emperor and his minions, the friendships of Statius with men of high station
                    seem to have been maintained on fairly equal terms. He was clearly the poet of
                    society in his day as well as the poet of the court.</p>
                <p>As poet, Statius unquestionably shines in many respects when compared with the
                    other post-Augustans. He was horn with exceptional talent, and his poetic
                    expression is, with all its faults, richer on the whole and less forced, more
                    buoyant and more felicitous, than is to be found elsewhere in the Silver Age of
                    Latin poetry. Statius is at his best in his occasional verses, the <hi
                    rend="italic">“Silvae,</hi>” which have a character of their own, and in their
                    best parts a charm of their own. The title was proper to verses of rapid
                    workmanship, on everyday themes. Statius prided himself on his powers of
                    improvisation, and he seems to have been quite equal to the Horatian feat of
                    dictating two hundred lines in an hour, while standing on one leg. The
                    improvisatore was in high honour among the later Greeks, as Cicero’s speech for
                    the poet Archias indicates; and the poetic contests common in the early empire
                    did much to stimulate ability of the kind. Statius speaks of his " <hi
                    rend="italic">Silvae”</hi> (preface to book i.) as having “streamed from him
                    under the influence of sudden inspiration, and with a certain pleasure due to
                    their rapidity.” No one poem occupied more than two days; some came to birth at
                    the dinner table; many while the poet’s friend Pollius sat by his side, and
                    shuddered at the audacity of his pen (preface to book iii.). It is to this
                    velocity that the poems owe their comparative freshness and freedom, along with
                    their loose texture and their inequality. There are thirty-two poems, divided
                    into five books, each with a dedicatory epistle. Of nearly four thousand lines
                    which the books contain, more than five-sixths are hexameters. Four of the
                    pieces (containing about 450 lines) are written in the hendecasyllabic metre,
                    the “tiny metre of Catullus,” and there is one Alcaic and one Sapphic ode. But
                    the poems in these metres are merely the experiments of a poet who knows well
                    that his strength lies in the hexameter, which in his hands shows greater
                    freedom, variety, and music than it exhibits when handled by other poets of the
                    Silver Latin Age. The subjects of the <hi rend="italic">“Silvae”</hi> are very
                    various. Five poems are devoted to flattery of the emperor and his favourites;
                    but of these enough has already been said. Six are lamentations for deaths, or
                    consolations to survivors. Statius seems to have felt a special pride in this
                    class of his productions; and certainly, notwithstanding the excessive and
                    conventional employment of pretty mythological pictures, with other
                    affectations, he sounds notes of pathos such as only come from the true poet.
                    There are oftentimes traits of an almost modern domesticity in these verses, and
                    Statius, the childless, has here and there touched on the charm of childhood in
                    lines for a parallel to which, among the ancients, we must go, strange to say,
                    to his rival Martial. One of the <hi rend="italic">epicedia,</hi> that on
                    Priscilla the wife of Abascantus, Domitian’s freedman (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Silv</hi>., y. 1), is full of interest for the picture it presents of the
                    official activity of a high<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0491-0468"/> officer of state. Another group of the " <hi
                    rend="italic">Silvae"</hi> give picturesque descriptions of the villas and
                    gardens of the poet’s friends. In these we have a more vivid representation than
                    elsewhere of the surroundings amid which the grandees of the early empire lived
                    when they took up their abode in the country. It was of these pieces that
                    Niebuhr thought when he said that the poems of Statius are charming to read in
                    Italy. They exhibit, better even than Pliny’s well-known letters, the passion of
                    the rich Roman for so constructing his country house that light, air, sun, and
                    leafage should subserve his luxury to the utmost, while scope was left for
                    displaying all the resources of art which his wealth enabled him to command. As
                    to the rest of the “<hi rend="italic">Silνaef</hi> the congratulatory addresses
                    to friends are graceful but commonplace, nor do the jocose pieces call for
                    special mention here. In the “Kalendae Decembres” we have a striking description
                    of the gifts and amusements provided by the emperor for the Roman population on
                    the occasion of the Saturnalia. In his attempt at an epithalamium <hi
                    rend="italic">CSilv.,</hi> i. 2) Statius is forced and unhappy. But the birthday
                    ode in Lucan’s honour <hi rend="italic">(Silv.,</hi> ii. 7) has, along with the
                    accustomed exaggeration, many powerful lines, and shows high appreciation of
                    preceding Latin poets. Some phrases, such as “the untaught muse of high-souled
                    Ennius” and “the lofty passion of sage Lucretius,” are familiar words with all
                    scholars. The ode ends with a great picture of Lucan’s spirit rising after death
                    on wings of fame to regions whither only powerful souls can ascend, scornfully
                    surveying earth and smiling at the tomb, or reclining in Elysium and singing a
                    noble strain to the Pompeys and the Catos and all the "Pharsalian host,” or with
                    proud tread exploring Tartarus and listening to the wailings of the guilty, and
                    gazing at Nero, pale with agony as his mother’s avenging torch glitters before
                    his eyes. It is singular to observe how thoroughly Nero had been struck out of
                    the imperial succession as recognized at court, so that the “bald Nero” took no
                    umbrage when his flatterer-in-chief profanely dealt with his predecessor’s
                    name.</p>
                <p>The epic poems of Statius are less interesting because cast in a commoner mould,
                    but they deserve study in many respects. They are the product of long
                    elaboration. The “<hi rend="italic">Thebais,"</hi> which the poet says took
                    twelve years to compose, is in twelve books, and has for its theme the old “tale
                    of Thebes”—the deadly strife of the Theban brothers. There is also preserved a
                    fragment of an <hi rend="italic">“Achilleis</hi>,” consisting of one book and
                    part of another. In the weary length of these epics there are many flowers of
                    pathos and many little finished gem-pictures, but the trammels of tradition, the
                    fashionable taste, and the narrow bars of education check continually the poet’s
                    flight. The public idea of what an epic poem should be was firmly fixed, and
                    Statius would not have towered above the thousand poets of his day in the
                    estimation of his countrymen had he not given full embodiment to the idea. Not
                    merely were the materials for his epics prescribed to him by rigid custom, but
                    also to a great extent the method by which they were to be treated. All he could
                    do was to sound the old notes with a distinctive <hi rend="italic">timbre</hi>
                    of his own. The gods must needs wage their wonted epic strife, and the men,
                    their puppets, must dance at their nod; there must needs be heavenly messengers,
                    portents, dreams, miracles, single combats, similes, Homeric and Virgilian
                    echoes, and all the other paraphernalia of the conventional epic. But Statius
                    treats his subjects with a boldness and freedom which contrast pleasingly with
                    the timid traditionalism of Silius Italicus and the stiff scholasticism of
                    Valerius Flaccus. The vocabulary of Statius is conspicuously rich, and he shows
                    audacity, often successful, in the use of words and metaphors. At the same time
                    he carried certain literary tricks to an aggravating pitch, in particular the
                    excessive use of alliteration, and the misuse of mythological allusion. The most
                    well-known persons and places are described by epithets or periphrases derived
                    from some very remote connexion with mythology, so that many passages are as
                    dark as Heraclitus. The <hi rend="italic">Thebais</hi> is badly constructed. The
                    action of the epic is hindered and stopped by enormous episodes, one of which
                    fills one sixth of the poem. Nor had Statius a firm grasp or clear imagination
                    of character. So trying are the late ancient epics to a modem reader that he who
                    has read any one of the three—Statius, Silius, and Valerius (Lucan stands
                    apart)—will with difficulty be persuaded to enter on the other two. Yet, if he
                    honestly reads them all, he can hardly fail to rank Statius the highest of the
                    three by a whole sphere.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the epics is (lated 1470, of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Silvae</hi> 1472. Notable editions since have been those of
                    Bernartius (Antwerp, 1595), Gronovius (1653), and Barth (1664). The best text is
                    the Teubner (the <hi rend="italic">Achilleis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thebais</hi> by Kohlmann, the <hi rend="italic">Silυae</hi> by Baehrens). Among
                    editions of portions of Statius’s works, that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Silvae</hi> by Jeremiah Markland, fellow of Peterhouse in Cambridge (1728),
                    deserves special attention. The brilliance and erudition of the work mark him
                    out as one of the best Latin scholars who ever lived. A critical edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Thebais</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Achilleis</hi> was begun by
                    O. Müller (1870) but not completed. The condition of the text of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Silvae</hi> is one of the most curious facts in the history of
                    ancient literature. Poggio discovered a MS. at St Gall and brought it into
                    Italy. This MS. has disappeared, but from it are derived all our existing MSS.,
                    except one of the birthday ode to Lucan, now at Florence, and of the 10th
                    century. Politian collated Poggio’s MS. with the <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps,</hi> and the collation has come down to us, and is the principal basis
                    of the text. The MSS. of the epics are numerous, as was to be expected from
                    their great popularity in the Middle Ages, to which Dante is witness (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Pιιrg.,</hi> xxi., where an interview with the shade of Statius is
                    described at some length). (J. S. R.)</p>
