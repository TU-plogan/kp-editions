                    1748. He was destined for the church, was educated by the Jesuits, became a
                    licentiate of the canon law, and, having early distinguished himself by the
                    astuteness and originality of his ideas, was appointed vicar-general by the
                    bishop of Chartres. He shared the political fervour of the party of advance, and
                    was fearlessly logical in working out the new and as yet indistinct princi-<pb

                    provided for the inculcation of his views by the invitation which Necker
                    addressed to all French writers to publish their opinions upon the mode of
                    convening the states-general. Sieyès startled his countrymen by the issue of
                    various pamphlets upon the political situation, and particularly by his daring
                    and original treatise upon the Third Estate, with its three famous divisions in
                    question and answer:—“1st, What is the Third Estate?—Everything. What has it
                    hitherto been in the political order?—Nothing. What does it demand?—To become
                    something.” He attacked unsparingly the privileged classes, and indeed in this
                    his most famous work he constructed, single-handed and at once, a programme for
                    the Revolution. The influence of the book and of its author soon became
                    enormous, and in 1789 the Abbé Sieyès was elected by the city of Paris as a
                    representative to the states-general, where he was the first to propose that the
                    three estates should meet together in one assembly. On the rejection of his
                    motion he boldly suggested the formation of an “assembly of representatives of
                    France already verified.” He was not, however, successful as a speaker, his
                    style being obscure and his matter too compressed for oral expression,—faults
                    which disappeared when he committed his thoughts to writing. Yet he was one of
                    the leaders of the assembly, and was appointed a member of the committee on the
                    constitution. His published speech in opposition to the power of absolute veto
                    by the king brought him still further into notice. But he recognized his
                    inaptitude for public speaking, and, although even Mirabeau declared that the
                    silence of Sieyès was a public calamity, he stood aside while his own ideas were
                    being developed amidst violence and riot both within and without the constituent
                    and afterwards the legislative assembly. As excess followed upon excess in the
                    wild course of the Revolution Sieyès had neither the courage nor the power to
                    quell the riot. In danger of becoming a suspect, and fearful of his life, he
                    emerged from obscurity in November 1793, on the occasion of the installation of
                    Reason in Notre Dame. Before the national convention he denied his faith,
                    abjuring the title of priest, professing that his only worship was that of
                    liberty and equality and his only religion the love of humanity and country, and
                    concluding by formally renouncing to the state the commuted pension which he
                    enjoyed in lieu of his former benefice. The overthrow of the Jacobins at last
                    overcame his fears and in March 1795 he is found publicly lauding the memory of
                    those guillotined Girondists in whose defence he, two years before, had never
                    once lifted his voice.</p>
                <p>In the same year (1795) the ex-abbé was commissioned by the Convention to The
                    Hague, where he successfully concluded an offensive and defensive alliance
                    between the United Provinces and France. Without Sieyès no framing of a
                    constitution could be attempted, and he was accordingly appointed member of a
                    commission to draw up organic laws, the constitution of 1793 having been found
                    unworkable. When the commission brought forward its report Sieyès did not
                    dissent; but he proposed to the Convention a separate scheme of his own, the
                    specialty of which was the provision for the appointment of a constitutional
                    jury which should be charged with the duty of revising all legislative decrees
                    against which the challenge was brought that they were themselves at variance
                    with the constitution. His scheme was, however, rejected in favour of the new
                    constitution, and from that moment he became its secret enemy. He was elected
                    one of the first directory of five, but he declined the honour. In 1798 he was
                    appointed the plenipotentiary of France to Prussia, where he was received with
                    great honour and where he speedily began to plot against the Government he
                    represented.</p>
                <p>He communicated his views to Napoleon, then in Egypt. Meanwhile (1799) he was
                    again elected to the directory, and, his plans being ripe, he accepted office.
                    Then came the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> of 18th Brumaire (9th November
                    1799), in which Sieyès took so important a part, but in which he was
                    unquestionably overborne by the genius and audacity of Bonaparte. The
                    provisional consulate composed of Napoleon, Sieyès, and Ducos lasted but a few
                    weeks. After a little Sieyès is a count of the empire and the proprietor of
                    Crosne (Seine-et-Oise), while Napoleon is able to boast of how he has bribed the
                    ex-abbé out of his constitutional views. Amid the political changes of France,
                    Sieyès on the second return of the Bourbons fled to Brussels; but after the
                    revolution of 1830 he felt it safe to return to Paris, where he died on 20th
                    June 1836.</p>
