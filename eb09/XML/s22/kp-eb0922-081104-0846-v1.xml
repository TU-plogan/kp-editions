                    Aurelius</hi></label>, consul in 391, and one of the most brilliant
                    representatives in public life and in literature of the old pagan party at Rome,
                    was educated in Gaul, and, having discharged the functions of praetor and
                    quaestor, rose to higher offices, and in 373 was proconsul of Africa. His public
                    dignities, which included that of pontiff, his great wealth and high character,
                    added to his reputation for eloquence, marked him out as the champion of the
                    pagan senate against the measures which the Christian emperors directed against
                    the old state religion of Rome. In 382 he was banished from Rome by Gratian for
                    his protest against the removal of the statue and altar of Victory from the
                    senate-house, and in 384, when he was prefect of the city, he addressed to
                    Valentinian a letter praying for the restoration of these symbols. This is the
                    most interesting of his literary remains, and called forth two replies from St
                    Ambrose, as well as a poetical refutation from Prudentius. After this Symmachus
                    was involved in the rebellion of Maximus, but obtained his pardon from
                    Theodosius, and appears to have continued in public life up to his death.</p>
                <p>Of the writings of Symmachus we possess (1) ten books of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Epistles,</hi> published after his death by his son. The model followed by
                    the writer is Pliny the Younger, and from a reference in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Saturnalia</hi> of Macrobius (bk. v., i. § 7), in which Symmachus is
                    introduced as one of the interlocutors, it appears that his contemporaries
                    deemed him second to none of the ancients in the “rich and florid” style. The
                    first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> by Bart. Cynischus (s. <hi
                        rend="italic">l. et a.,</hi> but published under Pope Julius II.) is very
                    incomplete, and the collection was only gradually completed by subsequent
                    editors. (2) Fragments of nine <hi rend="italic">Complimentary Orations</hi>
                    from a palimpsest, of which part is at Milan and part in the Vatican, were
                    discovered by Mai, who published the Milan fragments in 1815, the Roman ones in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Seripiorum Veterum Nova Collectio,</hi> vol. i. (1825),
                    and the whole in 1846. The work was not well done, and many corrections are
                    given in a new collation by O. Seeck (<hi rend="italic">Commentationes in
                        Honorem Τh. Μommseni,</hi> Berlin, 1877, p. 595 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi>
                    which has been followed by an edition of the works of Symmachus in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Monumenta Germanise Historica,</hi> Berlin, 1883.</p>
