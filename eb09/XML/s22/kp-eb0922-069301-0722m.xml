                    south by Sussex, and west by Hampshire. Owing to the fact that it includes a
                    portion of London, it ranks fourth among the counties of England in point of
                    population, but in point of size it is only the thirtieth, the total area being
                    485,129 acres, or 758 square miles.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of Surrey is reflected in its varied and picturesque
                    scenery, the charms of which are enhanced by the large proportion of ground
                    still remaining uncultivated. The extent of common land is also very great, a
                    circumstance which, from its proximity to London, must be considered as
                    specially fortunate. The northern portion of the county, in the London basin,
                    belongs to the Eocene formation: the lower ground is occupied chiefly by the
                    London clay of the Lower Eocene group, stretching (with interruptions) from
                    London to Farnham; this is fringed on its southern edge by the plastic clays or
                    Woolwich beds of the same group, which also appear in isolated patches at
                    Headley near Leatherhead; and the Thanet sands of the same group crop out under
                    the London clay between Beddington, Banstead, and Leatherhead. The north-western
                    portion of the county, covered chiefly by heath and Scotch fir, belongs to the
                    Middle Eocene group, or Bagshot sands: the Fox Hills and the bleak Chobham
                    Ridges are formed of the upper series of the group, which rests upon the middle
                    beds occupying the greater part of Bagshot Heath and Bisley and Pirbright
                    Commons, while eastwards the commons of Chobham, Woking, and Esher belong to the
                    lower division of the group. To the south of the Eocene formations the smooth
                    rounded outlines of the chalk hills extend through the centre of the county from
                    Farnham to Westerham (Kent). From Farnham to Guildford they form a narrow ridge
                    called the Hog’s Back, about half a mile in breadth with a high northern dip,
                    the greatest elevation reached in this section being 505 feet. East of Guildford
                    the northern dip decreases, and the outcrop widens, throwing out picturesque
                    summits, frequently partly wooded, and commanding widely variegated views, the
                    highest elevation being Botley Hill near Titsey, 866 feet. The Upper Greensand
                    or grey chalk marl, locally known as firestone, crops out underneath the Chalk
                    along the southern escarpment of the Downs, and the Gault, a dark blue marl,
                    rests beneath the Upper Greensand in the bottom of the long narrow valley which
                    separates the chalk Downs from the well-marked Lower Greensand hills. Leith Hill
                    of this formation reaches a height of 967 feet, and from its isolated position
                    commands one of the finest views in the south of England, the next highest
                    summits being Hindhead Hill (894 feet) and Holmbury Hill (857</p>
                <p>feet). The southern part of the county belongs to the Wealden formation of
                    freshwater origin: the lower strata or Hastings beds occupy a small portion at
                    the southeastern corner, but the greater part consists of a blue or brown shaly
                    clay, amid which are deposited river shells, plants of tropical origin, and
                    reptilian remains.</p>
                <p>The whole of the county north of the Downs is in the basin of the Thames. Besides
                    a number of smaller streams, its chief affluents from Surrey are the Wey at
                    Weybridge, the Mole at East Moulsey, and the Wandle at Wandsworth. The Eden, a
                    tributary of the Medway, takes its rise in the south-east corner of Surrey.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1886, of the total area of the county
                    299,034 acres were under cultivation, 77,553 being under corn crops, 44,998
                    under green crops, 26,741 rotation grasses, 138,117 permanent pasture, 2547
                    hops, and 9078 fallow. There are considerable varieties of soil, ranging from
                    plastic clay to calcareous earth and bare rocky heath. The plastic clay is well
                    adapted for wheat, the most largely grown of the corn crops, occupying 29,694
                    acres in 1886, while barley, oats, and pease’ which grow well on the loamy soils
                    in different parts of the county, occupied respectively 15,439, 24,705, and 4587
                    acres, beans occupying 1872 and rye 1256. Of green crops there were 6432 acres
                    under potatoes, 15,975 under turnips and swedes, 9995 mangolds, 860 carrots,
                    2660 cabbage, kohl-rabi, and rape, and 9076 vetches and other green crops. A
                    considerable proportion of the area under green crops is occupied by the market
                    gardens on the alluvial soil along the banks of the Thames, especially in the
                    vicinity of London. The total area of nursery grounds in 1886 was 1466, and of
                    market gardens 2953 acres. In early times the market gardeners were Flemings,
                    who introduced the culture of asparagus at Battersea and of carrots at Chertsey,
                    for which this district is still famous. The area under orchards in 1886 was
                    2144 acres. Rhododendrons and azaleas are largely grown in the north-western
                    district of the county. In the neighbourhood of Mitcham various medicinal plants
                    are extensively cultivated for the London herb-sellers and druggists, such as
                    lavender, mint, camomile, anise, rosemary, liquorice, hyssop, &amp;c. The
                    calcareous soil in the neighbourhood of Farnham is well adapted for hops, but
                    this crop in Surrey is of minor importance. There is a considerable area under
                    wood (42,974 acres in 1881). Oak, chestnut, walnut, ash, and elm are extensively
                    planted; alder and willow plantations are common; and the Scotch fir propagates
                    naturally from seed on the commons in the north-west of the county. The extent
                    of pasture land is not great, with the exception of the Downs, which are chiefly
                    occupied as sheep-runs. Dairy-farming is a more important industry than
                    cattle-feeding, large quantities of milk being sent to London. The number of
                    horses in 1886 was 9930, of which 3273 were unbroken horses and mares kept
                    solely for breeding; of cattle 49,986, of which 24,869 were cows and heifers in
                    milk or in calf and 8699 other cattle two years old and above; of sheep 87,658;
                    and of pigs 25,172.</p>
                <p>According to the latest (1873) landowners <hi rend="italic">Return</hi> for
                    England, Surrey was divided among 17,293 proprietors possessing 398,746 acres at
                    an annual value of £2,285,814, in addition to which there were 40,037 acres of
                    common lands. Of the proprietors 12,712, or nearly two-thirds, possessed less
                    than one acre each, the total which they owned being 2861 acres. The average
                    annual rental per acre of the land all over was about £5,14s. 9d. The following
                    proprietors held over 5000 acres each:—earl of Lovelace, 9958; crown, 7496; earl
                    of Onslow, 6563; Sir W. R. Clayton, 6505; G. W. G. Leveson-Gower, 6368.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The more important manufactures are chiefly
                    confined to London and its immediate neighbourhood (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >London,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 832). There are paper-mills at Wandsworth, and along
                    the valley of the Wandle there are snuff, drug, and copper mills. Calico
                    bleaching and printing are carried on to a small extent in the same valley, and
                    there are also a few silk mills and tanneries. Ropes, snuff, and drugs are
                    likewise manufactured along the banks of the Mole. Woollen goods and hosiery are
                    made at Godaiming, and gunpowder is largely manufactured at Chilworth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> In addition to the navigation by. barges,
                    steamers ply on the Thames as far as Hampton. The Basingstoke Canal from
                    Basingstoke to the Wey at Weybridge crosses the northwest corner of the county,
                    and the Surrey and Sussex Canal passes southwards from the Wey near Guildford to
                    the Arun. Surrey is more completely supplied by railways than any other county
                    in England, the London, Chatham, and Dover, the South-Eastern, the London,
                    Brighton, and South Coast, and the London and South-Western Railways
                    intersecting it by their main lines as well as by various branches. .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Surrey contains 14
                    hundreds; the borough of Southwark (pop. 221,946), which has.no municipal

                    (2505), Guildford (10,858), Kingston-upon-Thames (20,648), and Reigate (18,662).
                    A considerable portion (22,472 acres, with a population in 1881 of 980,522) is
                    within the metropolitan district of London, in addition to which there are the
                    following urban sanitary districts—Aidershot (20,l55), Croydon (78,953), Dorking
                    (6328), East Moulsey (3289), Epsom (6916), Farnham (4488), Ham Common (1349),
                    Hampton Wick (2164), New Malden (2δ38), Richmond (19,066), Surbiton (9406),
                    Teddington (6δ99), and Wimbledon (l5,950). The county has one court of quarter
                    sessions, and is divided into twelve petty and special sessional divisions. The
                    central criminal court has jurisdiction over certain parishes in this county.
                    The borough of Guildford has a separate court of quarter sessions and commission
                    of the peace; the boroughs of Reigate and Kingston-upon-Thames have commissions
                    of the peace; the borough of Southwark is included in the petty sessional
                    division of Newington; and the borough of Godaiming, in which the mayor and
                    ex-mayor are magistrates, forms part of the petty sessional division of
                    Guildford, the county justices having concurrent jurisdiction. The county
                    contains 152 civil parishes, with parts of two others. It is shared among the
                    dioceses of Canterbury, Rochester, and Winchester. Until 1885 the county for
                    parliamentary purposes was divided into East, Mid, and West Surrey; it is now
                    rearranged in six divisions, viz., Kingston, Mid (Epsom), North-East
                    (Wimbledon), NorthWest (Chertsey), South-East (Reigate), and South-West
                    (Guildford). The portion of Surrey formerly included in the borough of Greenwich
                    was in 1885 included in the borough of Deptford (Kent); the borough of Guildford
                    was disfranchised; one member was given to Croydon; and instead of the two
                    metropolitan boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark the following fifteen
                    constituencies (each returning one member) were created: — Battersea and
                    Clapham, constituting two divisions; Camberwell, embracing the divisions of
                    North Camberwell, Dulwich, and Peckham; Lambeth, embracing the divisions of
                    Brixton, Kennington, Lambeth North, and Norwood; Southwark, containing the
                    divisions of Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, and Southwark West; Wandsworth; and
                    Newington, with the divisions of Walworth and West Newington.</p>
                <p>Since the beginning of the 19th century the population has increased nearly 600
                    per cent. From 268,233 in 1801 it had increased by 1821 to 399,417, by 1851 to
                    683,082, by 1871 to 1,091,635, and by 1881 to 1,436,899, of whom 683,228 were
                    males and 753,671 females. The number of persons to an acre is 2·96 and of acres
                    to a person 0·34. Within the last decade the increase has been 35·1 per
                    cent.,—much greater than the increase in the general town population of England
                    and Wales, which was 19·63 per cent., the increase in the whole population being
                    only 14·34. Nearly two-thirds (980,522) of the population belong to the
                    metropolitan district of London, but the suburbs of London extend practically
                    throughout the greater part of the county, its increase in population being
                    chiefly due to the building of residences for those who have business or
                    professional interests in London.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Notwithstanding its proximity to
                    London, Surrey has been associated with few great events in English history.
                    Roman remains have been discovered at Albury, Kingston, Titsey, Woodcote, and a
                    few other places, but none are of much importance. On several of the hills there
                    are remains of camps of either Roman or British origin. The Roman Stane Street
                    from London to Chichester in Sussex passed by Kingston, Chessington,
                    Leatherhead, Dorking (where its remains are specially well marked), Leith Hill,
                    and Ockley. During the Saxon period Surrey was included in the dominions of the
                    South Saxons and afterwards of Wessex. Its name Surrey or “south kingdom” has
                    apparently reference to its position south of London or south of the Thames.
                    Kingston in Surrey was in 838 the seat of a witana-gemot convened by Egbert; and
                    after the capture of Winchester by the Danes it was from 901 to 978 the place
                    where the Anglo-Saxon kings were crowned. Surrey was an earldom of Godwine; and
                    after the conquest was bestowed on William de Warren, who had married Gundrada,
                    supposed to have been a daughter of the Conqueror. From the time that the great
                    charter was on 15th June 1215 signed by King John at Runnymede near Egham the
                    historical annals of the county are a blank, until the period of the Civil War,
                    when a skirmish took place, 7th June 1648, at Kingston.</p>
                <p>The only ecclesiastical ruins worthy of special mention are the picturesque walls
                    of Newark Priory, founded for Augustinians in the time of Richard Coeur de Lion;
                    and the Early English crypt and part of the refectory of Waverley Abbey, the
                    earliest house of the Cistercians in England, founded in 1128 by William
                    Gifford, bishop of Winchester. The <hi rend="italic">Annales Waverlicnscs,</hi>
                    published by Gale in his <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi> and afterwards in the
                    Record series of <hi rend="italic">Chronicles,</hi> are supposed to have
                    suggested to Sir Walter Scott the name of his first novel. The church
                    architecture is of a very varied kind, and has no peculiarly special features.
                    Among the more interesting churches are Albury, the tower of which is of Saxon
                    or very early Norman date; Beddington, a fine example of the Perpendicular, and
                    containing monuments of the Carew family; Chaldon, remarkable for its fresco
                    wall-paintings of the 12th century, discovered during restoration in 1870;
                    Compton, which, though mentioned in Domesday, possesses little of its original
                    architecture, but is worthy of notice for its two-storied chancel, and its
                    carved wooden balustrade surmounting the pointed Transition Norman arch which
                    separates the nave from the chancel; St. Mary’s, Guildford, containing examples
                    of Norman, Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular, but is of interest
                    chiefly for the grotesque carving on the corbels of the aisles and the coloured
                    medallions on the roof of the north chapel; Leigh, Perpendicular, possessing
                    some very fine brasses of the 15th century; Lingfield, Perpendicular, containing
                    ancient tombs and brasses of the Cobhams; Ockham, chiefly Decorated, with a
                    lofty embattled tower, containing the mausoleum of Lord Chancellor King (d.
                    1734), with full-length statue of the chancellor by Rysbroeck; Reigate, chiefly
                    Perpendicular, but with Transition Norman pillars in the nave; Stoke d’Abernon,
                    Early English, with the earliest extant English brass, that of Sir John
                    d’Abernon, 1277; and Woking, Decorated, with Early English chancel. Of old
                    castles the only examples are Farnham, occupied as a palace by the bishops of
                    Winchester, originally built by Henry of Blois, and restored by Henry III.; and
                    Guildford, with a strong quadrangular Norman keep. Ancient domestic architecture
                    is, however, well represented, the examples including Beddington Hall, now a
                    female orphan asylum; the ancient mansion of the Carews, rebuilt in the reign of
                    Queen Anne, hut still retaining the hall of the Elizabethan building; Crowhurst
                    Place, built in the time of Henry VII., the ancient seat of the Gaynesfords, and
                    frequently visited by Henry VIII.; portions of Croydon Palace, an ancient seat
