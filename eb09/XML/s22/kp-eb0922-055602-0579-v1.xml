                <p><label type="entry">STOBAeUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joannes</hi></label>, a native
                    of Stobi in Macedonia,— whence the surname Stobaeus or Stobensis,—is known to us
                    as the compiler of a very valuable series of extracts from Greek authors. Of his
                    life nothing is known, but he probably belongs to the latter half of the 5th
                    century. From his silence in regard to Christian authors, it is inferred with
                    some probability that he was not a Christian; that he was a man of wide culture
                    and general reading is clear from the anthology which bears his name.</p>
                <p>The extracts were intended by Stobaeus for his son Septimius, and were preceded
                    by a letter briefly explaining the purpose of the work and giving a summary of
                    the contents. From this summary (which is preserved in Photius’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Bibliotheca)</hi> we learn that Stobaeus divided his work into
                    four books; the first contained sixty chapters, the second forty-six, the third
                    forty-two, and the fourth fifty-eight. In most of our MSS. the work is divided
                    into three books, of which the first and second are generally called 'Ε <hi
                        rend="italic">κλoγαὶ ϕυσικαὶ καὶ ἠθικaὶ,</hi> and the third ’A <hi
                        rend="italic">vθoλόγιον (Florilegium</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sermones).</hi> As each of the four books is sometimes called Α <hi
                        rend="italic">vθoλόγιον</hi>, it is probable that this name originally
                    belonged to the entire work; the full title, as we know from Photius, was ’Ε <hi
                        rend="italic">κλογων ἀποφθεγμάτων υποθηκων βιβλία τέτταρα.</hi> Between the
                    account which Photius gives of Stobaeus’s work and the form in which we have it
                    there are several marked discrepancies. The second book in particular is little
                    more than a fragment. From this and other indications Wachsmuth has made it
                    probable that our Stobaeus is only an epitome of the original work, made about
                    the end of the 11th century at Byzantium, “ab homine Platonis Aristotelisque
                    amantissimo.”</p>
                <p>The didactic aim of Stobaeus’s work is apparent throughout. The first book
                    teaches physics—in the wide sense which the Greeks assigned to this term—by
                    means of extracts. It is often untrustworthy: Stobaeus betrays a tendency to
                    confound the dogmas of the early Ionic philosophers, and he occasionally mixes
                    up Platonism with Pythagoreanism. For part of this book and much of book ii. he
                    depended on the works of Aetius, a Peripatetic philosopher, and Didymus. The
                    third and fourth books, like the larger part of the second, treat of ethics; the
                    third, of virtues and vices, in pairs; the fourth, of more general ethical and
                    political subjects, frequently citing extracts to illustrate the pros and cons
                    of a question in two successive chapters. In all, Stobaeus quotes more than five
                    hundred writers, generally beginning with the poets, and then proceeding to the
                    historians, orators, philosophers, and physicians. It is to him that we owe many
                    of our most important fragments of the dramatists, particularly of
                    Euripides.</p>
                <p>The first complete edition of Stobaeus was published at Geneva in 1609; the last
                    is Meineke’s (Leipsic, 1855-1864). The best critical edition of books i. and ii.
                    is by Wachsmuth (Berlin, 1884); a companion edition of books iii. and iv. (the
                        <hi rend="italic">Florilegium)</hi> is promised by Otto Hense.</p>
