                <p><label type="entry">SNAKE-BIRD</label>, to use the name commonly given to it by
                    the English in North America, because of its “long slender head and neck,”
                    which, its body being submerged as it swims, “appear like a snake rising erect
                    out of the water” (Bartram’s MS., quoted by Ord in Wilson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Am. Ornithology,</hi> ix. p. 81), the “Darter” of many authors, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plotus anhinga</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Anhinga,” according to Marcgrave, who first described this
                    bird (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Rer. Nat. Brasiliae,</hi> p. 218), was the name it
                    bore among the natives.</p></note> of ornithology, is the type of a small but
                    very well-marked Family of Birds, <hi rend="italic">Plotidae,</hi> belonging to
                    the group <hi rend="italic">Steganopodes</hi> (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dysporomorpae</hi> of Prof. Huxley), and consisting of but a single genus and
                    three or four species. They bear a general resemblance both outwardly and in
                    habits to Cormorants (see vol. vi. p. 407), but are much more slender in form
                    and have both neck and tail much elongated. The bill also, instead of being
                    tipped with a maxillary hook, has its edges beset with serratures directed
                    backwards, and is sharply pointed,—in this respect, as well as in the attenuated
                    neck, likening the Snake-birds to the Herons (see vol. xi. p. 760); but the
                    latter do not generally transfix their prey as do the former.</p>
                <p>The male of the American species, which ranges from Illinois to the south of
                    Brazil, is in full breeding-plumage a very beautiful bird, with crimson irides,
                    the bare skin round the eyes apple-green and that of the chin orange, the head,
                    neck, and most part of the body clothed in black glossed with green; but down
                    each side of the neck runs a row of long hair-like white feathers, tinged with
                    pale lilac. The much elongated scapulars and the small upper wing-coverts bear
                    each a median white mark, which on the former is a stripe pointed at either end,
                    and on the latter a broad ovate patch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These feathers are very characteristic of each species of
                    the genus, and in India, says Jerdon, are among the Khasias a badge of
                    royalty.</p></note> The larger wing-coverts are dull white, but the
                    quillfeathers of the wings and tail are black, the last broadly tipped with
                    brownish-red, passing into greyish-white, and forming a conspicuous band when
                    the tail is spread in form of a fan, as it often is under water.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This peculiarity, first
                    pointed out to the writer by Mr. Bartlett, who observed it in birds in the
                    Zoological Society’s possession, doubtless suggested the name of “Water-Turkey
                    ’’ by which in some places <hi rend="italic">Plotus anhinga</hi> is said to be
                    known.</p></note> The hen differs much in appearance from the cock, having the
                    head, neck, and breast of a more or less deep buff, bounded beneath by a narrow
                    chestnut band; but otherwise her plumage is like that of her mate, only not so
                    bright in colour. The habits of this species have been repeatedly described by
                    American writers, and those of its congeners, to be immediately mentioned, seem
                    to be essentially the same. The Snake-bird frequents the larger rivers or
                    back-waters connected with them, where it may be seen resting motionless on some
                    neighbouring tree, generally choosing a dead branch, or on a “snag” projecting
                    from the bottom, whence it plunges beneath the surface, in pursuit of its fishy
                    prey, to emerge, in the manner before related, showing little more than its
                    slender head and neck. Its speed and skill under water are almost beyond
                    exaggeration, and it exhibits these qualities even in captivity,
                    taking—apparently without effort—fish after fish that may be introduced into its
                    tank, however rapidly they may swim and twist, and only returning to its perch
                    when its voracious appetite is for the moment appeased or its supply of food
                    temporarily exhausted. Then, after adjusting its plumage with a few rapid passes
                    of its bill, and often expanding its wings, as though, Cormorant-fashion, to dry
                    them, it abandons itself to the pleasurable and passive process of digestion,
                    reawaking to activity at the call of hunger. Yet at liberty it will indulge in
                    long flights, and those of the male at the breeding-season are ostentatiously
                    performed in the presence of his mate, around whom he plays in irregular zigzag
                    courses. The nest is variously placed, but almost always in trees or bushes
                    overhanging the water’s edge, and is a large structure of sticks, roots, and
                    moss, in which are laid four eggs with the white chalky shell that is so
                    characteristic of most Steganopodous birds. Not unfrequently several or even
                    many nests are built close together, and the locality that suits the Snake-bird
                    suits also many of the Herons, so that these, its distant relatives, are often
                    also its near neighbours.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The curious but apparently well-attested fact of the occurrence in England,
                    near Poole, in June 1851, of a male bird of this species (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoologist,</hi> pp. 3601∙, 3654) has been overlooked by several writers who
                    profess to mention all cases of a similar character.</p></note> The African
                    Snake-bird, <hi rend="italic">P. congensis</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >levaillanti</hi> of some authors), inhabits the greater part of that continent
                    from Natal northwards; but, though met with on the White Nile, it is not known
                    to have occurred in Egypt, a fact the more remarkable seeing that Canon Tristram
                    found it breeding in considerable numbers on the Lake of Antioch, to which it is
                    a summer visitor, and it can hardly reach its home without passing over the
                    intervening country. The male bird is easily distinguishable from the American
                    species by its rufous coronal patch, its buff throat and its chestnut greater
                    wing-coverts. A third species, <hi rend="italic">P. melanogaster,</hi> ranges
                    from Madagascar to India, Ceylon, Borneo, Java, and China. This so closely
                    resembles the last-mentioned that the differences between them cannot be briefly
                    expressed. The Australian region also has its Snake-bird, which is by some
                    regarded as forming a fourth species, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    novae-hollandiae</hi>; but others unite it to that last-mentioned, which is
                    perhaps somewhat variable, and it would seem (<hi rend="italic">P. Z. S.,</hi>
                    1877, p. 349) that examples from New Guinea differ somewhat from those
                    inhabiting Australia itself.</p>
                <p>The anatomy of the genus <hi rend="italic">Plοtus</hi> has been dealt with more
                    fully than that of most forms. Beside the excellent description of the American
                    bird’s alimentary canal furnished to Audubon by Macgillivray, other important
                    points in its structure have been well set forth by Garrod and Forbes in the
                    Zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> (1876, pp. 335- 345, pls.
                    xxvi.-xxviii.; 1878, pp. 679-681; and 1882, pp. 208-212), showing among other
                    things that there is an appreciable anatomical difference between the species of
                    the New World and of the Old; while the osteology of <hi rend="italic">P.
                    melanogaster</hi> has been admirably described and illustrated by Prof.
                    Milne-Edwards in M. Grandidier’s great <hi rend="italic">Oiseaux de
                    Madagascar</hi> (pp. 691-695, pls. 284, 285). In all the species the neck
                    affords a feature which seems to be unique. The first seven of the cervical
                    vertebrae form a continuous curve with its concavity forward, but the eighth
                    articulates with the seventh nearly at a right angle, and, when the bird is at
                    rest, lies horizontally. The ninth is directed downwards almost as abruptly, and
                    those which succeed present a gentle forward convexity. The muscles moving this
                    curious framework are as curiously specialized, and the result of the whole
                    piece of mechanism is to enable the bird to spear with facility its fishy prey.
