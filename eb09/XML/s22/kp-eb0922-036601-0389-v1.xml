                    of Dalmatia, at the head of one of the thirteen departments (area 730 square
                    miles; population in 1880 31,003), is situated on the seaward side of a
                    peninsula lying between the Gulf of Braza and the Gulf of Salona. Though not the
                    capital, it is the most important city in the principality, is the see of a
                    bishop, has a valuable museum of antiquities, and carries on an extensive trade
                    in wine and oil. Since' 1879 it has been the terminus of a railway running
                    northwards to Sebenico and Siveric. Built on the low ground at tho head of a
                    beautiful bay, and thrown into relief by a background of picturesque hills
                    rising close behind, Spalato has a striking sea-front, in which the leading
                    feature is still the ruined façade of the great palace of Diocletian, erected in
                    303 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to which the city owes its origin. In ground
                    plan this is almost a square, with a quadrangular tower at each of the four
                    corners. “Its faces correspond nearly with the four points of the compass. The
                    south front (towards the harbour) measures 521 feet, or, with the towers, 598
                    feet 8 inches, and the eastern and western sides are each 705 feet 8 inches”
                    (Wilkinson). The area included is 348,175 square feet, or, comprising the
                    towers, 352,614 square feet, a little more than eight acres, or rather less than
                    the area of the Escorial. There were four principal gates, with four streets
                    meeting in the middle of the quadrangle, after the style of a Roman camp. The
                    eastern gate (Porta Aenea) is destroyed; but, though the side towers are gone,
                    the main entrance of the building, the beautiful Porta Aurea, in the west front,
                    is still in fairly good preservation. The streets were lined with massive
                    arcades. The vestibule now forms the Piazza del Duomo or public square; to the
                    north-east of this lies the mausoleum (not, as the older antiquaries had it, the
                    temple of Jupiter), which has long been the smallest and darkest of cathedrals;
                    and to the south-east is the temple of Aesculapius, which served originally as a
                    kind of court chapel and has long been transformed into a baptistery.
                    Architecturally the most important of all the many striking features of the
                    palace is the arrangement in the vestibule by which the supporting arches spring
                    directly from the capitals of the large granite Corinthian columns. This, as far
                    as the known remains of ancient art are concerned, is the first instance of such
                    a method; and thus, in Mr Freeman’s words, “all Gothic and Romanesque
                    architecture was in embryo in the brain of Jovius or his architect.”</p>
                <p>The name Spalato, or Spalatro (a very old spelling), which used to be explained
                    as a corruption of Salonae Palatium, is pretty certainly of different origin—the
                    oldest form extant being Aspalathum (Constantine Porphyrogenitus) and early
                    variants Spalathon, Spa-lathron, Spalatrum (<hi rend="italic">Geogr. Rav.).</hi>
                    Dr Evans suggests a connexion with Aspalathus (the name of a prickly shrub) or
                    perhaps with Asphaltus. Not long after Diocletian’s death the buildings seem to
                    have been turned into an imperial cloth factory, and as most of the workers were
                    women we find it called a <hi rend="italic">gynaecium (Notitia).</hi> About 4
                    miles from the palace lay the ancient city of Salona (Σ <hi rend="italic"
                        >αλωvα</hi> or Σ <hi rend="italic">αλωvαι</hi>), which consisted of two
                    parts, the earlier Roman city to the west and a later portion incorporated
                    previous to the time of the Antonines. There are still remains at Salona of
                    ancient city walls, an amphitheatre, &amp;c., and a long line of walls extending
                    “from the western side of the city for a mile and more nearly along tho present
                    road to Trau (Tragurium).” The purpose of this line of walls is not evident, and
                    the date of its construction has been the subject of much discussion. Mr Freeman
                    is disposed to consider them Roman workmanship.</p>
                <p>Salona in its best days was one of the chief ports of the Adriatic, on one of the
                    most central sites in the Roman world. Made a Roman colony after its second
                    capture by tho Romans <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 78), it appears as Colonia
                    Martia Julia and Colonia Claudia Augusta Pia Veteranorum, and bears at different
                    periods the titles of respublica, conventus, metropolis, praefectura, and
                    praetorium. In Christian times it became a bishop’s see; and St Doimo or
                    Domnius, its first bishop, still gives his name to the cathedral of Spalato. The
                        city<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"

                    the 6th century. Recovered by Justinian in 535, it was in 544 aud 552 the
                    starting-point of Belisarius and Narses for their Italian expeditions. In tho
                    7th century Salona was completely destroyed by the Avars; but the empty palace
                    of Diocletian afforded an asylum for its inhabitants. The limits of the building
                    proved sufficient for the new city up to the time that it passed under Hungarian
                    and Venetian protection. Hungarian additions may still be seen above the Porta
                    Aurea; and the large octagonal tower bears the name of Torre d’Harvoye from the
                    Bosnian general who was created duke of Spalato by Ladislaus. The Venetians
                    enclosed the town with regular curtains and bastions in 1645-1670. About
                    1807-1809 the castle was dismantled and parts of the walls were thrown down.</p>
