                <p><label type="entry">SOUTHAMPTON</label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough,
                    which gives name to Hampshire, or the county of Southampton, and one of the
                    principal seaports on the south coast of England, is beautifully situated at the
                    head of Southampton Water, forming the mouth of the Test, on a sloping
                    peninsula, bounded on the east by the Itchen, at the terminus of the
                    South-Western Railway, 79 miles south-west of London, 13 south-south-west of
                    Winchester, and 24 west-north-west of Portsmouth. Southampton is also a county
                    of itself,—the county of the town of Southampton. It preserves much of its
                    antique appearance, but, although in the older parts the streets if picturesque
                    are narrow and irregular, it may still claim the distinction it enjoyed in
                    Leland’s time of ranking “as one of the fairest that is in England,” handsome
                    and spacious shops lining the principal streets, while the suburbs are studded
                    with numerous villas and mansions embosomed in woods. There are still
                    considerable remains of the old town walls built in the time of Richard II., the
                    most remarkable being a portion of the west walls, with an arcade on its
                    exterior face. Four of the seven gates are comparatively well preserved—North or
                    Bar Gate, South Castle Gate, Westgate, and Blue Anchor Gate. The finest of these
                    is Bargate, in a room above which is the ancient Guildhall, where the quarter
                    sessions are held. The representations of Sir Bevis of Hampton and the giant
                    Ascupart which formerly stood on each side have recently been obliterated. The
                    castle, originally a Saxon fortress, and rebuilt when the walls were erected,
                    was partly demolished in 1650. After its rebuilding had been begun by the
                    marquis of Lansdowne in 1805, it was sold, and in 1818 the site was parcelled
                    out for building plots. In the vicinity of the castle there are some houses of
                    very ancient date, including King’s House (Early Norman). The two old churches,
                    St Michael’s (originally Norman about the date of 1080) and Holyrood, have been
                    in a great degree modernized; the former contains a beautiful Byzantine font and
                    a monument to Sir R. Lyster, chiefjustice in the 16th century. The French chapel
                    of St Julien, originally attached to the hospital of God’s House, founded by
                    Henry VIII. for eight poor persons, is of Norman architecture; it contains the
                    burial-place of the earl of Cambridge, Lord Scrope, and Sir Thomas Grey, who in
                    1415 were executed outside the Bargate for conspiring against Henry V. Among the
                    modern public buildings are the Watts memorial hall, erected in 1876 at a cost
                    of £8000, the municipal office, occupying the old audit-house, the custom-house,
                    the philharmonic hall, the assembly rooms, the county court-house, the corn
                    exchange and chamber of commerce, and two theatres. The educational institutions
                    include the Hartley Institution, founded by bequest for the advancement of
                    natural history, astronomy, antiquities, and classical and Oriental literature,
                    and now embracing a library, reading-room, museum, art gallery, laboratories,
                    and schools of science and art associated with South Kensington; the Edward VI.

                    Alderman Taunton’s school, founded in 1752, and lately remodelled. The school
                    board was established in 1871. The benevolent and charitable institutions are
                    numerous, embracing the dispensary (1809), the royal South Hants infirmary
                    (1838), the female orphan asylum, the homoeopathic dispensary (1873), St Mary’s
                    cottage hospital (1873), and the Palk memorial home (1876). To the north of the
                    town is Southampton Common, formerly part of the manor of Shirley; and adjoining
                    the town to the north of Above Bar Street is the Public Park, prettily laid out
                    and containing statues of Lord Palmerston, Dr Watts, and Mayor Andrews. The town
                    is supplied with water partly from artesian wells and partly from reservoirs.
                    The population of the municipal borough (area 2004 acres) in 1871 was 53,741,
                    and in 1881 it was 60,051. In 1885 the area of the parliamentary borough,
                    formerly coextensive with that of the municipal borough, was extended to include
                    the parish of Millbrook, the ecclesiastical district of the Holy Saviour,
                    Bitterne, the parish of St Mary Extra, and the detached portion of Hound
                    included within St Mary Extra. The population of this area in 1881 was 84,384.
                    It is represented by two members.</p>
                <p>The importance of the port dates from the Norman Conquest, and was originally due
                    to its relation to Winchester. It had a considerable trade in wine as early as
                    1152, and from Queen Mary it obtained a monopoly in the importation of sweet
                    wines from the Grecian islands. With Venice and Italy it had a large trade as
                    early as the 14th century, and in the subsequent century it had a connexion with
                    Newfoundland, while its Channel trade and its shipbuilding were also of
                    importance. About the end of the 16th century its trade had, however, begun to
                    decline, and the visitation of the plague in 1665 tended still further to aid
                    its retrogression. Some improvement took place in its prospects by the creation
                    of a Pier and Harbour Commission in 1803, and the erection of the Royal Victoria
                    pier in 1831 was a further step towards prosperity, but its modern trade really
                    dates from the opening up of railway communication with London in 1840. It
                    possesses one of the finest natural harbours and has the advantage of a double
                    tide, a second high tide occurring two hours after the first. While largely
                    dependent for its import trade on its connexion with London and its easy
                    communication with France, it has become an outlet for the manufactures of the
                    midland and northern towns. Its great tidal dock, completed in 1842 at a cost of
                    £140,000, has an area of 16 acres with a depth of 18 feet at low water, and the
                    inner dock, completed in 1851, an area of 10 acres and a depth of 28 feet. Two
                    other docks embracing an area of 50 acres are being constructed. There are also
                    four dry docks, capable of receiving vessels of the largest tonnage at all
                    tides. Within recent years the port has lost the overland trade between London
                    and India by the removal to London of the headquarters of the Peninsular and
                    Oriental Steam Navigation Company. At present it is the headquarters of the
                    Royal Mail Steam Packet Company for the West Indies and the Pacific <hi
                    rend="italic">(via</hi> Panama) and for Brazil and the River Plate, the Union
                    Line for the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, and East Africa, and the London and South
                    Western Railway Company’s steamers to the French coast. Steamers also sail
                    regularly for Ireland and various ports on the west coast of England; and the
                    steamers of the North German Lloyd Company touch at the port on the way to and
                    from New York, and also to and from Asiatic and Australian ports. The total
                    number of vessels that entered the port in 1876 was 7840 of 1,201,301 tons, of
                    which 3780 with a tonnage of 201,434 were sailing vessels, and 4060 with a
                    tonnage of 999,867 were steamers. The number that cleared in the same year was
                    8047 of 1,174,365 tons, of which 3994 (196,064 tons) were sailing vessels, and
                    4053 (978,301 tons) were steamers. In 18S5 the number of vessels that entered
                    the port was 9768 of 1,539,357 tons, of which 3456 (175,900 tons) were sailing
                    vessels, and 6312 (1,363,457 tons) were steamers. . Tho number that cleared in
                    the same year was 9641 of 1,523,759 tons, of which 3350 (182,688 tons) were
                    sailing vessels, and 6291 (1,341,071 tons) were steamers. Since 1845 the trade
                    has increased more than tenfold, although within recent years the port has
                    suffered from the prevailing dulness. The total value of imports and exports in
                    1845 was £1,475,000; in 1880 the value of the imports was £9,205,183 and in 1884
                    it was £7,544,354; for these last years the value of the exports of United
                    Kingdom produce was £9,306,326 and £6,909,072; while the value of the exports of
                    foreign and colonial produce and manufactures in 1882 was £1,589,652 and in 1884
                    £1,150,954. Among the principal imports are cocoa, coffee, corn (including
                    maize), apples, provisions (especially butter, eggs, and potatoes from France
                    and the Channel</p>
                <p>Isles), rum and brandy, sugar, wine, wool, and rags. Among the principal exports
                    of the produce of the United Kingdom are apparel, cotton goods, leather, linen
                    goods, machinery, copper and iron goods, woollen and worsted goods. The number
                    of ships built at the port in 1885 was 19, of 17,875 tons burden.</p>
                <p>The Roman station of Clausentum was situated at Bitterne on the opposite side of
                    the Itchen, where extensive Roman remains have been found. The present town was
                    founded by the West Saxons, probably soon after their landing under Cerdic and
                    Cynric on the shores of Southampton Water in 495. The name Hantun-scire
                    (Hamptonshire) occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Saxon Chronicle</hi> under date
                    755, and Hamtun is first mentioned separately in 837. The prefix “South” was
                    probably added after the annexation of Wessex to Mercia in 920, to distinguish
                    it from the Hampton in Mercia afterwards called. Northampton. The town was
                    frequently ravaged by the Danes in the 9th and 10th centuries. Canute, after his
                    establishment on the throne, made it his occasional residence, and Southampton
                    beach is reputed to have been the scene of his rebuke to the flattery of his
                    courtiers, by the demonstration of his powerlessness to control the waves.
                    Southampton is mentioned in Domesday as Hantune. It possessed a mint as early as
                    925. It was frequently visited by successive monarchs from the time of Henry I.
                    In 1338 it repulsed an attack of the French and Genoese. In 1415 it was the
                    rendezvous of the army of Henry V. for France, and during his stay in the town
                    he detected the conspiracy against him of the earl of Cambridge, Lord Scrope,
                    and Sir Thomas Grey, who were executed outside the Bargate. In 1512 the marquis
                    of Dorset embarked from the port with 10,000 men to the aid of Ferdinand of
                    Spain against France, and in 1522 the earl of Surrey set out from it with a
                    large fleet to escort Charles V. Queen Elizabeth held a court at Southampton in
                    1569. On account of the outbreak of the plague in London in 1625 the council was
                    transferred by the king to Southampton, where on the 7th September a treaty was
                    signed with the United Provinces. The town received its first charter from Henry
                    II., and a charter of incorporation from Henry VI. in 1445 under the style of
                    “mayor, bailiff, and burgesses.” This charter was somewhat modified by that
                    granted by Charles I. which remained the governing charter till the passing of
                    the Municipal Act. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority. The town
                    first returned members to parliament in 1295. Among eminent persons connected
                    with Southampton are Dibdin the song writer, Bishop Peacocke, Thomas Fuller, and
                    Dr Watts.</p>
