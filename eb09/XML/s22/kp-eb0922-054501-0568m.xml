                    youth he assisted his stepfather, Thomas Smith, in his lighthouse schemes, and
                    at the early age of nineteen was sent to superintend the erection of a
                    lighthouse on the island of Little Cumbrae. During successive winters he
                    attended classes at Anderson’s College, Glasgow, and at Edinburgh university. He
                    succeeded his stepfather, whose daughter he married in 1799, as engineer to the
                    Board of Northern Lighthouses, and at the same time began general practice as a
                    civil engineer. During his period of office from 1797 to 1843, he designed aud
                    executed no fewer than eighteen lighthouses, the most important being that on
                    the Bell Rock, begun in 1807 and completed in 1810, in which he improved
                    considerably on the designs of Smeaton for the Eddystone lighthouse (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lighthouse,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 616). For its illumination he
                    introduced an improved apparatus; he was also the author of various other
                    valuable inventions in connexion with lighting, including the intermittent and
                    flashing lights, and the mast lantern for ships. In his general practice as a
                    civil engineer he was employed in the construction of many county roads, in
                    various important improvements in connexion with the approaches to Edinburgh,
                    including that by the Calton Hill, in the erection of slips at ferries, in the
                    construction of harbours, docks, and breakwaters, in the improvement of river
                    and canal navigation, and in the construction of several important bridges. It
                    was he that brought into notice the superiority of malleable iron rods for
                    railways over the old cast iron, and he was the inventor of the movable jib and
                    balance cranes. It was chiefly through his interposition that an Admiralty
                    survey was established, from which the Admiralty sailing directions for the
                    coasts of Great Britain and Ireland have been prepared. Stevenson was elected a
                    fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1815, and afterwards became a member
                    of the Geological and Astronomical Societies of London and the Wernerian and
                    Antiquarian Societies of Scotland. He published an account of the Bell Rock
                    lighthouse in 1824, and, besides contributing important articles on engineering
                    subjects to Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Encyclopaedia</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> was the author of various
                    papers read before the societies he was connected with. He died at Edinburgh
                    12th July 1850.</p>
