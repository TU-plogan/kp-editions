                    specimens have been obtained from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. That this
                    genus belongs to the order <hi rend="italic">Plectognathi</hi> and is allied
                    more especially to the globe-fishes (<hi rend="italic">Diodon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetrodon)</hi> has been indicated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology</hi> (vol. ix. pp. 663, 694), where also the
                    principal anatomical peculiarities have been noticed, and where illustrations of
                    the young have been given (see figs. 64, 65).</p>
                <p>Sun-fishes have the appearance of tailless fish. This is due to the extreme
                    shortening of the tail, which is supported by only a few short vertebrae and
                    reduced to a broad fringe of the trunk. Directly in front of it rise dorsal and
                    anal fins, high and broad, similar to each other in size and triangular in form.
                    The head is completely merged in the trunk, the boundary between them being
                    indicated only by a very small and narrow gill-opening and a comparatively small
                    pectoral fin. This fin can be of but little use in locomotion, and the
                    horizontal and vertical movements of the fish, as well as the maintenance of its
                    body in a vertical position, are evidently executed by<pb break="no"

                    mouth, situated in front of the head, is armed with an undivided dental plate
                    above and below, similar to but weaker than the teeth of the globe-fish <hi

                <p>Sun-fishes are truly pelagic, propagating their species in the open sea, and only
                    occasionally approach the coast. During the stormy season they live probably at
                    some depth, but in calm bright weather they rise and rest or play on the surface
                    with their dorsal fin high above the water. This habit has given rise to the
                    popular name “sun-fish,” a term also sometimes applied to the basking-shark
                    (vol. xxi. p. 777), which in like manner enjoys the warmth of a sunny day. In
                    some years the rough sun-fish is by no means scarce on the south coast of
                    England and on the Irish coasts, where it appears principally in the summer
                    months. The usual size is from 3 to 4 feet in length, but this species attains
                    to 7 feet and more. One of the largest specimens (see the accompanying figure)
                    was caught near Portland (Dorsetshire) in 1846, and is now in the British
                    Museum; its length is 7 feet 6 inches. The sun-fish has no economic value, and
                    is rarely, if ever, eaten.</p>
                <p>Whilst the rough sun-fish has a granulated, rough, shagreen-like skin, the second
                    species <hi rend="italic">(O. truncatus)</hi> has the surface of the body smooth
                    and polished, with its small dermal scutes arranged in a tesselated fashion. It
                    is oblong in shape, the body being much longer than it is deep. The sides are
                    finely ornamented with transverse silvery, black-edged stripes running downwards
                    to the lower part of the abdomen. It has not been found to exceed 2 feet in
                    length, but is very scarce, only a few specimens having been captured on the
                    coasts of Europe, at the Cape of Good Hope, and off Mauritius.</p>
