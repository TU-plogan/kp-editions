                <p><label type="entry">SOCAGE</label> is a form of tenure. Bracton, Britton, and
                    other old writers derived the word from the French <hi rend="italic">soc,</hi>
                    “a ploughshare.” Modern etymologists, however, prefer to derive it from the Old
                    English <hi rend="italic">soc,</hi> “a franchise” or “privilege,” or the land
                    over which such franchise or privilege was exercised. Socage differs from knight
                    service in being agricultural rather than military in its nature, and from
                    frankalmoign in being based on temporal rather than spiritual services. It is
                    either free or villein. Free socage <hi rend="italic">in capite</hi> was
                    abolished by 12 Car. II. c. 24. That form of free socage called common socage is
                    the ordinary modern freehold tenure. Varieties of it are burgage, gavelkind, and
                    petit serjeanty. Scutage, while it existed, was another variety. The only
                    representative of villein socage is the comparatively rare tenure of ancient
                    demesne confined to manors, described in Domesday Book as <hi rend="italic"
                    >terrae regis.</hi> Socage tenure is said to have formerly existed in Scotland.
                    The descent of socage lands in Scotland seems to have been to all the sons
                    equally, as was originally the case in England. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    article is essentially to give a history and exposition of socialism in its
                    leading phases and principles. The point of view is objective,—to explain what
                    socialism has been and is. A controversial or critical article on the many vexed
                    questions suggested by the subject would have been inconsistent with the plan of
                    this work.</p><p>or they are misleading, and they quite fail to bring out the
                    clear and strongly marked characteristics that distinguish the phenomena to
                    which the name of socialism is properly applied. To say that socialism exacts a
                    greater regard for the common weal than is compatible with human nature is to
                    pass sentence on the movement, not to define it. In all ages of the world, and
                    under all forms and tendencies of government and of social evolution, the will
                    of the individual has been subordinated to the will of society, often unduly so.
                    It is also most misleading to speak as if socialism must proceed from the state
                    as we know it. The early socialism proceeded from private effort and experiment.
                    A great deal of the most notorious socialism of the present day aims not only at
                    subverting the existing state in every form but all the existing political and
                    social institutions. The most powerful and most philosophic, that of Karl Marx,
                    aimed at superseding the existing governments by a vast international
                    combination of the workers of all nations, without distinction of creed, colour,
                    or nationality.</p><p>Still more objectionable, however, is the tendency not
                    unfrequently shown to identify socialism with a violent and lawless
                    revolutionary spirit. As sometimes used, “socialism” means nothing more nor less
                    than the most modern form of the revolutionary spirit with a suggestion of
                    anarchy and dynamite. This is to confound the essence of the movement with an
                    accidental feature more or less common to all great innovations. Every new thing
                    of any moment, whether good or evil, has its revolutionary stage in which it
                    disturbs and upsets the accepted beliefs and institutions. The Protestant
                    Reformation was for more than a century and a half the occasion of national and
                    international trouble and bloodshed. The suppression of American slavery could
                    not be effected without a tremendous civil war. There was a time when the
                    opinions comprehended under the name of “liberalism” had to fight to the death
                    for toleration; and representative government was at one time a revolutionary
                    innovation. The fact that a movement is revolutionary generally implies only
                    that it is new, that it is disposed to exert itself by strong methods, and is
                    calculated to make great changes. It is an unhappy feature of most great changes
                    that they have been attended with the exercise of force, but that is because the
                    powers in possession have generally attempted to suppress them by the exercise
                    of force.</p><p>In point of fact socialism is one of the most elastic and
                    protean phenomena of history, varying according to the time and circumstances in
                    which it appears and with the character and opinions and institutions of the
                    people who adopt it. Such a movement cannot be condemned or approved <hi
                    rend="italic">en bloc.</hi> Most of the current formulae to which it has been
                    referred for praise or censure are totally erroneous and misleading. Yet in the
                    midst of the various theories that go by the name of “socialism” there is a
                    kernel of principle that is common to them all. That principle is of an economic
                    nature, and is most clear and precise. The central aim of socialism is to
                    terminate the divorce of the workers from the natural sources of subsistence and
                    of culture. The socialist theory is based on the historical assertion that the
                    course of social evolution for centuries has gradually been to exclude the
                    producing classes from the possession of land and capital and to establish a new
                    subjection, the subjection of workers, who have nothing to depend on but
                    precarious wage-labour. The socialists maintain that the present system (in
                    which land and capital are the property of private individuals freely struggling
                    for increase of wealth) leads inevitably to social and</p></note><hi
                    rend="subscript"> .</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> word “socialism” is of
                    comparatively recent origin, having been coined in England in 1835. In that year
                    a society which received the grandiloquent name of the “Association of all
                    Classes of all Nations” was founded under the auspices of Robert Owen; and the
                    words “socialist” and “socialism” were first used during the discussions which
                    arose in connexion with it. As Owen and his school had no esteem for the
                    political reform of the time, and laid all emphasis on the necessity of social
                    improvement and reconstruction, it is obvious how the name came to be recognized
                    as suitable and distinctive. The term was borrowed from England by a
                    distinguished French writer, Reybaud, in his well-known work the <hi
                    rend="italic">Reformateurs modernes</hi> (1839), in which he discussed the
                    theories of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen. Through Reybaud it soon gained wide
                    currency on the Continent, and is now the accepted world-historic name for one
                    of the most remarkable movements of the 19th century.</p>
                <p>The name was thus first applied in England to Owen’s theory of social
                    reconstruction, and in France to those also of Saint-Simon and Fourier. The best
                    usage has always connected it with the views of these men and the cognate
                    opinions which have since appeared. The word, however, is used with a great
                    variety of meaning not only in popular speech and by politicians but even by
                    economists and learned critics of socialism. The general tendency is to regard
                    as socialistic any interference with property undertaken by society on behalf of
                    the poor, the limitation of the principle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >laissez-faire</hi> in favour of the suffering classes, radical social reform
                    which disturbs the present system of private property as regulated by free
                    competition. It is probable enough that the word will be permanently used to
                    express the tendency indicated in these phrases, as a general name for the
                    strong reaction that has now set in against the overstrained individualism and
                    one-sided freedom which date from the latter half of the 18th century. The
                    application is neither precise nor accurate; but it is use and wont that
                    determine the meaning of words, and this seems to be the tendency of use and
                    wont.</p>
                <p>Even economic writers differ greatly in the meaning they attach to the word. The
                    great German economist Roscher defines it as including “those tendencies which
                    demand a greater regard for the common weal than consists with human nature.”
                    Adolf Held says that “we may define as socialistic every tendency which demands
                    the subordination of the individual will to the community.” Janet more precisely
                    defines it as follows :—“We call socialism every doctrine which teaches that the
                    state has a right to correct the inequality of wealth which exists among men and
                    to legally establish the balance by taking from those who have too much in order
                    to give to those who have not enough, and that in a permanent manner, and not in
                    such and such a particular case,—a famine, for instance, a public calamity,
                    &amp;c.” Laveleye explains it thus: “In the first place every socialistic
                    doctrine aims at introducing greater equality in social conditions, and in the
                    second place at realizing those reforms by the law or the state.” Von Scheel
                    simply defines it as the “economic philosophy of the suffering classes.” Of all
                    these definitions it can only be said that they more or less faithfully reflect
                    current opinion as to the nature of socialism. They are either too vague<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0221-0206"/> economic anarchy, to the degradation of the
                    working man and his family, to the growth of vice and idleness among the wealthy
                    classes and their dependants, to bad and inartistic workmanship, and to
                    adulteration in all its forms; and that it is tending more and more to separate
                    society into two classes,—wealthy millionaires confronted with an enormous mass
                    of proletarians,—the issue out of which must either be socialism or social ruin.
                    To avoid all these evils and to secure a more equitable distribution of the
                    means and appliances of happiness, the socialists propose that land and capital,
                    which are the requisites of labour and the sources of all wealth and culture,
                    should become the property of society, and be managed by it for the general
                    good. In thus maintaining that society should assume the management of industry
                    and secure an equitable distribution of its fruits socialists are agreed, but in
                    the most important points of detail they differ very greatly.</p>
                <p>They differ as to the form society will take in carrying out the socialist
                    programme, as to the relation of local bodies to the central government, and
                    whether there is to be any central government, or any government at all in the
                    ordinary sense of the word, as to the influence of the national idea in the
                    society of the future, &amp;c. They differ also as to what should be regarded as
                    an “equitable” system of distribution. The school of Saint-Simon advocated a
                    social hierarchy in which every man should be placed according to his capacity
                    and rewarded according to his works. In the communities of Fourier the minimum
                    of subsistence was to be guaranteed to each out of the common gain, the
                    remainder to be divided between labour, capital, and talent,—five-twelfths going
                    to the first, four-twelfths to the second, and three-twelfths to the third. At
                    the revolution of 1848 Louis Blanc proposed that remuneration should be equal
                    for all members of his <hi rend="italic">social workshops.</hi> In the programme
                    drawn up by the united social democrats of Germany (Gotha, 1875) it is provided
                    that all shall enjoy the results of labour “according to their reasonable
                    wants,” all of course being bound to work. It is needless to say also that the
                    theories of socialism have been held in connexion with the most varying opinions
                    in philosophy and religion. A great deal of the historic socialism has been
                    regarded as a necessary implicate of idealism. Most of the prevailing socialism
                    of the day is based on the frankest and most outspoken revolutionary
                    materialism. On the other hand, many socialists hold that their system is a
                    necessary outcome of Christianity, that socialism and Christianity are essential
                    the one to the other; and it should be said that the ethics of socialism are
                    closely akin to the ethics of Christianity, if not identical with them.</p>
                <p>Still it should be insisted that the basis of socialism is economic, involving a
                    fundamental change in the relation of labour to land and capital,—a change which
                    will largely affect production, but will entirely revolutionize the existing
                    system of distribution. But, while its basis is economic, socialism implies and
                    carries with it a change in the political, ethical, technical, and artistic
                    arrangements and institutions of society which would constitute a revolution
                    greater probably than has ever taken place in human history, greater than the
                    transition from the ancient to the mediaeval world, or from the latter to the
                    existing order of society. In the first place, such a change generally assumes
                    as its political complement the most thoroughly democratic organization of
                    society. The early socialism of Owen and Saint-Simon was marked by not a little
                    of the autocratic spirit; but the tendency of the present socialism is more and
                    more to ally itself with the most advanced democracy. Socialism, in fact, claims
                    to be the economic complement of democracy, maintaining that without a
                    fundamental economic change political privilege has neither meaning nor value.
                    In the second place, socialism naturally goes with an unselfish or altruistic
                    system of ethics. The most characteristic feature of the old societies was the
                    exploitation of the weak by the strong under the systems of slavery, serfdom,
                    and wage-labour. Under the socialistic régime it is the privilege and duty of
                    the strong and talented to use their superior force and richer endowments in the
                    service of their fellow-men without distinction of class or nation or creed. In
                    the third place, socialists maintain that under their system and no other can
                    the highest excellence and beauty be realized in industrial production and in
                    art, whereas under the present system beauty and thoroughness are alike
                    sacrificed to cheapness, which is a necessity of successful competition. Lastly,
                    the socialists refuse to admit that individual happiness or freedom or character
                    would be sacrificed under the social arrangements they propose. They believe
                    that under the present system a free and harmonious development of individual
                    capacity and happiness is possible only for the privileged minority, and that
                    socialism alone can open up a fair opportunity for all. They believe, in short,
                    that there is no opposition whatever between socialism and individuality rightly
                    understood, that these two are complements the one of the other, that in
                    socialism alone may every individual have hope of free development and a full
                    realization of himself.</p>
                <p>Having seen, then, how wide a social revolution is implied in the socialistic
                    scheme of reconstruction, let us repeat (1) that the essence of the theory
                    consists in this —associated production with a collective capital with the view
                    to an equitable distribution. In the words of Schaffte, “the Alpha and Omega of
                    socialism is the transformation of private competing capitals into a united
                    collective capital” <hi rend="italic">{Quintessenz des Socialismus).</hi> A.
                    Wagner’s more elaborate definition of it (in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundlegung')</hi> is entirely in agreement with that of Schäffle. This is the
                    principle on which all the schools of socialism, however opposed otherwise, are
                    at one. Such a system, while insisting on collective capital (including land),
                    is quite consistent with private property in other forms, and with perfect
                    freedom in the use of one’s own share in the equitable distribution of the
                    produce of the associated labour. A thoroughgoing socialism demands that this
                    principle should be applied to the capital and production of the whole world;
                    only then can it attain to supreme and perfect realization. But a sober-minded
                    socialism will admit that the various intermediate stages in which the principle
                    finds a partial application are so far a true and real development of the
                    socialistic idea. (2) Socialism is both a theory of social evolution and a
                    working force in the history of the 19th century. Some of the most eminent
                    socialists, such as Rodbertus, regard their theory as a prophecy concerning the
                    social development of the future rather than as a subject of agitation. In their
                    view socialism is the next stage in the evolution of society, destined after
                    many generations to supersede capitalism, as capitalism displaced feudalism and
                    feudalism succeeded to slavery. Even the majority of the most active socialists
                    consider the question as still in the stage of agitation and propaganda, their
                    present task being that of enlightening the masses until the consummation of the
                    present social development, and the declared bankruptcy of the present social
                    order, shall have delivered the world into their hands. Socialism, therefore, is
                    for the most part a theory affecting the future, more or less remote, and has
                    only to a limited degree gained a real and practical footing in the life of our
                    time. Yet it should not be forgotten that its theories have most powerfully
                    affected all the ablest recent economic writers of Germany, and have even
                    considerably<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0222-0207"/> modified German legislation. Its influence is
                    rapidly growing among the lower and also among the most advanced classes in
                    almost every country dominated by European culture, following as a destroying
                    negation the development of capitalism. (3) In its doctrinal aspects socialism
                    is most interesting as a criticism of the present economic order, of what
                    socialists call the capitalistic system, with which the existing land system is
                    connected. Under the present economic order land and capital (the material and
                    instruments without which industry is impossible) are the property of a class,
                    employing a class of wage-labourers handicapped by their exclusion from land and
                    capital. Competition is the general rule by which the share of the members of
                    those classes in the fruits of production is determined. Against this system
                    critical socialism is a reasoned protest; and it is at issue also with the
                    prevailing political economy, in so far as it assumes or maintains the
                    permanence or righteousness of this economic order. Of the economic optimism
                    implied in the historic doctrine of <hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi>
                    socialism is an uncompromising rejection. (4) Socialism is usually regarded as a
                    phase of the struggle for the emancipation of labour, for the complete
                    participation of the working classes in the material, intellectual, and
                    spiritual inheritance of the human race. This is certainly the most substantial
                    and most prominent part of the socialist programme, the working classes being
                    the most numerous and the worst sufferers from the present régime. This view,
                    however, is rather one-sided, for socialism claims not less to be in the
                    interest of the small capitalist gradually crushed by the competition of the
                    larger, and in the interest also of the large capitalist, whose position is
                    endangered by the huge unmanageableness of his success, and by the world-wide
                    economic anarchy from which even the greatest are not secure. Still it is the
                    deliverance of the working class that stands in the front of every socialistic
                    theory; and, though the initiative in socialist speculation and action has
                    usually come from the middle and upper classes, yet it is to the working men
                    that they generally appeal.</p>
                <p>While recognizing the great confusion in the use of the word “socialism,” we have
                    treated it as properly a phenomenon of the 19th century, beginning in France
                    with Saint-Simon and Fourier, in England with Robert Owen, and most powerfully
                    represented at the present day by the school of Karl Marx. As we have seen,
                    however, there are definitions of the word which would give it a wider range of
                    meaning and a more ancient beginning, compared with which capitalism is but of
                    yesterday,—which would, in fact, make it as old as human society itself. In the
                    early stages of human development, when the tribe or the village community was
                    the social unit, the subordination of the individual to the society in which he
                    dwelt was the rule, and common property was the prevalent form. In the
                    development of the idea of property, especially as regards land, three
                    successive historical stages are broadly recognized,—common property and common
                    enjoyment of it, common property and private enjoyment, private property and
                    private enjoyment. The last form did not attain to full expression till the end
                    of the 18th century, when the principle of individual freedom, which was really
                    a reaction against privileged restriction, was proclaimed as a positive axiom of
                    government and of economics. The free individual struggle for wealth and for the
                    social advantages dependent on wealth is a comparatively recent thing. In all
                    periods of history the state reserved to itself the right to interpose in the
                    arrangements of property,—sometimes in favour of the poor, as in the case of the
                    English poor law, which may thus be regarded as a socialistic measure. Moreover,
                    all through history revolts in favour of a rearrangement of property have been
                    very frequent. And in the societies of the Catholic Church we have a permanent
                    example of common property and a common enjoyment of it.</p>
                <p>How are we to distinguish the socialism of the 19th century from these old-world
                    phenomena, and especially from the communism<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    socialists it is frequently used as practically synonymous with socialism.

                    economic basis of socialism as above explained.</p></note> which has played so
                    great a part in history? To this query socialists, especially of the school of
                    Marx, have a clear and precise answer. Socialism is a stage in the evolution of
                    society which could not arrive till the conditions necessary to it had been
                    established. The first and most essential of these was the development of the
                    great industrialism which after a long period of preparation and gradual growth
                    began to reach its culminating point with the inventions and technical
                    improvements, with the application of steam and the rise of the factory system,
                    in England towards the end of the 18th century. Under this system industry was
                    organized into a vast social operation, and was thus already socialized; but it
                    was a system that was exploited by the individual owner of the capital at his
                    own pleasure and for his own behoof. Under the pressure of the competition of
                    the large industry, the small capitalist is gradually crushed out, and the
                    working producers become wage-labourers organized and drilled in immense
                    factories and workshops. The development of this system still continues and is
                    enveloping the 2hole world. Such is the industrial revolution. Parallel with
                    this a revolution in the world of ideas equally great and equally necessary to
                    the rise of socialism has taken place. This change of thought which made its
                    world-historic announcement in the French Revolution made reason the supreme
                    judge and had freedom for its great practical watchword. It was represented in
                    the economic sphere by the school of Adam Smith. Socialism was an outcome of it
                    too, and first of all in Saint-Simon and his school professed to give the
                    positive and constructive corrective to a negative movement which did not see
                    that it was merely negative and therefore temporary. In other words, Saint-Simon
                    may be said to aim at nothing less than the completion of the work of Voltaire,
                    Rousseau, and Adam Smith. Thus socialism professes to be the legitimate child of
                    two great revolutions,—of the industrial revolution which began to establish
                    itself in England towards the end of the 18th century, and of the parallel
                    revolution in thought which about the same time found most prominent expression
                    in France. Robert Owen worked chiefly under the influence of the former;
                    Saint-Simon and Fourier grew up under the latter. The conspiracy of Babeuf is
                    properly to be regarded as a crude revolutionary communism not essentially
                    different from the rude efforts in communism made in earlier periods of history.
                    With Saint-Simon and Owen historic socialism really begins, and is no longer an
                    isolated fact, but has had a continuous and widening development, the succession
                    of socialistic teaching and propaganda being taken up by one country after
                    another throughout the civilized world.</p>
                <p>We have seen, then, that the rise of socialism as a new and reasoned theory of
                    society was relative to the industrial revolution and to the ideas proclaimed in
                    the French Revolution, prominent among which, besides the much emphasized idea
                    of freedom and the less easily realized ideals of equality and fraternity, was
                    the conception of the worth and dignity of labour. Though Owen was most largely
                    influenced by the former and Saint-Simon and Fourier by the latter, it is
                    certain that all three were<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0223-0208"/> greatly affected by both the new movements. The
                    motive power in Owen’s career was the philanthropy and humanitarianism of the
                    18th century. He had grown up in the midst of the industrial revolution; he was
                    one of the most successful pioneers in the improvement of the cotton
                    manufacture. No one could be more deeply conscious of the enormous abuses of the
                    factory system; and no one better knew the wonderful services it could render if
                    technical improvement were only made subordinate to human wellbeing. In the
                    career of Owen we see the new spirit of the 18th century seeking to bring the
                    mechanism of the new industrial system under the direction of a nobler
                    principle, in which the good of all should be the great and sole aim. The
                    position of Saint-Simon was considerably different, yet akin. As Owen had before
                    his eyes the evils of a young but gigantic industrialism, Saint-Simon
                    contemplated the hoary abuses of an idle and privileged feudalism, fearfully
                    shaken no doubt by the Revolution, but still strong in Europe, and in France as
                    elsewhere powerfully revived during the period after Waterloo. Saint-Simon saw
                    that a new world, an industrial world resting on labour, had arisen, while the
                    old feudal and theological world— <hi rend="italic">-fainéant</hi> courtiers and
                    a clergy steeped in ignorance —still ruled. All this array of parasites, who had
                    no longer any useful function to perform for society, Saint-Simon sought to
                    replace by the industrial chiefs and scientific leaders as the real working
                    heads of the French people. Only he expected that these exceptionally gifted
                    men, instead of exploiting the labour of others, should control an industrial
                    France for the general good. Neither Owen nor Saint-Simon was revolutionary in
                    the ordinary sense. Owen was most anxious that the English and other Governments
                    should adopt his projects of socialistic reform. Leading statesmen and royal
                    personages befriended him. He had no faith in the political reforms of 1832; he
                    reckoned the political side of chartism as of no account, and he preferred
                    socialistic experiment under autocratic guidance until the workmen should be
                    trained to rule themselves. The same autocratic tendency was very pronounced in
                    Saint-Simon and his school. His first appeal was to Louis XVIII. He wished to
                    supersede the feudal aristocracy by a working aristocracy of merit. His school
                    claim to have been the first to warn the Governments of Europe of the rise of
                    revolutionary socialism. (For further information as to Saint-Simon and his
                    school, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Saint-Simon.)</hi> The good and bad aspects of
                    the Saint-Simon socialism are too obvious to require elucidation in this
                    article. The antagonism between the old economic order and the new had only
                    begun to declare itself. The extent and violence of the disease were not yet
                    apparent; both diagnosis and remedy were superficial and premature. Such
                    deep-seated organic disorder was not to be conjured away by the waving of a
                    magic wand. The movement was all too utopian and extravagant in much of its
                    activity. The most prominent portion of the school attacked social order in its
                    essential point—the family morality—adopting the worst features of a fantastic,
                    arrogant, and prurient sacerdotalism, and parading them in the face of Europe.
                    Thus it happened that a school which attracted so many of the most brilliant and
                    promising young men of France, which was so striking and original in its
                    criticism of the existing condition of things, which was so strong in the spirit
                    of initiative, and was in many ways so noble, unselfish, and aspiring, sank
                    amidst the laughter and indignation of a scandalized society.</p>
                <p>The beginning of socialism may be dated from 1817, the year when Owen laid his
                    scheme for a socialistic community before the committee of the House of Commons
                    on the poor law, the year also that the speculations of Saint-Simon definitely
                    took a socialistic direction. The outlines of the history of socialism are very
                    simple. Till 1850 there was a double movement in France and England. In the
                    former country after Saint-Simon and Fourier the movement was represented
                    chiefly by Proudhon and Louis Blanc. In England after Owen the movement was
                    taken up by the body of Christian socialists associated with Maurice and
                    Kingsley. The more recent socialism is due chiefly to German and also Russian
                    thinkers, but is generally international both in sympathy and activity.</p>
                <p>Considered as a purely literary and speculative product, the socialism of Fourier
                    was prior to those of both Owen and Saint-Simon. His great work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Théorie des Quatre Mouvements,</hi> was published as early as
                    1808. The socialism of Fourier, however, scarcely attracted any attention and
                    exercised no influence till those of Owen and Saint-Simon were on the decline.
                    His system is one in which the wildest fantasy is mixed with ingenious theory
                    and the most searching criticism of the present competitive system; even yet it
                    is almost unrivalled in pungency and effectiveness. The pantheistic conception
                    of the world which underlay the Saint-Simonian theory of the “rehabilitation of
                    the flesh” formed the basis also of the social ethics and arrangements of
                    Fourier. According to Fourier, evil is the artificial product and attendant of
                    civilization, the result of perverted human institutions, which have run counter
                    to the ordinances of the Creator in pronouncing passions and affections to be
                    bad which are simply natural. Between the creature and the Creator there have
                    been 5000 years of misunderstanding. There is but one way of removing this
                    misunderstanding,—to give a free and healthy and complete development to our
                    passions. This Fourier sought to accomplish in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >phalanges,</hi> which, united in a system of free federation, would, as he
                    believed, soon cover the world (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fourier).</hi></p>
                <p>The year 1830 was an important turning-point in the history of socialism. During
                    the fermentation of that time the activity of the Saint-Simon school came to a
                    crisis, and the ideas of Fourier had an opportunity of taking practical effect.
                    Some of the Saint-Simonians joined him. The movement in France was short-lived;
                    and the numerous experiments tried in America were not more successful. One of
                    the most notable societies suggested by Fourier’s influence, but entirely free
                    from his immoral tendencies, was Brook Farm, established by George Ripley and
                    other cultured Americans in 1840. A most praiseworthy and successful institution
                    also suggested by the teaching of Fourier is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Familistère</hi> at Guise (Aisne) conducted by M. Godin. But by far the
                    greatest result of the revolution of 1830 was the definitive establishment of
                    the contrast between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Hitherto these two
                    classes had fought side by side against feudalism and the reaction. The
                    bourgeoisie were now rulers, and the proletariat became the revolutionary party,
                    the first outbreak under the new conditions taking place at Lyons in 1831, when
                    the starving workmen rose to arms with the device, “Live working or die
                    fighting.” During the latter half of the reign of the bourgeois king Louis
                    Philippe Paris became more than ever the centre of socialistic fermentation. In
                    1839 Louis Blanc published his <hi rend="italic">Organisation du Travail,</hi>
                    and Cabet his <hi rend="italic">Voyage en Icarie.</hi> In 1840 Proudhon
                    published his book on property. At this period Paris counted among her visitors
                    Lassalle, the founder of the social democracy of Germany; Karl Marx, the chief
                    of scientific international socialism; and Bakunin, the apostle of
                    anarchism.</p>
                <p>The socialism of Saint-Simon and Fourier was largely speculative, imaginative,
                    and utopian, and had only a very remote connexion with the practical life of
                    their time. With Louis Blanc (1811-1882) socialism came into real contact with
                    the public history of France. The most con-<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0224-0209"/> spicuous feature of Louis Blanc’s teaching was
                    that he demanded the democratic organization of the state as preparatory to
                    social reorganization. His system, therefore, had a positive and practical
                    basis, in so far as it allied itself to a dominant tendency in the existing
                    state. Louis Blanc was an eminent journalist, born at Madrid, where his father
                    had a high post on the finances of King Joseph. His celebrated work on
                    socialism, <hi rend="italic">Organisation du Travail,</hi> exerted a very large
                    influence on the thought of France. The formula of progress, says Louis Blanc,
                    is double in its unity,—moral and material amelioration of the lot of all by the
                    free co-operation of all and their fraternal association. He saw, however, that
                    the great end of social reform could not be attained without political reform.
                    It was not enough to discover the true methods for inaugurating the principle of
                    association and the organization of labour according to the rules of reason,
                    justice, and humanity. It was necessary to have political power on the side of
                    social reform, political power resting on the chambers, on the tribunals, and on
                    the army; not to take it as an instrument was to meet it as an obstacle. For
                    these reasons he wished to see the state constituted on a thoroughly democratic
                    basis as the first condition of success. He demanded that the state thus
                    reformed should establish associations, which he called <hi rend="italic">sοcial
                    workshops,</hi> for co-operative production. The money should be provided by the
                    state, which also should draw up the rules. The state should appoint the
                    functionaries for the first year. After that the workmen should elect their own
                    managers. “Though the false and anti-social education given to the present
                    generation makes it difficult to find any other motive of emulation and
                    encouragement than a higher salary, the wages will be equal, as the ideas and
                    character of men will be changed by an absolutely new education.” Louis Blanc
                    hoped that private firms would not be able to exist under the competition of
                    such associations, and that the latter would in time absorb all the production
                    of the country. Notwithstanding the influence exerted by Louis Blanc and the
                    working men’s party in the provisional Government of 1848, it cannot be said
                    that his plans obtained a fair hearing or a fair trial. His schemes were
                    certainly not carried out in the national workshops of that year. These were
                    really a travesty of Louis Blanc’s proposals, instituted expressly to discredit
                    them. They were simply means of finding work for a motley proletariat thrown out
                    of employment during the period of revolutionary disturbance; and these men were
                    put to unproductive work, whereas of course Louis Blanc contemplated nothing but
                    productive work, and the men he proposed to invite to join his associations were
                    to give guarantees of character. The months following the revolution of February
                    were, moreover, a period of industrial stagnation and insecurity, when any new
                    project of trade, either on the old or new lines, had very little prospect of
                    success. This remark applies largely also to the private associations for
                    co-operative production subsidized by the republican Government. These were more
                    closely akin to the plans of Louis Blanc; but to them also the times were
                    unfavourable, and the help given them was both scanty and injudicious. As one of
                    the leaders during this difficult crisis Louis Blanc had neither personal force
                    nor enduring political influence sufficient to secure any considerable success
                    for his cause. He was an amiable and genial enthusiast, but without weight
                    enough to be a controller of men on a wide scale. The labour conferences at the
                    Luxembourg, over which he presided, ended also as his opponents desired, without
                    any tangible result. The proletariat at Paris, incensed at the closing of the
                    national workshops, rose in armed insurrection, which was overthrown by
                    Cavaignac in the sanguinary days of June (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cavaignac).</hi> Louis Blanc was in no way implicated in the revolt, but he
                    found it necessary to go into exile in England. With the bloodshed of the days
                    of June French socialism ceased for a time to be a considerable force. Socialism
                    in the true acceptation of the word was indeed only partially responsible for
                    the insurrection. It was a rising of a proletariat not particularly versed in
                    theories of social reconstruction, but deeply incensed at the reactionary
                    measures of their rulers. Inasmuch, however, as it destroyed the most
                    enterprising leaders of the workmen and quelled the spirit of the remainder, it
                    thoroughly repressed the tendency to innovation amongst them for a long time to
                    come, while the false prosperity of the second empire removed their most crying
                    grievances. Under Napoleon III. there was consequently comparative quietness in
                    France. Even the International had very little influence on French soil, though
                    French working men had an important share in starting it.</p>
                <p>Compared with the parallel movement in France the early socialism of England had
                    an uneventful history (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Owen).</hi> In order to
                    appreciate the significance of Owen’s work it is necessary to recall some of the
                    more important features of the social condition of the country in his time. The
                    English worker had no fixed interest in the soil. He had no voice either in
                    local or national government. He had little education or none at all. His
                    dwelling was wretched in the extreme. The right even of combination was denied
                    him till 1824. The wages of the agricultural labourer were miserably low. The
                    workman’s share in the benefits of the industrial revolution was doubtful. Great
                    numbers of his class were reduced to utter poverty and ruin by the great changes
                    consequent on the introduction of improved machinery; the tendency to
                    readjustment was slow and continually disturbed by fresh change. The hours of
                    work were mercilessly long. He had to compete against the labour of women, and
                    of children brought frequently at the age of five or six from the workhouses.
                    These children had to work the same long hours as the adults, and they were
                    sometimes strapped by the overseers till the blood came. Destitute as they so
                    often were of parental protection and oversight, with both sexes huddled
                    together under immoral and insanitary conditions, it was only natural that they
                    should fall into the worst habits, and that their offspring should to such a
                    lamentable degree be vicious, improvident, and physically degenerate. In a
                    country where the labourers had neither education nor political or social
                    rights, and where the peasantry were practically landless serfs, the old English
                    poor-law was only a doubtful part of an evil system. All these permanent causes
                    of mischief were aggravated by special causes connected with the cessation of
                    the Napoleonic wars, which are well known. It was in such circumstances, when
                    English pauperism had become a grave national question, that Owen first brought
                    forward his scheme of socialism (1817). In his communities, which were intended
                    to be self-dependent units, Owen sought to provide the best education and the
                    constant exercise of unselfish intelligence, to unite the advantages of town and
                    country, and to correct the monotonous activity of the factory with the greatest
                    variety of occupation, while utilizing all the latest improvements in industrial
                    technique. The causes of Owen’s failure in establishing his communities are
                    obvious enough. Apart from the difficulties inherent in socialism, he injured
                    the social cause by going out of his way to attack the historic religions and
                    the accepted views on marriage, by his quixotry and tediousness, by refusing to
                    see that for the mass of men measures of transition from an old to a new system
                    must be adopted. If he had been truer to his earlier methods and retained the
                    autocratic guidance of his experiments, the chances of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n225/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0225-0210"/> success would have been greater. Above all, Owen
                    had too great faith in human nature, and he did not understand the laws of
                    social evolution. His great doctrine of the influence of circumstances in the
                    formation of character was only a very crude way of expressing the law of social
                    continuity so much emphasized by recent socialism. He thought that he could
                    break the chain of continuity, and as by magic create a new set of
                    circumstances, which would forthwith produce a new generation of rational and
                    unselfish men. The time was too strong for him, and the current of English
                    history swept past him. Even a very brief account of Owen, however, would be
                    incomplete without indicating his relation to Malthus. Against Malthus he showed
                    that the wealth of the country had, in consequence of mechanical improvement,
                    increased out of all proportion to the population. The problem, therefore, was
                    not to restrict population, but to institute rational social arrangements and to
                    secure a fair distribution of wealth. Whenever the number of inhabitants in any
                    of his communities increased beyond the maximum, new ones should be created,
                    until they extended over the whole world, uniting all in one great republic with
                    one interest. There would be no fear of over-population for a long time to come.
                    Its evils were then felt in Ireland and other countries; but that condition of
                    things was owing to the total want of the most ordinary common sense on the part
                    of the blinded authorities of the world. The period would probably never arrive
                    when the earth would be full; but if it should the human race will be good,
                    intelligent, and rational, and would know much better than the present
                    irrational generation how to provide for the occurrence. Such was Owen’s
                    socialist treatment of the population problem.</p>
                <p>In England the reform of 1832 had the same effect as the revolution of July
                    (1830) in France: it brought the middle class into power, and by the exclusion
                    of the workmen emphasized their existence as a separate class. The discontent of
                    the workmen now found expression in Chartism. As is obvious from the contents of
                    the charter, Chartism was most prominently a demand for political reform; but
                    both in its origin and in its ultimate aim the movement was more essentially
                    economic. As regards the study of socialism, the interest of this movement lies
                    greatly in the fact that in its organs the doctrine of “surplus value”
                    afterwards elaborated by Marx as the basis of his system is broadly and
                    emphatically enunciated. While the worker produces all the wealth, he is obliged
                    to content himself with the meagre share necessary to support his existence and
                    the surplus goes to the capitalist, who, with the king, the priests, lords,
                    esquires, and gentlemen, lives upon the labour of the working man <hi

                <p>After the downfall of Owenism began the Christian socialist movement in England
                    (1848-52), of which the leaders were Maurice, Kingsley, and Mr Ludlow. The
                    abortive Chartist demonstration of April 1848 excited in Maurice and his friends
                    the deepest sympathy with the sufferings of the English working class,—a feeling
                    which was intensified by the revelations regarding “London Labour and the London
                    Poor” published in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> (1849). Mr
                    Ludlow, who had in France become acquainted with the theories of Fourier, was
                    the economist of the movement, and it was with him that the idea originated of
                    starting co-operative associations. In <hi rend="italic">Politics for the
                    People,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Socialist,</hi> in the pulpit
                    and on the platform, and in <hi rend="italic">Yeast</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alton Locke,</hi> well-known novels of Kingsley, the representatives of the
                    movement exposed the evils of the competitive system, carried on an unsparing
                    warfare against the Manchester school, and maintained that socialism rightly
                    understood was only Christianity applied to social reform. Their labours in
                    insisting on ethical and spiritual principles as the true bonds of society, in
                    promoting associations, and in diffusing a knowledge of co-operation were
                    largely beneficial. In the north of England they joined hands with the
                    co-operative movement inaugurated by the Rochdale pioneers (1844) under the
                    influence of Owenism. Productive co-operation made very little progress, but
                    co-operative distribution has proved a great success.</p>
                <p>In 1852 the twofold socialist movement in France and England had come to a close,
                    leaving no visible result of any importance. From that date the most prominent
                    leaders of socialism have been German and Russian. To reach the beginnings of
                    German socialism we must go back a little, as it took its rise in the years
                    preceding the revolution of 1848. Its most conspicuous chiefs are Karl Marx,
                    Friedrich Engels, Lassalle, and Rodbertus (for the last two, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lassalle</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodbertus).</hi> The
                    greatest and most influential of the four was unquestionably Marx, who and his
                    like-minded companion Engels are the acknowledged heads of the “scientific and
                    revolutionary” school of socialism, which has its representatives in almost
                    every country of the civilized world, and is generally recognized as the most
                    serious and formidable form of socialism. Karl Marx (1818-1883) was of Jewish
                    extraction. He was born at Treves, and studied at Berlin and Bonn, but neglected
                    the speciality of law, which he nominally adopted, for the more congenial
                    subjects of philosophy and history. He was a zealous student and apparently an
                    adherent of Hegelianism, but soon gave up his intention of following an academic
                    career as a teacher of philosophy and joined the staff of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhenish Gazette,</hi> published at Cologne as an organ of the extreme
                    democracy. In 1843, after marry ing the sister of the Prussian minister Von
                    Westfalen, lie removed to Paris, where he applied himself to the study of
                    economic and social questions and began to publish those youthful writings which
                    must be reckoned among the most powerful expositions of the early form of German
                    socialism. With Arnold Ruge he edited the <hi rend="italic">Deutsch-Französische
                    Jahrbücher.</hi> In 1845 he was expelled from Paris and settled in Brussels,
                    where he published his <hi rend="italic">Discours sur le Libre Échange,</hi> and
                    his criticism of Proudhon’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophie de la Misère,</hi>
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Misère de la Philosophie.</hi> In Paris he had
                    already met Friedrich Engels, who was destined to be his lifelong and loyal
                    friend and companion-in-arms, and who in 1845 published his important work <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England.</hi> The two friends
                    found that they had arrived at a complete identity of opinion; and an
                    opportunity soon occurred for an emphatic expression of their common views. A
                    society of socialists, a kind of forerunner of the International, had
                    established itself in London, and had been attracted by the new theories of Marx
                    and the spirit of strong and uncompromising conviction with which he advocated
                    them. They entered into relation with Marx and Engels; the society was
                    reorganized under the name of the Communist League; and a congress was held,
                    which resulted (1847) in the framing of the <hi rend="italic">Manifesto of the
                    Communist Party,</hi> which was published in most of the languages of western
                    Europe, and is the first proclamation of that revolutionary socialism armed with
                    all the learning of the 19th century, but expressed with the fire and energy of
                    the agitator, which in the International and other movements has so startled the
                    world. During the revolutionary troubles of 1848 Marx returned to Germany, and
                    along with his comrades Engels, Wolff, &amp;c., he supported the most advanced
                    democracy in the <hi rend="italic">New Rhenish Gazette.</hi> In 1849 he settled
                    in London, where till his death in 1883 he applied himself to the elaboration of
                    his economic views and to the realization of his revolutionary programme. During
                    this period he published <hi rend="italic">Zur Kritik der politischen
                    Oekonomie</hi> (1859),<pb break="no"

                <p>The causes which have variously contributed to the rise of German socialism are
                    sufficiently clear. With the accession of the romanticist Frederick William IV.
                    to the throne of Prussia in 1840 German liberalism received a fresh expansion.
                    At the same time the Hegelian school began to break up, and the interest in pure
                    philosophy began to wane. It was a time of disillusionment, of dissatisfaction
                    with idealism, of transition to realistic and even to materialistic ways of
                    thinking. This found strongest expression in the Hegelian left, to which, after
                    the ideals of the old religions and philosophies had proved unsubstantial, there
                    remained as solid residuum the real fact of man with his positive interests in
                    this life. The devotion and enthusiasm which had previously been fixed on ideal
                    and spiritual conceptions were concentrated on humanity. To adherents of the
                    Hegelian left, who had been delivered from intellectual routine by the most
                    intrepid spirit of criticism, and who, therefore, had little respect for the
                    conventionalisms of a feudal society, it naturally appeared that the interests
                    of humanity had been cruelly sacrificed in favour of class privilege and
                    prejudice. The greatest thinkers of Germany had recognized the noble elements in
                    the French Revolution. To recognize also the noble and promising features of
                    French socialism was a natural thing, especially for Germans who had been in
                    Paris,—the great hearth of the new ideas. Here they found themselves definitely
                    and consciously in presence of the last and greatest interest of humanity, the
                    suffering and struggling proletariat of western Europe, which had so recently
                    made its definite entry in the history of the world. Thus socialism became a
                    social, political, and economic creed to Karl Marx and his associates. But they
                    felt that the theories which preceded them were wanting in scientific basis; and
                    it was henceforward the twofold aim of the school to give scientific form to
                    socialism and to propagate it in Europe by the best and most effective
                    revolutionary methods.</p>
                <p>The fundamental principle of the Marx school and of the whole cognate socialism
                    is the theory of “surplus value,”— the doctrine, namely, that, after the
                    labourer has been paid the wage necessary for the subsistence of himself and
                    family, the surplus produce of his labour is appropriated by the capitalist who
                    exploits it. This theory is an application of the principle that labour is the
                    source of value, which was enunciated by many of the old writers on economics,
                    such as Locke and Petty, which was set forth with some vagueness and
                    inconsistency by Adam Smith, and was more systematically expounded by Ricardo.
                    The socialistic application of the principle in the doctrine of surplus value
                    had been made both by Owenites and chartists. It was to prevent this
                    appropriation of surplus value by capitalists and middlemen that the Owen school
                    tried the system of exchange by labour notes in 1832,— the value of goods being
                    estimated in labour-time, represented by labour notes. The principle that labour
                    is the source of value has been accepted in all its logical consequences by
                    Marx, and by him elaborated with extraordinary dialectical skill and historical
                    learning into the most complete system of socialism that has ever been
                    formulated. A like application of the principle but in a less rigorous fashion
                    has been made by Rodbertus; and it is the same theory that underlies the
                    extravagancies and paradoxes of Proudhon. The question whether the priority in
                    the scientific development of the principle is due to Marx or Rodbertus cannot
                    be fully discussed here. But it may be said that, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Social Letters</hi> of Rodbertus to Von Kirchmann were published in 1850, the
                    importance of the principle was understood by the Marx school as early as 1845,
                    and in a broad and general way had indeed become the common property of
                    socialists. The historical importance and scientific worth of the writings of
                    Rodbertus should not be overlooked; nor are they likely to be when so much
                    attention has been given to him by A. Wagner and other distinguished German
                    economists. But in the great work of Marx the socialist theory is elaborated
                    with a fulness of learning and a logical power to which Rodbertus has no claim.
                    With Marx the doctrine of surplus value receives its widest application and
                    development; it supplies the key to his explanation of the history and influence
                    of capital, and consequently of the present economic era, which is dominated by
                    it. It is the basis, in fact, of a vast and elaborate system of social
                    philosophy. In any case it is an absurdity as well as an historical error to
                    speak of Marx as having borrowed from Rodbertus. Marx was an independent thinker
                    of great originality and force of character, who had made the economic
                    development of modern Europe the study of a laborious lifetime, and who was in
                    the habit, not of borrowing, but of strongly asserting the results of his own
                    research and of impressing them upon other men.</p>
                <p>The great work of Marx may be described as an exposition and criticism of
                    capital. But it is also indirectly an exposition of socialism, inasmuch as the
                    historical evolution of capital is governed by natural laws, the inevitable
                    tendency of which is towards socialism. It is the great aim of Marx to reveal
                    the law of the economic movement of modern times. Now the economic movement of
                    modern times is dominated by capital. Explain, therefore, the natural history of
                    capital, the rise, consolidation, and decline of its supremacy as an
                    evolutionary process, and you forecast the nature of that into which it is being
                    transformed,—socialism. Hence the great task of the Marx school is not to preach
                    a new economic and social gospel, not to provide ready-made schemes of social
                    regeneration after the fashion of the early socialists, nor to counteract by
                    alleviating measures the wretchedness of our present system, but to explain and
                    promote the inevitable process of social evolution, so that the domination of
                    capital may run its course and give place to the higher system that is to
                    come.</p>
                <p>The characteristic feature of the régime of capital, or, as Marx usually calls
                    it, the capitalistic method of production, is, that industrial operations are
                    carried on by individual capitalists employing free labourers, whose sole
                    dependence is the wage they receive. Those free labourers perform the function
                    fulfilled in other states of society by the slave and the serf. It is the
                    tendency of the capitalistic system to consolidate those two classes,—the
                    capitalist class, enriching itself on the profits of industry, which they
                    control in their own interest, and the class of workers, nominally free, but
                    without land or capital, divorced, therefore, from the means of production, and
                    dependent on their wages,—the modern proletariat. The great aim of the
                    capitalist is the increase of wealth through the accumulation of his profits.
                    This accumulation is secured by the appropriation of what the socialists call
                    surplus value. The history of the capitalistic method of production is the
                    history of the appropriation and accumulation of surplus value. To understand
                    the capitalistic system is to understand surplus value. With the analysis of
                    value, therefore, the great work of Marx begins.</p>
                <p>The wealth of the societies in which the capitalistic method of production
                    prevails appears as an enormous collection of commodities. A commodity is in the
                    first place an external object adapted to satisfy human wants; and this
                    usefulness gives it value in use, makes it a use value. These use values form
                    the material of wealth, whatever its social form may be. In modern societies,
                    where the business of production is carried on to meet the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n227/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0227-0212"/> demands of the market, for exchange, these use
                    values appear as exchange values. Exchange value is the proportion in which use
                    values of different kinds exchange for each other. But the enormous mass of
                    things that circulate in the world market exchange for each other in the most
                    different proportions. They must, however, have a common quality or they could
                    not be compared. This common quality cannot be any of the natural properties of
                    the commodities. In the business of exchange one thing is as good as another,
                    provided you have it in sufficient quantity. Leaving out of consideration,
                    therefore, the physical qualities that give commodities use value, we find in
                    them but one common characteristic,— that they are all products of human labour.
                    They are all crystallized forms of human labour. It is labour applied to natural
                    objects that gives them value. What constitutes value is the human labour
                    embodied in commodities. And the relation of exchange is only a phase of this
                    value, which is therefore to be considered independently of it. Further, the
                    labour-time spent in producing value is the measure of value, not this or that
                    individual labour, in which case a lazy or unskilled man would produce as great
                    a quantity of value as the most skilful and energetic. We must take as our
                    standard the average labour-force of the community. The labour-time which we
                    take as the measure of value is the time required to produce a commodity under
                    the normal social conditions of production with the average degree of skill and
                    intensity of labour. Thus labour is both the source and the measure of
                    value.</p>
                <p>As we have seen, the characteristic feature of the capitalistic system of
                    production is that industry is controlled by capitalists employing free
                    wage-labour; that is, while the capitalist owns and controls the means of
                    production, the free labourer has lost all ownership in land and capital and has
                    nothing to depend on but his wage. This condition of things was established only
                    after a long and gradual process of social change, which Marx copiously
                    illustrates from the history of England, as the classic land of the fully
                    developed capitalism. In the Middle Ages the craftsman and peasant were the
                    owners of the small means of production then extant, and they produced for their
                    own needs and for their feudal superior; only the superfluity went into the
                    general market. Such production was necessarily small, limited, and technically
                    imperfect. Towards the close of the Middle Ages a great change set in caused by
                    a remarkable combination of circumstances,—the downfall of the feudal system and
                    of the Catholic Church, the discovery of America and of the sea route to India.
                    Through the breaking up of the feudal houses with their numerous retainers,
                    through the transformation of the old peasant-holdings into extensive
                    sheep-runs, and generally through the prevalent application of the commercial
                    system to the management of land instead of the Catholic and feudal spirit, the
                    peasantry were driven off the land, a multitude of people totally destitute of
                    property were thrown loose from their old means of livelihood, and were reduced
                    to vagabondage or forced into the towns. It was in this way that the modern
                    proletarians made their tragic entry in history. On the other hand, there was a
                    parallel development of the capitalist class, brought about by the slave trade,
                    the exploitation of the American colonies and of both the Indies, and by the
                    robbery, violence, and corruption which attended the transference of the land
                    from the Catholic and feudal to the modern régime. The opening and extension of
                    the great world market, moreover, gave a great stimulus to industry at home. The
                    old guilds having already been expropriated and dissolved, the early
                    organization of industry under the control of an infant capitalism passed
                    through its first painful and laborious stages, till with the great mechanical
                    inventions, with the application of steam as the motive-power, and the rise of
                    the factory system towards the close of the 18th century, the great industrial
                    revolution was accomplished, and the capitalistic method of production attained
                    to its colossal manhood.</p>
                <p>The capitalistic system thus established, we have to remember that in all its
                    forms, and throughout all the stages of its history, the great aim of the
                    capitalist is to increase and consolidate his gains through the appropriation of
                    surplus value. This appropriation of surplus value is a very old phenomenon in
                    human society. In all the forms of society which depended on slave labour, and
                    under the feudal régime, the appropriation of the results of other men’s labour
                    was open and undisguised. Under the capitalistic system it is disguised under
                    the form of free contract. The workman appears on the labour market with the
                    sole commodity of which he has to dispose, his labour force, and sells it for a
                    specified time at the price it can bring, which we call his wage, and which is
                    equivalent to the average means of subsistence required to support himself and
                    to provide for the future supply of labour (in his family). But the labour force
                    of the workman as utilized by the capitalist in the factory or the mine produces
                    a net value in excess of his wage. That is, over and above his entire outlay,
                    including the wage paid to his workmen, the capitalist finds himself in
                    possession of a surplus, which can only represent the “unpaid labour” of his
                    workmen. This surplus is the surplus value of Karl Marx, the product of unpaid
                    labour. This it is which the capitalist seeks to obtain and to accumulate by all
                    the methods available. These methods are described by Marx with great detail and
                    elaboration through several hundred pages of his first volume. His account,
                    supported at every step by long and copious citations from the best historical
                    authorities and from the blue-books of the various parliamentary commissions, is
                    a lurid and ghastly picture of the many abuses of English industrialism. It is
                    the dark and gloomy reverse of the industrial glories of England. The fearful
                    prolongation of the hours of labour, the merciless exploitation of women, and of
                    children from the age of infancy, the utter neglect of sanitary conditions,
                    whatever could lessen the costs of production and swell the profits of the
                    capitalist, though every law of man and nature were violated in the
                    process,—such are the historical facts which Marx emphasizes and illustrates
                    with an overwhelming force of evidence. They receive ample confirmation in the
                    history of the English Factory Acts, imposed on greedy and unscrupulous
                    capitalists after a severe struggle prolonged for half a century, and required
                    to prevent the moral and physical ruin of the industrial population.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the first and most conspicuous result of the capitalistic
                    system is that, while production is a social operation carried on by men
                    organized and associated in factories, the product is appropriated by individual
                    capitalists: it is social production and capitalistic appropriation. Another
                    conspicuous and important result is that, while we have this organization in the
                    factories, we have outside of them all the anarchy of competition. We have the
                    capitalistic appropriators of the product of labour contending for the
                    possession of the market, without systematic regard to the supply required by
                    that market— each one filling the market only as dictated by his own interest,
                    and trying to outdo his rivals by all the methods of adulteration, bribery, and
                    intrigue,—an economic war hurtful to the best interests of society. With the
                    development of the capitalistic system machinery is more and more perfected, for
                    to neglect improvement is to succumb in the struggle; the improved machinery
                    renders labour super<pb break="no"

                    exposed to starvation. But, as the technique improves, the productive power of
                    industry increases, and continually tends more and more to surpass the available
                    needs of the market, wide as it is. The consequence is that the market tends to
                    be overstocked even to absolute repletion; goods will not sell, and a commercial
                    crisis is established, in which we have the remarkable phenomenon of widespread
                    panic, misery, and starvation resulting from a superabundance of wealth,—a
                    “crise pléthorique,” as Fourier called it, a crisis due to a plethora of wealth.
                    These crises occur at periodic intervals, each one severer and more widespread
                    than the preceding, until they now tend to become chronic and permanent, and the
                    whole capitalistic world staggers under an atlantean weight of ill-distributed
                    wealth. Thus the process goes on in obedience to its own inherent laws.
                    Production is more and more concentrated in the hands of mammoth capitalists and
                    colossal joint-stock companies, under which the proletariat are organized and
                    drilled into vast industrial armies. But, as crisis succeeds crisis, until
                    panic, stagnation, and disorder are universal, it becomes clear that the
                    bourgeoisie are no longer capable of controlling the industrial world. The
                    incompatibility between social production and anarchic distribution decidedly
                    declares itself. With the progress of democracy the proletariat seizes the
                    political power, and through it at last takes complete control over the economic
                    functions of society. It expropriates the private capitalist and appropriating
                    the means of production manages them in its own interest, which is the interest
                    of society as a whole; society passes into the socialistic stage through a
                    revolution determined by the natural laws of social evolution, and not by a
                    merely arbitrary exercise of power. It is a result determined by the inherent
                    laws of social evolution, independent of the will and purpose of individual men.
                    All that the most powerful and clear-sighted intellect can do is to learn to
                    divine the laws of the great movement of society, and to shorten and alleviate
                    the birth-pangs of the new era. The efforts of reactionaries of every class to
                    turn the wheel of history backwards are in vain. But an intelligent appreciation
                    of its tendencies and a willing co-operation with them will make progress
                    easier, smoother, and more rapid.</p>
                <p>It will have been seen that what Marx and his school contemplate is an economic
                    revolution brought about in accordance with the natural laws of historic
                    evolution. But in order to understand the full import of this revolution in the
                    mind of Marx we must remember that he regards the economic order of society as
                    the groundwork of the same, determining all the other forms of social order. The
                    entire legal and political structure as well as philosophy and religion are
                    constituted and controlled in accordance with the economic basis. This is in
                    harmony with his method and his conception of the world, which is the Hegelian
                    reversed. “For Hegel the thought process, which he transforms into an
                    independent subject under the name idea, is the creator of the real, which forms
                    only its external manifestation. With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing
                    else than the material transformed and translated in the human brain.” His
                    conception of the world is a frank and avowed materialism. His method is the
                    dialectic applied to a world thus understood; the business of inquiry, namely,
                    is to trace the connexion and concatenation in the links that make up the
                    process of historic evolution, to investigate how one stage succeeds another in
                    the development of society, the facts and forms of human life and history not
                    being stable and stereotyped things, but the ever-changing manifestations of the
                    fluent and unresting real, the course of which it is the duty of science to
                    reveal. The whole position of the Marx school may therefore be characterized as
                    evolutionary and revolu tionary socialism, based on a materialistic conception
                    of the world and of human history. Socialism is a social revolution determined
                    by the laws of historic evolution— a revolution which, changing the economic
                    groundwork of society, will change the whole structure.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the work of Marx is a natural history of capital, especially
                    in its relation to labour, and in its most essential features is a development
                    of two of the leading principles of the classic economics,—that labour is the
                    source of value, but that of this value the labourer obtains for himself merely
                    a subsistence wage, the surplus being appropriated by the exploiting capitalist.
                    Marx’s great work may be described as an elaborate historical development of
                    this glaring fundamental contradiction of the Ricardian economics, the
                    contradiction between the iron law of wages and the great principle that labour
                    is the source of wealth. Marx’s conception of labour is the same as that of
                    Ricardo, and as a logical exposition of the historic contradiction between the
                    two principles on the basis of Ricardo the work of Marx is quite unanswerable.
                    It is obvious, however, that the definition of labour assumed both in Ricardo
                    and Marx is too narrow. The labour they broadly posit as the source of wealth is
                    manual labour. In the early stages of industry, when the market was small and
                    limited and the technique was of the simplest and rudest description, labour in
                    that sense might correctly enough be described as the source of value. But in
                    modern industry, when the market is world-wide, the technique most complex, and
                    the competition most severe, when inventiveness, sagacity, courage, and decision
                    in initiative, and skill in management, are factors so important, no such
                    exclusive place as has been claimed can be assigned to labour. The Ricardian
                    principle, therefore, falls to the ground. And it is not historically true to
                    maintain, as Marx does, that the profits of the capitalist are obtained simply
                    by appropriating the products of unpaid labour. In initiating and managing the
                    capitalist is charged with the most difficult and important part of the work of
                    production. As a natural consequence it follows that Marx is also historically
                    inaccurate in roundly explaining capital as the accumulation of unpaid labour
                    appropriated by the capitalist. In past accumulation, as in the control and
                    management of industry generally, the capitalist has had the leading part.
                    Capital, therefore, is not necessarily robbery, and in an economic order in
                    which the system of free exchange is the rule, and the mutually beneficial
                    interchange of utilities, no objection can be raised to the principle of lending
                    and borrowing of money for interest. In short, in his theory of unpaid labour as
                    supplying the key to his explanation of the genesis and development of the
                    capitalistic system Marx is not true to history. It is the perfectly logical
                    outcome of certain of the leading principles of the Ricardian school, but it
                    does not give an adequate or accurate account of the facts of economic
                    evolution.</p>
                <p>It may indeed be maintained that in his theory of unpaid labour Marx is not
                    consistent with the general principles of his own philosophy of social
                    evolution. With him history is a process determined by material forces, a
                    succession of orderly phenomena controlled by natural laws. Now we may waive the
                    objection suggested by the principle enunciated in the Marx school itself, that
                    it is not legitimate to apply ethical categories in judgment on economic
                    processes that are merely natural, which, however, Marx does with revolutionary
                    emphasis throughout some hundreds of pages of his great work. It is more
                    important to point out, in perfect consistency with the principles of the
                    school, that the energy and inventiveness of the early capitalists especially
                    were the most essential factors in determining the existence and development of
                    a<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0229-0214"/> great economic era, and that the assertion of
                    freedom was an indispensable condition in breaking the bonds of the old feudal
                    order, which the new system displaced. Instead, therefore, of living and growing
                    rich on the produce of unpaid labour, the capitalist had a great social and
                    industrial function to perform, and played a great part in historic evolution.
                    The position and function of the workman was subordinate.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that in his theory of surplus value obtained from unpaid
                    labour Marx as agitator and controversialist has fallen into serious
                    contradiction with himself as scientific historian and philosopher. The theory
                    that labour is the source of value was widely accepted among economists during
                    his early life, and by its justice and nobleness it was well adapted to the
                    comfortable optimism prevalent among so many of the classical school. The
                    economists, however, did not follow the principle to its obvious conclusion,
                    that if labour is the source of wealth the labourer should enjoy it all. It was
                    otherwise with the socialists, who were not slow to perceive the bearing of the
                    theory on the existing economic order. In his controversial treatise against
                    Proudhon Marx gives a list of writers (beginning with the political economy of
                    Hopkins, published in 1822, only five years after the appearance of Ricardo’s
                    great work) by whom the principle was applied to revolutionary purposes. Its
                    simplicity and seeming effectiveness must have made it most attractive. As
                    posited by the classic economy and applied by the socialists Marx accepted the
                    principle. It was an unanswerable <hi rend="italic">argumentum ad hominem</hi>
                    when addressed to an economist of the Ricardian school; but it should have
                    broken down when confronted with historical fact. Nevertheless it was made and
                    continued to be the foundation stone of the system of Marx, and is really its
                    weakest point. His doctrine of surplus value is the vitiating factor in his
                    history of the capitalistic system. The most obvious excuse for him is that he
                    borrowed it from the classic economists. It would be the greatest possible
                    mistake, however, to make this a reason for undervaluing the remarkable services
                    rendered to economics by Karl Marx. He spent forty laborious years almost wholly
                    in exile as the scientific champion of the proletariat. In the combination of
                    learning, philosophic acumen, and literary power he is probably second to no
                    economic thinker of the 19th century. He seems to have been master of the whole
                    range of economic literature, and wielded it with a logical skill not less
                    masterly. But his great strength lay in his knowledge of the technical and
                    economic development of modern industry and in his marvellous insight into the
                    tendencies in social evolution determined by the technical and economic factors.
                    Whether his theories in this department are right or wrong they have suggested
                    questions that will demand the attention of economic thinkers for a long time to
                    come. It is in this department and not in his theory of surplus value that
                    Marx’s significance as a scientific economist is to be found.</p>
                <p>The great merit of Marx, therefore, lies in the work he has done as scientific
                    inquirer into the economic movement of modern times, as the philosophic
                    historian of the capitalistic era. It is now admitted by all inquirers worthy of
                    the name that history, including economic history, is a succession of orderly
                    phenomena, that each phase in the line of succession is marked by facts and
                    tendencies more or less peculiar to itself, and that laws and principles which
                    we now condemn had formerly an historical necessity, justification, and
                    validity. In accordance with this fundamental principle of historical evolution
                    arrangements and institutions which were once necessary, and originally formed a
                    stage in human progress, may gradually develop contradictions and abuses and
                    thus become more or less antiquated.</p>
                <p>The economic social and political forms which were the progressive and even
                    adequate expressions of the life of one era become hindrances and fetters to the
                    life of the succeeding times. This, the school of Karl Marx says, is precisely
                    the condition of the present economic order. The existing arrangements of
                    landlord, capitalist, and wage-labourer under free competition are burdened with
                    contradiction and abuse. The life of society is being strangled by the forms
                    which once promoted it. They maintain that the really vital and powerful
                    tendencies of our time are towards a higher and wider form of social and
                    economic organization,—towards socialism. This we believe to be the central
                    point of the whole question; but the fuller discussion of it can more
                    conveniently be postponed to the close of this article, λvhen we come to
                    consider socialism as a whole.</p>
                <p>The opinions of Marx were destined to find expression in two movements, which
                    have played a considerable part in recent history,—the International and the
                    social democracy of Germany. Of the International Marx was the inspiring and
                    controlling head from the beginning; and the German social democracy, though
                    originated by Lassalle, before long fell under Marx’s influence. Marx wrote the
                    famous inaugural address of the International and drew up its statutes,
                    maintaining a moderation of tone which contrasted strongly with the outspoken
                    vigour of the communist manifesto of 1847. But it was not long before the
                    revolutionary socialism which underlay the movement gained the upper hand. This
                    found strongest expression in the address drawn up by Marx in 1871 after the
                    suppression of the commune, and entitled <hi rend="italic">The Civil War in
                    France.</hi> The International was not responsible for the revolt of the
                    commune, which was a rising for the autonomy of Paris, supported chiefly by the
                    lower classes. It was a protest against excessive centralization raised by the
                    democracy of Paris, which has always been far in advance of the provinces, and
                    which found itself in possession of arms after the siege of the town by the
                    Germans. But, while it was prominently an assertion of local autonomy, it was
                    also a revolt against the economic oppression of the moneyed classes, and thus
                    contained within it strong socialistic tendencies. The socialists properly so
                    called were only a small minority. In this address, however, Marx and his
                    associates made themselves morally <hi rend="italic">solidaire</hi> with the
                    commune. They saw in it a great rising against the existing conditions of the
                    Parisian proletariat, which only partially saw the way of deliverance, but was
                    tired of oppression and full of just indignation against the tyrannous upper
                    classes, that controlled the central government of France. This address, if it
                    tended to increase the prestige of the International, greatly reduced its real
                    influence. Its last meeting as controlled by Marx took place at The Hague in
                    1872. The chief himself was present, and succeeded in casting out the anarchist
                    following of Bakunin; but it was the expiring effort. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >International.</hi></p>
                <p>This loss of influence by Marx was in the meantime more than compensated by his
                    success in gaining control over the social democracy of Germany. Of the
                    workmen’s unions which had grown so rapidly in Germany in the years following
                    1860, and which had first been patronized by the Progressist party, some had
                    attached themselves to the national socialism of Lassalle, but many held aloof
                    from that movement, and under the influence of Liebknecht and Bebel were
                    gradually drawn over to the views of Marx. At Lassalle’s death in 1864 his
                    “general working-men’s union of Germany” numbered only 4610 members. After
                    losing its founder the union had a changeful and somewhat precarious career for
                    a time; and it was only under the presidency of Von Schweitzer, which lasted for
                    four years<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0230-0215"/> (1867-1871), that it began moderately to
                    flourish. In the meantime the adverse party also made considerable progress. The
                    confederation of German unions, which was founded in 1863, declared in 1865 for
                    universal suffrage, pronounced against the Schulze-Delitzsch schemes in 1866,
                    and in the congress at Nuremberg of 1868 by a large majority declared their
                    adhesion to the International. In a great congress at Eisenach in 1869 they
                    founded the “social democratic working-men’s party,” and in the same year sent
                    representatives to the International congress at Basel. Great efforts were made
                    for a fusion of the Eisenach and the Lassalle party, and this was effected in a
                    congress at Gotha (May 1875). At this congress 25,000 regular members were
                    represented, of whom 9000 belonged to the Marx party and 15,000 to that of
                    Lassalle. The united body assumed the name of the “socialistic working-men’s
                    party of Germany,” and drew up a programme, which, as the most important
                    manifesto hitherto published by any socialist body, deserves to be given
                    entire.</p>
                <p>I. Labour is the source of all wealth and all culture, and as useful work in
                    general is possible only through society, so to society— that is, to all its
                    members—belongs the entire product of labour by an equal right, to each one
                    according to his reasonable wants,—all being bound to work.</p>
                <p>In the existing society the instruments of labour are a monopoly of the
                    capitalist class; the subjection of the working class thus arising is the cause
                    of misery and servitude in every form.</p>
                <p>The emancipation of the working class demands the transformation of the
                    instruments of labour into the common property of society and the co-operative
                    control of the total labour, with application of the product of labour to the
                    common good, and just distribution of the same.</p>
                <p>The emancipation of labour must be the work of the labouring class, in contrast
                    to which all other classes are only a reactionary mass.</p>
                <p>II. Proceeding from these principles, the socialistic working-men’s party of
                    Germany aims by all legal means at the establishment of the free state and the
                    socialistic society, to destroy the iron law of wages by abolishing the system
                    of wage-labour, to put a term to exploitation in every form, to remove all
                    social and political inequality.</p>
                <p>The socialistic working-men’s party of Germany, though working first of all
                    within the national limits, is conscious of the international character of the
                    labour movement, and resolved to fulfil all duties which this imposes on the
                    workmen, in order to realize the universal brotherhood of men.</p>
                <p>In order to prepare the way for the solution of the social question, the
                    socialistic working-men’s party of Germany demands the establishment of
                    socialistic productive associations with state help under the democratic control
                    of the labouring people. The productive associations are to be founded on such a
                    scale both for industry and agriculture that out of them may develop the
                    socialistic organization of the total labour.</p>
                <p>The socialistic working-men’s party demands as bases of the state — (1)
                    universal, equal, and direct right of electing and voting, with secret and
                    obligatory voting, of all citizens from twenty years of age for all elections
                    and deliberations in the state and local bodies; the day of election or voting
                    must be a Sunday or holiday; (2) direct legislation by the people; questions of
                    war and peace to be decided by the people; (3) universal military duty; a
                    people’s army in place of the standing armies; (4) abolition of all exceptional
                    laws, especially as regards the press, unions, and meetings, and generally of
                    all laws which restrict freedom of thought and inquiry; (5) administration of
                    justice by the people; free justice; (6) universal and equal education by the
                    state; compulsory education; free education in all public places of instruction;
                    religion declared to be a private concern.</p>
                <p>Within the existing society the socialistic working-men’s party of Germany
                    demands—(1) greatest possible extension of political rights and liberties in the
                    sense of the above demands; (2) a single progressive income-tax for state and
                    local purposes, instead of the existing taxes, and especially of the indirect
                    taxes that oppress the people; (3) unrestricted right of combination; (4) a
                    normal working-day corresponding to the needs of society; prohibition of Sunday
                    labour; (5) prohibition of labour of children, and of all women’s work injurious
                    to health and morality; (6) laws for the protection of the life and health of
                    workmen; sanitary control of workmen’s dwellings; inspection of mines, of
                    factories, workshops, and house-labour, by officials chosen by the workmen; an
                    effective employers’ liability Act; (7) regulation of prison labour; (8)
                    workmen’s funds to be under the entire control of the workmen.</p>
                <p>By this time the socialism of Germany began to be a power, which was calculated
                    to excite grave alarm among the ruling classes. The social democrats had
                    returned five members to the North German diet in 1867. For the German diet in
                    1871 they had counted only 120,000 votes, and returned two members; but in 1877
                    they had returned twelve members and polled nearly half a million. In Berlin the
                    socialist voting strength had risen from 6695 in 1871 to 57,511 in 1878,—an
                    increase which was all the more remarkable that Lassalle could hardly obtain a
                    hearing in the capital when he commenced his career. A much more significant
                    feature of the movement was the admirable state of organization to which the
                    socialist propaganda had attained. A large number of skilful, intelligent, and
                    energetic agitators spread their doctrines throughout Germany; a whole machinery
                    of newspapers, pamphlets, treatises, social gatherings, and even almanacs
                    diffused the new creed. In all the great centres of population, in Berlin,
                    Hamburg, and the industrial towns in Saxony and on the Rhine, the socialists
                    were rapidly tending to become the strongest party. The Government accordingly
                    intervened with exceptional legislation, which in 1878 was carried during the
                    excitement occasioned by the attempts on the emperor’s life of Hödel and
                    Nobeling. These exceptional laws, though administered with great rigour, have
                    not by any means succeeded in arresting the progress of the movement, as at the
                    election to the Reichstag in 1884 the socialists polled about 600,000 votes and
                    returned twenty-four members. Berlin alone counted 68,000 socialist voters. In
                    the last report relating to the anti-socialist law laid before the Reichstag
                    (1885) the continued progress of the party is admitted.</p>
                <p>The participation of the Catholic Church of Germany in the social question dates
                    from the period of the Lassalle agitation. In 1863 Döllinger recommended that
                    the church should intervene in the movement, and Bishop von Ketteler of Mainz
                    lost no time in expressing sympathy with Lassalle. In a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christenthum</hi> (1864) Ketteler
                    criticizes the liberalism of the Manchester school in substantially the same
                    terms as Lassalle, and recommends the voluntary formation of productive
                    associations with capital supplied by the faithful. In 1868 the Catholic
                    socialism of Germany took a more practical form: it started an organ of its own
                    and began to organize unions for the elevation of the working men. The
                    principles of the movement have been with some precision expounded by Canon
                    Moufang in an electoral address at Mainz (1871), and by the writers in their
                    organ. All agree in condemning the principles of liberalism, especially in its
                    economic aspects, as destructive of society and pernicious to the working-man,
                    who, under the pretence of freedom, is exposed to all the precariousness and
                    anarchy of competition and sacrificed to the iron law of wages. Self-help as
                    practised in the Schulze-Delitzsch schemes is also considered to be no sure way
                    of deliverance. This general remedy is union on Catholic principles, especially
                    the formation of trade guilds suited to modern exigencies, which some of their
                    leaders would make a compulsory measure enforced by the state. The views of
                    Moufang, which are most definite, may be thus summarized: legal protection for
                    the workers, especially as regards hours of labour, wages, the labour of women
                    and children, sanitation; subventions for workmen’s productive associations;
                    lightening of taxes on labour; control of the moneyed and speculating interests.
                    In the organization of unions the success of Catholic socialism has been great;
                    and the social democrats admit that they can make no progress in Catholic
                    districts where the church has developed its social activity.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0231-0216"/> the movement is a work by Pastor Todt entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Der radikale deutsche Socialismus und die christliche
                    Gesellschaft.</hi> In this work Todt condemns the economics of liberalism as
                    unchristian, and seeks to show that the ideals of liberty, equality, and
                    fraternity are entirely Scriptural, as are also the socialist demands for the
                    abolition of private property and of the wage system, that the labourer should
                    have the full produce of his labour, and that labour should be associated. The
                    chief leader of the movement is the court preacher Stöcker, the head also of the
                    anti-Semitic agitation, which is largely traceable to economic causes. Stöcker
                    founded two associations,—a central union for social reform, consisting of
                    members of the middle classes interested in the emancipation of labour, and a
                    Christian social working-men’s party. The former has had considerable success,
                    especially among the Lutheran clergy. The movement has met with the most
                    strenuous resistance from the social democratic party and has been greatly
                    hampered by the anti-socialist law of 1878.</p>
                <p>Little can here be said of the state socialism of Bismarck, —a very recent
                    movement, which has not yet had time to pass into history. Its leading
                    principles were announced in an imperial message to the Reichstag in November
                    1881. Besides the repressive measures necessary to restrain the excesses of the
                    social democracy, the emperor declared that the healing of social evils was to
                    be sought in positive measures for the good of the working man. The measures
                    proposed were for the insurance of the workmen against accident, sickness, old
                    age, and inability to work by arrangements under state control. “The finding of
                    the right ways and means for this state protection of the working man is a
                    difficult task, but also one of the highest that concern every society standing
                    on the ethical foundations of the Christian national life.” The message then
                    proceeds to speak of measures for “organizing the life of the people in the form
                    of corporative associations under the protection and furtherance of the
                    state,”—a clause which might be taken as an admission of the collectivist
                    principle. As yet the imperial programme has only been partially realized. It
                    will be obvious that such measures can be rightly appreciated only with
                    reference to the general theory and practice of Prussian government.</p>
                <p>The acknowledged father of anarchism is <hi rend="smallcaps">Proudhon</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) <hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi> but the doctrine owes its
                    development chiefly to Russian thinkers who had been trained in the Hegelian
                    left. The great apostle of the system in its advanced and most characteristic
                    stage was Michael Bakunin. Bakunin was sprung from the highest Russian
                    aristocracy, and was born at Torshok, in the government of Tver, in 1814.
                    Leaving the army, in which he served for some time, he visited western Europe,
                    chiefly Paris, where he met George Sand and Proudhon in 1847. For his share in
                    the German disturbances of 1849 he was imprisoned in Russia for several years
                    and then sent to Siberia, from which he escaped, and spent the rest of his life
                    in exile in western Europe, principally in Switzerland. In 1869 he founded the
                    Social Democratic Alliance, which, however, dissolved in the same year and
                    entered the International. In 1870 he attempted a rising at Lyons on the
                    principles afterwards exemplified by the Paris commune. At The Hague congress of
                    the International in 1872 he was outvoted and expelled by the Marx party.
                    Bakunin’s activity was most remarkable as an agitator. The international
                    socialism of the Romance countries, especially that of Spain and Italy, has been
                    largely moulded by him. He died at Bern in 1876. Nothing can be clearer or more
                    frank and comprehensive in its destructiveness than the socialism of Bakunin. It
                    is revolutionary socialism based on materialism and aiming at the destruction of
                    external authority by every available means. He rejects all the ideal systems in
                    every name and shape, from the idea of God downwards; and he rejects every form
                    of external authority, whether emanating from the will of a sovereign or from
                    universal suffrage. “The liberty of man,” he says in his <hi rend="italic">Dieu
                    et L’État,</hi> “consists solely in this, that he obey the laws of nature,
                    because he has himself recognized them as such, and not because they have been
                    imposed upon him externally by any foreign will whatsoever, human or divine,
                    collective or individual.” In this way will the whole problem of freedom be
                    solved: that natural laws be ascertained by scientific discovery, and the
                    knowledge of them be universally diffused among the masses. Natural laws being
                    thus recognized by every man for himself, he cannot but obey them, for they are
                    the laws also of his own nature; and the need for political organization,
                    administration, and legislation will at once disappear. Nor will he admit of any
                    privileged position or class, for “it is the peculiarity of privilege and of
                    every privileged position to kill the intellect and heart of man. The privileged
                    man, whether he be privileged politically or economically, is a man depraved in
                    intellect and heart.” “In a word, we object to all legislation, all authority,
                    and all influence, privileged, patented, official, and legal, even when it has
                    proceeded from universal suffrage, convinced that it must always turn to the
                    profit of a dominating and exploiting minority, against the interests of the
                    immense majority enslaved.” The anarchy of Bakunin is therefore essentially the
                    same as that of Proudhon, but expressed without paradox, and with a destructive
                    revolutionary energy which has seldom been equalled in history. What they both
                    contemplate is a condition of human enlightenment and self-control in which the
                    individual shall be a law to himself, and in which all external authority shall
                    be abolished as a despotic interference with personal freedom. It is an ideal to
                    which the highest religion and philosophy look forward as the goal of man, not
                    as one, however, which can be forthwith reached through the wholesale
                    destruction of the present framework of society, but through a long process of
                    ethical and social improvement. The error of the anarchists consists in their
                    impatient insistence on this proclamation of absolute freedom in the present
                    debased condition of the great mass of the people in every class. They insist on
                    taking the last step in social development before they have quite taken the
                    first. The other leading principles of anarchism will be best understood from
                    the following extracts taken from the programme of the International Social
                    Democratic Alliance. The Alliance demands above all things the definitive and
                    complete abolition of classes, and political, economic, and social equality of
                    individuals and sexes, and abolition of inheritance, so that in the future every
                    man may enjoy a like share in the produce of labour; that land and soil,
                    instruments of labour, and all other capital, becoming the common property of
                    the whole society, may be used only by the workers, that is, by associations of
                    cultivators and industrialists. It looks forward to the final solution of the
                    social question through the universal and international solidarity of the
                    workers of all countries, and condemns every policy grounded on so-called
                    patriotism and national jealousy. It demands the universal federation of all
                    local associations through the principle of freedom. Bakunin’s methods of
                    realizing his revolutionary programme are not less frank and destructive than
                    his principles. The revolutionist, as he would recommend him to be, is a
                    consecrated man, who will allow no private interests or feelings, and no
                    scruples of religion, patriotism, or morality, to turn him aside from his
                    mission, the aim of which is by all available means to overturn the existing
                    society. His work is merciless and universal<pb break="no"

                    doubtless proceed out of the movement and life of the people, but it is the
                    concern of coming generations. In the meantime all that Bakunin enables us to
                    see as promise of future reconstruction is the free federation of free
                    associations,— associations of which we find the type in the Russian
                    commune.</p>
                <p>Bakunin, as we have seen, has had great influence on the socialism of the Romance
                    countries. The important risings in Spain in 1873 were due to his activity; and
                    the socialism of Italy has been largely inspired by him. In those countries, as
                    well as in France and French Switzerland, anarchist doctrines of the same
                    general type as that of Bakunin are still in vogue, and are advocated by men of
                    mark in literature and science like Kropotkine and Elisée Reclus. The views of
                    the propaganda which they represent were most clearly and distinctly brought out
                    during the great anarchist trial at Lyons in 1883. What they aim at is the most
                    absolute freedom, the most complete satisfaction of human wants, without other
                    limit than the impossibilities of nature and the wants of their neighbours
                    equally worthy of respect. They object to all authority and all government on
                    principle, and in all human relations would in place of legal and administrative
                    control substitute free contract, perpetually subject to revision and
                    cancelment. But, as no freedom is possible in a society where capital is
                    monopolized by a diminishing minority, they believe that capital, the common
                    inheritance of humanity, since it is the fruit of the co-operation of past and
                    present generations, ought to be at the disposal of all, so that no man be
                    excluded from it, and no man seize part of it to the detriment of the rest. In a
                    word, they wish equality, equality of fact, as corollary or rather as primordial
                    condition of freedom. From each one according to his faculties; to each one
                    according to his needs. They demand bread for all, science for all, work for
                    all; <hi rend="italic">for</hi> all, too, independence and justice. Even a
                    government based on universal suffrage gives them no scope for effective action
                    in the deliverance of the poor, as they maintain that of the eight million
                    electors of France only some half a million are in a position to give a free
                    vote. In such a state of affairs, and in view of the continued misery and
                    degradation of the proletariat, they proclaim the sacred right of insurrection

                <p>It is an interesting fact that socialism has taken its most aggressive form in
                    that European country whose civilization is most recent. The revolutionary
                    opinions of Russia are not the growth of the soil, and are not the natural and
                    normal outcome of its own social development: they have been imported from
                    abroad. Falling on youthful and enthusiastic temperaments which had not
                    previously been inoculated with the principle of innovation, the new ideas have
                    broken forth with an irrepressible and uncompromising vigour which has
                    astonished the older nations of Europe. Another peculiarity of the situation is
                    that the Government is an autocracy served or controlled by a camarilla largely
                    foreign both in origin and sympathy. In this case, then, we have a revolutionary
                    party inspired by the socialism of western Europe fighting against a Government
                    which is also in many ways an exotic and is not rooted in the mass of the
                    people. The chief support of the Government is to be found in the reverence of
                    the peasantry for the person and office of the czar, while the nihilists look
                    upon the communal institutions of the country as their great ground of hope.
                    Considered as a national movement, three distinct stages are recognized in the
                    phenomena called Russian nihilism. In its first stage it was a speculative and
                    anti-religious tendency, destructive of all orthodox tradition and authority. It
                    was the spirit of the Hegelian left frankly accepting the materialism of</p>
                <p>Büchner and Moleschott as the final deliverance of philosophy; and the time was
                    the early years of Alexander II., when the old despotic restraints were so
                    largely removed,— a period of reform and innovation and comparative freedom. In
                    a country where religion had little influence among the educated classes, and
                    where philosophy was not a slow and gradual growth of the native mind, but a
                    fashion imported from abroad, the most destructive materialism found an easy
                    conquest. It was the prevalent form among the advanced thinkers; it was clear,
                    simple, and thorough; and it suited well the anti-religious mood of the time. By
                    the side of this negative speculation, however, the Russian youth became aware
                    of a new creed, destructive also in its beginnings, but full of the positive
                    promise of future reconstruction and regeneration,—socialism. Here they saw the
                    struggle of the proletariat, so terribly conspicuous in the Paris commune, 1hich
                    attracted universal attention in 1871, a proletariat represented in Russia by a
                    nation of peasantry sunk in immemorial ignorance and wretchedness. At this
                    period hundreds of young Russians of both sexes were studying in western Europe,
                    especially in Switzerland. In 1873 they were by an imperial ukaze recalled home,
                    but they carried the new ideas with them. The period of speculation was
                    succeeded by a period of socialist propaganda, which naturally met with
                    implacable opposition and merciless repression from the Government. As they
                    received no mercy, the nihilists determined to show none; and in 1878 began the
                    terrible duel of the Russian revolutionists against the autocracy and its
                    servants, which culminated in the violent death of Alexander II. in 1881.</p>
                <p>How far we are to regard the revolutionary movement of Russia as cognate in
                    principle with anarchism is not easy to determine. In despotic countries, where
                    constitutional reform and opposition to government are not tolerated, resolute
                    innovators are naturally driven to secret conspiracy and to violent action. What
                    distinguishes the Russian revolutionary party from other movements of a like
                    nature is the intensity of the enthusiastic devotion and selfsacrifice with
                    which they have braved death, imprisonment, exile, and privation in every form
                    and the calculating skill with which they have called the resources of modern
                    chemistry to their aid. There is no doubt that the doctrines of men like Bakunin
                    have had great influence on Russian socialism; but so have the writings of Marx,
                    as also of J. S. Mill and other advanced thinkers, who have no connexion with
                    anarchism. It is certain that the leaders of the revolutionary party resorted to
                    violent measures only after their peaceful propaganda was being ruthlessly
                    suppressed. With regard to political reform many of their leaders have declared
                    that they would be satisfied with constitutionalism. In the address sent to the
                    emperor Alexander III. after the death of his father in March 1881, the
                    executive committee of the revolutionary party offered to submit unconditionally
                    to a national assembly duly elected by the people. In this recognition of
                    constitutionalism, as well as in the strongly centralized organization of their
                    executive, the Russian revolutionary party are essentially at variance with
                    anarchism. In economics they advocate a thoroughgoing collectivism.</p>
                <p>We have now given a brief outline of the various forms of socialism as they have
                    historically appeared. It may be useful to group them as accurately and clearly
                    as possible. (1) Experiments in socialism conducted by private initiative, as
                    carried on in the schools of Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen; not that they
                    objected to state help, but that, in point of fact, their efforts were conducted
                    by private means. (2) Productive associations with state help: the programme of
                    economic change favoured by Louis Blanc and Lassalle. (3) The Marx school of
                    socialism, scientific and revolutionary, beyond all comparison the most im<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0233-0218"/> portant and most influential of all forms of
                    socialism. (4) Anarchism. (5) Nihilism. (6) Christian socialism; inasmuch as the
                    various phases of Christian socialism condemn the principle of competition as
                    operating in modern industry, and favour the organization of labour on united
                    principles, and especially of productive associations with a common capital and
                    an equitable system of distribution, they must be regarded as true forms of
                    socialism. (7) To these should be added the speculative socialism of which
                    Rodbertus is the most remarkable example; recognizing the fundamental evils of
                    the present system and agreeing with the Marx school in holding that socialism
                    is the next stage in social evolution, Rodbertus believed that the period of its
                    realization is so remote that any decidedly practical effort towards that end is
                    inapplicable; hence he could only recommend transitional remedial measures,
                    which will at least circumscribe the mischief inherent in the present economic
                    order and also pave the way towards a better state. (8) And last of all may be
                    added the various forms of state socialism, which are all examples of state
                    action on behalf of the poor, especially of the use of the public resources for
                    that purpose. The word “socialism” is very frequently used in this sense. As the
                    continued use of the word in such a way is almost a certainty, this phase of the
                    subject must be recognized here. It may be described as socialistic inasmuch as
                    it fully admits the responsibility of society for all its members; but in many
                    respects its tendencies are opposed to true socialism. It is a vague movement
                    which has not yet had time to take shape, and cannot be discussed here.
                    “Socialism of the chair” has already been discussed under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Political Economy,</hi> vol. xix. p. 393.</p>
                <p>The above classification can of course pretend only to be a rough and general
                    one. The various heads of the classification are not exclusive. The first
                    variety has chiefly an historical interest. The American communities (discussed
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Communism)</hi> are really cases of the old crude
                    communism. Productive associations with state help stand on the Gotha programme
                    of the social democrats of Germany. They are recommended by Christian
                    socialists, both Catholic and Protestant, and they form an important item in the
                    programme of the “knights of labour” of America. The resemblance in type between
                    the “community” of Owen, the <hi rend="italic">phalange</hi> of Fourier, the <hi
                    rend="italic">mir</hi> or commune of Russia, and the free commune of Bakunin is
                    apparent. It is the social unit as determined by obvious economic, local, and
                    historical conditions, and in socialism naturally becomes the point of departure
                    for a new construction of society. It will have been noted that most of the
                    important phases of socialism have been and are international in sympathy and
                    activity. The Marx socialism is spreading in nearly every country of the
                    civilized world, the doctrine being diffused by energetic agitators, and not
                    seldom by men of philosophic and literary culture. In late years this is true
                    both of France and England. It is well known how active anarchism has been. The
                    Christian socialist movement is more or less operative in Belgium, France,
                    Germany, Austria, and to some extent in England.</p>
                <p>In this article our aim has been to give an expository and historical account of
                    the various phases of socialism. It is impossible even to refer to all the
                    different questions suggested in our sketch; and to discuss the relations of
                    antagonism and affinity between socialism and the prevailing social and economic
                    ideas and institutions would require a long and elaborate treatise. In the
                    course of the article many obvious points of relationship, and particularly of
                    contrast, between socialism and political economy have presented themselves. All
                    that we can now do is to emphasize a few of the more important of these. The
                    scope of the current political economy of Great Britain may be broadly defined
                    as follows :—given the existing arrangements with regard to land, capital, and
                    labour, to determine the economic phenomena and the economic laws that will
                    prevail under a system of free individual competition. As we have abundantly
                    seen, socialism is diametrically opposed to the permanent continuance of these
                    arrangements. It looks forward to the time when the present system of individual
                    property in land and capital served by wage-labour will pass away, and when free
                    competition on that basis will cease with the system of which it is a part. It
                    regards the present economic order with the laws and conditions peculiar to it
                    as a passing phase in the historic evolution of mankind, with no greater claim
                    to permanence or finality than other historic eras which have had their day.
                    What enlightened socialism above all demands is that an unprejudiced science
                    should endeavour to distinguish between such economic laws as are permanently
                    grounded in the nature of man and his environment and such as have their
                    validity only in the existing economic order, between such as are enduringly
                    founded on nature and such as are only the accidents or temporary manifestations
                    of a changing civilization. Socialists appeal to history to prove that what the
                    orthodox economy considered the natural and normal order of things, with its
                    distribution of wealth under the three categories of rent, profit, and wages, is
                    really an exceptional phenomenon limited both in extent and duration. It is
                    therefore an obvious error to speak of socialism as roundly controverting
                    economic law. It is no business of socialism to controvert a law grounded in
                    nature, such as the physiological basis of the law of population; but it denies
                    the applicability of the Malthusian precept under the present condition, when
                    wealth is superabundant, but badly distributed owing to causes for which neither
                    nature nor science, but human selfishness and ignorance are responsible. Nor
                    does it lie in the principles of socialism to question the validity of those
                    special economic laws that hold good under the present economic order. Some of
                    these, such as the iron law of wages, socialism is disposed rather to accentuate
                    unduly as a necessity of the present system. It is the aim of socialism to
                    abolish the conditions under which such laws have their validity. Socialists
                    object to the present economic order <hi rend="italic">because</hi> of the
                    necessity of results which are opposed to human wellbeing. They object entirely
                    to the existing order with its distribution of the produce of labour into the
                    three categories of rent, profit, and wages, because on it are founded class
                    distinctions, with the consequent antagonism of classes, and the subjection and
                    degradation of the lower classes,—holding that economic subjection involves all
                    other forms of subjection and degradation. In short, scientific socialism as
                    represented by Marx and Friedrich Engels appeals against the existing economic
                    order, of which the orthodox political economy is an exposition and for which it
                    is so frequently an apology, to the higher laws and principles of social
                    evolution as determined by the nature of man in relation to the environment in
                    which he lives and develops.</p>
                <p>There is no space here to trace historically the influence of political economy
                    in the genesis of socialism, nor that of socialism on the recent political
                    economy. It has naturally been the tendency of socialism to emphasize the idea
                    of the worth and significance of labour, so prominent in the school of Adam
                    Smith. This was one of the most valuable features of the Saint-Simon school,
                    otherwise so much disfigured with utopianism and extravagance. As we have seen,
                    the socialism of Marx is in some of its most important aspects a development of
                    Ricardian principles. Turning to the influence of socialism on political
                    economists, we need but refer to that exercised by French socialism<pb

                    rend="italic">Autobiography.</hi> The economics of Germany has for the last
                    fifteen years been most powerfully affected by the theories of Lassalle, Marx,
                    and latterly also of Rodbertus. The causes which have produced socialism have
                    also affected economics; but a large part of the change is due directly to the
                    teaching of the socialists, especially of Marx, whose great work is recognized
                    as of the first importance. Without commanding assent to its leading
                    conclusions, socialism has given a new direction to most of the recent
                    Continental research in political economy. The German “socialism of the chair,”
                    the influence of which is by no means confined to the country that produced it,
                    is sufficient evidence of this.</p>
                <p>As we have already seen, Marx and his school accept in the completest form the
                    doctrine of evolution, which they learned first in Hegel, but finally hold as
                    taught by Darwin; and, in common with most socialists, from Saint-Simon
                    downwards, they recognize three stages in the economic development of
                    society,—slavery, serfdom, and wage-labour, —which last they believe will be
                    displaced by an era of associated labour with a collective capital. But how, it
                    is asked, does this theory of socialism as the next goal of society consist with
                    the Darwinian doctrine of the struggle for existence and the survival of the
                    fittest? Is not competition, this <hi rend="italic">bête noire</hi> of the
                    socialists, simply the social and economic form of the struggle for existence?
                    Is not competition, therefore, the very condition of social progress? Is not
                    socialism, therefore, inconsistent with progress? The question suggested is a
                    large and complicated one, to which we cannot here pretend to give an exhaustive
                    or determinate answer, but can only indicate some of the main lines of
                    discussion. (1) In all periods of human development, and especially in its
                    higher stages, progress consists most essentially in a growing social and
                    ethical virtue and in the cultivation of the beautiful both in sentiment and
                    art. With such an enlarging ideal of progress, how harmonize a system of
                    competition like the present, by which millions in every great European country
                    are effectively deprived of the means of development, and even of bare
                    livelihood? The struggle for existence has always been modified by social and
                    ethical conditions. If it is to continue, as it will in various forms, it should
                    be carried on under higher conditions, suitable to a higher and less animal
                    stage in the evolution of man. (2) Human progress has undoubtedly been attained
                    through struggle, especially through the struggle for existence; but the
                    struggle has essentially been one of men united in society, of tribe against
                    tribe, of city against city, of nation against nation, and race against race.
                    Thus it is easy to exaggerate unduly the importance of the struggle of the
                    individual man. History has only too often seen the abnormal development of
                    private selfishness, so overgrown as to weaken, and finally dissolve and
                    overthrow, the society in which it acted, thereby accomplishing its own
                    destruction. This is indeed the open secret of the ruin of most of the
                    communities that have existed. In short, a happy and healthy individual
                    development can be secured only through its due subordination to social virtue
                    and the general welfare. Human progress has been by strong societies with a
                    Well-developed social and public virtue. The excessive development of
                    “individualism” within a society has been its weakness and ruin. (3) While
                    emphasizing the extreme importance of the hereditary principle, especially as
                    connected with the fundamental institution of the family, we should also
                    recognize its tendency to abuse in perpetuating the enormous inequalities of
                    property and condition, many of which originated in a less perfect system of
                    society. The hereditary principle has indeed greatly contributed to the solidity
                    and continuity of the social order; but it also gives an exceptional advantage
                    in the struggle for existence to the privileged few. In this point, therefore,
                    the present system does not best fulfil the requirements of the evolution theory
                    as applied to society. The struggle is not one of merit. It is frequently one of
                    merit against hereditary privilege; not seldom it is one of privilege against
                    privilege without regard to merit at all. (4) In considering the possibilities
                    of human progress afforded by the present system of society in the light of the
                    evolution theory, it is impossible to ignore the fact that the continuance of
                    the race depends most on the less fit members of society, on the lower strata,
                    which are thriftless, the worst fed, and worst educated. While the classes which
                    are most intelligent and endowed with self-control abstain from marriage or
                    defer it, those who have the lowest organization marry early and have large
                    families. Even to perpetuate disease and deformity is not considered wrong. It
                    may be that prohibitory and restrictive laws, even if passed, would prove
                    inoperative and ineffectual in restraining so many hasty and ill-considered
                    unions that only serve to multiply misery and disease; but it is surely
                    excusable at least to inquire whether this abuse of freedom could not be
                    curtailed by strengthening the social union and increasing the pressure of the
                    enlightenment and moral sense of the community. (5) Above all, as the tendency
                    of the present order is to give the victory to cheapness, it may be asked
                    whether competition,—the economic form of the struggle for existence—is really
                    such a sure and potent element of progress, unless most powerfully counteracted
                    by other principles? In short, history is the resultant of many complex forces,
                    and it is easy to push too far the formulae of any system. It is out of the
                    balance and harmony of many principles, of which the struggle for existence is
                    but one, that human progress can proceed. (6) The main point is that in social
                    evolution the widest phase of the struggle for existence is between forms of
                    social organization. Hence the great question as regards socialism is whether it
                    is the fittest form of social organization for the time coming? Is it best
                    adapted to carry forward and develop in wider and more adequate form the
                    progressive life of the future?</p>
                <p>While many socialists have announced lax views regarding marriage and the family,
                    it cannot in view of popular misunderstanding be sufficiently emphasized that
                    the essence of socialism is an economic change. It enunciates no special
                    doctrine on the relation of the sexes. In common with other social reformers,
                    socialists generally advocate the equality of the sexes and the emancipation of
                    women; they object to the mercenary element so common in marriage; and they
                    abhor prostitution as one of the worst and vilest of existing evils, believing,
                    moreover, that it is a necessary result of the present distinction of classes
                    and of the unequal distribution of wealth. The views of the anarchists have
                    already been noted. In the Marx school there is a tendency to denounce the
                    legally binding contract in marriage. But such views all belong to the accidents
                    of socialism.</p>
                <p>So with regard to religion. Socialism has been and still is very frequently
                    associated with irreligion and atheism. The same remark applies to Continental
                    liberalism, and partly for a like reason: the absolute Governments of the
                    Continent have taken the existing forms of religion into their service and have
                    repressed religious freedom. On religion as on marriage socialism has no special
                    teaching. While the anarchists of the school of Bakunin would overturn all forms
                    of religion and reject the idea of God, the social democrats of Germany in their
                    Gotha programme of 1875 declare religion to be a private concern. As we have
                    seen, Christian socialism is a considerable force in many European countries;
                    and in many of the other schools, especially that of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n235/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0235-0220"/> Louis Blanc, the kinship and even identity of
                    ethical spirit with that of Christianity are unmistakable.</p>
                <p>In their revolutionary impatience the anarchists have avowed their hostility to
                    all the existing political forms except the free commune, which alone will be
                    left standing amid the general wreck they contemplate. The Marx school, as
                    represented by its ablest living exponent, Friedrich Engels, also look forward
                    to a period in the evolution of society when the state will become superfluous,
                    and, having no longer any function to perform, will die away. The state they
                    regard as an exploiting institution, an organization of the ruling classes for
                    retaining the workers in economic subjection. The International was an attempt
                    to supersede the exploiting states by a combination of the workers of all
                    countries without distinction of creed, colour, or nationality. When the workers
                    in the name of the whole society seize political power and take over the control
                    of production, the rule of classes, their conflicts and the excesses of the
                    struggle for existence among them, will cease. Instead of a government over
                    persons we shall have an administration of things and the control of productive
                    processes. Obviously the Marx school reserve the realization of this idea till
                    the evolution of society has prepared the way for it. In the conduct of the
                    International they insisted on a strongly centralized form of organization as
                    against the free federalism and the rejection of all authority maintained by
                    Bakunin and his followers. This opposition between centralization and federalism
                    does not concern us here; it is a question common to theoretical and practical
                    politics. It is necessary, however, to say a word about the opposition between
                    the national tendency of the Lassalle school and the international socialism of
                    Marx. As we have seen, a compromise was effected in the Gotha programme of 1875,
                    in which the importance of the nation as an existing form of human society is
                    amply recognized. The question is still discussed in the organs of the social
                    democrats; but the international tendency is decidedly the prevalent one. “Want
                    of patriotism” is one of the current epithets of reproach cast at them. It is
                    needless to point out that as most new movements of importance have been
                    revolutionary, so also have they for good or evil been international. In
                    becoming international the labour movement has only followed the example set by
                    commerce, finance, diplomacy, religion, philosophy, art, music.</p>
                <p>We have now reviewed the most important aspects of the socialist movement. As we
                    have seen, socialism is a new form of social organization, based on a
                    fundamental change in the economic order of society. Socialists believe that the
                    present economic order, in which industry is carried on by private competitive
                    capital, must and ought to pass away, and that the normal economic order of the
                    future will be one with collective means of production and associated labour
                    working for the general good. This principle of socialism is cardinal and
                    fundamental. All the other theories so often connected with it and so important
                    in relation to religion, philosophy, marriage, patriotism, &amp;c., are with
                    regard to socialism non-essential. Questions of method, though supremely
                    important, must also be distinguished from the essential principle. At the same
                    time it will be seen that an economic change, such as that contemplated in
                    socialism, would most powerfully affect every other department of human life.
                    Socialism, in short, means that in industry, in the economic arrangements of
                    society, the collective or co-operative principle shall become normal or
                    universal, that all who are able should contribute to the service of society,
                    and that all should share in the fruits of the associated labour according to
                    some good and equitable principle. In such a condition of things the noblest
                    field for ambition will be in the service of society,—an ideal which is already
                    partially realized in the democratic state. It is in this fundamental sense that
                    J. S. Mill declared himself a socialist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    first living authorities on economics and sociology, has, after long years of
                    study of the subject, come to the conclusion that “the future belongs to the
                    purified socialism.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Scientific socialists strongly insist that this economic order of the future
                    cannot be realized by utopian schemes or arbitrary legislation or mere
                    revolutionary disturbance. If it come at all, it must come as the consummation
                    of the dominant tendencies of modern social development; it must be realized
                    under the conditions prescribed by our nature and environment. In discussing the
                    doctrines of Marx we stated that the central point of the question was this—do
                    the strongest forces of the social development of our time really tend towards
                    the superseding of the present economic order and towards the establishment of a
                    new and wider order based on collective capital and associated labour?
                    Socialists maintain that they do, and that there is at present going forward a
                    double process of dissolution and reconstruction,—the dissolution of
                    individualism with a constructive tendency towards collectivism. From the
                    socialist point of view the following may be signalized as indicative of such a
                    process. (1) The tendency towards economic anarchy already explained in treating
                    of Marx’s views. Over the whole industrial world we see great crises succeeding
                    each other, resulting in stagnation and depression which now threaten to be
                    chronic and permanent. While the productive forces of the world are enormously
                    increasing, they only tend the more to intensify national and international
                    competition, and to render labour superfluous, precarious, and dependent. Under
                    this system the worker has neither freedom nor security. All this variety of
                    symptoms are only a sign of the break-down of the present economic order both in
                    principle and method. They are the necessary results of the competitive system,
                    which has thus finally revealed its real nature and tendency, —economic and
                    social anarchy. (2) The constant and inevitable tendency towards concentration
                    in industrial operations, which began with the introduction of steam and of the
                    factory system, through which the small producer has been superseded by the
                    capitalist, the smaller capitalist by the larger. And now the single capitalist
                    is being absorbed in the company, a growing proportion of the world’s business
                    being so large that only a great company can provide the requisite capital and
                    organization; whilst in the large companies there is a tendency, in case they
                    cannot drive each other out of the field, to bring about a fusion of interests.
                    In all this we see a great constructive process inevitably going on as the
                    result of the inherent tendencies of industrial development. Thus the control of
                    industry will be concentrated in a few colossal companies and their chiefs. It
                    is obvious how this process could simplify the transference of the whole to a
                    collective management by society. (3) This leads us to a third important point,
                    the growing tendency towards state control of industry, and the growing sense of
                    the responsibility of society for all its members, observable in German
                    politics, not less than under the more democratic conditions of France and
                    England. It is apparent how under this influence the existing state might absorb
                    one by one all the large social functions, as has already happened with regard
                    to education, means of communication, &amp;c. Naturally this could be
                    accomplished only through a most comprehensive development of local and
                    subordinate bodies of every kind. Socialism by no means implies that such an
                    enormous burden of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n236/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0236-0221"/> work should be thrown on the central government.
                    Most socialist schools have contemplated a vast increase of communal or local
                    autonomy,—a course which, on the other hand, does not carry with it the
                    subversion of the central government. (4) In England during the last half
                    century we have seen a long succession of efforts, partially successful, towards
                    a new organization of society rendered necessary by the changes due to the
                    industrial revolution. In economics as in other spheres the watchword of the new
                    era has been freedom, the removal of restraint. But it has been found that
                    positive measures of reconstruction were also necessary. Factory legislation
                    carried in opposition to the prevailing economic theory, trades unions,
                    employers’ combinations, industrial partnerships, boards of conciliation, the
                    co-operative system,—all these are real, if partial, endeavours towards a new
                    organization of society suited to the new conditions. Socialism claims to be the
                    comprehensive scheme of organization which embraces in a complete and consistent
                    unity all these partial efforts. (5) But the great social force which is
                    destined to work out the vast transformation consists of the human beings most
                    directly interested in the colossal struggle,—the modern democracy. This
                    democracy is marked by a combination of characteristics which are new to
                    history. It is being educated and enlightened in the school and by the cheap
                    press; it is being drilled and organized in large factories, in the national
                    armies, by vast popular demonstrations, in the gigantic electoral struggles of
                    the time. Thus it is becoming conscious of its enormous power, and able to make
                    use of it. It is becoming conscious also of its unsatisfactory social and
                    economic position. The democracy which has become the master-force of the
                    civilized world are economically a mass of proletarians dependent on precarious
                    wage-labour. Having transformed the political condition of things, they are
                    ready now for an economic transformation. But the inevitable process of
                    concentration of industrial operations already referred to is entirely against
                    the continuance or restoration of the small producer, whether workman or peasant
                    proprietor. Such efforts of continuance or restoration are reactionary; they are
                    economically unsound and must fail. Production and distribu tion ever tend to
                    larger dimensions. The only issue out of the present economic condition is
                    concentrated collective industry under the control of the new democracy and its
                    chosen leaders. On the irresistible momentum of these two inevitable and
                    ever-growing forces—the concentration of industry and the growth of the new
                    democracy— socialism depends for the realization of its scheme of
                    transformation.</p>
                <p>Such are the tendencies to which philosophic socialists point as already working
                    towards a transformation of society of the kind they expect. It is essentially a
                    question of the future, with which we have no concern in this article. Our duty
                    has simply been to point out the forces which socialists believe to be actually
                    at work for the realization of their theory of social organization; and here we
                    must leave the subject.</p>
