                    hemispheres, as well as of mountain districts in warmer climes. The tufted
                    character of the plant, and its habit of sending out long slender branches
                    (runners) which produce a new bud at the extremity, are well known. The leaves
                    are usually palmately three-parted, but the number of leaflets may be increased
                    to five or reduced to one. While the flower has the typical Rosaceous structure,
                    the so-called fruit is very peculiar, but it may be understood by the contrast
                    it presents with the “hip” of the rose. In the last-named plant the top of the
                    flower-stalk expands as it grows into a vaseshaped cavity, the “hip,” within
                    which are concealed the true fruits or seed-vessels. In the rose the extremity
                    of the floral axis is concave and bears the carpels in its interior. In the
                    strawberry the floral axis, instead of becoming concave, swells out into a
                    fleshy, dome-shaped or flattened mass in which the carpels or true fruits,
                    commonly called pips or seeds, are more or less imbedded but never wholly
                    concealed. A ripe strawberry in fact may be aptly compared to the “fruit” of a
                    rose turned inside out.</p>
                <p>The common wild strawberry of Great Britain, which indeed is found throughout
                    Europe and great part of North America, is <hi rend="italic">F. vesca,</hi> and
                    this was the first species brought under cultivation in the early part of the
                    17th century. Later on other species were introduced, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >F. elatior,</hi> a European species, the parent stock of the hautbois
                    strawberries, and especially <hi rend="italic">F. virginiana</hi> from the
                    United States and <hi rend="italic">F. chiloensis</hi> from Chiloe. From these
                    species, crossed and recrossed in various manners, have sprung the vast number
                    of different varieties now enumerated in catalogues, whose characteristics are
                    so inextricably blended that the attempt to trace their exact parentage or to
                    follow out their lineage has become impossible. It must suffice to say that the
                    varieties at present cultivated vary in the most remarkable degree in size,
                    colour, flavour, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to
                    disease, and constitution of plant. Some, as previously stated, vary in foliage,
                    others produce no runners, and some vary materially in the relative development
                    of their sexual organs, for, while in most cases the flowers are in appearance
                    hermaphrodite, at least in structure, there is a very general tendency towards a
                    separation of the sexes, so that the flowers are males or females only as to
                    function, even although they may be perfect in construction. This tendency to
                    dioecism is a common characteristic among <hi rend="italic">Rosaceae,</hi> and
                    sometimes proves a source of disappointment to the cultivator, who finds his
                    plants barren where he had hoped to gather a crop. This happens in the United
                    States more frequently than in Britain, but when recognized can readily be
                    obviated by planting male varieties in the vicinity of the barren kinds. Darwin,
                    in alluding to the vast amount of variability in the so-called “fruit,”—a change
                    effected by the art of the horticulturist in less than three
                    centuries,—contrasts with this variability the fixity and permanence of
                    character presented by the true fruits, or pips, which are distributed over the
                    surface of the swollen axis. The will and art of the gardener have been directed
                    to the improvement of the one organ, while he has devoted no attention to the
                    other, which consequently remains in the same condition as in the wild plant.
                    Too much stress is not, however, to be laid on this point, for it must be
                    remembered that the foliage, which is not specially an object of the gardener’s
                    “selection,” nevertheless varies considerably.</p>
