                <p><label type="entry">SUCCESSION DUTY</label> is a sum paid to the state by a
                    person benefited by the succession to certain kinds of property. Legacies were
                    first taxed in 1780. It was not until 1853 that a tax was levied upon succession
                    to real property, or succession under any instrument other than a will by which
                    property is enjoyed in succession to a deceased person. The duty is paid on
                    succession to both real and personal property, in fact, in almost all cases
                    which do not fall within the Legacy Duty Acts. The Succession Duty Act, 1853 (16
                    and 17 Vict. c. 51), defines succession as “every past or future disposition of
                    property by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled
                    to any property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after
                    the time appointed for the commencement of this Act, either immediately or after
                    any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way
                    of substitutive limitation, and every devolution by law of any beneficial
                    interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying
                    after the time appointed for the commencement of this Act to any other person in
                    possession or expectancy.” There are certain exemptions, the most important
                    being successions of a husband or wife, successions where the whole value is
                    under £100, individual successions under the value of £20, and legacies and
                    shares of personal estate chargeable under the Legacy Duty Acts. The duties
                    levied vary from 1 to 10 per cent., according to the degree of consanguinity
                    between the predecessor and the successor. Leasehold property and personalty
                    directed to be converted into real estate are liable to succession and<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0640-0617"/> not to legacy duty. Spécial provision is made for
                    the collection of the duty in the case of joint tenants, in the case where the
                    successor is also the predecessor, and in other dispositions of a special
                    nature. The duty is a first charge on property; but, if the property be parted
                    with before the succession duty be paid, the liability of the successor appears
                    to be transferred to the alienee. A <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> purchaser
                    is protected by a receipt for duty, notwithstanding any suppression or
                    mis-statement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed, or
                    any insufficiency of such assessment. It is usual in requisitions on title
                    before conveyance to demand for the protection of the purchaser the production
                    of receipts for succession duty. Recent legislation has made some amendments in
                    the law. By 43 Vict. c. 14, s. 11, succession duty may be commuted in certain
                    cases by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. 44 Vict. c. 12, s. 36, relieves
                    from payment of succession duty on personal estate not exceeding £300 by payment
                    of a sum of thirty shillings on the affidavit or inventory. Section 41 exempts
                    from payment of the 1 per cent. duty in respect of property for which stamp duty
                    has been paid on the affidavit or inventory. Up to 1885 certain property vested
                    in bodies corporate and unincorporate escaped liability to succession duty. 48
                    and 49 Vict. c. 51, s. 11, now imposes on such bodies (with considerable
                    exceptions) a duty at the rate of 5 per cent. on the annual value, income, or
                    profits of the succession. All the Acts which have been cited extend to the
                    United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the United States succession duty is regulated by tit. xxxv. ch. 10 of the
                    Revised Statutes. The duty varies from 1 to 6 per •cent., according to the
                    degree of consanguinity.</p>
