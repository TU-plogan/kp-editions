                    (1804-1849), orchestral conductor and composer of dance-music, was born at
                    Vienna, March 14, 1804. In 1819 he obtained his first engagement as a violinist
                    in a small band then playing at the Sperl, in the Leopoldstadt. Shortly
                    afterwards he joined Lanner, with whom he remained associated as
                    deputy-conductor until 1825, when he organized a little band of fourteen
                    performers on his own account. It was during the carnival of 1826 that Strauss
                    inaugurated his long line of triumphs by introducing his band to the public of
                    Vienna at the Schwan, in the Rossau suburb, where his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taüberl-Walzer</hi> (op. 1) at once established his reputation as the best
                    composer of dance-music then living. Upon the strength of this success he was
                    invited back to the Sperl, where he accepted an engagement, with an increased
                    orchestra, for six years. Soon after this he was appointed kapellmeister to the
                    1st Bürger regiment, and entrusted with the duty of providing the music for the
                    court balls; while the number of his private engagements was so great that he
                    found it necessary to enlarge his band from time to time until it consisted of
                    more than two hundred performers. In 1833 he began a long and extended series of
                    tours throughout northern Europe, eventually visiting England in 1838. In Paris
                    he associated himself with Musard, whose quadrilles became not much less popular
                    than his own waltzes; but his greatest successes were achieved in London, where
                    he arrived in time for the coronation of Queen Victoria, and played at
                    seventy-two public concerts, besides innumerable balls and other private
                    entertainments. The fatigue of these long journeys seriously injured Strauss’s
                    health; but he soon resumed his duties at the Sperl; and on May 5, 1840 he
                    removed with his band to the Imperial “Volksgarten,” which thenceforth became
                    the scene of his most memorable successes. Those who enjoyed the privilege of
                    hearing him conduct there could never forget the wonderful delicacy of the
                    performance, over which the master presided with a quiet power which ensured the
                    perfection of every minutest <hi rend="italic">nuance.</hi> In 1844 Strauss
                    began another extensive series of tours. In 1849 he revisited London, and, after
                    his farewell concert, was escorted down the Thames by a squadron of boats, in
                    one of which a band played tunes in his honour. This was his last public
                    triumph. On his return to Vienna he was attacked with scarlet fever, of which he
                    died, September 25, 1849.</p>
                <p>Strauss was survived by three sons,—Johann (born 1825), Joseph (1827-1870), and
                    Edward (born 1835), all of whom have distinguished themselves as composers of
                    dance-music, and assisted in recruiting the ranks and perpetuating the
                    traditions of the still famous band.</p>
