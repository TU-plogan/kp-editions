                    under the government of the Punjab, lying between 30° 24' and 31° N. lat. and
                    between 77° 5' and 77° 50' E. long. Its area is 1096 square miles, and it is
                    bounded on the N. by the hill states of Balsan and Jubal, on the E. by the
                    British district of Dehra Dun, from which it is separated by the rivers Tons and
                    Jumna, on the S.W. by Ambala district, and on the N.W. by the states of Patiála
                    and Keunthál. Except a very small tract about Nahan, the chief town and
                    residence of the raja, on the south-western extremity, where a few streams rise
                    and flow south-westward to the Saraswatí and Ghaggar rivers, the whole of Sirmúr
                    lies in the basin of the Jumna, which receives from this tract the Giri and its
                    feeders the Jalal and the Palúr. The Tons, the great western arm of the stream
                    called lower down the Jumna, flows along the eastern boundary of Sirmúr, and on
                    the right side receives from it the two small streams Minus and Nairai. The
                    surface generally declines in elevation from north to south; the chief
                    elevations on the northern frontier (Chor peak and station) are about 12,000
                    feet above the sea. The valley of the Khiárda Dun, which forms the southern part
                    of the state, is bounded on the S. by the Siwalik range, the hills of which are
                    of recent formation and abound in fossil remains of large vertebrate animals.
                    Though the rocks of Sirmúr consist of formations usually metalliferous, the
                    yield of mineral wealth is at present but small. The forests are very dense, so
                    much so that the sportsman finds difficulty in making his way through them in
                    search of wild elephants, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyaenas, with which they
                    abound. The climate of Sirmúr varies with the elevation; the northern extremity
                    has very little rain; but large and excellent crops are everywhere to be
                    obtained by irrigation.</p>
                <p>The population in 1881 was 112,371 (males 63,305, females 49,066), the great
                    majority being Hindus. The only town of any importance is Nahan, with a
                    population of 5253. The principal products of the state are opium, tobacco, and
                    cereals, and its gross revenue is estimated at £21,000. Sirmúr, which means “a
                    crowned head,” was the place of residence of the rajas who ruled over the state
                    before the present dynasty entered the country. The reigning raja (Shamsher
                    Prakásh, K.C.S.I.) holds his possessions by a grant made on the expulsion of the
                    Gúrkhas by the British in 1815.</p>
