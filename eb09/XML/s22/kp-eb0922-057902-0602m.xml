                    structures of iron and other materials in which fuel is burned for heating and
                    ventilating apartments and for cooking food. Following the primitive open
                    hearth, the first separate heating apparatus used by Egyptians, Greeks, and
                    Romans was the brazier, an open basin of metal in which charcoal was consumed.
                    The brazier is still in common use for industrial purposes, and in Continental
                    countries it is widely employed both for cooking and for domestic heating. The
                    Romans further were acquainted with the hypocaust, a separate chamber under the
                    floor of the apartment to be heated (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Baths,</hi> vol.
                    iii. p. 434). In an improved form of hypocaust, flues were provided which
                    conveyed the heat and products of combustion to the floors of other apartments
                    at some distance from the fire. In the remains of Roman villas found in Britain
                    the hypocaust is an invariable feature. The introduction of chimneys into houses
                    in the early part of the 14th century opened the way to all modern improvements
                    in the heating arrangements of apartments, and the efforts of inventors have
                    been devoted to the securing of the thorough combustion of the fuel used, and to
                    the utilization of the maximum amount of heat therefrom in the most healthful
                    and agreeable manner. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Smoke Abatement.</hi></p>
                <p>The stove or close range, as distinguished from the open fireplace, distributes
                    the largest amount of heat from the fuel it burns. In its simplest form the
                    common stove consists of a case of iron, closed above, with its sole raised from
                    the floor on which it stands. It has two small openings in one side, one on the
                    level of the firebars for draught, and the other above for supplying fuel; and
                    on the opposite side the products of combustion are carried away by a flue-pipe
                    passing into a chimney. In a more complex form the height of the case or body is
                    increased, and a series of horizontal flues or spaces are formed inside, through
                    which the heated air and smoke pass, thus extracting more thoroughly the heat
                    before it enters the chimney, and giving a greatly increased heating surface.
                    Such stoves overdry the air in rooms, and, when they are externally heated to a
                    high degree, floating particles are burned by falling on their surfaces, whence
                    arises the disagreeable stuffy smell almost inseparable from their use. To
                    mitigate this evil of overheating, linings of tiles, firebricks, and other
                    non-conducting materials are with great advantage introduced between the heated
                    iron and the air of the apartment. In ventilating stoves the outside casing of
                    iron is entirely protected from the direct action of fire by a lining of
                    firebrick. The inside is divided into several spaces or flues, and air drawn
                    from without enters by a separate flue, and passing through these spaces is
                    heated and delivered into the apartment as a warm current. In another class, of
                    which the gill stove is the type, there radiates from the fire-case a range of
                    flanges or gills a few inches apart, which conduct the heat outwards and
                    enormously extend the heating surface, counteracting at the same time the
                    tendency to overheating. Cooking stoves or ranges have in their centre a fire
                    space covered above with a removable top-plate, in which are circular openings
                    whereby the cooking vessels can be brought into direct contact with the fire. At
                    both sides there are one or more compartments which form ovens, and around these
                    the heat from the fire is carried by flues; or at one side a water boiler may be
                    placed, although generally a high-pressure boiler occupies a space immediately
                    behind the fire. The flues which pass around all these spaces, and that also
                    leading directly to the chimney, are controlled by dampers, so that the heat can
                    be directed along any desired course.</p>
                <p>Both as a heating and cooking agent coal gas is now being largely used, and many
                    forms of stoves have been devised to meet its peculiar conditions as a gaseous
                    fuel. Gas stoves present the obvious advantages of cleanliness, comparative
                    freedom from smoke, and immediate readiness for use; and the flame and heat are
                    under the most perfect control. Gas is used in open fireplaces as well as in
                    stoves, a most efficient open heating arrangement being that devised by the late
                    Sir Chas. W. Siemens, in which a combined fire of charcoal and coal gas is made.
                    Small lamp stoves for burning mineral oils are also in use; but they share the
                    serious disadvantage of certain simple gas stoves, from which the whole products
                    of combustion pass into the room in which they are placed.</p>
                <p>Fireplaces are entirely open in front; they radiate heat into the apartment; and
                    flame, smoke, &amp;c., pass direct into the chimney. The rapid passage of the
                    heated air into the chimney carries away a large proportion of the heat, and
                    this loss is particularly great in grates made entirely of iron. In modern
                    grates of good quality the sides and back of the fire-basket are of fire-brick,
                    which retains and throws out much heat. In slow-combustion grates the
                    fire-basket is set low on the hearth, and air is admitted to the fuel only
                    through the fire-bars in front. The back of the grate slopes in towards the
                    hearth, where the fire space is comparatively narrow. By means of a door sliding
                    down over the front from the upper part of the grate, the indraught of air can
                    be modified at pleasure. In ventilating fireplaces the fire-basket is of iron
                    lined with firebrick, and in the space between the back of the grate and the
                    wall flues are formed which are heated from the fire. Into these flues air from
                    without is introduced, which, after being there warmed, passes into the
                    apartment at suitable openings.</p>
