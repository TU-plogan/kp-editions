                    lat. and between 80° 21' and 81° 26' E. long., and it is bounded on the N. by
                    Kheri district, on the E. by that of Bahraich, from which it is separated by the
                    Gogra river, and on the S. and W. by Bara Banki, Lucknow, and Hardoi districts,
                    the Gumti river forming the boundary. Sitápur district is elliptical in shape;
                    its greatest length from south-east to north-west is 70 miles, and its extreme
                    breadth from north-east to south-west 55 miles; its area is 2251 square miles.
                    Being without hills or valleys, and devoid of forests, Sitápur presents the
                    appearance of a vast plain sloping imperceptibly from an elevation of 505 feet
                    above sea-level in the north-west to 400 feet in the south-east. The country is,
                    however, well wooded with numerous groves, and well cultivated, except in those
                    parts where the soil is barren and cut up by ravines. It is intersected by
                    numerous streams, and contains many shallow ponds and natural reservoirs, which
                    overflow during the rains, but become dry in the hot season. Except in the
                    eastern portion, which lies in the doabs or alluvial plains between the Kewáni
                    and Chauka and the Gogra and Chauka rivers, the soil is as a rule dry, but even
                    this moist tract is interspersed with patches of land covered with saline
                    efflorescence called “reh.” The principal rivers are the Gogra, which is
                    navigable by boats of large tonnage throughout the year, and the Chauka.
                    Nylghau, many varieties of deer, wild hog, wolf, jackal, and fox are common, but
                    none of the larger wild animals are found within the district. The climate is
                    considered healthy, and the cantonments of Sitápur are famous for the low
                    mortality of the British troops stationed there. The average annual rainfall is
                    about 33 inches. The district contains no railway, but it is well provided with
                    good unmetalled roads.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population was returned at 958,251 (505,986 males and 452,265
                    females); Hindus numbered 818,738, Mohammedans 138,733, and Christians 443.
                    Sitâpur contains but two towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants,—namely,
                    Khairabad, 14,217, and Laharpur, 10,437. The administrative headquarters of the
                    district are at Sitápur town, which is prettily situated on the banks of the
                    Saráyan river, with good groves in all directions, and with a population in 1881
                    of 6780. Of the total district area 1455 square miles are cultivated and 510 are
                    cultivable. The principal staples are wheat, barley, joar, gram, bajra, and
                    rice; besides these a considerable quantity of sugar-cane is raised, as also oil
                    seeds, cotton, and tobacco. The only manufactures of any note are tobacco and
                    tazias at Biswán, with a little cotton printing and weaving in most of the
                    towns. The history of Sitápur is closely associated with that of the rest of
                    Oudh. The district figured prominently in the mutiny of 1857, when the native
                    troops quartered in the cantonments rose in mutiny and fired on their officers,
                    many of whom were killed, as were also several military and civil officers, with
                    their families, in attempting to escape. Order being restored in 1858, the
                    Government offices were re-opened, and nothing has since occurred to disturb the
                    peace of the district.</p>
