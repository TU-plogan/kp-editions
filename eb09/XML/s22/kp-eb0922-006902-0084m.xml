                    throughout the earth’s crust, including the ocean, which contains a trace of the
                    noble metal—minute, it is true, in a relative sense, but in absolute amount
                    approaching 10,000 million tons. Of the varieties of silver ores, the following
                    chiefly are metallurgically important :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Reguline

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. Silver is also frequently met with in
                    base-metallic ores, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in lead ores and many kinds of
                    pyrites. Unmixed silver minerals nowhere present themselves in large continuous
                    masses. What we call “silver ores” are all more or less complex mixtures in
                    which the non-argentiferous components are usually decidedly in the majority.
                    Their metallurgic treatment depends chiefly on the nature of these admixtures,
                    the state of combination of the silver being as a rule irrelevant in the choice
                    of a process, because some at least of the noble metal is always present as
                    sulphide, and our modes of treatment for it include all other native forms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amalgamation.—</hi> If a given ore is relatively free of base
                    “metals” (metallurgically speaking), some process of “amalgamation” may be, and
                    often is, resorted to.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Freiberg process</hi> the first step is to roast the
                    (ground) ore with common salt, which converts the sulphide of silver into<pb

                    2NaCl + 4O from the air = 2AgCl + Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>). The mass, along with certain proportions of water,
                    scrap-iron, and mercury, is placed in barrels, which are then made to rotate
                    about their axes so that the several ingredients are forced into constantly
                    varying contact with one another. The salt solution takes up a small proportion
                    of chloride, which in this (dissolved) form is quickly reduced by the iron to
                    the metallic state (2AgCl + Fe = FeCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2Ag), so
                    that there is, so to say, room made in the brine for another instalment of
                    chloride of silver, which is reduced in its turn, and so on to the end,—the
                    metal formed uniting with the mercury into a semi-fluid amalgam. Of this the
                    bulk at least readily unites into larger continuous masses, which, on account of
                    their high specific gravity, are easily separated from the dross mechanically.
                    The amalgam is pressed in linen bags to eliminate a quantity of relatively
                    silver-free liquid mercury (this of course is utilized as such in subsequent
                    operations), and the remaining solid amalgam is subjected to distillation from
                    iron retorts, whereby its mercury is recovered as a distillate while a more or
                    less impure silver remains in the retort. This process, after having been long
                    wrought in Freiberg with great success, is now superseded there by the Augustin
                    method (see below), but it survives in some other places, as, for example, the
                    Washoe or Comstock district in the Sierra Nevada (United States). It is not used
                    in Chili, Peru, and Mexico because of the scarcity of fuel.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mexican process,</hi> though far less perfect than that of
                    Freiberg, evades this difficulty. It was tried for the first time, if not
                    actually invented, by Bartolomeo de Medina in 1557. It was adopted in Mexico in
                    1566 and in Peru in 1574, and is in use in both countries and in Chili to this
                    day. The stamped ore is ground into a fine paste with water; this paste, after
                    having been allowed to dry up a little in air, is placed on a stone floor along
                    with a quantity of salt, and the two are trodden together by mules. On the
                    following day there are added certain proportions of “magistral” (a kind of
                    crude sulphate of copper made by roasting copper pyrites) and of mercury, and
                    the mules are kept going until the silver is as far as possible converted into
                    amalgam, which takes from fifteen to forty-five days. The rationale of the
                    process is not quite understood. According to Boussingault, the cupric chloride
                    (formed by the salt from the sulphate) chlorinates part of the sulphide of
                    silver, thus—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">2</hi> CuCl <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2</hi> + Ag <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S=2 AgCl + S + Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and the cuprous chloride formed acts upon another
                    portion of sulphide of silver, thus—</p>
                <p>Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + Ag <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S = 2 AgCl + Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S, and in
                    this way all the sulphide of silver is gradually converted into chloride. The
                    chloride is reduced to the metallic state by the mercury (AgCl + Hg=HgCl +Ag)
                    with formation of calomel, the metallic silver uniting with the surplus mercury
                    into amalgam. The calomel is allowed to go to waste.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Augustin process</hi> of silver extraction is only a
                    peculiar mode of metallifying and collecting the silver of an ore after it has
                    been by some preliminary operation converted into chloride or sulphate. Either
                    salt is brought into solution—the chloride by means of hot brine, the sulphate
                    by means of hot water, acidified with oil of vitriol; the solution is separated
                    from the insolubles, and made to filter through a bed of precipitated copper.
                    The copper reduces the silver to metal, which remains on the bed as a spongy
                    mass, while an equivalent quantity of copper chloride (or sulphate) passes
                    through as a solution. The silver sponge is collected, freed from adhering
                    copper by muriatic acid in contact with air, and then sent to the furnace. From
                    the copper liquor that metal is precipitated in its original form by means of
                    iron.</p>
                <p>The silver furnished by any of these methods is never pure, even in the
                    commercial sense. A general method for its purification is to fuse it up with
                    lead and subject the alloy to cupellation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lead,</hi>
                    vol. xiv. p. 376). Cupel-silver is apt to contain small quantities of lead
                    (chiefly), bismuth, antimony, copper, and more or less of gold, of which metals,
                    however, only the first three are reckoned “contaminations” by the metallurgist.
                    They can be removed by a supplementary cupellation, without added lead, at a
                    high temperature. Addition of lead would remove the copper likewise, but it is
                    usually allowed to remain and the alloy sent out as cupriferous silver, to be
                    alloyed with more copper and thus converted into some kind of commercial
                    “silver” (see below). If gold is present to the extent of 0∙1 per cent. or more,
                    it is recovered by treatment of the metal with nitric acid or boiling vitriol.
                    The gold in either case remains as such; the silver becomes nitrate or sulphate,
                    and from the solution of either salt is recovered by precipitation with metallic
                    copper. Although nitric acid is the more expensive of the two parting agents, it
                    is often now preferred because photography has created a large demand for
                    nitrate of silver. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Gold,</hi> vol. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">x.</hi> p. 749.</p>
                <p>For the “incidental” extraction of silver from essentially base-metallic ores the
                    method in the case of all lead ores' is simply to proceed as if only lead were
                    present, and from the argentiferous lead produced to extract the noble metal by
                    one of the processes described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Lead</hi> (vol. xiv.
                    p. 376-7), while for the treatment of sulphureous copper ores one method is so
                    to smelt the ore (with, if necessary, an addition of galena or some form of
                    oxide of lead) as to produce a regulus of lead and a “mat” of sulphide of
                    copper, (Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S), which latter should contain as
                    little lead as possible. The silver follows chiefly the lead, and is extracted
                    from it by cupellation; but some silver remains in general even with a lead-free
                    mat. Compare account of the Lautenbach process under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lead.</hi></p>
                <p>A modern mode of extracting the silver from a copper mat is to roast it at a very
                    low temperature, so as to produce a relatively large proportion of metallic
                    sulphate, and then to destroy the bulk of the sulphate of copper by a
                    judiciously-regulated higher temperature. The silver all remains as sulphate,
                    which is extracted by hot dilute sulphuric acid and wrought by the Augustin
                    method.</p>
                <p>Very interesting is the process which was patented by Claudet for the
                    remunerative extraction of the few hundredths of a per cent. of silver contained
                    in that kind of cupriferous iron pyrites which is now used, almost exclusively,
                    for the making of vitriol. The “cinders,” as returned by the vitriol maker, are
                    habitually worked up for copper by roasting them with salt and lixiviating the
                    roasted mass with water, when the copper dissolves as chloride, Cu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and CuCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The silver goes with it, but for its precipitation no
                    method was known until Field found that silver dissolved as AgCl in a chloride
                    solution can be precipitated exhaustively by addition of the calculated
                    proportion of a soluble iodide, as AgI. Claudet’s process is only an adaptation
                    of Field’s discovery. After having diluted the copper liquor with a certain
                    proportion of water· he adds the weight of iodine, calculated from the assay, as
                    solution of iodide of zinc, which produces a very impure precipitate of iodide
                    of silver. From it he re-extracts the iodine, by treatment with zinc and dilute
                    sulphuric acid, as iodide of zinc, which is used over again. The “silver
                    precipitate,” which now contains its silver as metal mixed with a large quantity
                    of (chiefly) sulphate of lead, goes to the metal-refiner, who treats it as a
                    lead ore.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemically Pure Silver.—</hi> Even the best “fine” silver of
                    commerce contains a few thousandth-parts of copper or other base metal. To
                    produce perfectly pure metal the most popular method is to first prepare pure
                    chloride (by applying the method given below under “Chloride” to a nitric
                    solution of any kind of ordinary “silver”), and then to reduce the chloride to
                    metal, which can be done in a great variety of ways. One way is to mix the dry
                    chloride intimately with one-fifth of its weight of pure quicklime or one-third
                    of its weight of dry carbonate of soda, and to fuse down the mixture in a
                    fire-clay crucible at a bright red heat. In either case we obtain a regulus of
                    silver lying under a fused slag of chloride—2AgCl + (CaO or Na <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) = 2Ag + (CaCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O or 2NaCl + CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + O).
                    The fused metal is best granulated by pouring it from a sufficient height, and
                    as a thin stream, into a mass of cold water. A convenient wet-way method for
                    small quantities is to boil the recently precipitated chloride (which must have
                    been produced and washed in the <hi rend="italic">cοld)</hi> with caustic
                    soda-ley and just enough of sugar to take away the. oxygen of the Ag <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O transitorily produced. The silver in this case is
                    obtained as a yellowish-grey heavy powder, which is easily washed by
                    decantation; but it tends to retain unreduced chloride, which can be removed
                    only by fusion with carbonate of soda.</p>
                <p>Stas recommends the following process as yielding a metal which comes nearer
                    ideal purity. Slightly cupriferous silver is made into dry nitrate and the
                    latter fused to reduce any platinum nitrate that may be present to metal. The
                    fused mass is taken up in dilute ammonia and diluted to about fifty times the
                    weight of the silver it contains. The filtered (blue) solution is now mixed with
                    an excess of solution of sulphite of ammonia, SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and allowed to
                    stand. After twenty-four hours about one-half of the silver has separated out in
                    crystals; from the mother-liquor the rest comes down promptly on application of
                    a water-bath heat. The rationale of the process is that the sulphite hardly acts
                    upon the dissolved oxide of silver, but it reduces some of the oxide of copper,
                    2CuO, to Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, with formation of sulphate SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">

                    equivalent of Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O; and so on to the end.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0086-0071"/> Pure silver (ingot) has a beautiful white colour
                    and lustre; it is almost as plastic as pure gold, and, like it, very soft. It
                    does not tarnish in natural air; but in air contaminated with ever so little
                    sulphuretted hydrogen it gradually draws a black film of sulphide. The specific
                    gravity of the frozen metal is 10∙42 to 10∙51, rising to 10∙57 after compression
                    under a die. It is the best conductor of heat and electricity. The expansion of
                    unit length from 0° to 100° C. is 0∙001936 (Fizeau). The specific heat is 0∙0570
                    (Regnault), 0∙0559 (Bunsen). It fuses at 954° C. (Violle)— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> far below the fusing point of copper or gold—without oxidation,
                    unless it be in contact with a surface of silicate (porcelain glaze, &amp;c.),
                    when a trace of silicate of Ag <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O is produced. It
                    volatilizes appreciably at a full red heat; in the oxyhydrogen flame it boils,
                    with formation of a blue vapour. The fused metal readily absorbs oxygen gas
                    (under fused nitre as much as twenty times its volume—Gay-Lussac). When the
                    oxygenated metal freezes the absorbed gas goes off suddenly at the temperature
                    of solidification, and, by forcing its way through the solid crust produces
                    volcanic eruptions of metal which are sometimes very beautiful. The presence of
                    even very little base metal in the silver prevents this “spitting,” the base
                    metal combining with the oxygen faster than it can be reabsorbed. Pure silver
                    retains a trace of the absorbed oxygen permanently, and Dumas in an experiment
                    on one kilogramme of metal extracted from it 82 milligrammes of oxygen in an
                    absolute vacuum at 400°–500° C. Water, and ordinary non-oxidizing aqueous acids
                    generally, do not attack silver in the least, hydrochloric acid excepted,—which,
                    in the presence of air, dissolves the metal very slowly as chloride. A solution
                    of common salt acts similarly, the liberated sodium becoming NaOH. Aqueous
                    hydriodic acid, even in the absence of air, dissolves silver perceptibly, with
                    evolution of hydrogen (Deville). Aqueous nitric acid dissolves the metal readily
                    as nitrate; hot vitriol converts it into a magma of crystalline sulphate, with
                    evolution of sulphurous acid. Silver is absolutely proof against the action of
                    caustic alkali leys, and almost so against that of fused caustic alkalies even
                    in the presence of air. It ranks in this respect next to gold, and is much used
                    to make vessels for chemical operations involving the use of fused caustic
                    potash or soda. The ordinary “fine” metal is good enough for this purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Silver Alloys.</hi> —Pure silver is too soft to make durable
                    coins or vessels combining lightness with stability of form. This defect can be
                    cured by alloying it with a little copper. All ordinary “silver” articles
                    consist of such alloys. The proportion of silver in these (their “fineness”) is
                    habitually stated in parts of real silver per 1000 parts of alloy. In Great
                    Britain all silver coins are made of “standard silver,” the fineness of which,
                    by legal definition, is 925. The toleration is 4 units (of pure silver in 1000
                    of alloy), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a specimen passes as long as its
                    fineness lies between 925 and 921 (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Mint,</hi> vol.
                    xvi. p. 483). As regards silver-plate the “Hall” in London refuses to stamp any
                    poorer alloy. In Germany and in the United States all silver coins, in France
                    and Austria the major silver coins, are of the fineness 900, with a toleration
                    of 3 units. The minor coins of Austria are of the fineness 375 to 520; in France
                    all silver coins under one franc contain 835 of silver, 93 of copper, and 72 of
                    zinc in 1000 parts. The fineness prescribed by law or custom for “silver”
                    articles is 950 or 800 (±5) in France, 750 in North Germany, 812∙5 in South
                    Germany, and 820 in Austria. All <hi rend="italic">these</hi> alloys at least
                    are liable to “liquation,” which means that, although they are perfectly
                    homogeneous in the crucible, they freeze into layers of not absolutely the same
                    composition. According to Levai, passing from the skin to the core of an ingot
                    of 900 per mille silver the difference may amount to 3 units. Of all the alloys
                    tried by that chemist only that composed according to the formula Ag <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, corresponding to 719
                    per mille of silver, remained perfectly homogeneous on freezing. He therefore
                    recommends this alloy for coinage; unfortunately, however, any silver-copper
                    alloy which contains less than about 750 per mille of noble metal tarnishes very
                    perceptibly in the air. British standard silver is quite free of this defect,
                    but it is inconveniently soft, far softer than the “900” alloy.</p>
                <p>The extent to which the properties of silver are modified by addition of copper
                    depends on the fineness of the alloy produced. The addition of even three parts
                    of copper to one of silver does not quite obliterate the whiteness of the noble
                    metal. According to Kamarsch the relative abrasion suffered by silver coins of
                    the degrees of fineness named is as follows :—</p>

                    of the object by means of a brush. The mercury then is driven away by heat, when
                    a coherent film of silver remains, which adheres very firmly, is quite

                    heavy, easily settling precipitate and a clear solution,—more readily if the
                    co-reagents are exactly balanced or the silver is in excess than when the
                    precipitant predominates. Chloride of silver is as good as insoluble in water,
                    but hydrochloric acid, and chloride solutions generally, dissolve it
                    perceptibly. In dilute sulphuric and nitric acids it is as insoluble as in plain

                    Hydrogen at a dull red heat reduces it to metal. A similar reduction is effected
                    in even the compact chloride by contact with zinc, water, and a little dilute
                    sulphuric acid; the reduction, however, proceeds rather slowly and is rarely

                    even the bromide, this latter exceeding in this sense the chloride. But boiling
                    oil of vitriol decomposes it slowly, with elimination of iodine vapours and
                    formation of sulphate. Hydrogen at a red heat does not act upon it; nor is it at

                    derived from purely oxygenated acids the least trace of silver can be detected
                    by hydrochloric acid, which precipitates the silver as chloride (see above). The
                    precipitate, when produced in a possibly complex solution, may include the
                    chlorides of lead (PbCl) and mercurosum (Hg <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi

                    For the <hi rend="italic">quantitative</hi> determination of silver, the
                    ordinary laboratory method is to bring the metal into solution as nitrate and
                    then to throw it down as pure chloride. The chloride is washed, collected,
                    dehydrated by fusion, and weighed. According to Stas, if O = 16, Ag = 107∙93 and
                    Cl = 35∙454; hence the chloride contains 0∙75273 of its weight of metal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">assaying</hi> of silver ores is done preferably in the “dry
                    way in fact relatively poor ores cannot be assayed satisfactorily in any other.
                    The general method with sulphureous ores is to mix them, as powders, with
                    (silver-free) oxide of lead and tartar, and fuse in a clay or graphite crucible.
                    The regulus includes all the silver. The fuse is poured into a conical mould of
                    castiron, when the metal goes to the bottom of the mould; the ingot, after
                    cooling, is easily separated from the adhering slag. The slag-free regulus is
                    then placed in a little cupel made out of compressed bone-ash, and is heated in
                    a muffle to redness and kept at this temperature in the current of air which
                    pervades the muffle in virtue of its disposition in the furnace until all the
                    lead and base metals generally have been sucked up by the porous cupel. The
                    remaining “button” of metal is weighed, which gives the conjoint weight of the
                    silver and gold, which latter metal is rarely absent. For its determination the
                    button is rolled out into a piece of thin sheet, which is “parted” with nitric
                    acid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gold).</hi> The gold remains and goes to the
                    balance; the weight of the silver is found by difference. Similarly, to
                    determine the fineness of silver alloys, a known weight of the alloy—customarily
                    0∙5 gramme—is “cupelled,” with addition of a proportion of pure lead depending
                    on the weight of base metal to be removed, as shown by the following table,

                <p>In a well-appointed laboratory two operators who work into each other’s hands can
                    easily make several dozen of such assays in a day. Cupelling, indeed, is the
                    promptest of all methods of analysis, only the results are not quite as exact as
                    is desirable in the case of precious metal, part of the silver being lost by
                    volatilization, and part by being sucked into the cupel. The error attains its
                    maximum in the case of alloys of about 700 per mille, and with these conies to

                    corrected to some extent by “blank” assays made with known weights of pure
                    silver and pure copper; but such corrections are not quite safe. Hence
                    cupellation nowadays, in the mints at least, is used only for a first
                    approximation, and the exact fineness determined by the “wet-way” process,
                    invented by Gay-Lussac. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Assaying,</hi> vol. ii. p.

                <p>A most excellent method for the quick determination of a not approximately known
                    weight of dissolved silver has been invented by Volhard. This method rests on
                    the fact that solutions of sulphocyanates (including that intensely red salt
                    Fe(NCS) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> which is produced when, for instance, NCS.H
                    is mixed with ferric sulphate) precipitate silver completely from even strongly
                    acid solutions, as NCS.Ag. A convenient reagent for the method is produced by
                    dissolving <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> NCS.NH
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> grammes of (chlorine-free) sulphocyanate of
                    ammonium in water to 1000 c.c. to produce a solution of which 1 c.c.
                    precipitates about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> Ag = 10∙8 milligrammes of silver. To determine the exact “titre,” we
                    dissolve, say, 540 milligrammes of pure silver in 1∙2 nitric acid, and next boil
                    away every trace of N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>. We then dilute to say 50 c.c., add 5 c.c. of saturated solution of iron
                    alum (not less), and, lastly, run in sulphocyanate from the burette, until the
                    red colour of ferric sulphocyanate which appears locally from the first, by
                    addition of the last drop of NCS solution, has become permanent on stirring.
                    Supposing 49∙3 c.c. of solution to have been required to reach this point, every
                    1 c.c. of reagent precipitates <hi rend="superscript"> 540</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 493</hi> milligrammes of silver, and it, of course, always
                    does so, even, let us add, in the presence of (say) 70 per cent. of copper
                    beside 30 of silver in the alloy under operation. Volhard’s method is more
                    exact, and, with a small number of samples, takes even less time, than
                    cupellation. (W. D. )</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mode of Occurrence.—</hi> Silver is rarely found in the native
                    state, and then only in comparatively small quantities. Most of the ores of
                    silver are difficult to reduce, and it is therefore deemed safe to regard this
                    as the last of the three great coining metals which came into use. Silver is
                    originally as widespread as gold, occurring in nearly all the volcanic rocks and
                    some of the Primary ones. In the Silver Reef district of Utah it is found in
                    sedimentary sandstone, though this appears to have undergone some change from
                    volcanic action. But gold remains unaltered by the action of the elements, and
                    is often carried away long distances from its original place of occurrence by
                    the breaking down of the rocks which contain it and their formation anew
                    elsewhere, either as other rocks or as “placers” of gravel or sand, containing
                    gold easily washed out by hand or with rude appliances. Silver, on the contrary,
                    is only to be found in the rocks where it originally occurs. When these are
                    broken down or worn away, the silver is either driven into new mineral
                    combinations, or, more commonly, dissipated and lost. Hence silver is only to be
                    obtained by subterranean mining, and demands the aid of capital and associated
                    labour. The greater rapidity with which gold can be obtained has often
                    influenced the legal relation of value between these two metals, and its bearing
                    upon prices, commerce, and civilization.</p>

                    consisted of gold. For this and other reasons, it is impossible to determine the

                    antiquity, silver appears to have been everywhere equal in value to gold until
                    the silver mines showed signs of exhaustion, when, as the principal coins were
                    of copper and silver, and prices were commonly expressed in these coins, the
                    threatened decrease of money was probably averted and a profit secured for the
                    state by raising the legal value of gold coins. In Greece, in the time of
                    Herodotus (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. iii. 95), gold was 13 times the value of
                    silver, at which ratio it appears to have stood for a long period.</p>
                <p>When the Romans acquired the placer mines of Pannonia, Dacia, Spain, Gaul,
                    &amp;c., they made their principal coins of gold; and at a later period, when
                    the supplies of this metal fell off, they raised the legal value of silver coins
                    to one-tenth that of gold ones of like weight and fineness. This ratio was
                    afterwards changed to 11, and still later to 12 silver for 1 gold. In the
                    Arabian states of the 7th century the ratio was about 6 ½ for 1; yet in France
                    at the same time it was 10 for 1; in England during the 12th century it was 9
                    for 1; in France during the 14th century certain silver and gold coins of like
                    weight bore the same value, hence the ratio was 1 for 1; in Castile and Leon in
                    1454-74 it was 7 ½ for 1. Speaking broadly, between the rise of Mohammedanism
                    and the opening of the silver mines of America the value of silver compared with
                    gold gradually rose. It is evident that there were two lines of ratios, the one
                    having an Indo-Arabic, the other a Romano-Germanic origin, and that the conflict
                    of ratios—which only ceased when America was discovered and a great coinage of
                    the precious metals occurred in Spain—gave rise to many of those otherwise
                    inexplicable lowerings of coins, of one or the other metal, which characterize
                    this period.</p>
                <p>In Spain, by the edict of Medina (1497), the ratio was 10 ¾. When America was
                    plundered the first fruits were gold, not silver; whereupon Spain, in 1546, and
                    before the wealth of the silver mines of Potosi was known, raised the legal
                    value of gold to 13 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, and, as Spain then monopolized the supplies of the precious metals, the
                    rest of the world was obliged to acquiesce in her valuation. During the
                    following century Portugal obtained such immense quantities of gold from the
                    East Indies, Japan, and Brazil that the value of her imports of this metal
                    exceeded £3,000,000 a year, whilst those of Spain had dwindled to £500,000 in
                    gold, and had only increased to £2,500,000 in silver. Portugal now governed the
                    ratio, and in 1688 raised the value of gold to 16 times that of silver. Except
                    during a brief period of forty years, this ratio has ever since been maintained
                    in Spanish and British America and the United States. A century later the spoils
                    of the Orient were exhausted, the Brazilian placers began to decline, and
                    Portugal lost her importance. Spain thus again got control of the ratio, and, as
                    her colonial produce was chiefly silver, she raised its value in 1775 from
                    one-sixteenth to one-fifteenth and a half that of gold for the Peninsula,
                    permitting it to remain at one-sixteenth in the colonies. France, whose previous
                    ratio (that of 1726) was 14 ½, adopted the Spanish ratio of 15 ½ in 1785, and
                    has adhered to it ever since. These three historical ratios, and the bearing of
                    each upon the others, have influenced all legislation on the subject, and, where
                    there was no legislation, have governed the bullion markets for more than two
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile an economical school arose which, while conceding it to be necessary
                    that the state should fabricate coins, denied it the right to limit the number
                    of coins, or to exact payment (seigniorage) for coinage. This school found
                    expression in the Act 18 Charles II. (1666), which permitted private persons to
                    have coined for them an unlimited quantity of gold or silver, at the public
                    mint, free of charge. Similar Acts were passed in Holland, France, and other
                    countries. But the crown retained the right to regulate the nominal value of
                    gold and silver coins, the exercise of which has had the greatest influence on
                    the relative market value of those metals.</p>
                <p>To check abuses of this prerogative the economical school next directed its
                    efforts towards the adoption of one in place of two metals for full legal tender
                    coins. The principal advocates of this change during the last century were Dutot
                    (1739) and Desrotours (1790), and during the present one Lord Liverpool (1808),
                    De Quincey (1849), and Chevalier (1856). The policy thus advocated was
                    practically adopted in Holland and England during the 18th century, and by the
                    latter definitively in 1816. It was accepted by the Monetary Conference
                    assembled at Paris June 20, 1867, and by the Commercial Convention at Berlin
                    October 20, 1868. In 1871 it was practically, though not definitively, adopted
                    by Germany, and since that date by several smaller states, including distant
                    Japan. In France (1874) and the United States (1873-78) the policy pursued has
                    been a waiting one. Full legal tender silver coins continue to be employed for
                    money, but the state has ceased to coin silver on private account. Either

                <p>The closure of the mints of all important commercial countries to silver, while
                    they have remained open to the free coinage of gold at a fixed valuation, has
                    enhanced the purchasing power of gold, compared "with either silver or other
                    commodities, about one-fourth. The price of uncoined silver being usually quoted
                    in gold, this phenomenon appears as a “fall of silver,” by which term it is
                    commonly known. This alleged fall, its causes, consequences, and remedies,
                    constitute the “Silver Question.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Production.—</hi> In the principal producing countries—the
                    United States, Mexico, Chili, and Peru—mining is free, and there are no official
                    returns of the production, which is therefore mere matter of conjecture. In the
                    United States it is the custom to value silver bullion at onesixteenth that of
                    gold. This unduly swells the value of the conjectural product of that country
                    more than onefourth (see <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the United States
                    Monetary Commission of 1876, Appendix, pp. 1-66). From a careful consideration
                    of the bullion movement, the total annual product of silver throughout the world
                    at the present time is estimated at between 50 and 60 million ounces, at which
                    figure it has remained steady upwards of ten years.</p>

                    quantity of silver used in the arts have met with little success, and the
                    statistics so obtained are defective. But the total production of silver in the
                    Western World, from the discovery of America to the present time, has been, in
                    value, about 1400 million pounds sterling, of which about 300 million pounds

                    may certainly recognize Borel, who, according to the Spanish chroniclers, was
                    count of Barcelona from 967 to 993, while the bishop may probably be identified
                    with Hatto, bishop of Vich or Ausona from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 960 to 971
                    or 972. In company with his two patrons Gerbert visited Rome, where the pope,
                    hearing of the young student’s proficiency in music and astronomy, induced him
                    to remain in Italy, and before long introduced him to the emperor Otto I. A
                    papal diploma, still extant, shows that Count Borel and Bishop Octo or Otho of
                    Ausona were at Rome in January 971, and, as all the other indications point to a
                    corresponding year, enables us to fix the chronology of Gerbert’s later
                    life.</p><p>When brought before the emperor, Gerbert admitted his skill in all
                    branches of the quadrivium, but lamented his comparative ignorance of logic.
                    Eager to supply this deficiency he seized the opportunity of following
                    Lothaire’s ambassador Garamnus, archdeacon of Rheims, to this city, for the sake
                    of studying under so famous a dialectician in the episcopal schools which were
                    then (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 972?) rising into reputation under the care of
                    Archbishop Adalbero (969-989). So promising a scholar soon attracted the
                    attention of Adalbero himself, and Gerbert was speedily invited to exchange his
                    position of learner for that of teacher. At Rheims he seems to have studied and
                    lectured for many years, having amongst his pupils, now or at a later time, Hugh
                    Capet’s son Robert, afterwards king of France, and Richer, to whose history we
                    owe almost every detail of his master’s early life. According to this writer
                    Gerbert’s fame began to spread over western Europe, throughout Gaul, Germany,
                    and Italy, till it roused the envy of a rival teacher, Otric of Saxony, in whom
                    we may doubtless recognize Octricus of Magdeburg, the favourite scholar of Otto
                    I., and, in earlier days, the instructor of St Adalbert, the apostle of the
                    Bohemians. Otric, suspecting that Gerbert erred in his classification of the
                    sciences, sent one of his own pupils to Rheims to take notes of his lectures,
                    and, finding his suspicions correct, accused him of his error before Otto II.
                    The emperor, to whom Gerbert was well known, appointed a time for the two
                    philosophers to argue before him; and Richer has left a long account of this
                    dialectical tournament at Ravenna, which lasted out a whole day and was only
                    terminated towards evening at the imperial bidding. The date of this controversy
                    seems to have been about Christmas 980, and it was probably followed almost
                    immediately by Otric’s death, October 1, 981.</p><p>It must have been about this
                    time (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 982) that Gerbert received the great abbey of
                    Bobbio from the emperor. That it was Otto II., and not, as formerly supposed,
                    Otto I., who gave him this benefice, seems evident from a diploma quoted by
                    Mabillon <hi rend="italic">(Annales,</hi> iv. 121). Richer, however, makes no
                    mention of this event; and it is only from allusions in Gerbert’s letters that
                    we learn how the new abbot’s attempts to enforce his dues waked a spirit of
                    discontent which at last drove him in November 983 to take refuge with his old
                    patron Adalbero. It was to no purpose that he appealed to the emperor and
                    empress for restitution or redress; and it was perhaps the hope of extorting his
                    reappointment to Bobbio, as a reward for his services to the imperial cause,
                    that changed the studious scholar of Rheims into the wily secretary of Adalbero.
                    It was a time of great moment in the history of Western Europe. Otto II. died in
                    December 983, leaving the empire to his infant heir Otto III. Lothaire claimed
                    the guardianship, and attempted to make use of his position to serve his own
                    purposes in Lorraine, which would in all probability have been lost to the
                    empire had it not been for the indefatigable efforts of Adalbero and Gerbert.
                    Into the obscure details of the succeeding years,</p></note> and some trifling
                    amounts each in China, Japan, Persia, &amp;c. On the whole it appears quite safe
                    to estimate the average annual consumption of silver in the arts and through
                    wear, tear, and loss as fully equal to three-fourths of the production. Lowe in
                    1822 estimated it at two-thirds. Silver is principally used for plate and
                    jewellery; it is also consumed in photography, and in numerous chemical
                    preparations, such as lunar caustic, indelible ink, hair dyes, fulminating
                    powder, &amp;c. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. de.)</hi></p>
