                    representatives in public life and in literature of the old pagan party at Rome,
                    was educated in Gaul, and, having discharged the functions of praetor and
                    quaestor, rose to higher offices, and in 373 was proconsul of Africa. His public
                    dignities, which included that of pontiff, his great wealth and high character,
                    added to his reputation for eloquence, marked him out as the champion of the
                    pagan senate against the measures which the Christian emperors directed against
                    the old state religion of Rome. In 382 he was banished from Rome by Gratian for
                    his protest against the removal of the statue and altar of Victory from the
                    senate-house, and in 384, when he was prefect of the city, he addressed to
                    Valentinian a letter praying for the restoration of these symbols. This is the
                    most interesting of his literary remains, and called forth two replies from St
                    Ambrose, as well as a poetical refutation from Prudentius. After this Symmachus
                    was involved in the rebellion of Maximus, but obtained his pardon from
                    Theodosius, and appears to have continued in public life up to his death.</p>
                <p>Of the writings of Symmachus we possess (1) ten books of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles,</hi> published after his death by his son. The model followed by the
                    writer is Pliny the Younger, and from a reference in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saturnalia</hi> of Macrobius (bk. v., i. § 7), in which Symmachus is introduced
                    as one of the interlocutors, it appears that his contemporaries deemed him
                    second to none of the ancients in the “rich and florid” style. The first edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> by Bart. Cynischus (s. <hi rend="italic"
                    >l. et a.,</hi> but published under Pope Julius II.) is very incomplete, and the
                    collection was only gradually completed by subsequent editors. (2) Fragments of
                    nine <hi rend="italic">Complimentary Orations</hi> from a palimpsest, of which
                    part is at Milan and part in the Vatican, were discovered by Mai, who published
                    the Milan fragments in 1815, the Roman ones in his <hi rend="italic">Seripiorum
                    Veterum Nova Collectio,</hi> vol. i. (1825), and the whole in 1846. The work was
                    not well done, and many corrections are given in a new collation by O. Seeck
                    (<hi rend="italic">Commentationes in Honorem Τh. Μommseni,</hi> Berlin, 1877, p.
                    595 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> which has been followed by an edition of the
                    works of Symmachus in the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Germanise Historica,</hi>
                    Berlin, 1883.</p>
