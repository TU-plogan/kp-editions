                    are concerned, all may be met with in the brackish water of certain littoral
                    districts. The majority have a compressed well-proportioned body, which in the
                    marine species is of a more elongate form, leading to the allied group of
                    Flute-Mouths <hi rend="italic">(Fistulariidae),</hi> which are, in fact,
                    gigantic marine sticklebacks. Their mouth is of moderate width, oblique, and
                    armed with small but firmly set teeth. But their most distinctive characteristic
                    consists in the armature of their head and body. The head is nearly entirely
                    protected by hard bone; even the cheeks, which in the majority of fishes are
                    covered with a naked or scaly skin, are in this genus cuirassed by the dilated
                    infraorbital bones. There are no scales developed on any part of the body, but a
                    series of hard and large scutes protects a greater or lesser portion of the
                    sides. The first dorsal fin and the ventrals are transformed into pointed
                    formidable spines, and joined to firm bony plates of the endoskeleton. With
                    regard to the degree in which this armature is developed, not only do the
                    species differ from each other, but almost every species shows an extraordinary
                    amount of variation, so that some older naturalists have distinguished a
                    multitude of species, whilst the majority of the present day are inclined to
                    reduce their number considerably. About ten kinds may be taken to be
                    specifically distinct.</p>
                <p>So far as is known at present, all sticklebacks construct a nest for the
                    reception of the spawn, which is jealously guarded by the male until the young
                    are hatched, which event takes place in from ten to eighteen days after
                    oviposition. He also protects them for the first few days of their existence,
                    and provides them with food, until they gradually stray from their home. The
                    construction of the nest varies in the different species.</p>
                <p>Sticklebacks are short-lived animals; they are said to reach an age of only three
                    or four years; yet their short life, at least that of the males, is full of
                    excitement. During the first year of their existence, before the breeding-season
                    begins, they live in small companies in still pools or gently flowing brooks.
                    But with the return of the warmer season each male selects a territory, which he
                    fiercely defends against all comers, especially against intruders of his own
                    species and sex, and to which he invites all females, until the nest is filled
                    with ova. At this period he also assumes a bridal dress, painted with blue and
                    red tints. The eggs are of comparatively large size, one female depositing only
                    from 50 to 100; but, as the females deposit their spawn in nests of different
                    males, the number of ova contained in one nest does not exceed one hundred.</p>
                <p>Of the species known not one has so wide a geographical range, and has so well
                    been studied, as the common British Three-Spined Stickleback <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gastrosteus aculeatus).</hi> It is found everywhere in northern and central
                    Europe, northern Asia, and North America. The development of its scutes and
                    spines varies exceedingly, and specimens may bo found without any lateral scutes
                    and with short spines, others with only a few scutes and moderately sized
                    spines, and again others which possess a complete row of scutes from the head to
                    the caudal fin, and in which the fin-spines are twice as long and strong as in
                    other varieties. On the whole, the smooth varieties are more numerous in
                    southern than in northern localities. This species swarms in some years in
                    prodigious numbers; in Pennant’s time amazing shoals appeared in the fens of
                    Lincolnshire every seven or eight years. Their numbers may perhaps be conceived
                    from the fact that a man employed in collecting them gained, for a considerable
                    time, four shillings a day by selling them at the rate of a halfpenny a bushel.
                    No instance of a similar increase of this fish has been observed in our time,
                    and this possibly may be due to the diminished number of suitable
                    breeding-places in consequence of the general introduction of artificial
                    drainage. This species usually constructs its nest on the bottom, excavating a
                    hollow in which a bed of grass, rootlets, or fibres is prepared; walls are then
                    raised, aud the whole is roofed over with the like material. The nest is an inch
                    and more in diameter, with a small aperture for an entrance.</p>
                <p>The Ten-Spined Stickleback <hi rend="italic">(Gastrosteus pungitius)</hi> is so
                    called from the number of spines usually composing its first dorsal fin, which,
                    however, may be sometimes reduced to eight or nine or increased to eleven. It is
                    smaller than the three-spined species, rarely exceeding 2 inches in length. Its
                    geographical range nearly coincides with that of the other species, but it is
                    more locally distributed, and its range in northern Asia is not known. With
                    regard to its habits, it differs from the common species only in the selection
                    of the site for its nest, which is generally placed among weeds above the bottom
                    of the water. Breeding males are readily recognized at a distance by the
                    intensely black colour of the lower parts of their body.</p>
                <p>Both these species are for their size extremely voracious, causing no small
                    amount of injury if allowed in breeding-ponds in which valuable fish are
                    preserved. During the whole time they are not engaged in their breeding
                    operations they are in pursuit of food. A small stickleback kept in an aquarium
                    devoured, in five hours’ time, seventy-four newly-hatched dace, which were about
                    a quarter of an inch long. Two days after it swallowed sixty-two, and would
                    probably have eaten as many every day, could they have been procured.</p>
                <p>The Sea Stickleback <hi rend="italic">(Gastrosteus spinachia)</hi> is a much
                    larger and more slender species than those mentioned; it attains to a length of
                    7 inches, and is armed with fifteen short spines on the back. It is extremely
                    common round the British coasts, but never congregates in large shoals. At
                    suitable localities of the coast which are sheltered from the waves and
                    overgrown with sea-weed, especially in rock-pools, one or two males establish
                    themselves with their harems, and may be observed without difficulty, being
                    quite as fearless as their freshwater cousins. Harbours and shallows covered
                    with <hi rend="italic">Zostera</hi> are likewise favourite haunts of this
                    species, although the water may be brackish. The nest is always firmly attached
                    to sea-weed, and sometimes suspended from an overhanging frond. This species
                    inhabits only the northern coasts of Europe.</p>
