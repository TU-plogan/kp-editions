                    type="authorial"><p>This chemical element has already been treated in its
                    scientific aspects under <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi> (vol. <hi

                    and varied, arrange themselves under three heads,—(1) <hi rend="italic">metallic
                    sulphates,</hi> of which hydrated sulphate of lime, CaSO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>.2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, gypsum, is the most abundant; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">metallic sulphides,</hi> a numerous family, including the majority
                    of metallic ores, of which, however, only iron pyrites serves as a source for
                    sulphur; (3) <hi rend="italic">elementary sulphur.</hi> In the organic world we
                    meet with sulphur everywhere, this element forming an essential (though
                    quantitatively subordinate) component of the albumenoids, a class of compounds
                    contained in all vegetable and animal structures. Of organic materials rich in
                    sulphur we may name animal hair (containing about 4 per cent.) and the essential
                    oils of the onion, garlic, and mustard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elementary Sulphur.</hi></p>
                <p>This occurs as a mineral chiefly in the Upper Miocene deposits and in the Flötz,
                    associated in general with gypsum, massive limestone, and marl. Commercially
                    important deposits are found in Sicily (provinces of Caltanissetta, Girgenti,
                    Catania), Italy (Latera and Scrofano, province of Rome), Spain (Teruel and
                    Arcos), France (dept. Vaucluse), Transylvania, Poland (Swoszowice near Cracow),
                    and Germany (Lüneburg, in Hanover). The exhalations of volcanoes include, as a
                    rule, sulphurous acid, SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and sulphuretted
                    hydrogen, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S, which two gases, if moist, readily
                    decompose each other into water and sulphur,—a circumstance which accounts for
                    the constant occurrence of sulphur in all volcanic districts. Mt Purace in
                    Colombia wears a cap of sulphur (derived from its own crater) which accumulates
                    at the rate of about 2 feet per annum,— its superficial area amounting to 1435
                    square yards. The solfatara at Bahara Saphinque on the Red Sea is said to yield
                    600 tons of sulphur annually. The molten sulphur discharged from the crater of
                    the Alaghez in the Armenian highlands forms solid excrescences, which the
                    natives dislodge from their inaccessible positions by means of rifleshots. A
                    sulphur deposit near the Borax Lake in California is estimated to contain 20,000
                    tons. Most of the sulphur or brimstone of commerce comes from the rich fields of
                    Sicily, where in 1884 the annual production had almost reached 400,000 tons. The
                    mode of mining there adopted is by a network of horizontal galleries (tunnels)
                    driven through the deposit; the solid squares thus marked off are hewn out, a
                    central pillar being left to support the roof. The total excavation is generally
                    100 feet high and from 25 to 50 wide; not unfrequently the whole collapses. Down
                    to a comparatively recent date all the work used to be done by hand, boys of
                    eight to ten years of age being employed to carry the ore to the shaft and
                    thence to the surface; only where a mine has reached a depth of 325 feet or more
                    is water-power, if available, resorted to. Since 1868, however, the ore at
                    Grotta Calda at least has been raised by properly constructed shafts with the
                    help of steam-power, and this system is spreading.</p>
                <p>The Sicilian ores are customarily classified as follows :—</p>
                <p>Per 100 parts of ore Per 100 parts of ore</p>
                <p>Sulphur present. Sulphur recovered.</p>
                <p>Richest ores .... 30-40 20-25</p>

                <p>Ordinary 20-25 10-15</p>
                <p>The poor yield of actual sulphur is explained by the rather primitive method used
                    for its extraction. A semicircular or semi-elliptical pit <hi rend="italic"
                    >(calcarone)</hi> about 33 feet in diameter and 8 deep is dug into the slope of
                    a hill, and the sides are coated with a wall of stone. The sole consists of two
                    halves slanting against each other, the line of intersection forming a
                    descending gutter which runs to the outlet. This outlet having been closed by
                    small stones and sulphate of lime cement, the pit is filled with sulphur ore,
                    whieh is heaped up considerably beyond the edge of the pit and covered with a
                    layer of burnt-out ore. In building up the heap a number of narrow vertical
                    passages are left to afford a draught for the fire. The ore is kindled from
                    above and the fire so regulated (by making or unmaking air-holes in the
                    covering) that, by the heat produced by the combustion of the least sufficient
                    quantity of sulphur, the rest is liquefied. The molten sulphur accumulates on
                    the sole, whence it is from time to time run out into a square stone receptacle,
                    from whieh it is ladled into damp poplar-wood moulds and so brought into the
                    shape of truncated cones weighing 110 to 130 lb each. These cakes are sent out
                    into commerce. A calcarone with a capacity of 28,256 cubic feet burns for about
                    two months, and yields about 200 tons of sulphur. The immense volumes of
                    sulphurous acid evolved give lise to many complaints; all the minor pits suspend
                    work during the summer to avoid destruction of the crops. A calcarone that is to
                    be used all the year round must be at least 220 yards from any inhabited place
                    and 110 from any field under cultivation.</p>
                <p>The yield of sulphur, as seen from the table given above, is miserably small, but
                    the scarcity of fuel in Sicily almost prohibits the introduction of any more
                    rational method. As sulphur fuses at 114° C., high-pressure steam at once
                    suggests itself as a suitable medium of heating. In the sulphur-works of Latera,
                    in the province of Rome, the following apparatus (constructed by Gritti) is<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n660/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0660-0635"/> being used with success. A vertical truncated
                    perforated cone of thick sheet-iron serves for the reception of the ore. This
                    cone is enclosed in a similar cone of iron, which terminates in a detachable
                    deep iron basin below, and is provided with a tightly fitting lid. All tho
                    joints in this outer shell are steam-tight. The inner cone having been charged
                    and the lid secured, steam of sufficient pressure to ensure a temperature of
                    from 125° to 135° C. is blown into the apparatus, which soon causes the sulphur
                    to melt and collect in the basin below. After from 30 to 50 minutes, reckoning
                    from the time when the above temperature is reached, the operation is completed.
                    The steam is then turned off and the sulphur made to run from the basin into a
                    receptacle beside the apparatus, to be cast into sticks or cakes. The iron basin
                    is then detached, and by turning aside an iron damper which held the ore in its
                    place the exhausted ore is made to drop into a pit. Each charge of ore amounts
                    to about from 25½ to 26½ cwts., containing about 385 lb of sulphur. Of this some
                    360 lb are recovered as saleable sulphur, at the expense of about 286 lb of
                    oak-wood as fuel.</p>
                <p>R. E. Bollmann in 1867 proposed to extract the sulphur by means of bisulphide of
                    carbon. The process, after having been tried at Bagnoli near Naples and given up
                    as hopeless, was introduced in 1873 in Swoszowice near Cracow under the guidance
                    of Winkler and has proved a success. The apparatus is constructed so that the
                    bisulphide used in the process of extraction is recovered by distillation; the
                    loss of bisulphide amounts only to one-half per cent., sometimes to less, and
                    the sulphur produced is very pure. But by far the greater part of the purer
                    qualities of commercial sulphur is produced from Sicilian calcarone sulphur by
                    distillation, which removes the 3 per cent. or so of earthy impurities contained
                    in it. The following apparatus (invented originally by Michel of Marseilles and
                    improved subsequently by others) enables the manufacturer to produce either of
                    two forms of “refined” sulphur which commerce demands. It consists of a
                    stone-built chamber of about 2825 cubic feet capacity, whieh communicates
                    directly with two slightly slanting tubular retorts of iron, each of which holds
                    about 660 lb of sulphur. The retorts are charged with molten sulphur from an
                    upper reservoir, which is kept at the requisite temperature by means of the lost
                    heat of the retort fires. The chamber has a safety valve at the top of its
                    vault, which is so balanced that the least surplus pressure from within sends it
                    up. The first puff of sulphur vapour which enters the chamber takes fire and
                    converts the air of the chamber into a mixture of nitrogen and sulphurous acid.
                    The next following instalments of vapour, getting diffused throughout a large
                    mass of relatively cold gas, condense into a kind of “snow,” known in commerce
                    and valued as “flowers of sulphur” (<hi rend="italic">flores sulphuris).</hi> By
                    conducting the distillation slowly, so that the temperature within the chamber
                    remains at a sufficiently low degree, it is possible to obtain the whole of the
                    product in the form of “flowers.” If compact (“roll ”) sulphur is wanted the
                    distillation is made to go on at the quickest admissible rate. The temperature
                    of the interior of the chamber soon rises to more than the fusing-point of
                    sulphur (114° C. ), and the distillate accumulates at the bottom as a liquid,
                    which is tapped off from time to time to be cast into the customary form of rods
                    of about 1½ inches diameter.</p>
                <p>In some places sulphur is extracted from iron pyrites by one of two methods. The
                    pyrites is subjected to dry distillation from out of iron or fire-clay tubular
                    retorts at a bright red heat. One-third of the sulphur is volatilized—3FeS <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> —and obtained as a
                    distillate. The second method is analogous to the calcarone method of liquation:
                    the ore is placed in a lime-kiln like furnace over a mass of kindled fuel to
                    start a partial combustion of the mineral, and the process is so regulated that,
                    by the heat generated, the unburnt part is decomposed with elimination of
                    sulphur, which collects in the molten state on an inverted roof-shaped sole
                    below the furnace and is thence conducted into a cistern. Such pyrites sulphur
                    is usually contaminated with arsenic, and consequently is of less value than
                    Sicilian sulphur, which is characteristically free from this impurity.</p>
                <p>The substance known as “milk of sulphur” <hi rend="italic">{lac sulphuris)</hi>
                    is very finely divided sulphur produced by the following, or some analogous,
                    chemical process. One part of quicklime is slaked by means of 6 parts of water,
                    and the paste produced diluted with 24 parts of water; 2·3 parts of flowers of
                    sulphur are added; and the whole is boiled for about an hour or longer, when the
                    sulphur dissolves,—</p>
                <p>3CaO + 12S = 2CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> + CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>The mixed solution of pentasulphide and thiosulphate of calcium thus produced is
                    clarified, diluted more largely in a tub, and then mixed with enough of pure
                    dilute hydrochloric acid to produce a feebly alkaline mixture; this shows that
                    only the bulk of the pentasulphide is decomposed,—CaS <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> + 2HCl = CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> S + (4S of precipitated sulphur). The addition of more acid would produce
                    an additional supply of sulphur (by the action of the H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> on the
                    dissolved H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S); but this thiosulphate sulphur is
                    yellow and compact, while the CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> part has the
                    desired qualities, forming an extremely fine, almost white, powder. The
                    precipitate is washed, collected, and dried at a very moderate heat. It is used
                    as a medicine. If sulphuric acid is used instead of hydrochloric acid the
                    preparation is apt to be contaminated with hydrated sulphate of lime. In the
                    United Kingdom, indeed, precipitated sulphate of lime used to be added
                    intentionally to produce what the public had got accustomed to; but this
                    practice has been rightly stopped by the authorities.</p>
                <p>During the year 1875 the production of sulphur in Europe is stated to have been
                    as follows :—</p>

                    used for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Subjoined is an enumeration of some

                    mercuric salt (black, HgS + Hg or HgS respectively), copper (greenish black,

                    (yellow, SnS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>). The sulphides A are insoluble; the
                    sulphides B are soluble in sulphide of ammonium solution, and the latter, from
                    this solution, can be reprecipitated by acidification with dilute sulphuric or
                    hydrochloric acid. The brown SnS precipitated from stannous salts is insoluble
                    in the (colourless) solution of (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi

                    following metals are not precipitated from their salt solutions if these are
                    acidified sufficiently by added mineral acid; but they are precipitated from
                    their neutral or alkaline solutions by sulphide of ammonium :—iron (black, FeS),
                    nickel (black, NiS), cobalt (black, CoS), manganese (flesh-coloured, MnS), zinc
                    (white, ZnS). Aluminium and chromium, given as salts of their oxides, R <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, are precipitated by
                    sulphide of ammonium as hydrated oxides (Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    these as ammonia, NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, the H <hi rend="subscript">

                    precipitated as such. The ordinary salts of group D (barium, strontium, calcium,
                    magnesium), and the salts of the alkali metals E (potassium, sodium, &amp;c.)
                    generally, give no precipitate with either sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphide of
                    ammonium. It is easy to translate what we have stated into a method for the
                    separation of groups A, B, C (D and E), from one another.</p>

                    prepared by passing perfectly dry chlorine gas over heated sulphur contained in
                    a retort, the retort being connected with a condenser constructed so that the

                    and benzol and bisulphide of carbon mix with it in all proportions without

                    chloride of sulphur is used for the vulcanization of (chiefly sheet)
                    india-rubber. The mixture is readily imbibed by the rubber, which when allowed
                    to dry (at from 22° to 25° C.) gives up the bisulphide of carbon and the
                    chlorine of the reagent, the latter as HC1, but retains its sulphur in a state
                    of chemical combination.</p>
                <p>The gas SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi>
                    vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">v.</hi> p. 501), produced extempore by the combustion
                    of sulphur, is used for the bleaching of silk, wool, straw, and wicker work,
                    also for the disinfection of rooms and of wine-casks (to prevent acetous
                    fermentation). A solution of the gas in water is manufactured industrially, for
                    use chiefly in the manufacture of sugar. It is added to the beetroot or cane
                    juice to prevent its fermentation while awaiting concentration. A solution of
                    “bisulphite of lime” (produced by saturating milk of lime with sulphurous acid
                    gas) is much used as an antiseptic generally. Liquefied sulphur dioxide has
                    found an application as a frigorific for the manufacture of ice. The apparatus
                    used is so constructed that the volatilized sulphur dioxide is all caught and
                    recondensed. Sulphurous acid when required as such or for the making of
                    sulphites is always produced, even industrially, from oil of vitriol, by
                    reduction with either sulphur or charcoal. In the heat the reactions are 2SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + S=3SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and 2SO <hi

                    practically in castiron vessels. The presence of carbonic acid in the gas
                    produced by the charcoal process does not interfere with the preparation of
                    sulphites.</p>
                <p>The soda salt Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, known
                    commercially as hyposulphite of soda, is used industrially for chiefly two
                    purposes, namely, (1) as a solvent for chloride of silver in photography (se <hi

                    “antichlor” in paper-making, to destroy the remnants of chlorine in bleached
                    paper pulp. To understand its action we need only know that chlorine and water
                    in such cases act like oxygen,— Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = 2HCl + O; every 4 × 0 thus produced converts one S

                    > 2</hi> into 2SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of sulphuric acid. For the
                    preparation of this salt a great many methods have been invented. The simplest
                    to explain is the treatment of a solution of normal sulphite of sodium with
                    sulphur,—SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Na. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + S =
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Na <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Instead of adding free sulphur, Liebig prepares a
                    solution of polysulphide of sodium (by dissolving sulphur in caustic-soda ley)
                    and adds it to the sulphite. The surplus sulphur combines with the sulphite;
                    besides, the polysulphide contains thiosulphate from the first. Another method
                    is to pass sulphurous acid through a solution of sulphide of sodium. Here, by
                    first intention, if we may say so, sulphite of sodium and H <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> S are produced; but the H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S and the excess
                    of SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> give water and sulphur, and two-thirds of
                    this sulphur unite with the sulphite first formed into thiosulphate. The crude
                    sulphide of calcium, which is produced so largely in the Le Blanc process (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Sodium,</hi><hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> p. 243), when
                    exposed to the air gets oxidized, with formation of calcium thiosulphate, which
                    can be extracted by means of water and converted into sodium salt by double
                    decomposition with carbonate or sulphate of soda. Pure thiosulphate of soda
                    forms large transparent monoclinic prisms, which lose no water on exposure to
                    ordinary air in the cold. At about 48° C. they fuse into a liquid, which may
                    remain liquid on cooling, but solidifies suddenly when a fragment of the solid
                    salt is dropped in. 100 parts of water dissolve at 16° 25° 35° 45° C.</p>

                <p>The anhydride SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is used largely in the manufacture
                    of tar colours. Oil of vitriol is decomposed by dropping it on a mass of
                    platinum scrap kept at a bright red heat within a fireclay retort, —SO <hi

                    and, after removing the water—the bulk by partial condensation aud the rest by
                    means of vitriol—the sulphur dioxide and the oxygen are made to recombine by
                    passing them over platinized asbestos at a dull red heat. The fumes of SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> formed are condensed in a dry receiver by application
                    of cold from without (Winkler’s process).</p>
                <p>The fact that finely divided platinum, in virtue of its power of condensing
                    oxygen, induces the union of SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and ½O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> into SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> has been known for
                    a long time; but all attempts to utilize the reaction for the production of
                    sulphuric acid from a mixture of sulphur dioxide, air, and nitrogen produced by
                    the combustion of sulphur or pyrites in air have failed. The platinum acts too
                    feebly in the presence of the unavoidably large mass of nitrogen, and soon loses
                    its efficacy altogether owing to the accumulation on it of particles of
                    incombustible matter from the kiln gases. Oxide of chromium, Cr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and oxide of iron, Fe
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, act like platinum,
                    through transitory formation of the respective sulphates—the gases produced in
                    pyrites kilns include a considerable quantity of ready-made SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> —but they also are not available practically for the
                    making of sulphuric acid. In short, all attempts to produce this reagent
                    otherwise than by means of the old Nordhausen or the chamber process have so far
                    been unqualified failures industrially. In regard to the chamber process we may
                    add a few notes to what has been said under <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi>
                    (vol. v. p. 503 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.). As stated in that article, nitrous
                    acid, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, when
                    brought into contact with sufficiently strong vitriol unites with it, giving
                    rise to bodies similar to chamber crystals,— <hi rend="subscript"> + + 2g</hi>
                    θ^ <hi rend="subscript"> = 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> θ-θ; or, what
                    comes practically to the same,</p>
                <p>N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (out of the vitriol) = S0 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>

                <p>In the presence of sufficient water this union does not take place, because the
                    water causes the product to break up as shown by the equation if read from right
                    to left. These facts explain why a stronger acid than one containing some 60 per
                    cent. or so of real H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> cannot be produced directly in the chamber. This inconvenience has led,
                    in the hands of Gay-Lussac, to an important improvement on the original process.
                    He inserts between the chamber outlet and the chimney a tower made of acid-proof
                    stone and filled with pieces of coke, over which concentrated oil of vitriol is
                    made to trickle down while the chamber gases ascend through the tower on their
                    way to the chimney. The vitriol absorbs all or most of the N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which would otherwise
                    be lost. But the practical reliberation of the N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> was beset with very great difficulties, which have
                    been fully overcome only by a more recent invention of Glover’s. He places
                    between the kiln and the entrance side of the chamber a tower similar in
                    construction to Gay-Lussac’s, which the kiln gases have to traverse before they
                    get into the latter. Through the tower he runs at the same time a stream of
                    nitrated (Gay-Lussac) acid and one of ordinary chamber acid. The latter acts on
                    the nitrated acid as water; at least it virtually sets free the combined nitrous
                    acid, so that it is reduced by the sulphurous acid coming from the kiln to
                    nitric oxide, which travels into the chamber with the rest of the gases to do
                    duty there in the well-known manner. As the kiln gases are very hot, a
                    considerable quantity of the water which goes through a Glover tower (as chamber
                    acid) is volatilized and thus made to supply part of the steam necessary for the
                    process. The Glover tower, besides fulfilling its primary object, serves to
                    concentrate part of the chamber acid and to supply part of the necessary steam
                    without expense for fuel. The expenditure of nitrate of soda, which before the
                    introduction of the two towers used to amount to from 8 to 13 parts per 100 of
                    sulphur burned, has been reduced to from 3·5 to 6·5. The actual loss of nitrous
                    acid of course is the less, <hi rend="italic">caeieris paribus,</hi> the larger
                    the chamber, and (for a given chamber) the greater the care with which the
                    process is conducted. But even under the most skilful management more nitrous
                    acid is lost than can be accounted for by the unavoidable imperfections in the
                    apparatus and in the mode of working them. From the investigations of Weber and
                    of Frémy it appears that, in the presence of relatively much water more
                    especially, part of the nitrous acid suffers reduction, not to nitric, but to
                    nitrous oxide, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, which, being unsusceptible of
                    direct oxidation, is lost for the process.</p>
                <p>For a great many purposes <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the manufacture of
                    “superphosphate” from bones or mineral phosphate of lime) the 60 to 64 per cent.
                    acid which comes out of the chamber can be used as it is; but it is not strong
                    enough for all purposes. In the production of stronger (from chamber) acid the
                    first step always is to run the acid into long, very shallow lead pans and to
                    simply boil it down in these, either by the application of heat from below, in
                    which case the bottoms of the pans must be protected by making them rest on
                    plates of iron, or by enclosing the pans in a vault and causing the Hot gases of
                    a furnace fire to strike along the surface of the acid. The result in either
                    case is that, while more and more water goes away as steam, the residual acid of
                    course gets stronger and stronger. But with the strength the boiling-point
                    rises, and, as necessary consequences, the extent to which the acid attacks the
                    lead (with formation of sulphate and sulphurous acid) and the danger of melting
                    down the pans by local overheating become greater and greater. When the acid has
                    come up to about from 78 to 80 per cent. (corresponding to a specific gravity of
                    1·7 after cooling), it is not safe to push the concentration any further, quite
                    apart from the fact that an acid of 80 per cent. when boiled down emits a very
                    appreciable proportion of acid along with the volatilized water. An acid of 1·7
                    indeed is amply strong enough for a variety of applications, such as, for
                    instance, the conversion of salt into sulphate. If a stronger acid is wanted the
                    concentration must be continued in glass or platinum retorts.</p>
                <p>The vitriol maker’s glass retort, as a rule, consists of two detachable parts,
                    namely, a pear-shaped body about 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> feet high and nearly 2 feet in diameter, and a glass
                    alembic whose wider end fits the mouth of the pear, while its narrower outlet
                    end points downwards and terminates within a slightly slanting lead-pipe, which
                    conveys the distillate to a leaden tank. The retort rests on a layer of sand
                    contained in a closely fitting iron basin, and the lateral space between the two
                    is filled completely with sand. The iron basin is suspended within a furnace in
                    such a way that only it, and not any part of the retort, is touched directly by
                    the flame. As a rule, some twelve retorts stand side by side, each in its own<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n662/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0662-0637"/> sandbath, and are heated by the same fire. As the
                    temperature of the boiling liquid and of the vapour rises at the end to beyond
                    300° C., a sudden draught of cold air might cause rupture of a retort; the
                    apparatus is therefore placed in a special room accessible only through double
                    doors, and the inner door is not permitted to be opened before the outer has
                    been shut. The acid, as it is boiling down, gets stronger and stronger, because,
                    although the vapour is very strongly acid from the first, its percentage <hi
                    rend="italic">p'</hi> of real H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> at any given stage is less than the value <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> whieh obtains in the boiling liquid as it is at the time.
                    <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> at a given barometric pressure is a fixed function of
                    <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> only, and increases as <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    increases; the difference <hi rend="italic">ρ -p'</hi> accordingly gets less and
                    less. It becomes nil, not when the acid has become pure H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, but when it has come up to the
                    composition 12SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3+</hi> 13H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    O (Marignac). This particular hydrate only boils without change of composition;
                    even pure H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> when
                    distilled, by giving up more than 1SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> for 1H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, becomes reduced to that hydrate 12SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 13HO, which then boils without further change of
                    composition. A stronger acid than “Marignac,” as we may call it, cannot be
                    produced by the concentration of weaker acid, and even its production (from 1·7
                    acid) involves a very considerable loss of acid as distillate. Hence practically
                    the process is stopped when the acid in the retorts has come up to some 96 per
                    cent. of H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which
                    is ascertained by the specific gravity of the last runnings being at a certain
                    value. As soon as this point is reached the retorts are allowed to cool till the
                    contents can be withdrawn with safety by means of lead siphons into glass
                    carboys. This, however, means a considerable loss of time and fuel; besides, the
                    process of distilling from out of glass vessels is not free from danger, and for
                    these reasons it is preferred in many establishments to concentrate the pan acid
                    in large platinum stills, although these are extremely expensive. The great
                    advantage of the platinum still is that it admits of continuous working; while
                    pan acid (containing say 1 lb of water per <hi rend="italic">N</hi> lb of full
                    strength—96 per cent. or so—acid) runs in, and a far weaker acid (containing for
                    the same period of time 1 lb of water and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> lb of full
                    strength acid) is distilling over, the balance <hi rend="italic">N-n</hi> lb of
                    finished acid is being withdrawn by means of a platinum siphon. The outer limb
                    of the siphon in its middle portion divides into a system of four narrower tubes
                    and is cooled down by means of a cold-water jacket surrounding it, so that the
                    acid can be run directly into carboys.</p>
                <p>The platinum retort in its latest form has a large undulating bottom made of
                    strong metal, on which a rapidly converging low body joins, made of thinner
                    metal because it is not so directly exposed to the flame. Along with this still
                    a flat platinum pan is used with an undulating bottom similar to that of the
                    still for the preliminary concentration of the acid. As platinum is not liable
                    to fuse or be attacked by any strength of boiling acid, a relatively small
                    platinum pan does as much work as a far larger one made of lead.</p>

                <p>Sulphate of aluminium, Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> +18H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, the
                    active ingredient of <hi rend="smallcaps">Alum</hi> (vol. i. p. 643), is now
                    being produced industrially in a state of perfect freedom from iron, and is more
                    and more taking the place of alum. Paper-makers, at least, no longer use
                    anything else for the production of alumina soap, which in machine-made paper
                    serves as the principal ingredient of the size. The crude salt is easily
                    produced by treatment of relatively pure bauxite (native hydrated alumina) or
                    china clay with chamber acid at a suitable temperature. The resulting mass is
                    dissolved in water, the undissolved matter (silica, &amp;c.) allowed to settle,
                    the clear liquor drawn off, and from it an apology for what is wanted is
                    obtained by evaporation to a small volume and allowing to crystallize. But the
                    salt thus obtained is always contaminated with a variety of foreign sulphates,
                    including sulphate of iron, and this last-named impurity, for the majority of
                    applications, cannot be suffered to remain. One of the best methods for its
                    removal, if not the best, is that discovered by Semper and Fahlberg: the
                    solution, which must contain all its iron as ferric salt and contain somewhat
                    less than the normal proportion of sulphuric acid, is digested with hydrated
                    binoxide of lead. In the course of about a week all the iron is completely
                    precipitated. The better qualities of sulphate of alumina nowadays have at most
                    only a few thousandths per cent. of iron.</p>
                <p>Sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) is made technically in chiefly two ways. One
                    method is to heat metallic copper to redness in air until it is almost
                    completely oxidized, and to dissolve the oxide by means of dilute sulphuric
                    acid. The Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O present behaves like a mixture of
                    metal and CuO. Another process starts from the subsulphide Cu <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S (produced metallurgically as “mat,” or perhaps
                    expressly from its elements), and converts this into sulphate and oxide by
                    careful roasting. The product is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid. Large
                    quantities of blue vitriol are produced incidentally in the “parting” of
                    auriferous silver (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gold,</hi> vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >x.</hi> p. 749) by means of oil of vitriol. Sulphate of copper crystallizes
                    from its aqueous solution in large transparent blue crystals of the triclinic
                    system their composition is CuSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> 5H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. The crystals are stable in the air. At 100° C. they
                    lose 4H <hi rend="subscript"> 2O</hi>, the last H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    requiring a temperature of 200° C. for its expulsion. The anhydrous salt is
                    dirty white; it readily reunites with water, and consequently is available as a
                    dehydrating agent, for instance, for the preparation of absolute alcohol from
                    spirit of wine. 100 parts of water dissolve at 0° 10° 20° 50° 100° C.</p>
                <p>31·6 37·0 42·3 65·8 203·3 parts of crystallized salt (Poggiale). The salt is
                    insoluble in alcohol. Blue vitriol is used largely in electrotyping and for many
                    other purposes.</p>
                <p>Subjoined are two general tests for sulphur. (1) All sulphur compounds when
                    brought in contact at a red heat with a mixture of nitre and carbonate of soda
                    (or some other equivalent alkaline oxidizing mixture) are changed so that the
                    sulphur assumes the form of alkaline sulphate, which can be extracted by means
                    of water. From the (filtered) solution the SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> is
                    precipitated by addition of chloride of barium as BaSO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>,—a white powdery precipitate characteristically insoluble in water and in
                    dilute acids. (2) Any non-volatile sulphur compound, when heated on charcoal in
                    a reducing flame with carbonate of soda, yields sulphide of sodium (“hepar”),
                    which, when moistened with water on a silver coin, produces a black stain of
                    metallic sulphide. (Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Selenium</hi> vol. xxi. pp.
