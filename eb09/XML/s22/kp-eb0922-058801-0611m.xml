                    (1721-1792), an eminent line engraver, was descended from the Scottish family of
                    Strange, or Strang, of Balcasky, Fife, and was born in the Mainland of Orkney,
                    on July 14, 1721. In his youth he spent some time in an attorney’s office; but,
                    having manifested a taste for drawing, he was apprenticed, in 1735, to Richard
                    Cooper, an engraver in Edinburgh. After leaving Cooper in 1741, he started on
                    his own account as an engraver, and had attained a fair position when, in 1745,
                    he joined the Jacobite army as a member of the corps of life guards. He engraved
                    a half-length of the Young Pretender, and also etched plates for a bank-note
                    designed for the payment of the troops. He was present at the battle of
                    Culloden, and after the defeat remained in hiding in the Highlands, but
                    ultimately returned to Edinburgh, where, in 1747, he married Isabella, only
                    daughter of William Lumisden, son of a bishop of Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>In the following year he proceeded to Rouen, and there studied drawing under J.
                    B. Descamps, carrying off the first prize in the Academy of Design. In 1749 he
                    removed to Paris, and placed himself under the celebrated Le Bas. It was from
                    this master that he learned the use of the dry point, an instrument which he
                    greatly improved, and employed with excellent effect in his own engravings. In
                    1750 Strange returned to England. Presently he settled in London along with his
                    wife and daughter, and superintended the illustrations of Dr William Hunter’s
                    great work on the <hi rend="italic">Gravid Uterus,</hi> published in 1774. The
                    plates were engraved from red chalk drawings by Van Rymsdyk, now preserved in
                    the Hunterian Museum, Glasgow, and two of them were executed with great skill by
                    Strange’s own hand. By his plates of the Magdalen and Cleopatra, engraved after
                    Guido in 1753, he at once established his professional reputation.</p>
                <p>He was invited in 1759 to engrave the portraits of the prince of Wales and Lord
                    Bute, by Allan Ramsay, but declined, on the ground of the insufficient
                    remuneration offered and of the pressure of more congenial work after the
                    productions of the Italian masters. His refusal was attributed to his Jacobite
                    proclivities, and it led to an acrimonious correspondence with Ramsay, and to
                    the loss, for the time, of royal patronage. In 1760 Strange started on a
                    long-meditated tour in Italy. He studied in Florence, Naples, Parma, Bologna,
                    and Rome, executing innumerable drawings, of which many—the Day of Correggio,
                    the Danae and the Venus and Adonis of Titian, the St Cecilia of Raphael, and the
                    Barberini Magdalen of Guido, &amp;c.—were afterwards reproduced by his burin. On
                    the Continent he was received with great distinction, and he was elected a
                    member of the academies of Rome, Florence, Parma, and Paris. He left Italy in
                    1764, and, having engraved in the French capital the Justice and the Meekness of
                    Raphael, from the Vatican, he carried them with him to London in the following
                    year.</p>
                <p>The rest of his life was spent mainly in these two cities, in the diligent
                    prosecution of his art. In 1766 he was elected a member of the Incorporated
                    Society of Artists, and in 1775, piqued by the exclusion of engravers from the
                    Royal Academy, he published an attack on that body, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >An Enquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Royal Academy of Arts at
                    London,</hi> and prefaced by a long letter to Lord Bute. In 1787 he engraved
                    West’s Apotheosis of the Princes Octavius and Alfred, and was rewarded with the
                    honour of knighthood. He died in London on the 5th of July 1792.</p>
                <p>In the technique of engraving Strange was a master. His line is tender and
                    flowing, without monotony or confusion, and his expression of flesh is
                    characterized by uncommon delicacy and transparency. In draftsmanship his works
                    are often defective.</p>
                <p>After his death a splendid edition of reserved proofs of his engravings was
                    issued; and a catalogue of his works, by Charles Blanc, was published in 1848 by
                    Rudolph Weigel of Leipsic, forming part of <hi rend="italic">Le Graveur en
                    Taille Douce.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Sir Robert Strange, Knt.,
                    and his Brother-in-law Andrew Lumisden,</hi> by James Dennistoun of Dennistoun,
                    1855.</p>
