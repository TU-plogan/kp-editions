                    county town of Stirlingshire, is finely situated on the slopes of an isolated
                    eminence overlooking the valley of the Forth and abruptly precipitous towards
                    the north-west, at the junction of several railway lines, 36 miles
                    west-north-west of Edinburgh and 30 north-north-east of Glasgow. Originally the
                    town was protected on all the accessible sides of the rock by a wall, of which
                    there are still some remains at the southern end of the Back Walk. There were
                    two principal entries to the town,—the South Port, originally 100 yards more to
                    the west of the present line of Port Street, and the bridge over the Forth to
                    the north. The earliest bridge was at Kildean, a mile to the west; the existing
                    old bridge, now disused, probably dates from about the end of the 13th century;
                    the new bridge was erected in 1829, from the designs of Stevenson, at a cost of
                    £17,000. The streets of the old town are for the most part steep, narrow, and
                    irregular, and contain a large number of quaint and antique dwellings. The town
                    has now much outgrown its ancient limits, and the surrounding suburbs on the low
                    grounds contain numerous villas. The castle crowning the eminence, and
                    commanding a splendid panoramic view of the wide valley between the Lennox Hills
                    and the Highland mountains and Ochils, with the links of the Forth and the
                    widening estuary to the east, is of unknown antiquity, but from the time that
                    Alexander I. died within its walls in 1124 till James VI. ascended the throne of
                    England it was intimately associated with the fortunes of the Scottish monarchs,
                    and after the accession of the Stuarts it became a favourite royal residence.
                    The building was extended by James III., who erected the parliament hall, now
                    used as a barrack-room. The palace, begun by James V. and finished in the reign
                    of Mary, is<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0578-0555"/> at the south-west of the fortress, and forms a
                    quadrangle, the front and pillars of which are adorned by quaintly sculptured
                    figures. The royal chapel founded by Alexander I., rebuilt in the 15th century,
                    and again by James VI., was subsequently converted into an armoury and is now
                    used as a store. To the west of it is the Douglas room, the scene of the
                    treacherous murder of William, eighth earl of Douglas, by James II. in 1452.
                    Below the castle on the north-east is the road of Ballangeich, which supplied a
                    fictitious title to James V. when wandering in disguise. Beyond it is the Gowan
                    or Gowlan Hill, at the west corner of which is Mote Hill or Heading Hill, where
                    Murdoch, duke of Albany, and several of his relatives were beheaded in 1425. On
                    the north-east side of the esplanade a statue of King Robert Bruce was erected
                    in 1877. Below the castle rock to the south-west were the king’s gardens, now
                    laid out in grass, with an octagonal mound, called the King’s Knot, in the
                    centre. Farther south is the King’s Park, now used for recreation, and as a
                    drill ground. In the cemetery to the south of the castle esplanade there are a
                    number of interesting monuments. Near the main entrance to the esplanade is the
                    building called Argyll’s Lodging, erected by the poet, Sir William Alexander,
                    who was created earl of Stirling by Charles I. It passed into the possession of
                    the Argylls in 1640, and was the headquarters of John, duke of Argyll, during
                    the rebellion of 1715. South-west of it is Mar’s Work, the ruins of the palace
                    built as a residence by the earl of Mar about 1570, from the ruins of
                    Cambuskenneth Abbey. Next to the castle the most interesting public building is
                    the Greyfriars church, some portions of which date from the 13th century,
                    although the monastery with which it was connected was not founded till 1494.
                    The greater part of it is in the Later Pointed style. The church was the scene
                    of the coronation of James VI., 29th July 1567, when John Knox preached the
                    coronation sermon. The site of the Dominican monastery founded by Alexander II.
                    in 1223 is now occupied by the National Bank. In the immediate neighbourhood of
                    Stirling, on the other side of the Forth, in Clackmannan county, is the
                    beautiful ruin of Cambuskenneth Abbey, chiefly Early English or First Pointed,
                    founded by David I. in 1147 for canons regular, associated with the meeting of
                    parliaments and other interesting events in Scottish history, and the
                    burial-place of James III. and his queen, Margaret of Denmark.</p>
                <p>The principal secular buildings are the old town-house, erected in 1701; the new
                    town buildings; the jail, erected in 1848 at a cost of £12,000; the county
                    buildings (1875, £15,000); the Smith institute, founded by the bequest cf
                    £22,000 and a valuable collection of paintings by Thomas Stewart Smith, and
                    embracing a picture gallery, a museum, and a reading room; the public halls
                    (1883, £12,000); and the high school (1855, £5000; now being extended at a cost
                    of £8000). Among the benefactions are Cowane’s hospital, founded by the bequest
                    of John Cowane, dean of guild in 1633, for twelve decayed members of the
                    guildry, but the distribution of the charity has since been altered, and the
                    building erected in 1639 now forms the guild hall; Spittal's hospital, founded
                    by Robert Spittal, tailor to James IV., about 1530 for decayed tradesmen;
                    Allan’s hospital, founded in 1725 for the maintenance of children of poor
                    townsmen; and Cunningham’s mortification, founded in 1808 with an endowment of
                    £4000 for the clothing and schooling of sons of mechanics. By the operation of
                    the Endowed Schools and Hospitals Act the charities are now largely devoted to
                    education.</p>
                <p>As early as the 15th century Stirling had a trade with the Netherlands in worsted
                    cloth, shalloons, stockings, and thread, but the manufactures afterwards
                    declined. The cotton manufacture carried on in the beginning of the present
                    century has now entirely ceased. During the last century the manufacture of
                    tartans and carpets was carried on, but this also languished about the end of
                    the century, and was not revived till about 1820. The woollen manufacture is now
                    the staple industry, the principal goods being carpets, tartans, tweeds, and
                    shawls. There are also breweries, coachbuilding works, and agricultural
                    implement works. The population of the royal burgh in 1871 was 10,873, and in
                    1881 12,194. The population of the parliamentary burgh, which includes the
                    village of St Ninians, in 1871 was 14,279, and in 1881 it was 16,001.</p>
                <p>The town is of unknown antiquity, and undoubtedly owed its origin to the fortress
                    on the rock, which became one of the most important strongholds in Scotland and
                    the centre of the struggle between Scotland and England. As early as 1119 the
                    town was a royal burgh, and under Alexander I. it became one of the four towns
                    which constituted the Court of the Four Burghs, superseded under James III. by
                    the Convention of Royal Burghs. Its earliest charter was that of Alexander II.
                    in 1226, who first made the castle a royal residence. Its last governing charter
                    was obtaiued from Charles I. in 1641. On account of a combination of three
                    members of the council to retain themselves in office it was deprived of its
                    corporate privileges in 1773, and they were not restored till 1781. The castle
                    was held by William the Lion before 1174, was occupied by Edward I. with his
                    army in 1296, and was burned with the town in 1298 by the Scots on their retreat
                    from the battle of Falkirk. Between this time and 1341 it was frequently
                    besieged and taken by the English, the longest period during which it remained
                    in their hands being from its capture by Edward I. in 1304 till his son’s defeat
                    10 years afterwards at the battle of Bannockburn. It was the birthplace of James
                    II. in 1430, and, it being the jointure house of his mother, he was removed to
                    it in 1438 from Edinburgh to thwart the ambitious purposes of Sir William
                    Crichton. It was in one of its rooms that James, as stated above, slew the earl
                    of Douglas, after which the town was burned by the earl’s brothers. James V.
                    took refuge in it after his escape from Falkland in 1528. During the reign of
                    Mary and the period of the Reformation, Stirling occupied a position of almost
                    as great prominence as during the wars of Scottish independence. Here the infant
                    queen was crowned by the cardinal’s party in 1543; here her son, afterwards
                    James VI., was baptized according to the Roman Catholic ritual, 17th December
                    1566; and here he was crowned by the leaders of the congregation on July 29th of
                    the following year. In 1571 rival parliaments were held by the queen’s party in
                    Edinburgh and the king’s lords at Stirling, shortly after which an attempt was
                    made by the queen’s adherents to surprise Stirling castle, which was almost
                    successful, the regent (Lennox) being slain in the fray. On the 26th April 1578
                    the castle was surprised by Morton, after which a reconciliation took place
                    between the two parties. In 1584 the castle was occupied by the earls of Angus
                    and Mar, the Protestant leaders, but on the approach of the king with a large
                    force they fled to England. Returning with a formidable army collected in the
                    south in the following year, they compelled James after the flight of Arran to
                    open the gates to them, safety to his person having been guaranteed. The town
                    was the scene of the baptism of Prince Henry with great pomp in August 1594, for
                    which purpose the chapel royal was rebuilt on a larger scale “to entertain the
                    great number of strangers expected.” The meetings of the privy council and court
                    of session were held in 1637 at Stirling on account of the disturbed condition
                    of Edinburgh, and a parliament was held at it in 1645, on account of Edinburgh
                    having been visited by the plague, but the outbreak of the disorder in Stirling
                    caused an adjournment to Perth. During the Civil War Stirling was held by the
                    Covenanters, and the committees of church and state adjourned to it after the
                    victory of Cromwell at Dunbar 3d September 1650. In August of the following year
                    the castle was taken by General Monk. In 1715 it was held by Argyll to prevent
                    the passage of the Forth by the Jacobites; and during the rebellion of 1745 it
                    was unsuccessfully besieged by the Highlanders.</p>
