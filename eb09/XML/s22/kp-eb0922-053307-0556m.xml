                    Eustace. As one of the chief barons of Normandy he had sworn to aid in securing
                    the succession to the crown of England for his cousin the empress Matilda and
                    her infant son, afterwards Henry II. Nevertheless, on the death of Henry I. in
                    1135, Stephen at once crossed over to England, and was welcomed by the citizens
                    of London as king. Aided by his brother Henry, bishop of Winchester, and the
                    justiciar, Bishop Roger of Salisbury, he made himself master of the royal
                    treasure, and was formally elected and crowned on St Stephen’s day, December 26,
                    1135. In a brief charter issued at the time of his coronation he promised to
                    observe the laws and liberties of the land. A fuller charter, the second of our
                    great charters of liberties, was issued early in 1136. In this document, which
                    was based on that of Henry I., each of the three estates came in for its share
                    of promises, but the leading position of the church and the importance of the
                    aid which it gave the king are shown by the predominant attention paid to
                    ecclesiastical privileges. So far all seemed going well, but the troubles of the
                    reign soon began. A false report of Stephen’s death in the summer of 1136 caused
                    revolts to break out in the east and west of England. Roger Bigot seized
                    Norwich, and Baldwin of Redvers occupied Exeter. Stephen, who possessed
                    considerable military skill, speedily put down these rebellions, but the
                    outbreak showed the lightness of the feudal bond and the defectiveness of
                    Stephen’s title. In 1137 he crossed over into Normandy to defend his dominions
                    there from Geoffrey of Anjou, and was successful enough to make a satisfactory
                    peace, but he returned to find England aflame. A mysterious conspiracy was
                    hatched in the diocese of Ely, where the fenlands may have still concealed some
                    remnants of the opposition to Stephen’s grandfather. David, king of Scotland,
                    who had already taken up arms on behalf of his niece Matilda, but had been
                    bought off by the surrender of Carlisle, marched an army into England and
                    advanced as far as Yorkshire. Robert, earl of Gloucester, the strongest of the
                    English nobles, raised the standard of rebellion at Bristol. Against these
                    numerous enemies Stephen contrived at first to make head. The conspiracy at Ely
                    was nipped in the bud; the Scotch invasion was checked in the battle of the
                    Standard, near Northallerton, in 1138, and even against Robert of Gloucester
                    Stephen won some success. But his own weakness and folly proved his ruin. In
                    order to conciliate the barons who remained true to him, he allowed them to
                    build castles, each of which became a centre of petty but intolerable tyranny.
                    Instead of relying on the support of his English subjects, Stephen surrounded
                    himself with a body of foreign mercenaries, who pillaged all alike. He granted
                    earldoms at random, thereby splitting up the royal authority and diminishing the
                    royal revenues. Lastly,—and this was the worst mistake of all,—he broke with the
                    church, and especially with the great family of Bishop Roger, who had the
                    administrative machinery in their hands. On the ground that they had no right to
                    fortify their castles he arrested the bishops of Lincoln and Salisbury, together
                    with Roger the chancellor, son of the latter. He thus enforced the surrender of
                    the castles, but the church, with the new archbishop, Theobald, and Stephen’s
                    brother, Henry of Winchester, now legate, at its<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0557-0534"/> head, declared against him. Henry called a
                    council, laid formal charges against the king, and threatened to appeal to Rome.
                    In the midst of this crisis Matilda and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester,
                    landed in the south of England, and a civil war began. From this time forward,
                    for fourteen dismal years, the land knew no peace. It is needless to go into
                    details. Neither party was strong enough to deal a final blow at the other. The
                    nobility changed sides as they pleased, fighting generally for their own
                    interests or for plunder; bands of freebooters wandered up and down the country;
                    upwards of a thousand castles, each of which was a den of robbers, were erected;
                    the church found threats and persuasion equally ineffective to restore peace and
                    order. “Men said openly,” we are told by the chronicler, “that Christ and His
                    saints slept.” At the battle of Lincoln in 1141 Stephen was taken prisoner.
                    After this Matilda was elected queen, but she soon forfeited the allegiance of
                    her supporters. The Londoners revolted, the empress fled to Oxford, and the earl
                    of Gloucester was taken prisoner. He was exchanged for Stephen, and matters went
                    on as before. About 1147 there came a change. Matilda left the country, and her
                    son Henry took the lead. His predominance was further secured by the death of
                    Robert of Gloucester in 1148. Three years later Henry became count of Anjou on
                    the death of his father, while his marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine made him
                    one of the most powerful princes in Europe. This great accession of strength
                    enabled him to meet Stephen on more than equal terms, and Stephen on the death
                    of his son Eustace was more inclined to peace. In November 1153 the treaty of
                    Wallingford brought the long struggle to an end. It was agreed that Stephen
                    should reign till his death, and that Henry should succeed him. A scheme of
                    reform was drawn up, which Stephen endeavoured, during the short remainder of
                    his reign, to carry out. He died on October 25, 1154. A brave man, a good
                    soldier, merciful and generous, but devoid of moral strength and political
                    insight, he was utterly incapable to discharge a task which demanded all the
                    skill and energy of his great successor. His nominal reign was a period of
                    anarchy in English history, important only as a full justification for the
                    tyrannies of Henry I. and Henry II.</p>
