                    of as “a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit,” and, though his official
                    function was rather the “serving of tables” than the ministry of the word, the
                    narrative of the book of Acts shows him to have been principally and
                    pre-eminently a preacher. After a brief period of popularity he was accused
                    before the sanhedrin as a blasphemer, and, without being allowed to finish his
                    speech in his own defence, he was hurried without the city walls and stoned to
                    death (c. 37 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> “Devout men”— an expression
                    apparently used to denote the uncircumcised adherents of the synagogue (see Acts
                    x. 2)—buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. His martyrdom is
                    commemorated in the Latin Church on December 26 and in the Greek on December 27.
                    Ecclesiastical tradition tells that in the year 415 his remains were discovered
                    by Lucian, priest of Caphar-Gamala near Jerusalem; after being deposited for
                    some time in Jerusalem, they were removed by the younger Theodosius to
                    Constantinople, and thence by Pope Pelagius to Rome. Some relics of Stephen were
                    also brought from Palestine to the West by Orosius. Their discovery is
                    commemorated on August 3.</p>
                <p>The ministry and martyrdom of Stephen marked a great crisis in the history of the
                    relations of the Christian church to the Gentile world. At first, we are
                    informed, the early disciples, numbering three thousand souls, “had favour with
                    all the people” (Acts ii. 47), who protected them against the rulers, elders,
                    and scribes; “for all men glorified God for that which was done” (Acts iv. 21),
                    and the people “magnified” the apostles (v. 13). It was this great popularity of
                    the disciples of Jesus in Jerusalem that led to the ordination of the deacons.
                    Soon a great revulsion of feeling took place. Stephen, “full of grace and
                    power,” had wrought “great wonders and signs among the people” (vi. 8); then
                    suddenly arose “certain of the synagogue,” disputing with Stephen, and were
                    “unable to withstand the wisdom and spirit by which he spoke.” What was the new
                    and offensive element introduced by Stephen into the apostolic preaching? The
                    accusations against him, and his speech in his own defence, alike show that he
                    was the first to realize with any clearness the greatness of the Christian
                    revolution,—the incompatibility of the Mosaic institutions with the spirituality
                    and freeness of the gospel and with its destiny to become a message of salvation
                    for the whole world. The entire drift of his speech is to show the progressive
                    character of revelation, and to show that, as God had often manifested Himself
                    apart from the forms of the law and the synagogue, these could not be held to be
                    of the essence of religion. The seed of much that is most distinctive of the
                    Pauline epistles was sown by the preaching of Stephen.</p>
