                <p><label type="entry">STARCH</label> is an organized product of the vegetable
                    kingdom, forming one of the most important and characteristic elements of plant
                    life, and an abundantly stored reserve material for the discharge of vegetative
                    functions. It originates within the living vegetable cell through the formative
                    activity of chlorophyll under the influence of light, and is consequently an
                    unfailing characteristic of all plants containing that body (compare <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> vol. xix. p. 54). Starch found within leaves
                    and other green parts of plants is assimilated and transformed with great
                    rapidity; accumulations of it are carried as starch-formers, and redeposited as
                    starch in special reservoirs or portions of plants as the period of maturity
                    approaches. In this way the body is found to gorge the stems of certain
                    palms—the sago, Ac.—just before these plants begin to form their fruit; it is
                    the principal constituent of the underground organs of biennial and perennial
                    plants, tap-roots, root-stocks, corms, bulbs, and tubers; and it is abundantly
                    stored in many fruits and seeds, as in the cereals and pulses, in bananas,
                    bread-fruit, &amp;c. It occurs in minute granules varying in diameter from 1 to
                    100 and even 200 micromillimetres; and the granules from different sources have
                    each a distinct microscopic character, their forms and size being, however,
                    affected according as they are aggregated in clusters or individually formed
                    (see vol. ii. p. 631, figs. 3 to 6). Under the microscope these granules are
                    seen to consist of a nucleus or hilum surrounded by layers arranged
                    concentrically or excentrically, and the relations of hilum and layers are the
                    most distinctive features of individual starches. Whether the hilum point bears
                    to the granule the relation of a nucleus is a matter of dispute, the general
                    opinion being that the grains are formed from without inwards, the centre being
                    invariably the softest and most soluble portion, while the outer layers are most
                    closely related to cellulose. Starch consists of a white or yellowish-white
                    glistening powder, which on being rubbed between the fingers emits a crackling
                    sound. It is only slightly acted on by cold water, but under the influence of
                    heat in water it swells up, forming according to the proportions of starch and
                    water a clouded opalescent paste. Iodine acts on it in water by producing a
                    brilliant blue coloration, this reaction forming a very delicate and
                    characteristic test. Diastase and dilute boiling sulphuric acid convert starch
                    into a form soluble in hot water, whence it passes into a series of easily
                    soluble dextrins, and finally into the condition of the sugars, dextrose and
                    maltose. In its chemical relations starch consists of an intimate mixture of two
                    isomeric bodies,—granulose and starch cellulose,—or rather of a series of
                    gradations from the one to the other, the starch cellulose being principally in
                    the external layers, while the granulose is found in the central portions of the
                    granules. Starch cellulose is a body intermediate between granulose and ordinary
                    cellulose; from the latter it is distinguished by being reducible to soluble
                    starch by boiling in water and by digesting in caustic alkali. Together, the
                    substances consist of a combination of carbon with hydrogen and oxygen, the

                    its combined condition, in cereals, &amp;c., starch is certainly the greatest
                    and foremost of all the elements of nutrition (compare <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Dietetics</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nutrition).</hi> In its other
                    industrial relations starch is used—(1) directly, as a thickening material in
                    calico printing, for the dressing and finishing of many textiles, for laundry
                    purposes, adhesive paste, and powder; and (2) indirectly, for the preparation of
                    dextrin and British gum and starch sugar. Maize, wheat, and rice starch are
                    principally employed for the direct applications; and for the dextrin and
                    starch-sugar manufacture potato starch is almost exclusively selected.</p>
                <p>In the preparation of starch the object of the manufacturer is to burst the
                    vegetable cell walls, to liberate the starch granules, and to free them from the
                    other cell contents with which they are associated. When, as in the case of the
                    potato, the associated cell contents, &amp;c., are readily separated by solution
                    and levigation the manufacture is exceedingly simple. Potato starch is prepared
                    principally by carefully washing the potatoes and in a kind of rasping machine
                    reducing them to a fine pulp, which is deposited in water as raw starch. The
                    impurities of this starch—cellulose, albuminoids, fragments of potato,
                    &amp;c.—are separated by washing it in fine sieves, through the meshes of which
                    the pure starch alone passes. The sieves are variously formed, some revolving,
                    others moving horizontally or in such manner as to keep the material in
                    agitation. The starch is then received in tanks, in which it settles, and so
                    separates from the soluble albuminoids and salts of the potatoes. The settling
                    of the starch is much retarded by the dissolved albuminoids, and to hasten the
                    separation small quantities either of alum or of sulphuric acid are employed.
                    Alum coagulates the albumen and to that extent contaminates the starch, while
                    the acid acts on the starch itself and is difficult of neutralization. After the
                    starch has settled, the brown-coloured supernatant liquor is drawn off and the
                    starch again washed either in tanks or in a centrifugal machine. Finally it is
                    dried by spreading it in layers over porous bricks (a process not required in
                    the case of starch washed in a centrifugal machine) and by exposure to the air,
                    after which it still retains a large proportion of water, but is in a condition
                    for making dextrin or starch-sugar. For further drying it is ground to a rough
                    powder, and dried thoroughly in a hot chamber, then reduced to a powder and
                    sifted. A method of reducing potatoes to a pulp by slicing and heaping them up
                    till fermentation takes place is said to give a large yield of starch, but it is
                    not much practised.</p>
                <p>In dealing with the starches of the cereals, there is greater difficulty, owing
                    to the presence of gluten, which with water forms a tough elastic body difficult
                    of solution and removal. The difficulty is experienced in greatest measure in
                    dealing with wheat, which contains a large proportion of gluten. Wheat starch is
                    separated in two different ways—(1) the fermentation method, which is the
                    original process, and (2) by mechanical means without preliminary fermentation.
                    In the fermentation process whole wheat or wheaten meal is softened and swollen
                    by soaking in water. Wheat grains are, in this condition, ground, and the pulp,
                    mixed to a thickish fluid with water, is placed in tanks, where it ferments,
                    developing acetic and volatile acids which dissolve the gummy constituents of
                    the wheat, with part of the gluten, and render the whole less tenacious. After
                    full fermentation, the period of which varies with the weather and the process
                    employed, the starch is separated in a washing drum. It is subsequently washed
                    with water, which dissolves out the gluten, the starch settling in two
                    layers,—one comparatively pure, the other mixed with gluten and some branny
                    particles. These layers are separated, the second undergoing further washing to
                    remove the gluten, &amp;c., and the remaining operations are analogous to those
                    employed in the preparation of potato-starch. By the mechanical process wheaten
                    flour is kneaded into a stiff paste, which, after resting for an hour or two, is
                    washed over a fine sieve so long as the water passing off continues milky,
                    whereby the starch is liberated and the greater part of the gluten retained as a
                    gluey elastic mass in the sieve. The starch is subsequently purified by
                    fermentation, washing, and treatment in centrifugal machines. The gluten thus
                    preserved is a useful food for diabetic patients, and is made with flour into
                    artificial macaroni and pastes, besides being valuable for other industrial
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>Maize starch is obtained by analogous processes, but, the proportion of gluten in
                    the grain being smaller, and less tenacious in its nature, the operations,
                    whether chemical or mechanical, present fewer difficulties. Under one method the
                    separation of maize starch is facilitated by steeping, swelling, and softening
                    the grain in a weak solution of caustic soda, and favourable results are also
                    obtained by a process in which the pulp from the crushing mill is treated with
                    water acidulated with sulphurous acid.</p>
                <p>In the preparation of rice-starch a weak solution of caustic soda is also
                    employed for softening and swelling the grain. It is then washed with pure
                    water, dried, ground, and sifted, and again treated with alkaline water, by
                    which the whole of the nitrogenous constituents are taken up in soluble form. An
                    acid process for obtaining rice-starch is also employed, under which the grain,
                    swollen and ground, is treated repeatedly with a solution of hydrochloric acid,
                    which also dissolves away the non-starchy constituents of the grain. The laundry
                    starches now in use are principally made from rice and from pulse. (J. PA.)</p>
