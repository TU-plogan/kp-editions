                    Russian immigration) last returned at 637,893. It is bounded by Astrakhan and
                    the province of the Don Cossacks on the N., Kuban on the W., Terek on the S.,
                    and the Caspian Sea on the E., occupying the eastern part of the broad plains
                    and steppes which fringe the main chain of <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasus</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) on the north. In the western part of the
                    government a broad undulating swelling, ranging from 1500 to 2000 feet above
                    sea-level, extends northwards from the central mountain chain; in the southern
                    part of this swelling, in the vicinity of Pyatigorsk, there is a group of
                    sixteen mountains, 2800 to 4600 feet in height—the Beshtau,— which, as shown by
                    Abich, ought to be considered as a porphyritic upheaval which took place at a
                    point where the two predominant directions in Caucasus (south-west to north-east
                    and south-east to north-west) meet. Northward and eastward of the above plateau
                    are extensive steppes, from 400 to 200 feet above the sea, having gentle slopes
                    both to the north (to the depression of the Manytch) and to the east (towards
                    the low and dry steppes of the Caspian littoral). The geological structure of
                    Stavropol is most interesting. The mountains in the southern parts of Pyatigorsk
                    consist of trachytic porphyries and volcanic rocks. Numberless hot mineral
                    springs (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyatigorsk)</hi> occur in this group, and
                    earthquakes are most common in the region. A broad belt of Miocene deposits,
                    represented by the “steppe limestone” with <hi rend="italic">Mactra
                    podolica,</hi> girdles the hilly tracts, attaining a breadth of 40 miles or
                    rather more; while the remainder of the steppes, which gently slope towards the
                    Manytch and the Caspian, are occupied by the Post-Tertiary Caspian formation
                    (loess).</p>
                <p>Stavropol is chiefly watered by the Kuma and its tributaries (Podkumok, Karamyk,
                    Buivola, &amp;c.), its basin being the most fertile part of the province, but
                    the evaporation is so great that the Kuma never reaches the Caspian except in
                    spring. The Manytch is less a river than a series of lakes occupying a
                    depression which formerly was a connecting channel between the Black Sea and the
                    Caspian. This channel has two slopes, the eastern sometimes discharging its
                    scanty water-supply into the Kuma, while on the western slope the elongated
                    lakes which fill up the depression drain into the Don, reaching it, however,
                    only during spring. Two Yegorlyks (Great and Middle), the Kalaus, and the
                    Tchogra (temporary tributaries of the Manytch) water the west part of Stavropol;
                    while the Yeya and the Barsukly—a tributary of the Kuban—rise in the district of
                    Pyatigorsk. On the whole, irrigation is scanty, and in the eastern steppes water
                    is supplied only by cisterns. Besides the few lakes of the Manytch depression,
                    there are many smaller salt lakes around the Caspian. Timber is scarce, even in
                    the hilly tracts.</p>
                <p>The climate is severe. Although Stavropol and Pyatigorsk both have an average
                    yearly temperature of 48° Fahr., frosts of -22° Fahr. are not uncommon, and the
                    average winter temperature is only 28°·7 at Stavropol (January, 25°; July, 71°).
                    Yellow and other endemic fevers, sometimes very severe, are common on the low
                    banks of the Kuma and Manytch.</p>
                <p>The region is traversed by both the great highways along the western shore of the
                    Caspian (the Vladikavkaz and the Derbent routes), and accordingly several
                    nations in their migrations have left stragglers on the steppes of Stavropol.
                    Thus we now find in these steppes Lamaite Kalmucks (about 10,000), Mohammedan
                    Turcomans and Nogais (together about 60,000), as well as less considerable
                    remains of several other tribes. On the other hand, immigrants from Great and
                    Little Russia, Poles, Germans, Esthonians, Greeks, and even a few Scots (in a
                    colony close to Pyatigorsk) have settled in the most fertile and best watered
                    parts of Stavropol in the course of the present century. The Russian population
                    is growing very rapidly, and already numbers upwards of 500,000.</p>
                <p>There are three administrative districts, the chief towns of which are Stavropol
                    (35,470 inhabitants in 1884), Pyatigorsk (11,115), and Alexandrovskaya (8710),
                    and a territory of nomad natives which occupies more than two-fifths of the
                    entire area of the government.</p>
                <p>The educational returns for 1883 show 7 gymnasiums and “real schools,” with 1081
                    boys and 491 girls, and 139 elementary schools, with only 5310 boys and 1034
                    girls.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the chief occupation of the settled population, and so large is
                    the harvest that no less than 16,000 labourers, attracted by high wages, come
                    annually from European Russia to assist in gathering in the crops. Large amounts
                    of corn are exported both to the mountainous districts of Caucasus and to Russia
                    (Rostoff-on-the-Don). Cattle-breeding is engaged in very largely, not only by
                    the Kalmucks, Turcomans, and Nogais, but also by the Russians. In 1884 Stavropol
                    had 154,000 horses, 808,500 cattle, 2,540,00ff sheep, 45,000 goats, 75,000 pigs,
                    and 7500 camels. Cattle and horses, as also wool, hair, hides, and sheepskins,
                    are exported in considerable quantities. A remarkable feature of Stavropol is
                    the rapid growth among the Russian peasant population of a great variety of
                    domestic trades both for local supply and for exportation. Silk wares are now
                    woven in the villages to such an extent as to become an important article of
                    export to Russia. Many other petty trades have also grown up of late, such as
                    various kinds of cottonweaving, the manufacture of leather wares, small metallic
                    wares, and so on. Manufactures proper (chiefly distillation) employed some 1000
                    persons in 1870, and their produce was estimated at about £140,000 per annum.
                    Since that time they have slowly expanded. A brisk trade is carried on in the
                    above-mentioned articles of export, and twenty-nine village fairs show an
                    aggregate annual return of nearly £300,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The northern slopes of Caucasus began to be
                    colonized by Russians at a very early period, and as early as the 11th century
                    part of the territory now occupied by Stavropol was known to Russian annalists
                    as the Tmutarakañ principality, which had Russian princes. A new attempt to
                    colonize North Caucasus was made in the 16th century, under Ivan the Terrible,
                    who married, a Kabardian princess. This was again unsuccessful, and it was not
                    till 1711 that Russia began regularly to colonize the territory by Cossack
                    settlements. The military colonization was continued during the whole of last
                    century; Kizlar was founded in 1736, Stavropol in 1776 or 1777. Immense tracts
                    were given by Catherine II. to her courtiers, who began to people them with
                    serfs brought from Russia. The flow of immigrants rapidly increased as soon as
                    peace was firmly established, and it is still on the increase, especially since
                    the emancipation of the serfs, so that Stavropol is rapidly becoming a Russian
                    province, with a comparatively limited number of natives in the steppes of its
                    eastern part.</p>
