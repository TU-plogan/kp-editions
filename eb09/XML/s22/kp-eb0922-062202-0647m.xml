                <p><label type="entry">SUGAR</label>. Formerly chemists called everything a “sugar”
                    which had a sweet taste, and acetate of lead to this day is known as “sugar of
                    lead” in commerce and familiar chemical parlance; but the term in its scientific
                    sense soon came to be restricted to the sweet principles in vegetable and animal
                    juices. Only one of these—cane sugar—was known as a pure substance until 1619,
                    when Fabrizio Bar-toletti isolated the sugar of milk and proved its
                    individuality. In regard to all other “sugars” besides these two the knowledge
                    of chemists was in the highest degree indefinite, and remained so until about
                    the middle of the 18th century, when Marggraf made the important discovery that
                    the sugars of the juices of beet, carrots, and certain other fleshy roots are
                    identical with one another and with the sugar of the cane. Lowitz subsequently
                    showed that the granular part of honey is something different from cane sugar;
                    this was confirmed by Proust, who found also<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0648-0623"/> that Lowitz’s honey sugar is identical with a
                    crystallizable sugar present largely in the juice of the grape. Proust’s
                    investigations extended to other sweet vegetable juices also. All those
                    investigated by him owed their sweetness to one or more of only three
                    species,—(1) cane sugar, (2) grape sugar, (3) (amorphous) fruit sugar. Proust’s
                    results obtain substantially to this day; a number of new sugars strictly
                    similar to these three have been discovered since, but none are at all widely
                    diffused throughout the organic kingdom.</p>
                <p>The quantitative elementary composition of cane sugar was determined early in the
                    19th century by Gay-Lussac and Thénard, who may be said to have virtually
                    established our present formula, C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 22</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi>. Under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fermentation</hi> (vol. ix. p. 93) it has been explained how
                    Gay-Lussac (in 1811) came to mis-correct his numbers so as to bring them into
                    accordance with what we now express by C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> = ½C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 24</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 12</hi>. Dumas and Boullay, some years later, found that cane sugar is what
                    Gay-Lussac and Thénard’s analysis makes it out to be, while the “corrected”
                    numbers happen to be correct for grape sugar. Dumas and Boullay’s research
                    completed the foundations of our present science of the subject. “Sugar” is now
                    a collective term for two chemical genera named <hi rend="italic"
                    >saccharoses</hi> (all C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    22</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">glucoses</hi>
                    (all C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>). All sugars are colourless non-volatile solids,
                    soluble in water and also (though less largely) in aqueous alcohol; from either
                    solvent they can in general be obtained in the form of crystals. The aqueous
                    solution exhibits a sweet taste, which, however, is only very feebly developed
                    in certain species.</p>
                <p>All sugars and their solutions have the power of turning the plane of
                    polarization of light. In a given solution of a given kind of sugar the angle α
                    through which the plane is turned is governed by the equation α=±[α] <hi
                    rend="italic">lp</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">l</hi> stands for the length of
                    solution traversed (the customary unit of length being the centimetre) and <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> for the number of grams of dry sugar present in a volume of
                    solution equal to that of (say) 100 grams (3·52 oz.) of water, where, however,
                    “gram” must be taken as merely a convenient word for “unit of weight”; ±[α], <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the special value of α for <hi rend="italic">l</hi> =l
                    and <hi rend="italic">p=l,</hi> is called the specific rotatory power of the
                    sugar operated upon. The sign ± indicates that the plane of polarization is
                    turned either to the right or to the left according to the nature of the
                    species. For a given species and a given temperature [α] has a constant value.
                    Supposing its value to have been determined by standard experiments and <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> to be known (or to be kept constant throughout and taken as
                    unit of length), the determination of α for a given solution suffices for the
                    calculation of <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> This method is largely used
                    industrially for the assaying of cane sugar.</p>
                <p>Sugars, though neutral to litmus and inert towards such substances as carbonates
                    on the one hand and aqueous acids <hi rend="italic">(qua</hi> acids) on the
                    other, combine with strong bases, such as caustic potash, baryta, and lime, into
                    <hi rend="italic">saccharates,</hi> and, when brought into contact with the
                    strongest nitric acid (or a mixture of the same with oil of vitriol) or (at the
                    proper temperature) with acetic anhydride, unite with these into nitrates and
                    acetates respectively, with elimination of water. These nitrates, &amp;c., are
                    related to the respective sugar exactly as (to take an analogous case) nitrate
                    of methyl, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), is
                    to methyl-alcohol, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (OH); only in the case of a
                    sugar a plural of <hi rend="smallcaps">NO</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">
                    3</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">'s</hi> is capable of entering into every one
                    molecule and turning out so many HO’s; hence sugars are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">polyvalent alcohols.</hi> Of the several points of difference
                    between saccharoses and glucoses the most important is that, while the latter
                    remain unchanged when boiled with highly dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric (or
                    certain other kinds of) acid, the former take up water and every molecule breaks
                    up into two molecules of glucose, which in general are of different kinds. Cane
                    sugar, for instance, yields <hi rend="italic">dextrose</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">laevulose</hi> (so called from the direction in which they turn
                    the plane of polarized light), thus—</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 11</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> + C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> 0 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi></p>
                <p>Cane sugar turns the plane of polarized light to the right; the mixed glucose
                    produced is laevo-rotatory; hence the process is spoken of technically as
                    involving the <hi rend="italic">inversion</hi> of cane sugar, and the mixed
                    product is called <hi rend="italic">invert sugar.</hi> The term “inversion,”
                    however, has come somehow to be used for all decompositions which fall under the
                    above equation; occasionally it is used even in a wider sense, to include any
                    decomposition of a carbo-hydrate <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> starch) into two
                    less complex carbo-hydrates.</p>
                <p>All sugars are liable to fermentative changes; a special character of the three
                    principal vegetable sugars is that, when brought into contact as solutions with
                    yeast (living cells of saccharomyces), under suitable conditions, they suffer
                    vinous fermentation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, break up substantially into
                    carbonic acid and alcohol. Dextrose and laevulose break up directly,—C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> = 2C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> O + 2CO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Cane sugar first, under the influence of a soluble
                    ferment in the yeast, gets inverted, and the invert sugar then ferments, the
                    dextrose disappearing at a greater rate than the laevulose.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that no sugar has ever been produced artificially even in the
                    sense of being built up from other native organic substances of less chemical
                    complexity. It is easy to produce dextrose from starch, or laevulose from
                    inulin, or both from cane sugar, by inversion; but none of these processes is
                    reversible by known methods. Yet the problem of producing cane sugar
                    artificially may in a sense be said to have found a virtual solution at the
                    hands of a German-American chemist, Fahlberg.<note anchored="true"

                    be about 230 times as sweet as cane sugar. This saccharine is a white
                    crystallized solid, only slightly soluble in cold water, but sufficiently so to
                    admit of its incorporation with jellies, puddings, beverages, &amp;c. A mixture
                    of one part of it with 1000 parts of ordinary grape sugar (as produced
                    industrially from starch) is as sweet as the best cane sugar. The substance,
                    though an antiseptic, is said to be perfectly innocuous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glucoses.</hi></p>
                <p>Of these a pretty large number are now known, but only laevulose and dextrose
                    need be noticed here. Both are largely present in all kinds of sweet fruit
                    juices and in honey. In most of these materials they are accompanied by a small
                    proportion of cane sugar, which forcibly suggests that the glucose in fruit
                    juices is really inverted cane sugar. But, in opposition to this surmise, the
                    proportion of cane sugar in oranges increases during the process of ripening,
                    and the sourest of all fruits—the lemon—contains four parts of cane for every
                    ten of invert sugar; besides, the juices of grapes and sweet cherries contain no
                    cane sugar whatever. According to Stammer, the young leaves of the sugar cane
                    contain abundance of invert sugar, which gradually disappears and gives way to
                    cane sugar as the leaves develop and ultimately dry up. In the living body of
                    man dextrose is constantly being produced from the glycogen of the liver, to be
                    taken up by the blood and oxidized into carbonic acid and water. In certain
                    diseases, however (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nutrition,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 681),
                    the sugar survives and passes into the urine; as much as one pound avoirdupois
                    may be discharged by a diabetic patient in twenty-four hours. A numerous class
                    of vegetable substances, known as <hi rend="italic">glucosides,</hi> contain
                    glucose of some kind in the sense that, when decomposed by boiling dilute
                    sulphuric acid or by the action of certain ferments, they split up into glucose
                    and some product;—not a sugar—which is characteristic of the respective species.
                    For examples, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fermentation,</hi> vol. ix. p. 96.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dextrose</hi> is being produced industrially from starch by
                    inversion (see below), and sold as grape sugar. Such grape sugar, however, is
                    very impure. For the preparation of pure dextrose rich diabetic urine, honey,
                    and cane sugar are convenient materials. The method recommended by Soxhlet is to
                    dissolve 160 grams (5·64 oz.) of powdered cane sugar in a mixture of 500 c. c.
                    of alcohol of 85 per cent. by weight and 20 c.c. of fuming hydrochloric acid at
                    45° C. and to allow the solution to stand. After about a week dextrose begins to
                    crystallize out, and, if the mixture is being frequently agitated, the deposit
                    of crystals increases gradually. A small crop of crystals thus obtained suffices
                    for inducing crystallization in a large supply of fresh liquor. Dextrose
                    crystallizes from its highly concentrated aqueous solution—somewhat tardily—in
                    minute soft crystals, united into warts or cauliflower-like masses, which
                    contain 1H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O of crystal water beside C <hi

                    parts at 17·5 C. and 21·7 parts on boiling. In a given volume of aqueous

                    of sweetness as 3 parts of cane sugar. Dextrose fuses at 146 C. and at 170

                <p><hi rend="italic">Laevulose.—</hi> The liquid part of crystalline honey consists
                    chiefly of laevulose; but its purification is difficult. From invert sugar it
                    can be extracted, according to Dubrunfaut, by cautious addition of slaked lime
                    at a low temperature. The laevulose separates out as a difficultly soluble lime
                    compound, which is separated from the mother-liquor containing the dextrose by
                    pressure and by judicious washing with cold water. The laevulosate of lime is
                    decomposed by the exact equivalent of oxalic acid solution; then the oxalate of
                    lime is filtered off, and the filtrate evaporated on a water-bath. The laevulose
                    ultimately remains as a thick syrup, which formerly was supposed not to be
                    susceptible of crystallization; but Jungfleisch and Lefranc have succeeded
                    lately in obtaining crystals from it by means of alcohol. Laevulose is very
                    largely soluble in water, and fully as sweet as cane sugar. It fuses at 95° C.;
                    at 170° it passes into laevulosan, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi

                <p>The following reactions, though studied chiefly with dextrose, apply also to
                    laevulose, and, substantially at least, to glucoses generally. If a solution of
                    glucose is mixed with excess of caustic potash or soda, a solution of alkaline
                    glucosate is formed, which, however, has little stability. If the solution is
                    heated, the glucosate is decomposed with formation of dark-coloured (soluble)
                    alkali salts of acid products, which, whatever they may be, are not
                    reconvertible into glucose. Cane sugar, in these circumstances, remains
                    substantially unchanged, and can be regenerated by elimination of the alkali. If
                    a solution of glucose is mixed with (not too much) sulphate of copper, and an
                    excess of caustic potash or soda be then added, no precipitate of cupric hydrate
                    is formed, but an intensely blue solution, which, on standing in the cold
                    gradually, and on heating promptly,‘deposits a red precipitate of cuprous oxide,
                    Cu <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, the glucose being oxidized at the expense of
                    the dissolved CuO into soluble alkali salts of little known acids. By means of
                    this (Trommer’s) test the least trace of glucose in a solution can be
                    discovered. Cane sugar, in the circumstances, yields cuprous oxide only on
                    long-continued boiling. Fehling has brought this test into the following more
                    convenient form, which, besides, admits of quantitative application: 34·6δ grams
                    (1·22 oz.)of sulphate of copper, CuSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 5H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and 173 grams (6 oz.) of Rochelle salt (double
                    tartrate of potash and soda) are dissolved in a solution of 70 grams (2·46 oz.)
                    of solid caustic soda, and the intensely blue solution produced is diluted to
                    1000 c.c. Every c.c. of Fehling solution oxidizes about 5 milligrams (·077
                    grain) of dextrose (not of glucose generally). To determine an unknown weight of
                    glucose, its solution is added to an excess of suitably diluted Fehling solution
                    at a boiling heat, which is maintained for a sufficient time to oxidize the
                    glucose as completely as possible,—the requisite time depending on the nature of
                    the glucose. The cuprous oxide precipitate is allowed to settle, is then
                    collected on a filter, and weighed directly or indirectly. From its weight the
                    weight of the glucose is calculated,—a standard experiment with a known weight
                    of the respective kind of pure glucose furnishing the factor. A less exact but
                    more expeditious method is to dissolve the sugar to be analysed in water, to
                    dilute to a known volume (not less than 200 c.c. for every gram of glucose), and
                    to drop this solution from a burette into a measured volume of dilute Fehling
                    solution at a boiling heat until the blue colour is just destroyed, <hi

                <p>Of these only cane sugar, milk sugar, and maltose can be noticed here. The
                    highest qualities of commercial cane sugar are chemically pure. Pure cane sugar
                    crystallizes from its supersaturated syrup in colourless, transparent monoclinic
                    prisms (exemplified in colourless candy sugar). The crystals are barely, if at
                    all, hygroscopic; they are rather hard, and when broken up in the dark give off
                    a peculiar kind of bluish light. Sp. gr. 1·593 at 4° C. The aqueous solution,
                    saturated at <hi rend="italic">t</hi> ° C., contains <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    per cent. of dry sugar. For <hi rend="italic">t</hi> = 0° 10° 20° 30° 40°

                <p>From 50° upwards the solubility increases at such a rate that a given quantum of
                    water dissolves any quantity of sugar if the mixture is constantly kept boiling.
                    Accordingly a sugar syrup when boiled down deposits nothing, but passes
                    gradually into the condition of fused sugar when the boiling-point merges into
                    the fusingpoint of sugar, which lies at 160-161° C. Even a cold-saturated
                    solution of sugar has the consistence of a syrup. Absolute alcohol hardly
                    dissolves sugar at all; aqueous alcohol dissolves it the more largely the
                    greater its proportion of water. Fused sugar freezes into a transparent glass,
                    which is colourless if pure, but in practice generally exhibits a yellowish hue,
                    and, if really anhydrous, remains glassy for an indefinite time. Barley-sugar
                    and certain other confections are substantially fused sugar; but from their mode
                    of manufacture they retain a trace of enclosed water, which constantly dissolves
                    particles of the surrounding sugar glass to redeposit them in the less soluble
                    form of crystals, so that barley - sugar in the course of time loses its
                    transparency through conversion into an aggregate of minute crystals. If fused
                    sugar is kept at a few degrees above its fusing-point for some time, it passes
                    iuto an alloy, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, of dextrose and
                    laevulosan (see above). At higher temperatures it loses water and passes into
                    anhydrides not reconvertible into cane sugar, which are known in the aggregate
                    as “caramel,”—a most intensely brown viscous solid, easily soluble in water and
                    in aqueous alcohol, with formation of intensely coloured solutions. Caramel
                    (often made of dextrose) is much used as an innocent colouring agent for sauces,
                    liqueurs, &amp;c. A pure solution of cane sugar is said to remain unchanged on
                    boiling (it being understood, of course, that local overheating be carefully
                    avoided); but continued contact with even so feeble an acid as carbonic induces
                    at least partial inversion. The statement of the unchangeability of sugar
                    solution on boiling seems hardly credible, because a syrup boiling at all
                    considerably above 100° C. contains plenty of molecules at temperatures-above
                    160° C., which are bound to suffer irreversible conversion into dextrose and
                    laevulosan (or laevulose), and even, if hot enough, caramelization. In ordinary
                    practice, at any rate, sugar solutions on boiling do behave as indicated by this
                    theory. Cane sugar, as already stated, unites with alkalis, alkaline earths, and
                    other of the more strongly basic metallic oxides into saccharates. A soluble
                    saccharate of lime, which is readily decomposible by carbonic acid and even by
                    filtration through bone charcoal, plays a great part in the manufacture of
                    sugar. The following strontium salt must be named, because it at least promised
                    some years ago to occupy a similar position industrially. According to
                    Scheibler, if strontia hydrate, SrOH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + 8H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is added to a boiling 15 per cent. solution of cane
                    sugar, then as soon as 2SrO is added for every C <hi rend="subscript"> 12</hi> H

                    SrO almost all the sugar is precipitated. The precipitate is easily washed and
                    decomposed by water and carbonic acid, with formation of insoluble carbonate of
                    strontia (from which the hydrate can be reproduced) and a solution of cane
                    sugar. The ultimate molasses produced in sugar making or refining, though they
                    refuse to deposit crystals under any conditions, contain some 30 to 40 per cent.
                    of real cane sugar; Scheibler’s process applies to them,—to put the industrial
                    bearings of the discovery in the proper light,—and it has led to quite a series
                    of patents for the production of strontia; but, as far as we know, it has failed
                    to take root in the sugar industry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Milk Sugar</hi> occurs in the milk of mammals, and it is
                    doubtful whether it occurs anywhere else, although Bouchardat once proved its
                    presence in a sample marked as sugar obtained from <hi rend="italic">Sapota,
                    Achras</hi> (the sapodilla of the West Indies). It is made industrially in
                    Switzerland as a bye-product in the making of cheese. It passes into the whey,
                    from which it is extracted by evaporation to a small volume, decolorization with

                    substance can be obtained by repeated recrystallization from water, and
                    ultimately by precipitation from the aqueous solution by alcohol. Milk sugar as
                    it crystallizes from water under the ordinary conditions forms hydrated crystals
                    of the composition <hi rend="smallcaps">C</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">

                    rend="smallcaps">O;</hi> under certain conditions anhydrous crystals separate
                    out. The hydrated crystals have pretty much the aspect of candy sugar, but they
                    are less transparent, far harder, quite free from every <hi rend="italic"
                    >soupçon</hi> of hygroscopicity, and far less sweet. They dissolve in six parts
                    of cold and in 2·5 parts of boiling water; the solutions are not syrupy. Milk
                    sugar is hardly soluble in alcohol. The ordinary crystals, as the formula shows,
                    have the composition of a glucose; indeed milk sugar solution behaves to caustic
                    alkalis and to Fehling solution as if it were a glucose. But the hydrated
                    crystals lose their water at 130°, with formation of a residue reconvertible
                    into the original substance by the mere action of water; besides, milk sugar is
                    susceptible of inversion into dextrose and a specific galactose. The optical
                    behaviour of a milk sugar solution varies according as it is derived from the
                    ordinary crystals or the anhydride produced at 130°, and according to the time
                    which has elapsed since its preparation; but if it stands sufficiently long the
                    specific rotatory power assumes ultimately the same (constant) value. Milk sugar
                    solution when brought in contact with yeast does not suffer vinous fermentation;
                    but certain <hi rend="italic">Spaltpilze</hi> induce a fermentation involving
                    the formation of alcohol and of lactic acid. This process is utilized by the
                    Kirghiz in the production of their native drink, “koumiss,” made from mare’s
                    milk (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Milk,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 305). Milk sugar is used
                    in medicine as a diluent for dry medicines. Homoeopathists use it by preference.
                    A solution of milk sugar in certain proportions of water and cow’s milk is used

                    supposed to be the active agent in malt. For its preparation 2 kilograms (4·40
                    lb) of potato starch are made into a paste with 9 litres (15·84 pints) of water
                    over a water-bath; after allowing it to cool down to 60° or 65° C., an infusion
                    of from 120 to 140 grams (4·23 to 5 oz. ) of malt made at 40° C. is added. The
                    mixture is kept at from 60° to 65° for an hour; it is then boiled and filtered.
                    The filtrate is evaporated to a syrup, which is exhausted twice with alcohol of
                    85 per cent. by weight and then once with absolute alcohol. The dextrin (mostly)
                    remains; the maltose passes into solution. The alcoholic extracts are evaporated
                    to a syrupy consistence and allowed to stand. The absolute alcohol extract soon
                    yields a crop of impure crystals of maltose, which are used to induce
                    crystallization in the other two syrups. In regard to the somewhat tedious
                    methods of purification we refer to the handbooks of chemistry. Maltose
                    crystallizes (from alcohol on spontaneous evaporation) in fine needles of the

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O goes off at 100° C. Maltose is less soluble in
                    alcohol than dextrose, to which it is otherwise very similar. To caustic alkalis
                    and Fehling solution it behaves exactly as dextrose does. Like it, it suffers
                    vinous fermentation under the influence of yeast. When boiled with dilute
                    sulphuric acid it breaks up into (so to say) dextrose and dextrose. Maltose
                    plays an important part in the brewing of alcoholic malt liquors. (W. D.)</p>

                    11th century, says that Askar - Mokram had no equal for the quality and quantity
                    of its sugar, “notwithstanding the great production of 'Irak, Jorján, and
                    India.” It used to pay 50,000 pounds of sugar to the sultan in annual tribute

                    it had risen to 150,000 tons, and in 1885 the total quantity used was almost
                    1,100,000 tons.</p><p>In 1747 Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, director of the
                    physical classes in the Academy of Sciences, Berlin, discovered the existence of
                    common sugar in beetroot and in numerous other fleshy roots which grow in
                    temperate regions. But no practical use was made of the discovery during his
                    lifetime. The first to establish a beet-sugar factory was his pupil and
                    successor, Franz Carl Achard, at Cunern (near Breslau) in Silesia in 1801. The
                    processes used were at first very imperfect, but the extraordinary increase in
                    the price of sugar on the Continent caused by the Napoleonic policy gave an
                    impetus to the industry, and beetroot factories were established at many centres
                    both in Germany and in France. In Germany the enterprise came to an end almost
                    entirely with the downfall of Napoleon I.; but in France, where at first more
                    scientific and economical methods of working were introduced, the manufacturers
                    were able to keep the industry alive. It was not however, till after 1830 that
                    it secured a firm footing; but from 1840 onwards it advanced with giant strides.
                    Now it is an industry of national importance, especially in Germany, controlling
                    in the meantime the market against the cane-sugar trade. While cane sugar was
                    practically without a rival, the cultivation was in general highly profitable,
                    but it was conducted under tropical skies, largely by slave labour and entirely
                    removed from scientific supervision. The staple produced at the plantations was
                    raw sugar, whieh was sent to Europe to be refined. It was not till the pressure
                    of the competition with beet sugar began to make itself felt that planters
                    realized the necessity for improving their methods of working. It has now been
                    found possible to apply many of the processes and appliances devised in
                    connexion with the production of beet sugar to the extraction of its older
                    rival.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cane Sugar
                    Manufacture.</hi> —The sugar-cane <hi rend="italic">(Saccharum officinarum)</hi>
                    is a species of grass, the stalks or canes of which reach a height of from 8 to
                    15 feet, and attain a diameter of 1½ to 2 inches. The stalks are divided into
                    prominent joints or internodes, the long sheathing alternate leaves springing
                    from each joint. As the canes approach maturity they throw up a long smooth
                    hollow joint termed the <hi rend="italic">arrow,</hi> whence springs the flower
                    head, consisting of beautiful feather-like loose panicles. The points are filled
                    with a loose spongy fibrous mass, saturated with a juice which is at first
                    watery but afterwards becomes sweet and glutinous. As the joints ripen, the
                    leaves wither and fall away and the stem becomes externally smooth, shining, and
                    hard, containing much silica. The varieties of sugar-cane in cultivation are
                    very numerous, and are distinguished from each other by external colour, length
                    of internodes (3½ to 10 inches), height to which they grow, richness in juice,
                    and many other characters. The four principal classes cultivated in the West
                    Indies are the Creole or country cane, the Tahiti cane, the Batavian cane, and
                    the Chinese cane. An average sample of Tahiti cane at maturity contains—water,
                    71·04 per cent.; sugar, 18·00; ligneous tissue and pectin, 9·56; albumen,
                    colouring matter, and insoluble salts, 1·20; silica, 0·20. The sugar-cane
                    requires a rich, well-drained, but moist soil. It is propagated by slips taken
                    from the upper part of the canes, which are planted at intervals about 5 feet
                    apart or in close-set rows 6 feet apart. In the West Indies the planting takes
                    place between June and October, and in the case of the Creole variety the canes
                    are ready for cutting down by the beginning of January in the second following
                    year. When mature the canes are cut down close to the ground, the remaining
                    leaves and upper shoot removed, and the stalks immediately taken to the mill for
                    crushing. The stocks left are liberally manured with crushed remains and ashes
                    of former crops, combined with nitrogenous manures, and are covered over; they
                    then send up a crop of new stems, termed <hi rend="italic">rattoons.</hi> The
                    system of rattooning can be continued for several years, but the canes so
                    treated go on declining in size and in yield of sugar. The yield of canes, of
                    course, varies within wide limits; but 20 tons per acre may be regarded as a
                    good average crop.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cane-Crushing.—</hi> The juice is
                    extracted by pressing the canes in a sugar-mill between three, or sometimes
                    five, heavy close-set rollers of iron, placed horizontally in a powerful
                    framework or cheeks. In a three-roller mill they consist of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cane, top,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">megass</hi> roller respectively. The top
                    roller is set above and between the other two, and under its periphery is a
                    fixed metal plate called the <hi rend="italic">trash turner,</hi> which guides
                    the cane coming from between the cane and top rollers into the bite between top
                    and megass rollers. Generally the cane roller is screwed up to within half an
                    inch of the top roller, while the free space between top and megass rollers is
                    considerably less. The mill is set in motion by steam power, and the canes are
                    fed by hand on a travelling band or carrier into the rollers. If a thick feed is
                    placed at one side and little at the other, one portion passes through
                    imperfectly crushed, while the other severely strains the mill and may either
                    stop the machinery or cause a breakdown by some portion giving way. The yield

                    which the farther East learned from the Arabs, was developed by the famous
                    physicians of this region, in whose pharmacopceia sugar had an important place.
                    Under the Arabs the growth and manufacture of the cane spread far and wide, from
                    India to Sus in Morocco (Edrisi, ed. Dozy, p. 62), and were also introduced into
                    Sicily and Andalusia.</p>
                <p>In the age of discovery the Spaniards became in their turn the great
                    disseminators of the sugar cultivation: the cane was planted by them in Madeira
                    in 1420; it was carried to San Domingo in 1494; and it spread over the occupied
                    portions of the West Indies and South America early in the 16th century. Within
                    the first twenty years of the 16th century the sugar trade of San Domingo
                    expanded with great rapidity, and it was from the dues levied on the imports
                    brought thence to Spain that Charles V. obtained funds for his palace-building
                    at Madrid and Toledo. In the Middle Ages Venice was the great European centre of
                    the sugar trade, and towards the end of the 15th century a Venetian citizen
                    received a reward of 100,000 crowns for the invention of the art of making
                    loaf-sugar. One of the earliest references to sugar in Great Britain is that of
                    100,000 lb of sugar being shipped to London in 1319 by Tomasso Loredano,
                    merchant of Venice, to be exchanged for wool. In the same year there appears in
                    the accounts of the chamberlain of Scotland a payment at the rate of 1s. 9½d.
                    per pound for sugar. Throughout Europe it continued to be a costly luxury and
                    article of medicine only, till the increasing use of tea and coffee in the 18th
                    century brought it into the list of principal food staples. The increase in the
                    consumption is exemplified by the fact that, while<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0651-0626"/> juice obtained with an ordinary mill varies from
                    60 to 65 per cent. One of the most useful devices for improving the machinery is
                    the substitution of an hydraulic attachment, which can be applied to the
                    headstocks of any of the rollers, in place of the rigid and immovable screws and
                    wedges of the ordinary mill. This secures a uniform pressure with the most
                    irregular feed and much greater pressure than is possible with rigid rollers,
                    resulting in a greatly increased yield of juice (67 to 70 per cent.) and a
                    megass or refuse proportionately drier and therefore more available for fuel for
                    steamraising. The juice from the mill is led into a trough, whence it is carried
                    by pipes to the clarifiers. But even the most perfect system of mechanical
                    pressure leaves a large percentage of sugar in the refuse cane, and to remedy
                    this the diffusion method (see below), which has been attended with remarkable
                    success in the beet industry, has been also applied to the extraction of cane
                    j.uice. At Aska (Madras) in India it has been found possible by that process to
                    obtain as much as 87⅜ of the 90 per cent. of juice present in canes.
                    Considerable difficulty was at first found in slicing the silicious stalks for
                    diffusion; but this process seems to promise a much more exhaustive extraction
                    of the juice than can be secured by mechanical means. The juice is a turbid
                    frothy liquid of a yellowish green colour, with a specific gravity of from 1·070
                    to about 1·1100. The variety of cane cultivated, its age, and especially the
                    nature of the season in which it has grown as regards rain, all have an
                    important influence on the yield of sugar. The expressed juice contains from 15
                    to 18 per cent. of solids, showing on a good average—sugar, 14·55 per cent.;
                    glucose, 1·65; non-saccharine solids, ·917; ash, ·283. The juice got from
                    sugar-cane is much richer in sugar and less contaminated with non-saccharine
                    solids than that yielded by beet; and its pleasant taste and aromatic odour
                    contrast markedly with the acrid taste and unpleasant smell of beet juice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Purification of the Juice.—</hi> In the hot climates where
                    sugar-canes grow a process of fermentation is almost immediately set up in the
                    impure juices from the canes, causing the formation of invert sugar and later
                    products of fermentation, and thereby a serious loss of sugar. It is therefore
                    essential that with the least possible delay the manufacturing processes should
                    be proceeded with. The juice is first filtered through a set of sieves to remove
                    the mechanical impurities it carries from the mill. Then it is run into the
                    clarifiers, a series of iron vessels capable of holding six or eight hun&lt;lred
                    gallons of juice, and in these it is heated up to about 130° Fahr., and milk of
                    lime is added in quantity sufficient to neutralize the acid constituents it
                    contains. The heat is then raised to just under the boiling-point, when
                    gradually a thick scum rises and forms on the surface, and when the defecation
                    thereby effected is complete the clear liquid below is drawn off. Various other
                    substances besides lime are employed for the defecation of juice, one of which,
                    the bisulphite of lime in the so-called Icery process, has attained considerable
                    favour. The bisulphite is added in excess; the acids of the juice decompose a
                    certain proportion of it, liberating sulphurous acid, which by its influence
                    promotes the coagulation of the albuminous principles and at the same time
                    promotes the bleaching of the liquid. In another process the green juice is
                    first treated with sulphurous acid, which (with the natural acid constituents)
                    is subsequently neutralized by lime. Recently also phosphoric acid has come into
                    favour as a defecating agent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boiling Down.—</hi> From the clarifier the juice passes on to
                    the battery, a range of three to five pans or “coppers,” heated by direct fire,
                    in which it is concentrated down to the crystallizing point. The juice,
                    gradually increasing in density, is passed from the one into the other till it
                    reaches the last of the series, the <hi rend="italic">striking teach,</hi> in
                    which it is concentrated to the granulating point. The skimmings from these pans
                    are collected and used for making rum. From the striking teach the concentrated
                    juice is removed to shallow coolers, in which the crystals form. A few days
                    later it is transferred to hogsheads in the curing-house, and the molasses is
                    drained away from the crystallized raw sugar into tanks. The sugar so obtained
                    is the <hi rend="italic">muscovado</hi> of the sugar-refiners, and both that and
                    the molasses form their principal raw materials. Clayed sugar consists of raw
                    sugar from which a portion of the adherent molasses has been dissolved by the
                    action of moisture percolating through it from moist clay laid over its surface.
                    Labour difficulties and scarcity of water operate against the general
                    introduction of improved systems of working cane-juice, but in many plantations
                    central usines or sugar-factories have been established with great success. In
                    these the canes of many growers are worked up with the aid of the <hi
                    rend="italic">triple effect apparatus,</hi> the vacuum pan, and the centrifugal
                    separator employed by beet manufacturers. Wetzel’s pan, Fryer’s concreter, and
                    similar devices for the efficient evaporation of juice by exposing it to the
                    action of heat in thin films over an extended surface are also in use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Beet Sugar Manufacture.</hi> —The sugar beet is a cultivated
                    variety of <hi rend="italic">Beta maritima</hi> (natural order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chenopodiaceae),</hi> other varieties of which, under the name of mangold or
                    mangel wurzel, are grown as feeding-roots for cattle. The plants are cultivated
                    like turnips, and the roots attain their maturity in about five months after
                    sowing, being gathered during September and October. The efforts of growers have
                    been largely directed to the development of roots yielding juice rich in sugar;
                    and especially in Germany these efforts have been stimulated by the circumstance
                    that excise duty on inland sugar is there calculated on the roots. The duty is
                    based on the assumption that from 12½ parts of beet 1 part of grain sugar is
                    obtained; but in actual practice 1 part of raw sugar is now yielded by 9·27
                    parts of root. Moreover, when the sugar is exported a drawback is paid for that
                    on which no duty was actually levied, and hence indirectly comes the so-called
                    bounty on German sugar. In 1836 for 1 part of sugar 18 parts of beet were used,
                    in 1850 13·8 parts, in 1860 12·7 parts, and now (1887) about 9·25 parts only are
                    required. In France till recently the inland duty was calculated on the raw
                    sugar; hence the French grower devoted himself to the production of roots of a
                    large size yielding great weight per acre, and had no motive to aim at rich
                    juice and economical production. Many processes, therefore, have come into use
                    in German factories which are not available under the French methods of working.
                    But since 1884 the French manufacturers have had the power to elect whether duty
                    shall be levied on the roots they use or on the raw sugar they make, and a large
                    proportion have already chosen the former. The nature of the seasons exercises
                    much influence on the composition of sugar beet, especially on its richness in
                    sugar, which may range from 10 to 20 per cent. The following represents the
                    limits of average composition :—</p>
                <p>Water 84·5 to 79·0</p>
                <p>Sugar and other soluble bodies 11∙5 to 17·0</p>
                <p>Cellulose and other solids 4·0 4·0</p>
                <p>The non-saccharine solids in the juice are very complex, embracing albumen,
                    amido-acids, and other nitrogenous bodies, beetroot gum, soluble pectose
                    compounds, fat, colouring matter, with the phosphates, sulphates, oxalates, and
                    citrates of potash, soda, lime, and iron, and silica. The relation and relative
                    proportion of these to the sugar present are of the utmost importance.</p>
                <p>Two distinct ways of obtaining the juice from beet are now principally
                    employed,—pressure and diffusion. The mechanical methods of pressure are
                    principally used in France; the process of diffusion is all but universal in
                    Germany. Formerly a modified diffusion process—maceration—was in use; but it has
                    now been generally abandoned, as has also a means of separating the juice by
                    centrifugal action. For the mechanical processes the roots have first to be
                    reduced to a condition of fine pulp. For this purpose the roots, thoroughly
                    trimmed and washed, are fed into a pulping machine, in which a large drum or
                    cylinder, armed with close-set rows of saw-toothed blades, is revolved with
                    great rapidity, so that the fleshy roots on coming against them are rasped down
                    to a fine uniform pulp. The operation is assisted by pouring small quantities of
                    water or of watery juice on the revolving drum, which thins the pulp somewhat,
                    and aids the free flow of the juice in the subsequent operation. The expression
                    of the juice is effected either by the hydraulic press or by continuous roller
                    presses. From the hydraulic press the juice flows freely at first; but in order
                    to obtain the largest possible yield it is necessary to moisten the first
                    presscake and submit it to a second pressure, whereby a thin watery juice is
                    expressed. After having been pressed twice, the cake that is left should amount
                    to not more than 17 per cent. of the original roots; hence, allowing 4 per cent.
                    for ligneous tissue, &amp;c., only about 13 per cent. of water, sugar, and
                    soluble salts, &amp;c., remain in the refuse. For the system of continuous
                    pressure presses analogous to the mills employed for cane-crushing are used.
                    Many modifications of the roller press have been introduced, and, although the
                    best express from 3 to 5 per cent. less juice than the hydraulic press, they
                    have several advantages under the system formerly common in France, which bound
                    the maker to return press-cake containing a certain proportion of sugar for use
                    as a feeding-stuff’ on the farm. In certain forms of press the lower rollers are
                    perforated to allow the escape of the expressed juice; in some the rollers are
                    covered with india-rubber, so that they give an elastic squeeze on an extended
                    surface; and in others the pulp is carried in an endless cloth through a series
                    of rollers, being all the while subjected to gradually increasing pressure.</p>
                <p>The diffusion process for obtaining beet juice depends on the action of dialysis,
                    in which two liquids of different degrees of concentration separated by a
                    membrane tend to transfuse through the membrane till equilibrium of solution is
                    attained. In the beet the cell-walls are membranes enclosing a solution of
                    sugar. Supposing these cells to be brought into contact with pure water, then by
                    theory, if the cells contain 12 per cent. of juice, transfusion will go on till
                    an equal weight of water contains 6 per cent. of sugar, while by the passage of
                    water into the cell the juice there is reduced to the same density. Taking the 6
                    per cent. watery solution and with it treating fresh roots containing again 12
                    per cent., a 9 per cent. solution will be attained, which on being brought a
                    third time in contact with fresh roots would be raised to a density of 10·5.
                    Thus theoretically seven-eighths of the whole sugar would be obtained at the
                    third operation, and it is on this theory that the diffusion process is based.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0652-0627"/> ten or twelve diffusers are employed, eight being
                    in operation while the others are being emptied, cleaned, and refilled. These
                    diffusers consist of large close upright cylinders capable of holding each two
                    or three tons of sliced roots. They are provided with manholes above, perforated
                    false bottoms, and pipes communicating with each other, so that the fluid
                    contents of any one can be forced by pressure into any other. In working, pure
                    water from an elevated tank is run into No. 1 cylinder, which contains the
                    slices almost exhausted of their soluble contents; it percolates the mass, and
                    by pressure passes into No. 2, where it acts on slices somewhat richer in juice.
                    So it goes through the series, acquiring density in its progress and meeting in
                    each successive cylinder slices increasingly rich in juice. Before entering the
                    last cylinder the watery juice is heated, and under the combined influence of
                    heat and pressure the juice within the cylinder becomes richly charged with
                    sugar. No. 1 cylinder when exhausted is disconnected; No. 2 then becomes No. 1,
                    and a newly charged cylinder is joined on at the other extremity; and so the
                    operation goes on continuously. The juice ultimately obtained is diluted with
                    about 50 per cent. of water; but it is of a comparatively pure saccharine
                    quality, with less gummy, nitrogenous, and fibrous impurities than accompany the
                    juice yielded by mechanical means.</p>
                <p>If the juice obtained by any process were a pure solution of sugar the
                    manufacturing operations would be few and simple. But beet juice is at best a
                    very mixed solution, containing much gum, acid bodies, nitrogenous matter, and
                    various salts. These adhere to the saccharine solution with the utmost
                    obstinacy; they attack the sugar itself and change crystalline into invert
                    sugar, communicating to it a dirty brown colour and a disagreeable acrid taste
                    and smell. To separate as far as possible the non-saccharine constituents and to
                    remove the colour from the juice are troublesome tasks. The preliminary
                    purification embraces two sets of operations,—first the treatment of the juice
                    with lime and carbonic acid, secondly, filtration through animal charcoal. Under
                    the old method of working the juice is first boiled in a copper pan with milk of
                    lime to the extent of from ½ to 1 per cent. of lime to the weight of juice
                    operated on. The boiling serves to coagulate the albuminoids, while the lime
                    forms with certain of the other impurities an insoluble precipitate, and in part
                    combines with the sugar to form a soluble saccharate of lime. The insoluble lime
                    combination and the coagulum rise as a scum over the surface of the juice, and
                    the latter, now comparatively clear, is drawn off by a siphon pipe, to be
                    treated in another vessel with carbonic acid. The acid breaks up the saccharate
                    of lime and forms insoluble carbonate of lime, which in precipitating carries
                    down further impurities with it. After settlement the clear juice is drawn off
                    and the precipitated slime pressed in a filter press, whereby it gives up the
                    juice it contains. As now commonly conducted these operations—treating with lime
                    and carbonic acid—are combined, according to the method devised by Jelinek. The
                    juice to he purified is heated and treated with as much as 5 per cent. of lime,
                    while carbonic acid is simultaneously injected into the mass. The juice meantime
                    is raised to a temperature just under boiling-point. The addition of such a
                    large amount of lime effects the precipitation of a great proportion of the
                    non-saccharine constituents of the juice. The whole mass of turbid liquid formed
                    by this treatment is forced into a filter press, and there the lime compounds
                    and impurities are separated with great rapidity from the saccharine juice.
                    Numerous other methods of purification have been proposed, and to some extent
                    have met with favourable reception; but of these we can only mention that of
                    Dubrunfaut and De Massy, in which baryta is substituted for lime, thereby
                    producing an insoluble barium saccharate, and the analogous process of
                    Scheibler, in which strontia is employed in the same sense, producing likewise
                    insoluble strontia saccharate. The juice, which still contains much saline and
                    other non-saccharine matter, is next filtered through animal charcoal; this
                    largely removes colouring matter and carries away a further proportion of the
                    salts. Charcoal filtering is an expensive process; being, moreover, a feature of
                    the subsequent refining, many attempts have been made to dispense with it, and
                    the success of the Jelinek method in producing a comparatively pure and
                    colourless juice has given rise to hopes that it may at this stage be yet
                    dispensed with.</p>
                <p>The next operation consists in concentrating the comparatively pure but thin and
                    watery juice,—a work formerly done in open pans by direct firing, hut now
                    carried out in closed vessels, in which the vacuum pan principle of boiling is
                    brought into play. The apparatus consists of a series of three closed vessels,
                    hence called a “triple effect,” although in some cases a two-vessel apparatus or
                    double effect is employed. These pans are provided internally with a series of
                    closed pipes for steam-heating, the steam from the boiler of the first passing
                    by a pipe into the worm of the second, and similarly the steam from the second
                    into the worm of the third when a third pan is employed. The steam which rises
                    in the third pan is drawn off by a condenser and vacuum pump, and, as the vacuum
                    so created acts through the whole series, the juice is evaporated and
                    concentrated at a comparatively low temperature by the agency of the steam
                    supplied to the first pan. Tho juice increases in gravity as it is drawn from
                    the one pan to the other, till by the time it is run off from the third cylinder
                    it has attained a concentration representing a gravity of about 25 Baume. This
                    concentrated juice is while in a heated condition filtered through fresh
                    charcoal, from which it comes ready for boiling down to crystallization. To
                    bring the dense juice to the crystallizing point it is necessary to conduct the
                    evaporation at the lowest possible temperature. High temperature increases the
                    uncrystallizable at the expense of the crystallizable portion, and burns some
                    proportion into caramel, which darkens the liquid and the resulting sugar
                    crystals. Boiling down at low temperature is effected by the use of the vacuum
                    pan, a closed globular vessel in which by the aid of a condenser and air-pump a
                    vacuum is maintained over the boiling juice and the boiling-point is lowered in
                    proportion to the decrease of air pressure. In vacuum pan boiling the thick
                    juice may simply be concentrated to that degree of density from which, on
                    cooling, the crystals will form, or the crystals may be allowed to separate from
                    the mother-liquor in the pan while the boiling proceeds; these crystals, forming
                    nuclei, increase in size from the concentration of fresh charges of juice added
                    from time to time. By this method the boiled-down juice as it leaves the pan
                    consists of a grainy mass of crystals floating in a fluid syrup. After being
                    allowed to cool, the mass is fed into the drum or basket of a centrifugal
                    machine, which by its rapid rotation separates the fluid molasses from the
                    crystals, driving the liquid portion through the meshed wall of the basket. For
                    further cleaning of the crystals from adherent syrup a small quantity of either
                    water or pure syrup is added to the drum, and is likewise forced through the
                    sugar crystals by centrifugal action. Steam also is employed for cleaning the
                    crystals whilst in the centrifugal machine. The syrup from the first supply of
                    sugar is returned to the vacuum pan, again boiled, and treated as above for a
                    second supply of less pure sugar; similarly a third supply is yielded by the
                    drainings of the second. The molasses from the third supply is a highly impure
                    mixture of crystallizable and invert sugar, potash, and other salts, smelling
                    and tasting powerfully of its beet origin. Many methods have been tried to
                    recover the large amount of sugar contained in this molasses. That most
                    extensively* employed is the osmose process originated by Dubrunfaut, in which,
                    by the application of a dialyser, it is found that the salts pass through the
                    membrane more rapidly than does sugar. The elution process of Scheibler, which
                    depends on the formation of a saccharate of lime, and the more recent strontia
                    process of the same chemist, in which a strontiate of lime is formed, are also
                    much employed. Another means of utilizing the molasses consists in fermenting
                    and distilling from it an impure spirit for industrial purposes.</p>

                    raw cane and beetroot sugars which come into the market, and by precisely the
                    same series of operations. The sugar is first melted in charges of 5 or 6 tons
                    in <hi rend="italic">blow-ups,—</hi> cast-iron tanks fitted with mechanical

                    33 Baumé, and formerly it was the practice to treat it, especially when low
                    qualities of sugar were operated on, with blood albumen. The hot liquor is next
                    passed through twilled cotton bags encased in a meshing of hemp, through which
                    the solution is mechanically strained. From 50 to 200 of these filters are
                    suspended in close chambers, in which they are kept hot, from the bottom of a
                    perforated iron tank, each perforation having under it a bag. These bags have
                    from time to time to be taken off for cleaning out and washing. From the bag
                    filter the liquor is passed for decolorizing through beds of animal charcoal
                    enclosed in cisterns to a depth of from 30 to 50 feet, the sugar being received
                    into tanks for concentration in the vacuum pan. In that apparatus it is “boiled
                    to grain,” and the treatment is varied according to the nature of the finished
                    sugar to be made. To make loaves small crystals only are formed in the pan, and
                    the granular magma is run into steam-jacketed open pans and raised to a
                    temperature of about 180° to 190° Fahr., which liquefies the grains. The hot
                    solution is then cast into conical moulds, the form of the loaf, in which the
                    sugar as it cools crystallizes into a solid mass, still surrounded and mixed
                    with a syrup containing coloured and other impurities. After thorough settling
                    and crystallization, a plug at the bottom of the mould is opened and the syrup
                    allowed to drain away. To whiten the loaves they are treated with successive
                    doses of saturated syrup, ending with a syrup of pure colourless sugar. These
                    doses are poured on the upper side of the cone, and, percolating down through
                    the porous mass, carry with them the impure green syrup which still may adhere
                    to the crystals. The liquor which obstinately remains in the interstices is
                    driven out by suction or centrifugal action , the loaf is rounded off, papered,
                    and placed in a stove tor drying. The syrup which drains from the loaves is sold
                    as golden syrup. When refined crystals are to be made the contents of the vacuum
                    pan are passed into the centrifugal machine; the syrup is then driven off by
                    rotation, and the crystals purified either by adding pure syrup to the revolving
                    basket or by blowing steam through it.<pb break="no"

                    for domestic use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Palm Sugar.</hi> —That which comes into the European market
                    as <hi rend="italic">jaggery</hi> or <hi rend="italic">khaur</hi> is obtained
                    from the sap of several palms, the wild date <hi rend="italic">(Phoenix
                    sylvestris),</hi> the Palmyra <hi rend="italic">(Borassus flabelliformis),</hi>
                    the cocoa-nut <hi rend="italic">(Cocos nucifera),</hi> the gomuti <hi
                    rend="italic">(Arenga saceharifcra),</hi> and others. The principal source is
                    <hi rend="italic">Phoenix sylvestris,</hi> which is cultivated in a portion of
                    the Ganges valley to the north of Calcutta. The trees are ready to yield sap
                    when five years old; at eight years they are mature, and continue to give an
                    annual supply till they reach thirty years. The collection of the sap (toddy)
                    begins about the end of October and continues, during the cool season, till the
                    middle of February. The sap is drawn off from the upper growing portion of the
                    stem, and altogether an average tree will run in a season 350 lb of toddy, from
                    which about 35 lb of raw sugar—jaggery—is made by simple and rude processes.
                    Jaggery production is entirely in native hands, and the greater part of the
                    amount made is consumed locally; it only occasionally reaches the European
                    market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Starch Sugar.</hi> —This, known in commerce as glucose or
                    grape sugar, an abundant constituent of sweet fruits, &amp;c. (see p. 623
                    above), is artificially elaborated on an extensive scale from starch. The
                    industry is most largely developed in Germany, where potato starch is the raw
                    material, and in the United States, Indian corn starch being there employed. The
                    starch is acted on by a weak solution of sulphuric acid, whereby soluble starch
                    is formed, which ultimately results in a mixture of glucose aud dextrose in
                    varying proportions, constituting the starch sugar of commerce. The operations
                    embrace the boiling of the starch with water containing the requisite proportion
                    of acid, the neutralization of the acid with lime, and the formation of a
                    precipitate of sulphate of lime, which is separated by filtration in a filter
                    press. The filtered liquid is, when necessary, deprived of colour by passing it
                    through a bed of animal charcoal, and then it is concentrated to a density of
                    from 40 to 45 Baumé in a vacuum pan. If the resulting syrup contains little
                    dextrin it will on cooling slowly solidify into a granular concretionary mass;
                    but if much dextrin is present it remains in the condition of a syrup. Starch
                    sugar is very largely used by brewers and distillers, and by liqueur makers,
                    confectioners, and others for making fruit and other syrups. Burnt to caramel,
                    it is also employed to colour beverages and food substances. As an adulterant it
                    is largely employed in the honey trade and for mixing with the more valuable
                    cane sugar. In 1885 there were about fifty factories in Germany engaged in
                    starch sugar making, in which 10,000 tons of hard sugar, 20,000 tons of syrup,
                    and 1250 tons of “colour” were made.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.</hi></p>
                <p>At the present time, judging by the amount sent to the market, cane and beet
                    sugars are produced in about equal amount; but, since vast quantities of cane
                    sugar are grown and consumed in India, China, and other Eastern countries of
                    which we get no account, there cannot be a doubt that the annual production of
                    cane far exceeds that of beet sugar. Still, as a growth of not more than forty
                    years, the dimensions to which the beet sugar trade has attained are certainly
                    remarkable. But these dimensions would not have been so suddenly attained had it
                    not been for the system of protection established in the producing countries and
                    of bounties paid to the beet manufacturers on exporting their produce. The</p>
                <p>United Kingdom is the only open market for sugar, which is consequently sold
                    there at an unprecedentedly low price. The following table shows the relative
                    proportions of the beet and the cane sugar trade and the principal sources of
                    the supply for 1880-85 :—</p>
