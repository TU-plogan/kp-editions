                    characteristic of Tuscany, stands (43° 19' N. lat., 11° 19' E. long.) on a hill
                    near the mountainous region of Chianti, the Maremma, and Val di Chiana. It is 60
                    miles by rail south of Florence and 160 north-west of Rome. The area of the city
                    within the walls is about 2 ½ square miles and its population in 1881 was
                    25,204. The province of Siena, comprising about 1467 square miles, with 37
                    communes, and a total population of 207,000, by the political redistribution of
                    1882 forms a single electoral college and returns four members to parliament.
                    The diocese of Siena, an archbishopric dating from 1459, includes 18 city and 95
                    rural parishes divided into 12 vicariates.</p>
                <p>The city possesses a university, founded in 1203 and limited to the faculties of
                    law and medicine. Among the other public institutions the following are the more
                    important:—the town library, first opened to students in the 17th century; the
                    Archivio, a record office, instituted in 1858, containing a valuable and
                    splendidly arranged collection of documents; the Fine Arts Institution, founded
                    in 1816; and the natural history museum of the Royal Academy of the
                    Physiocritics, inaugurated in the same year. There are also many flourishing
                    charities, including an excellent hospital and a school for the deaf and
                    dumb.</p>
                <p>The public festivals of Siena known as the “Palio delle Contrade” have a European
                    celebrity. They are held in the public square, the curious and historic Piazza
                    del Campo (now Piazza di Vittorio Emanuele), on 2d July and 16th August of each
                    year; they date from the Middle Ages and were instituted in commemoration of
                    victories and in honour of the Virgin Mary (the old title of Siena, as shown by
                    seals and medals, having been “Sena vetus civitas Virginis”). In the 15th and
                    16th centuries the celebrations consisted of bull-fights. At the close of the
                    16th century these were replaced by races with mounted buffaloes, and since 1650
                    by (ridden) horses. Siena is divided into seventeen <hi rend="italic"
                    >contrade</hi> (wards), each with a distinct appellation and a chapel and flag
                    of its own; and every year ten of these <hi rend="italic">contrade,</hi> chosen
                    by lot, send each one horse to compete for the prize <hi rend="italic"
                    >palio</hi> or banner. The aspect of Siena during these meetings is very
                    characteristic, and the whole festivity bears a mediaeval stamp in harmony with
                    the architecture and history of the town.</p>
                <p>Among the noblest fruits of Sienese art are the public buildings adorning the
                    city. The cathedral, one of the finest examples of Italian Gothic architecture,
                    was begun in the early years of the 13th century, and in 1317 its walls were
                    extended to the baptistery of San Giovanni; a further enlargement was begun in
                    1339 but never carried out, and a few ruined walls and arches alone remain to
                    show the magnificence of the uncompleted design. The splendid west front, of
                    tricuspidal form, enriched with a multitude of columns, statues, and inlaid
                    marbles, was finished in 1380. Space fails for the enumeration of the art
                    treasures of the interior, but conspicuous among them is the well-known
                    octagonal pulpit by Niccolò Pisano, dating from about 1274. The cathedral
                    pavement is almost unique. It is inlaid with designs in colour and black and
                    white, representing Biblical and legendary subjects, and is supposed to have
                    been begun by Duccio della Buoninsegna. But the finest portions beneath the
                    domes, with scenes from the history of Abraham, Moses, and Elijah, are by
                    Domenico Beccafumi and are executed with marvellous boldness and effect. The
                    choir stalls also deserve mention: the older ones (remains of the original
                    choir) are in <hi rend="italic">tarsia</hi> work; the others, dating from the
                    16th century, are carved from Riccio's designs. The Piccolomini Library,
                    adjoining the <hi rend="italic">duomo,</hi> was founded by Cardinal Francesco
                    Piccolomini-Todeschini<pb break="no"

                    Pius II. Here are Pinturicchio’s famous frescos of scenes from the life of the
                    latter pontiff and the collection of choir books (supported on sculptured desks)
                    with splendid illuminations by Sienese and other artists. The church of San
                    Giovanni, the ancient baptistery, beneath the cathedral is approached by an
                    outer flight of marble steps built in 1451. It has a beautiful façade designed
                    by Giovanni di Mino del Pellicciaio in 1382, and a marvellous font with
                    bas-reliefs by Donatello, Ghiberti, Giacomo della Quercia, and other
                    15th-century sculptors. The other churches are—the Collegiata di Proyenzano, a
                    vast building of some elegance, designed by Schifardini (1594); Sant’ Agostino,
                    rebuilt by Van vitelli in 1755, containing a Crucifixion and Saints by Perugino,
                    a Massacre of the Innocents by Matteo di Giovanni, the Coming of the Magi by
                    Sodoma, and a St Antony by Spagnoletto or his school; the beautiful church of
                    the Servîtes (15th century), which contains another Massacre of the Innocents by
                    Matteo di Giovanni and other good examples of the Sienese school; San Francesco,
                    designed by Agostino and Agnolo about 1326, and now (1887) being restored, which
                    once possessed many fine paintings by Duccio Buoninsegna, Lorenzetti, Sodoma,
                    and Beccafumi, but some of these perished in the great fire of 1655, and the
                    rest were removed to the Institute of Fine Arts after 1862 during the temporary
                    desecration of the church; San Domenico, a fine 13th-century building with a
                    single nave and transept, containing Sodoma’s splendid fresco the Swoon of St
                    Catherine, the Madonna of Guido da Siena, and a crucifix by Sano di Pietro. This
                    church crowns the Fontebranda hill above the famous fountain of that name
                    immortalized by Dante, and in a steep lane below stands the house of St
                    Catherine, now converted into a church and oratory, and maintained at the
                    expense of the inhabitants of the Contrada dell’ Oca. It contains some good
                    pictures by Pacchia and other works of art, but is chiefly visited for its
                    historic interest and as a striking memorial of the characteristic piety of the
                    Sienese.</p>
                <p>The communal palace in the Piazza del Campo was begun in 1288 and finished in
                    1309. It is built of brick, is a fine specimen of Pointed Gothic, and was
                    designed by Agostino and Agnolo. The light and elegant tower (Torre del Mangia)
                    soaring from one side of the palace was begun in 1325, and the chapel standing
                    at its foot, raised at the expense of the Opera del Duomo as a public
                    thank-offering after the plague of 1348, dates from 1352. This grand old palace
                    has other attractions besides the beauty of its architecture, for its interior
                    is lined with works of art. The atrium has a fresco by Bartolo di Fredi and the
                    two ground-floor halls contain a Coronation of the Virgin by Sano di Pietro and
                    a splendid Resurrection by Sodoma. In the Sala dei Nove or della Pace above are
                    the noble allegorical frescos of Ambrogio Lorenzetti representing the effects of
                    just and unjust government; the Sala delle Balestre or del Mappamondo is painted
                    by Simone di Martino (Memmi) and others, the Cappella della Signoria by Taddeo
                    di Bartolo, and the Sala del Concistorio by Beccafumi. Another hall is now being
                    prepared in memory of Victor Emmanuel II., and its frescos and decorations are
                    to be entrusted exclusively to Sienese artists. The former hall of the grand
                    council, built in 1327, was converted into the chief theatre of Siena by Riccio
                    in 1560, and, after being twice burnt, was rebuilt in 1753 from Bibbiena’s
                    designs. Another Sienese theatre, the Rozzi, in Piazza San Pellegrino, designed
                    by A. Doveri and erected in 1816, although modern, has an historic interest as
                    the work of an academy dating from the 16th century, called the Congrega de’
                    Rozzi, that played an important part in the history of the Italian comic
                    stage.</p>
                <p>The city is adorned by many other noble edifices both public and private, of
                    which we will mention the following palaces—the Tolomei (1205); Buonsignori,
                    formerly Tegliacci, an elegant 14th-century construction, restored in 1848;
                    Grottanelli, formerly Pecci and anciently the residence of the captain of war,
                    recently restored in its original style; Sansedoni; Marsilii; Piccolomini, now
                    belonging to the Government and containing the state archives; Piccolomini delle
                    Papesse, like the other Piccolomini mansion, designed by Bernardo Rossellino,
                    and now the national bank; the enormous block of the Monte de’ Paschi, enlarged
                    and partly rebuilt in the original style between 1877 and 1881, and including
                    the old Dogana and Spannocchi palaces; the Loggia di Mercanzia (15th century),
                    now a club; the Loggia del Papa, erected by Pius II.; and other fine buildings.
                    We must also mention the two celebrated fountains, Fonte Gaia and Fontebranda;
                    the Fonte Nuova, near Porta Ovile, by Camaino di Crescentino also deserves
                    notice. Thanks to all these architectural treasures, the narrow Sienese streets
                    with their many windings and steep ascents are full of picturesque charm, and,
                    together with the collections of excellent paintings, foster the local pride of
                    the inhabitants and preserve their taste and feeling for art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The origin of Siena, like that of other Italian
                    cities, is lost in a mist of legendary tradition. It was probably founded by the
                    Etruscans, and then falling under the Roman rule became a colony in the reign of
                    Augustus, or a little earlier, and was distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Saena Julia.</hi> Few memorials of the Roman era or of the first
                    centuries of Christianity have been preserved, and none at all of the interval
                    preceding the Lombard period. We have documentary evidence that during this
                    epoch, in the reign of Rotaris (or Rotari), there was a bishop of Siena named
                    Mouro. Attempts to trace earlier bishops as far back as the 5th century have
                    yielded only vague and contradictory results. Under the Lombards the civil
                    government was in the hands of a <hi rend="italic">gastaldo,</hi> under the
                    Carolingians of a count, whose authority, by slow degrees and a course of events
                    similar to what took place in other Italian communes, gave way to that of the
                    bishop, whose power in turn gradually diminished and was superseded by that of
                    the consuls and the commonwealth.</p>
                <p>We have written evidence of the consular government of Siena from 1125 to 1212;
                    the number of consuls varied from three to twelve. This government, formed of
                    <hi rend="italic">gentil-uomini</hi> or nobles, did not remain unchanged
                    throughout the whole period, but was gradually forced to accept the
                    participation of the <hi rend="italic">popolani</hi> or lower classes, whose
                    efforts to rise to power were continuous and determined. Thus in 1137 they
                    obtained a third part of the government by the reconstitution of the general
                    council with 100 nobles and 50 <hi rend="italic">popolani.</hi> In 1199 the
                    institution of a foreign <hi rend="italic">podestà</hi> gave a severe blow to
                    the consular magistracy, which was soon extinguished; and in 1233 the people
                    again rose against the nobles in the hope of ousting them entirely from office.
                    The attempt was not completely successful; but the Government was now equally
                    divided between the two estates by the creation of a supreme magistracy of
                    twenty-four citizens,—twelve nobles and twelve <hi rend="italic">popolani.</hi>
                    During the rule of the nobles and the mixed rule of nobles and <hi rend="italic"
                    >popolani</hi> the commune of Siena was enlarged by fortunate acquisitions of
                    neighbouring lands and by the submission of feudal lords, such as the
                    Scialenghi, Aldobrandeschi, Pannocchieschi, Visconti di Campiglia, Ac. Before
                    long the reciprocal need of fresh territory and frontier disputes, especially
                    concerning Poggibonsi and Montepulciano, led to an outbreak of hostilities
                    between Florence and Siena. Thereupon, to spite the rival republic, the Sienese
                    took the Ghibelline side, and the German emperors, beginning with Frederick
                    Barbarossa, rewarded their fidelity by the grant of various privileges.</p>
                <p>During the 12th and 13th centuries there were continued disturbances, petty wars,
                    and hasty reconciliations between Florence and Siena, until in 1254-55 a more
                    binding peace and alliance was concluded. But this treaty, in spite of its
                    apparent stability, led in a few years to a fiercer struggle; for in 1258 the
                    Florentines complained that Siena had infringed its terms by giving refuge to
                    the Ghibellines they had expelled, and on the refusal of the Sienese to yield to
                    these just remonstrances both states made extensive preparations for war. Siena
                    applied to Manfred, obtained from him a strong body of German horse, under the
                    command of Count Giordano, and likewise sought the aid of its Ghibelline allies.
                    Florence equipped a powerful citizen army, of which the original registers are
                    still preserved in the volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Il Libro di
                    Montaperti</hi> in the Florence archives. This army, led by the podestà of
                    Florence and twelve burgher captains, set forth gaily on its march towards the
                    enemy’s territories in the middle of April 1260, and during its first campaign,
                    ending 18th May, won an insignificant victory at Santa Petronilla, outside the
                    walls of Siena. But in a second and more important campaign, in which the
                    militia of the other Guelf towns of Tuscany took part, the Florentines were
                    signally defeated at Montaperti on 4th September 1260. This defeat crushed the
                    power of Florence for many years, reduced the city to desolation, and apparently
                    annihilated<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n55/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0055-0040"/> the Florentine Guelfs. But the battle of
                    Benevento (1266) and the establishment of the dynasty of Charles of Anjou on the
                    Neapolitan throne put an end to the Ghibelline predominance in Tuscany.
                    Ghibelline Siena soon felt the effects of the change in the defeat of its army
                    at Colle di Valdelsa (1269) by the united forces of the Guelf exiles,
                    Florentines, and French, and the death in that battle of her powerful citizen
                    Provenzano Salvani (mentioned by Dante), who had been the leading spirit of the
                    Government at the time of the victory of Montaperti. For some time Siena
                    remained faithful to the Ghibelline cause; nevertheless Guelf and democratic
                    sentiments began to make head. The Ghibellines were on several occasions
                    expelled from the city, and, even when a temporary reconciliation of the two
                    parties allowed them to return, they failed to regain their former
                    influence.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the popular party acquired increasing power in the state. Exasperated
                    by the tyranny of the Salimbeni and other patrician families allied to the
                    Ghibellines, it decreed in 1277 the exclusion of all nobles from the supreme
                    magistracy (consisting since 1270 of thirty-six instead of twenty-four members),
                    and insisted that this council should be formed solely of Guelf traders and men
                    of the middle class. This constitution was confirmed in 1280 by the reduction of
                    the supreme magistracy to fifteen members, all of the humbler classes, and was
                    definitively sanctioned in 1285 (and 1287) by the institution of the magistracy
                    of nine. This council of nine, composed only of burghers, carried on the
                    government for about seventy years, and its rule was sagacious and peaceful. The
                    territories of the state were enlarged; a friendly alliance was maintained with
                    Florence; trade flourished; in 1321 the university was founded, or rather
                    revived, by the introduction of Bolognese scholars; the principal buildings now
                    adorning the town were begun; and the charitable institutions, which are the
                    pride of modern Siena, increased and prospered. But meanwhile the exclusiveness
                    of the single class of citizens from whose ranks the chief magistrates were
                    drawn had converted the government into a close oligarchy and excited the hatred
                    of every other class. Nobles, judges, notaries, and populace rose in frequent
                    revolt, while the nine defended their state (1295-1309) by a strong body of
                    citizen militia divided into <hi rend="italic">terzieri</hi> (sections) and <hi
                    rend="italic">contrade</hi> (wards), and violently repressed these attempts. But
                    in 1355 the arrival of Charles IV. in Siena gave fresh courage to the
                    malcontents, who, backed by the imperial authority, overthrew the government of
                    the nine and substituted a magistracy of twelve drawn from the lowest class.
                    These new rulers were to some extent under the influence of the nobles who had
                    fomented the rebellion, but the latter were again soon excluded from all share
                    in the government. This was the beginning of a determined struggle for
                    supremacy, carried on for many years, between the different classes of citizens,
                    locally termed <hi rend="italic">ordini</hi> or <hi rend="italic">monti,—</hi>
                    the lower classes striving to grasp the reins of government, the higher classes
                    already in office striving to keep all power in their own hands, or to divide it
                    in proportion to the relative strength of each <hi rend="italic">monte.</hi> As
                    this struggle is of too complex a nature to be described in detail, we must
                    limit ourselves to a summary of its leading episodes.</p>
                <p>The twelve who replaced the council of nine (as these had previously replaced the
                    council of the nobles) consisted —both as individuals and as a party—of
                    ignorant, incapable, turbulent men, who could neither rule the state with
                    firmness nor confer prosperity on the republic. They speedily broke with the
                    nobles, for whose manoeuvres they had at first been useful tools, and then split
                    into two factions, one siding with the Tolomei, the other, the more restless and
                    violent, with the Salimbeni and the <hi rend="italic">noveschi</hi></p>
                <p>(partisans of the nine), who, having still some influence in the city, probably
                    fomented these dissensions, and, as we shall see later on, skilfully availed
                    themselves of every chance likely to restore them to power. In 1368 the
                    adversaries of the twelve succeeded in driving them by force from the public
                    palace, and substituting a government of thirteen,—ten nobles and three <hi
                    rend="italic">noveschi.</hi> This government lasted only twenty-two days, from
                    2d to 24th September, and was easily overturned by the dominant faction of the
                    <hi rend="italic">dodicini</hi> (partisans of the twelve), aided by the
                    Salimbeni and the populace, and favoured by the emperor Charles IV. The nobles
                    were worsted, being driven from the city as well as from power; but the absolute
                    rule of the twelve was brought to an end, and right of participation in the
                    government was extended to another class of citizens. For, on the expulsion of
                    the thirteen from the palace, a council of 124 plebeians created a new
                    magistracy of twelve <hi rend="italic">difensori</hi> (defenders), no longer
                    drawn exclusively from the order of the twelve, but composed of five of the <hi
                    rend="italic">popolo minuto,</hi> or lowest populace (now first admitted to the
                    government), four of the twelve, and three of the nine. But it was of short
                    duration, for the <hi rend="italic">dodicini</hi> were ill satisfied with their
                    share, and in December of the same year (1368) joined with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >popolo minuto</hi> in an attempt to expel the three <hi rend="italic"
                    >noveschi</hi> from the palace. But the new popular order, which had already
                    asserted its predominance in the council of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >riformatori,</hi> now drove out the <hi rend="italic">dodicini,</hi> and for
                    five days (11th to 16th December) kept the government in its own hands. Then,
                    however, moved by fear of the emperor, who had passed through Siena two months
                    before on his way to Rome, and who was about to halt there on his return, it
                    tried to conciliate its foes by creating a fresh council of 150 <hi
                    rend="italic">riformatori,</hi> who replaced the twelve defenders by a new
                    supreme magistracy of fifteen, consisting of eight <hi rend="italic"
                    >popolani,</hi> four <hi rend="italic">dodicini,</hi> and three <hi
                    rend="italic">noveschi,</hi> entitled respectively “people of the greater
                    number,” “people of the middle number,” and “people of the less number.” From
                    this renewal dates the formation of the new order or <hi rend="italic">monte dei
                    riformatori,</hi> the title henceforth bestowed on all citizens, of both the
                    less and the greater people, who had reformed the government and begun to
                    participate in it in 1368. The turbulent faction of the twelve and the
                    Salimbeni, being dissatisfied with these changes, speedily rose against the new
                    Government. This time they were actively aided by Charles IV., who, having
                    returned from Rome, sent his militia, commanded by the imperial vicar Malatesta
                    da Rimini, to attack the public palace. But the Sienese people, being called to
                    arms by the council of fifteen, made a most determined resistance, routed the
                    imperial troops, captured the standard, and confined the emperor in the
                    Salimbeni palace. Thereupon Charles came to terms with the Government, granted
                    it an imperial patent, and left the city, consoled for his humiliation by the
                    gift of a large sum of money.</p>
                <p>In spite of its wide basis and great energy, the <hi rend="italic">monte dei
                    riformatori,</hi> the heart of the new Government, could not satisfactorily cope
                    with the attacks of adverse factions and treacherous allies. So, the better to
                    repress them, it created in 1369 a chief of the police, with the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">esecutore,</hi> and a numerous association of <hi rend="italic"
                    >popolani—</hi> the company or <hi rend="italic">casata grande</hi> of the
                    people—as bulwarks against the nobles, who had been recalled from banishment,
                    and who, though fettered by strict regulations, were now eligible for offices of
                    the state. But the appetite for power of the “less people” and the dregs of the
                    populace was whetted rather than satisfied by the installation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">riformatori</hi> in the principal posts of authority. Among the
                    wool-carders—men of the lowest class, dwelling in the precipitous lanes about
                    the Porta Ovile—there was an<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n56/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0056-0041"/> association styling itself the “company of the
                    worm.” During the famine of 1371 this company rose in revolt, sacked the houses
                    of the rich, invaded the public palace, drove from the council of fifteen the
                    four members of the twelve and the three of the nine, and replaced them by seven
                    tatterdemalions. Then, having withdrawn to its own quarter, it was suddenly
                    attacked by the infuriated citizens (<hi rend="italic">noveschi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">dodicini</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> who broke into houses and
                    workshops and put numbers of the inhabitants to the sword without regard for age
                    or sex. Thereupon the popular rulers avenged these misdeeds by many summary
                    executions in the piazza. These disorders were only checked by fresh changes in
                    the council of fifteen. It was now formed of twelve of the greater people and
                    three <hi rend="italic">noveschi,</hi> to the total exclusion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">dodicini,</hi> who, on account of their growing turbulence, were
                    likewise banished from the city.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Government had also to contend with difficulties outside the walls.
                    The neighbouring lords attacked and ravaged the municipal territories; grave
                    injuries were inflicted by the mercenary bands, especially by the Bretons and
                    Gascons. The rival claims to the Neapolitan kingdom of Carlo di Durazzo and
                    Louis of Anjou caused fresh disturbances in Tuscany. The Sienese Government
                    conceived hopes of gaining possession of the city of Arezzo, which was first
                    occupied by Durazzo’s men, and then by Enguerrand de Coucy for Louis of Anjou;
                    but while the Sienese were nourishing dreams of conquest the French general
                    unexpectedly sold the city to the Florentines, whose negotiations had been
                    conducted with marvellous ability and despatch (1384). The gathering
                    exasperation of the Sienese, and notably of the middle class, against their
                    rulers was brought to a climax by this cruel disappointment. Their discontent
                    had been gradually swelled by various acts of home and foreign policy during the
                    sixteen years’ rule of the <hi rend="italic">riformatori,</hi> nor had the
                    concessions granted to the partisans of the twelve and the latter’s recall and
                    renewed eligibility to office availed to conciliate them. At last the revolt
                    broke out and gained the upper hand, in March 1385. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >riformatori</hi> were ousted from power and expelled the city, and the trade of
                    Siena suffered no little injury by the exile of so many artisan families. The
                    fifteen were replaced by a new supreme magistracy of ten priors, chosen in the
                    following proportions,—four of the twelve, four of the nine, and two of the
                    people proper, or people of the greater number, but to the exclusion of all who
                    had shared in the government or sat in council under the <hi rend="italic"
                    >riformatori.</hi> Thus began a new order or <hi rend="italic">monte del
                    popolo,</hi> composed of families of the same class as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >riformatori,</hi> but having had no part in the government during the latter’s
                    rule. But, though now admitted to power through the burgher reaction, as a
                    concession to democratic ideas, and to cause a split among the greater people,
                    they enjoyed very limited privileges.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and restored the liberties of Siena. During the interval the supreme magistracy
                    had assumed a more popular form. By the partial readmission of the <hi
                    rend="italic">riformatori</hi> and exclusion of the twelve, the permanent <hi
                    rend="italic">balìa</hi> was now composed of nine priors (three of the nine,
                    three of the people, and three of the <hi rend="italic">riformatori)</hi> and of
                    a captain of the people to be chosen from each of the three <hi rend="italic"
                    >monti</hi> in turn. On 11th April peace was made with the Florentines and Siena
                    enjoyed several years of tranquil prosperity.</p><p>But the great Western schism
                    then agitating the Christian world again brought disturbance to Siena. In
                    consequence of the decisions of the council of Pisa, Florence and Siena had
                    declared against Gregory XII. (1409); Ladislaus of Naples, therefore, as a
                    supporter of the pope, seized the opportunity to make incursions on Sienese
                    territory, laying it waste and threatening the city. The Sienese maintained a
                    vigorous resistance till the death of this monarch in 1414 freed them from his
                    attacks. In 1431 a fresh war with Florence broke out, caused by the latter’s
                    attempt upon Lucca, and continued in consequence of the Florentines’ alliance
                    with Venice and Pope Eugenius IV., and that of the Sienese with the duke of
                    Milan and Sigismund, king of the Romans. This monarch halted at Siena on his way
                    to Rome to be crowned, and received a most princely welcome. In 1433 the
                    opposing leagues signed a treaty of peace, and, although it was disadvantageous
                    to the Sienese and temptations to break it were frequently urged upon them, they
                    faithfully adhered to its terms. During this period of comparative tranquillity
                    Siena was honoured by the visit of Pope Eugenius IV. (1443) and by that of the
                    emperor Frederick III., who came there to receive his bride, Eleanor of
                    Portugal, from the hands of Bishop Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini, his secretary and
                    historian (1452). This meeting is recorded by the memorial column still to be
                    seen outside the Camollia gate. In 1453 hostilities against Florence were again
                    resumed, on account of the invasions and ravages of Sienese territory committed
                    by Florentine troops in their conflicts with Alphonso of Naples, who since 1447
                    had made Tuscany his battle-ground. Peace was once more patched up with Florence
                    in 1454. Siena was next at war for several years with Aldobrandino Orsini, count
                    of Pitigliano, and with Jacopo Piccinini, and suffered many disasters from the
                    treachery of its generals. About the same time the republic was exposed to still
                    graver danger by the conspiracy of some of its leading citizens to seize the
                    reins of power and place the city under the suzerainty of Alphonso, as it had
                    once been under that of the duke of Milan. But the plot came to light; its chief
                    ringleaders were beheaded, and many others sent into exile (1456); and the death
                    of Alphonso at last ended all danger from that source. During those critical
                    times the government of the state was strengthened by a new executive magistracy
                    called the <hi rend="italic">balìa,</hi> which from 1455 began to act
                    independently of the priors or consistory. Until then it had been merely a
                    provisional committee annexed to the latter. But henceforward the <hi
                    rend="italic">balìa</hi> had supreme jurisdiction in all affairs of the state,
                    although always, down to the fall of the republic, nominally preserving the
                    character of a magistracy extraordinary. The election of Aeneas Sylvius
                    Piccolomini to the papal chair in 1458 caused the utmost joy to the Sienese; and
                    in compliment to their illustrious fellow-citizen they granted the request of
                    the nobles and readmitted them to a share in the government. But this
                    concession, grudgingly made, only remained in force for a few years, and on the
                    death of the pope (1464) was revoked altogether, save in the case of members of
                    the Piccolomini house, who were decreed to be <hi rend="italic">popolani</hi>
                    and</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1387 fresh quarrels with Florence on the subject of Montepulciano led to an
                    open war, that was further aggravated by the interference in Tuscan affairs of
                    the ambitious duke of Milan, Gian Galeazzo Visconti. With him the Sienese
                    concluded an alliance in 1389 and ten years later accepted his suzerainty and
                    resigned the liberties of their state. But in 1402 the death of Gian Galeazzo
                    lightened their yoke. In that year the first plot against the Vis-contian rule,
                    hatched by the twelve and the Salimbeni and fomented by the Florentines, was
                    violently repressed, and caused the twelve to be again driven from office; but
                    in<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n57/mode/1up"

                    Meanwhile fresh discords were brewing among the plebeians at the head of
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>The conspiracy of the Pazzi in 1478 led to a war in which Florence and Milan were
                    opposed to the pope and the king of Naples, and which was put an end to by the
                    peace of 13th March 1480. Thereupon Alphonso, duke of Calabria, who was fighting
                    in Tuscany on the side of his father Ferdinand, came to an agreement with Siena
                    and, in the same way as his grandfather Alphonso, tried to obtain the lordship
                    of the city and the recall of the exiled rebels of 1456. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >noveschi</hi> (to whose order most of the rebels belonged) favoured his
                    pretensions, but the <hi rend="italic">riformatori</hi> were against him. Many
                    of the people sided with the <hi rend="italic">noveschi,</hi> rose in revolt on
                    22d June 1480, and, aided by the duke’s soldiery, reorganized the government to
                    their own advantage. Dividing the power between their two orders of the nine and
                    the people, they excluded the <hi rend="italic">riformatori</hi> and replaced
                    them by a new and heterogeneous order styled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aggregati,</hi> composed of nobles, exiles of 1456, and citizens of other
                    orders who had never before been in office. But this violent and perilous upset
                    of the internal liberties of the republic did not last long. A decree issued by
                    the Neapolitan king (1482) depriving the Sienese of certain territories in
                    favour of Florence entirely alienated their affections from that monarch.
                    Meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">monte</hi> of the nine, the chief promoters of
                    the revolution of 1480, were exposed to the growing hatred and envy of their
                    former allies, the <hi rend="italic">monte del popolo,</hi> who, conscious of
                    their superior strength and numbers, now sought to crush the <hi rend="italic"
                    >noveschi</hi> and rise to power in their stead. This change of affairs was
                    accomplished by a series of riots between 7th June 1482 and 20th February 1483.
                    The <hi rend="italic">monte del popolo</hi> seized the lion’s share of the
                    government; the <hi rend="italic">riformatori</hi> were recalled, the <hi
                    rend="italic">aggregati</hi> abolished, and the <hi rend="italic">noveschi</hi>
                    condemned to perpetual banishment from the government and the city. But “in
                    perpetuo" was an empty form of words in those turbulent Italian republics. The
                    <hi rend="italic">noveschi,</hi> being “fat burghers” with powerful connexions,
                    abilities, and traditions, gained increased strength and influence in exile; and
                    five years later, on 22d July 1487, they returned triumphantly to Siena,
                    dispersed the few adherents of the <hi rend="italic">popolo</hi> who offered
                    resistance, murdered the captain of the people, reorganized the state, and
                    placed it under the protection of the Virgin Mary. And, their own predominance
                    being assured by their numerical strength and influence, they accorded equal
                    shares of power to the other <hi rend="italic">monti.</hi></p>
                <p>Among the returned exiles was Pandolfo Petrucci, chief of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >noveschi</hi> and soon to be at the head of the Government. During the
                    domination of this man (who, like Lorenzo de’ Medici, was surnamed “the
                    Magnificent ”) Siena enjoyed many years of splendour and prosperity. We use the
                    term “domination” rather than “signory” inasmuch as, strictly speaking, Petrucci
                    was never lord of the state, and left its established form of government intact;
                    but he exercised despotic authority in virtue of his strength of character and
                    the continued increase of his personal power. He based his foreign policy on
                    alliance with Florence and France, and directed the internal affairs of the
                    state by means of the council (<hi rend="italic">collegio</hi>) of the <hi
                    rend="italic">balìa,</hi> which, although occasionally reorganized for the
                    purpose of conciliating rival factions, was always subject to his will. He
                    likewise added to his power by assuming the captainship of the city guard
                    (1495), and later by the purchase from the impoverished commune of several
                    outlying castles (1507). Nor did he shrink from deeds of bloodshed and revenge:
                    the assassination of his father-in-law, Niccolò Borghesi (1500), is an indelible
                    blot upon his name. He successfully withstood all opposition within the state,
                    until he was at last worsted in his struggle with Cesare Borgia, who caused his
                    expulsion from Siena in 1502. But through the friendly mediation of the
                    Florentines and the French king he was recalled from banishment on 29th March
                    1503. He maintained his power until his death at the age of sixty on 21st May
                    1512, and was interred with princely ceremonials at the public expense. The
                    predominance of his family in Siena did not last long after his decease.
                    Pandolfo had not the qualities required to found a dynasty such as that of the
                    Medici. He lacked the lofty intellect of a Cosimo or a Lorenzo, and the
                    atmosphere of liberty-loving Siena with its ever-changing factions was in no way
                    suited to his purpose. His eldest son, Borghese Petrucci, was incapable,
                    haughty, and exceedingly corrupt; he only remained three years at the head of
                    affairs and fled ignominiously in 1515. Through the favour of Leo X. he was
                    succeeded by his cousin Raffaello Petrucci, previously governor of St Angelo and
                    afterwards a cardinal.</p>
                <p>This Petrucci was a bitter enemy to Pandolfo’s children. He caused Borghese and a
                    younger son named Fabio to be proclaimed as rebels, while a third son, Cardinal
                    Alphonso, was strangled by order of Leo X. in 1518. He was a tyrannical ruler,
                    and died suddenly in 1522. In the following year Clement VII. insisted on the
                    recall of Fabio Petrucci; but two years later a fresh popular outbreak drove him
                    from Siena for ever. The city then placed itself under the protection of the
                    emperor Charles V., created a magistracy of “ten conservators of the liberties
                    of the state” (December 1524), united the different <hi rend="italic">monti</hi>
                    in one named the “<hi rend="italic">monte</hi> of the reigning nobles,” and,
                    rejoicing to be rid of the last of the Petrucci, dated their public books, <hi
                    rend="italic">ab instaurata libertate</hi> year I., II., and so on.</p>
                <p>The so-called free government subject to the empire lasted for twenty-seven
                    years; and the desired protection of Spain weighed more and more heavily until
                    it became a tyranny. The imperial legates and the captains of the Spanish guard
                    in Siena crushed both Government and people by continual extortions and by undue
                    interference with the functions of the <hi rend="italic">balìa.</hi> Charles V.
                    passed through Siena in 1535, and, as in all the other cities of enslaved Italy,
                    was received with the greatest pomp; but he left neither peace nor liberty
                    behind him. From 1527 to 1545 the city was torn by faction fights and violent
                    revolts against the <hi rend="italic">noveschi,</hi> and was the scene of
                    frequent bloodshed. The <hi rend="italic">balìa</hi> was reconstituted several
                    times by the imperial agents,—in 1530 by Don Lopez di Soria and Alphonso
                    Piccolomini, duke of Amalfi, in 1540 by Granvella (or Granvelle), and in 1548 by
                    Don Diego di Mendoza; but government was carried on as badly as before, and
                    there was increased hatred of the Spanish rule. When in 1549 Don Diego announced
                    the emperor’s purpose of erecting a fortress in Siena to keep the citizens in
                    order, the general hatred found vent in indignant remonstrance. The historian
                    Orlando Malavolti and other special envoys were sent to the emperor in 1550 with
                    a petition signed by more than a thousand citizens praying him to spare them so
                    terrible a danger; but their mission failed: they returned unheard. Meanwhile
                    Don Diego had laid the foundation of the citadel and was carrying on the work
                    with activity. Thereupon certain Sienese citizens in Rome, headed by Aeneas
                    Piccolomini (a kinsman of Pius II.), entered into negotiations with the agents
                    of the French king and, having with their help collected men and money, marched
                    on Siena and forced their way in by the new gate (now Porta Romana) on 26th July
                    1552. The townspeople, encouraged and reinforced by this aid from without, at
                    once rose in revolt, and, attacking the Spanish troops, disarmed them and drove
                    them to take refuge in the citadel (28th July). And finally by an agreement
                    with<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0058-0043"/> Cosimo de’ Medici, duke of Florence, the
                    Spaniards were sent away on the 5th August 1552 and the Sienese took possession
                    of their fortress.</p>
                <p>The Government was now reconstituted under the protection of the French agents;
                    the <hi rend="italic">balìa</hi> was abolished, its very name having been
                    rendered odious by the tyranny of Spain, and was replaced by a similar
                    magistracy styled <hi rend="italic">capitani del popolo e reggimento.</hi> Siena
                    exulted in her recovered freedom; but her sunshine was soon clouded. First, the
                    emperor’s wrath was stirred by the influence of France in the counsels of the
                    republic; then Cosimo, who was no less jealous of the French, conceived the
                    design of annexing Siena to his own dominions. The first hostilities of the
                    imperial forces in Val di Chiana (1552-53) did little damage; but when Cosimo
                    took the field with an army commanded by the marquis of Marignano the ruin of
                    Siena was at hand. On 26th January Marignano captured the forts of Porta
                    Camollia (which the whole population of Siena, including the women, had helped
                    to construct) and invested the city. On 2d August of the same year, at Marciano
                    in Val di Chiana, he won a complete victory over the Sienese and French troops
                    under Piero Strozzi, the Florentine exile and marshal of France. Meanwhile Siena
                    was vigorously besieged, and its inhabitants, sacrificing everything for their
                    beloved city, maintained a most heroic defence. A glorious record of their
                    sufferings is to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> of Sozzini, the
                    Sienese historian, and in the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> of Blaise de
                    Monluc, the French representative in Siena. But in April 1555 the town was
                    reduced to extremity and was forced to capitulate to the emperor and the duke.
                    On 21st April the Spanish troops entered the gates; thereupon many patriots
                    abandoned the city and, taking refuge at Montalcino, maintained there a shadowy
                    form of republic until 1559.</p>
                <p>Cosimo I. de’ Medici being granted the investiture of the Sienese state by the
                    patent of Philip II. of Spain, dated 3d July 1557, took formal possession of the
                    city on the 19th of the same month. A lieutenant-general was appointed as
                    representative of his authority; the council of the <hi rend="italic">balìa</hi>
                    was reconstituted with twenty members chosen by the duke; the consistory and the
                    general council were left in existence but deprived of their political autonomy.
                    Thus Siena was annexed to the Florentine state under the same ruler and became
                    an integral part of the grand-duchy of Tuscany. Nevertheless it retained a
                    separate administration for more than two centuries, until the general reforms
                    of the grand-duke Pietro Leopoldo, the French domination, and finally the
                    restoration swept away all differences between the Sienese and Florentine
                    systems of government. In 1859 Siena was the first Tuscan city that voted for
                    annexation to Piedmont and the monarchy of Victor Emmanuel II., this decision
                    (voted 26th June) being the initial step towards the unity of Italy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literary History.—</hi> The literary history of Siena, while
                    recording no gifts to the world equal to those bequeathed by Florence, and
                    without the power and originality by which the latter became the centre of
                    Italian culture, can nevertheless boast of some illustrious names. Of these a
                    brief summary, beginning with the department of general literature and passing
                    on to history and science, is subjoined. Many of them are also dealt with in
                    separate articles, to which the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>As early as the 13th century the vulgar tongue was already well established at
                    Siena, being used in public documents, commercial records, and private
                    correspondence. The poets flourishing at that period were Folcacchiero, Cecco
                    Angiolieri—a humorist of a very high order—and Bindo Bonichi, who belonged also
                    to the following century. The chief glory of the 14th century was St Catherine
                    Benincasa. The year of her death (1380) was that of the birth of St Bernardino
                    Albizzeschi, a popular preacher whose sermons in the vulgar tongue are models of
                    style and diction. To the 15th century belongs Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pius
                    II.), humanist, historian, and political writer. In the 16th century we find
                    another Piccolomini (Alexander), bishop of Patras, author of a curious dialogue,
                    <hi rend="italic">Della bella Creanza delle Donne</hi>; another bishop, Claudio
                    Tolomei, diplomatist, poet, and philologist, who revived the use of ancient
                    Latin metres; and Luca Contile, a writer of narratives, plays, and poems. Prose
                    fiction had two representatives in this century,—Scipione Bargagli, a writer of
                    some merit, and Pietro Fortini, whose productions were trivial and indecent. In
                    the 17th century we find Ludovico Sergardi (Quinto Settano), a Latinist and
                    satirical writer of much talent and culture; but the most original and brilliant
                    figure in Sienese literature is that of Girolamo Gigli (1660-1722), author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gazzettino, La Sorellina di Don Pilone, Il Vocabolario
                    Cateriniano,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Diario Ecclesiastico.</hi> As
                    humorist, scholar, and philologist Gigli would take a high place in the
                    literature of any land. His resolute opposition to all hypocrisy—whether
                    religious or literary—exposed him to merciless persecution from the Jesuits and
                    the Della Cruscan Academy.</p>
                <p>In the domain of history we have first the old Sienese chronicles, which down to
                    the 14th century are so confused that it is almost impossible to disentangle
                    truth from fiction or even to decide the personality of the various authors.
                    Three 14th-century chronicles, attributed to Andrea Dei, Agnolo di Tura, called
                    Il Grasso, and Neri di Donati, are published in Muratori, vol. xv. To the 15th
                    century belongs the chronicle of Allegretto Allegretti, also in Muratori (vol.
                    xxiii.); and during the same period flourished Sigismondo Tizio (a priest of
                    Siena, though born at Castiglione Aretino), whose voluminous history written in
                    Latin and never printed (now among the MSS. of the Chigi Library in Rome),
                    though devoid of literary merit, contains much valuable material. The best
                    Sienese historians belong to the 16th century. They are Orlando Malavolti
                    (1515-1596), a man of noble birth, the most trustworthy of all; Antonio
                    Bellarmati; Alessandro Sozzini di Girolamo, the sympathetic author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diario dell' ultima Guerra Senese</hi>; and Giugurta Tommasi, of
                    whose tedious history ten books, down to 1354, have been published, the rest
                    being still in manuscript. Together with these historians we must mention the
                    learned scholars Celso Cittadini (d. 1627), Ulberto Benvoglienti (d. 1733), one
                    of Muratori's correspondents, and Gio. Antonio Picci (d. 1768), author of
                    histories of Pandolfo Petrucci and the bishopric of Siena. In the same category
                    may be classed the librarian C. F. Carpellini (d. 1872), author of several
                    monographs on the origin of Siena and the constitution of the republic, and
                    Scipione Borghesi (d. 1877), who has left a precious store of historical,
                    biographical, and bibliographical studies and documents.</p>
                <p>In theology and philosophy the most distinguished names are— Bernardino Ochino
                    and Lelio and Fausto Soccini (16th century); in jurisprudence, three Soccini —
                    Mariano senior, Bartolommeo, and Mariano junior (15th and 16th centuries); and
                    in political economy, Sallustio Bandini (1677-1760), author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discorso sulla Maremma.</hi> In physical science the names most
                    worthy of mention are those of the botanist Pier Antonio Mattioli (1501-1572),
                    of Pirro Maria Gabrielli (1643-1705), founder of the academy of the
                    Physiocritics, and of the anatomist Paolo Mascagni (d. 1825).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Art.—</hi> The history of Sienese art is a fair and luminous
                    record. Lanzi happily designates Sienese painting as “Lieta scuola fra lieto
                    popolo” (“the blithe school of a blithe people”). The special characteristics of
                    its masters are freshness of colour, vivacity of expression, and distinct
                    originality. The Sienese school of painting owes its origin to the influence of
                    Byzantine art; but it improved that art, impressed it with a special stamp, and
                    was for long independent of all other influences. Consequently Sienese art
                    seemed almost stationary amid the general progress and development of the other
                    Italian schools, and preserved its mediaeval character down to the end of the
                    15th century. When the Florentine Giot-tesques and their few followers were on
                    the wane, this mystic Sienese school still showed continued fertility and
                    improvement. At the close of the 15th century the influence of the Umbrian
                    and—to a slighter degree—of the Florentine schools began to penetrate into
                    Siena, followed a little later by that of the Lombard, and these grafts gave
                    fresh vigour to the old stock without destroying its special characteristics. Of
                    this new phase of Sienese art it has been well said that Sodoma was its
                    Leonardo, Baldassare Peruzzi its Raphael, and Beccafumi its Michelangelo. In
                    every age Siena has produced many painters of different degrees of merit. It is
                    impossible to mention all, so we will only cite the names of the more
                    celebrated. In the 13th century we find Guido (da Siena), painter of the
                    well-known Madonna in the church of S. Domenico in Siena. The 14th century gives
                    us Ugolino, who painted the Madonna del Tabernacolo in Or San Michele, Florence;
                    Duccio di Buoninsegna, whose chief work is the great panel of the high altar of
                    the cathedral at Siena; Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Simone di Martino (or
                    Memmi), Lippo Memmi, Andrea di Vanni (painter and statesman), and Taddeo di
                    Bartolo. In the 15th century we have Sano di Pietro, Giovanni di Paolo, Stefano
                    di Giovanni (Il Sassetta), and Matteo di Giovanni Bartoli, whose several
                    paintings of the Massacre of the Innocents show a fine sentiment and much
                    observation of reality. The 16th century boasts the names of Guidoccio
                    Cossarelli, Giacomo Pacchiarotto, Girolamo del Pacchia,<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0059-0044"/> Baldassare Peruzzi (1481-1537), who was excellent
                    in many branches of art and especially celebrated for his frescos and studies in
                    perspective and chiaroscuro; Giovanni Antonio Bazzi, otherwise known as Il
                    Sodoma (1477-1549), who, born at Vercelli in Piedmont and trained at Milan in
                    the school of Leonardo da Vinci, came to Siena in 1504 and there produced his
                    finest works; Domenico Beccafumi, otherwise known as Micharino (1486-1550),
                    noted for the Michel-angelesque daring of his designs; and Francesco Vanni.</p>
                <p>Side by side with these painters marches a notable band of sculptors and
                    architects, such as Lorenzo Maitani, architect of the Orvieto cathedral (end of
                    13th century); Camaino di Crescentino; Tino di Camaino, sculptor of the monument
                    to Henry VII. in the Campo Santo of Pisa; Agostino and Agnolo, who in 1330
                    carved the fine tomb of Bishop Guido Tarlati in the cathedral of Arezzo; Lando
                    di Pietro (14th century), architect, entrusted by the Sienese commune with the
                    proposed enlargement of the cathedral (1339); Giacomo della Quercia, whose
                    lovely fountain, the Fonte Gaia, in the Piazza del Campo has been recently
                    restored by the sculptor Sarrocchi; Lorenzo di Pietro (Il Vecchietta), a pupil
                    of Della Quercia and an excellent artist in marble and bronze; Francesco di
                    Giorgio Martino (1439-1502), painter, sculptor, military engineer, and writer on
                    art; Giacomo Cozzarelli (15th century); and Lorenzo Mariano, surnamed Il Marrina
                    (16th century). (C. PA.)</p>
