                <p><label type="entry">SURFACE, CONGRUENCE, COMPLEX</label>. In the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Curve</hi> the subject was treated from an historical point of
                    view for the purpose of showing how the leading ideas of the theory were
                    successively arrived at. These leading ideas apply to surfaces, but the ideas
                    peculiar to surfaces are scarcely of the like fundamental nature, being rather
                    developments of the former set in their application to a more advanced portion
                    of geometry; there is consequently less occasion for the historical mode of
                    treatment. Curves in space were briefly considered in the same article, and they
                    will not be discussed here; but it is proper to refer to them in connexion with
                    the other notions of solid geometry. In plane geometry the elementary figures
                    are the point and the line; and we then have the curve, which may be regarded as
                    a singly infinite system of points, and also as a singly infinite system of
                    lines. In solid geometry the elementary figures are the point, the line, and the
                    plane; we have, moreover, first, that which under one aspect is the curve and
                    under another aspect the developable (or torse), and which may be regarded as a
                    singly infinite system of points, of lines, or of planes; and secondly, the
                    surface, which may be regarded as a doubly infinite system of points or of
                    planes, and also as a special triply infinite system of lines. (The tangent
                    lines of a surface are a special complex.) As distinct particular cases of the
                    first figure we have the plane curve and the cone, and as a particular case of
                    the second figure the ruled surface, regulus, or singly infinite system of
                    lines; we have, besides, the congruence or doubly infinite system of lines and
                    the complex or triply infinite system of lines. And thus crowds of theories
                    arise which have hardly any analogues in plane geometry; the relation of a curve
                    to the various surfaces which can be drawn through it, and that of a surface to
                    the various curves which can be drawn upon it, are different in kind from those
                    which in plane geometry most nearly correspond to them,—the relation of a system
                    of points to the different curves through them and that of a curve to the
                    systems of points upon it. In particular, there is nothing in plane geometry to
                    correspond to the theory of the curves of curvature of a surface. Again, to the
                    single theorem of plane geometry, that a line is the shortest distance between
                    two points, there correspond in solid geometry two extensive and difficult
                    theories,—that of the geodesic lines on a surface and that of the minimal
                    surface, or surface of minimum area, for a given boundary. And it would be easy
                    to say more in illustration of the great extent and complexity of the
                    subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surfaces in General; Torses, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>1. A surface may be regarded as the locus of a doubly infinite system of
                    points,—that is, the locus of the system of points determined by a single
                    equation <hi rend="italic">U</hi> =(*)(<hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> 1) <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0, between the Cartesian coordinates (to
                    fix the ideas, say rectangular coordinates) <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi>; or,
                    if we please, by a single homogeneous relation <hi rend="italic">U</hi> =(*)(<hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z, w</hi>) <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0,
                    between the quadriplanar coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z, w.</hi> The
                    degree <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the equation is the order of the surface; and
                    this definition of the order agrees with the geometrical one, that the order of
                    the surface is equal to the number of the intersections of the surface by an
                    arbitrary line. Starting from the foregoing point definition of the surface, we
                    might develop the notions of the tangent line and the tangent plane; but it will
                    be more convenient to consider the surface <hi rend="italic">ab initio</hi> from
                    the more general point of view in its relation to the point, the line, and the
                    plane.</p>
                <p>2. Mention has been made of the plane curve and the cone; it is proper to recall
                    that the <hi rend="italic">order</hi> of a plane curve is equal to the number of
                    its intersections by an arbitrary line (in the plane of the curve), and that its
                    <hi rend="italic">class</hi> is equal to the number of tangents to the curve
                    which pass through an arbitrary point (in the plane of the curve). The cone is a
                    figure correlative to the plane curve: corresponding to the plane of the curve
                    we have the vertex of the cone, to its tangents the generating lines of the
                    cone, and to its points the tangent planes of the cone. But from a different
                    point of view we may consider the generating lines of the cone as corresponding
                    to the points of the curve and its tangent planes as corresponding to the
                    tangents of the curve. From this point of view we define the order of the cone
                    as equal to the number of its intersections (generating lines) by an arbitrary
                    plane through the vertex, and its class as equal to the number of the tangent
                    planes which pass through an arbitrary line through the vertex. And in the same
                    way that a plane curve has singularities (singular points and singular tangents)
                    so a cone has singularities (singular generating lines and singular tangent
                    planes).</p>
                <p>3. Consider now a surface in connexion with an arbitrary line. The line meets the
                    surface in a certain number of points, and, as already mentioned, the <hi
                    rend="italic">order</hi> of the surface is equal to the number of these
                    intersections. We have through the line a certain number of tangent planes of
                    the surface, and the <hi rend="italic">class</hi> of the surface is equal to the
                    number of these tangent planes.</p>
                <p>But, further, through the line imagine a plane; this meets the surface in a curve
                    the order of which is equal (as is at once seen) to the order of the surface.
                    Again, on the line imagine a point; this is the vertex of a cone circumscribing
                    the surface, and the class of this cone is equal (as is at once seen) to the
                    class of the surface. The tangent lines of the surface which lie in the plane
                    are nothing else than the tangents of the plane section, and thus form a singly
                    infinite series of lines; similarly, the tangent lines of the surface which pass
                    through the point are nothing else than the generating lines of the
                    circumscribed cone, and thus form a singly infinite series of lines. But, if we
                    consider those tangent lines of the surface which are at once in the plane and
                    through the point, we see that they are finite in number; and we define the <hi
                    rend="italic">rank</hi> of a surface as equal to the number of tangent lines
                    which lie in a given plane and pass through a given point in that plane. It at
                    once follows that the class of the plane section and the order of the
                    circumscribed cone are each equal to the rank of the surface, and are thus equal
                    to each other. It may be noticed that for a general surface <hi rend="italic"
                    >U</hi> =(*)(<hi rend="italic">x, y, z, w</hi>) <hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi>, = 0, of order <hi rend="italic">n</hi> without point singularities the
                    rank is <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, = <hi rend="italic">n(n</hi>- 1), and the
                    class is <hi rend="italic">n', = n(n</hi>- l) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>;
                    this implies (what is in fact the case) that the circumscribed cone has line
                    singularities, for otherwise its class, that is the class of the surface, would
                    be <hi rend="italic">a(a</hi>- 1 ), which is not = <hi rend="italic">n(n</hi>- 1
                    ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>4. In the last preceding number the notions of the tangent line and the tangent
                    plane have been assumed as known, but they require to be further explained in
                    reference to the original point definition of the surface. Speaking generally,
                    we may say that the points of the surface consecutive to a given point on it lie
                    in a plane which is the tangent plane at the given point, and conversely the
                    given point is the point of contact of this tangent plane, and that any line
                    through the point of contact and in the tangent plane is a tangent line touching
                    the surface at the point of contact. Hence we see at once that the tangent line
                    is any line meeting the surface in two consecutive points, or—what is the same
                    thing—a line meeting the surface in the point of contact counting as two
                    intersections and in <hi rend="italic">n</hi>- 2 other points. But, from the
                    foregoing notion of the tangent plane as a plane containing the point of contact
                    and the consecutive points of the surface, the passage to the true definition of
                    the tangent plane is not equally obvious. A plane in general meets the surface
                    of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in a curve of that order without double
                    points; but the plane may be such that the curve has a<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0696-0669"/> double point, and when this is so the plane is a
                    tangent plane having the double point for its point of contact. The double point
                    is either an acnode (isolated point), then the surface at the point in question
                    is convex towards (that is, concave away from) the tangent plane; or else it is
                    a crunode, and the surface at the point in question is then concavo-convex, that
                    is, it has its two curvatures in opposite senses (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >infra,</hi> No. 16). Observe that in either case any line whatever in the plane
                    and through the point meets the surface in the points in which it meets the
                    plane curve, namely, in the point of contact, which <hi rend="italic">qua</hi>
                    double point counts as two intersections, and in <hi rend="italic">n</hi>- 2
                    other points; that is, we have the preceding definition of the tangent line.</p>
                <p>5. The complete enumeration and discussion of the singularities of a surface is a
                    question of extreme difficulty which has not yet been solved.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In a plane curve the only
                    singularities which need to be considered are those that present themselves in

                    certain number of nodes, cusps, inflexions, aud double tangents. As regards a
                    surface, no such reduction of the higher singularities has as yet been
                    made.</p></note> A plane curve has point singularities and line singularities;
                    corresponding to these we have for the surface isolated point singularities and
                    isolated plane singularities, but there are besides -continuous singularities
                    applying to curves on or torses circumscribed to the surface, and it is among
                    these that we have the non-special singularities which play the most important
                    part in the theory. Thus the plane curve represented by the general equation
                    (<hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi>) <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0 <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> of any given order <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> has the
                    non-special line singularities of inflexions and double tangents; corresponding
                    to this the surface represented by the general equation (<hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z, w</hi>) <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0, of any given order <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> has, not the isolated plane singularities, but the
                    continuous singularities of the spinode curve or torse and the node-couple curve
                    or torse. A plane may meet the surface in a curve having (1) a cusp (spinode) or
                    (2) a pair of double points; in each case there is a singly infinite system of
                    such singular tangent planes, and the locus of the points of contact is the
                    curve, the envelope of the tangent planes the torse. The reciprocal
                    singularities to these are the nodal curve and the cuspidal curve: the surface
                    may intersect or touch itself along a curve in such wise that, cutting the
                    surface by an arbitrary plane, the curve of intersection has at each
                    intersection of the plane with the curve on the surface (1) a double point
                    (node) or (2) a cusp. Observe that these are singularities not occurring in the
                    surface represented by the general equation (<hi rend="italic">x, y, z, w</hi>)
                    <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0 of any order; observe further that in
                    the case of both or either of these singularities the definition of the tangent
                    plane must be modified. A tangent plane is a plane such that there is in the
                    plane section a double point in addition to the nodes or cusps at the
                    intersections with the singular lines on the surface.</p>
                <p>6. As regards isolated singularities, it will be sufficient to mention the point
                    singularity of the conical point (or cnicnode) and the corresponding plane
                    singularity of the conic of contact (or cnictrope). In the former case we have a
                    point such that the consecutive points, instead of lying in a tangent plane, lie
                    on a quadric cone, having the point for its vertex; in the latter case we have a
                    plane touching the surface along a conic; that is, the complete intersection of
                    the surface by the plane is made up of the conic taken twice and of a residual
                    curve of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi>- 4.</p>
                <p>7. We may, in the general theory of surfaces, consider either a surface and its
                    reciprocal surface, the reciprocal surface being taken to be the surface
                    enveloped by the polar planes (in regard to a given quadric surface) of the
                    points of the original surface; or—what is better—we may consider a given
                    surface in reference to the reciprocal relations of its order, rank, class, and
                    singularities. In either case we have a series of unaccented letters and a
                    corresponding series of accented letters, and the relations between them are
                    such that we may in any equation interchange the accented and the unaccented
                    letters; in some cases an unaccented letter may be equal to the corresponding
                    accented letter. Thus, let <hi rend="italic">n, n</hi> be as before the order
                    and the class of the surface, but, instead of immediately defining the rank, let
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be used to denote the class of the plane section and
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ' the order of the circumscribed cone; also let <hi
                    rend="italic">S</hi>, <hi rend="italic">S'</hi> be numbers referring to the
                    singularities. The form of the relations is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> '( = rank of surface); <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ' = <hi

                    are merely written down to denote proper corresponding combinations of the
                    several numbers referring to the singularities collectively denoted by <hi
                    rend="italic">S, S'</hi> respectively. The theory, as already mentioned, is a
                    complex and difficult one, and it is not the intention to further develop it
                    here.</p>
                <p>8. A developable or torse corresponds to a curve in space in the same manner as a
                    cone corresponds to a plane curve: although capable of representation by an
                    equation <hi rend="italic">U=</hi> (<hi rend="italic">x, y, z, w</hi>) <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0, and so of coming under the foregoing
                    point definition of a surface, it is an entirely distinct geometrical
                    conception. We may indeed, <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> surface, regard it as a
                    surface characterized by the property that each of its tangent planes touches
                    it, not at a single point, but along a line; this is equivalent to saying that
                    it is the envelope, not of a doubly infinite series of planes, as is a proper
                    surface, but of a singly infinite system of planes. But it is perhaps easier to
                    regard it as the locus of a singly infinite system of lines, each line meeting
                    the consecutive line, or, what is the same thing, the lines being tangent lines
                    of a curve in space. The tangent plane is then the plane through two consecutive
                    lines, or, what is the same thing, an osculating plane of the curve, whence also
                    the tangent plane intersects the surface in the generating line counting twice,
                    and in a residual curve of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi>- 2. The curve is
                    said to be the edge of regression of the developable, and it is a cuspidal curve
                    thereof; that is to say, any plane section of the developable has at each point
                    of intersection with the edge of regression a cusp. A sheet of paper bent in any
                    manner without crumpling gives a developable; but we cannot with a single sheet
                    of paper properly exhibit the form in the neighbourhood of the edge of
                    regression: we need two sheets connected along a plane curve, which, when the
                    paper is bent, becomes the edge of regression and appears as a cuspidal curve on

                <p>9. A ruled surface or regulus is the locus of a singly infinite system of lines,
                    where the consecutive lines do not intersect; this is a true surface, for there
                    is a doubly infinite series of tangent planes,—in fact any plane through any one
                    of the lines is a tangent plane of the surface, touching it at a point on the
                    line, and in such wise that, as the tangent plane turns about the line, the
                    point of contact moves along the line. The complete intersection of the surface
                    by the tangent plane is made up of the line counting once and of a residual
                    curve of the order <hi rend="italic">n-</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">.</hi> A

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0697-0670"/> there are on the surface two systems of lines
                    each of which is a regulus. A cubic surface may be a regulus (see No. 11 <hi
                    rend="italic">infra).</hi><hi rend="italic">Surfaces of the Orders 2, 3, and
                    4.</hi></p>
                <p>10. A surface of the second order or a quadric surface is a surface such that
                    every line meets it in two points, or— what comes to the same thing—such that
                    every plane section thereof is a conic or quadric curve. Such surfaces have been
                    studied from every point of view. The only singular forms are when there is (1)
                    a conical point (cnicnode), when the surface is a cone of the second order or
                    quadricone; (2) a conic of contact (cnictrope), when the surface is this conic;
                    from a different point of view it is a <hi rend="italic">surface aplatie</hi> or
                    flattened surface. Excluding these degenerate forms, the surface is of the
                    order, rank, and class each = 2, and it has no singularities. Distinguishing the
                    forms according to <hi rend="italic">reality,</hi> we have the ellipsoid, the
                    hyperboloid of two sheets, the hyperboloid of one sheet, the elliptic
                    paraboloid, and the hyperbolic paraboloid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry,
                    Analytical).</hi> A particular case of the ellipsoid is the sphere; in abstract
                    geometry this is a quadric surface passing through a given quadric curve, the
                    circle at infinity. The tangent plane of a quadric surface meets it in a quadric
                    curve having a node, that is, in a pair of lines; hence there are on the surface
                    two singly infinite sets of lines. Two lines of the same set do not meet, but
                    each line of the one set meets each line of the other set; the surface is thus a
                    regulus in a twofold manner. The lines are real for the hyperboloid of one sheet
                    and for the hyperbolic paraboloid; for the other forms of surface they are
                    imaginary.</p>
                <p>11. We have next the surface of the third order or cubic surface, which has also
                    been very completely studied. Such a surface may have isolated point
                    singularities (cnic-nodes or points of higher singularity), or it may have a
                    nodal line; we have thus 21 + 2, = 23 cases. In the general case of a surface
                    without any singularities, the order, rank, and class are = 3, 6, 12
                    respectively. The surface has upon it 27 lines, lying by threes in 45 planes,
                    which are triple tangent planes. Observe that the tangent plane is a plane
                    meeting the surface in a curve having a node. For a surface of any given order
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> there will be a certain number of planes each meeting
                    the surface in a curve with 3 nodes, that is, triple tangent planes; and, in the
                    particular case where <hi rend="italic">n=</hi> 3, the cubic curve with 3 nodes
                    is of course a set of 3 lines; it is found that the number of triple tangent
                    planes is, as just mentioned, = 45. This would give 135 lines, but through each
                    line we have 5 such planes, and the number of lines is thus = 27. The theory of
                    the 27 lines is an extensive and interesting one; in particular, it may be
                    noticed that we can, in thirty-six ways, select a system of 6 × 6 lines, or
                    “double sixer,” such that no 2 lines of the same set intersect each other, but
                    that each line of the βne set intersects each line of the other set.</p>
                <p>A cubic surface having a nodal line is a ruled surface or regulus; in fact any
                    plane through the nodal line meets the surface in this line counting twice and
                    in a residual line, and there is thus on the surface a singly infinite set of
                    lines. There are two forms; but the distinction between them need not be
                    referred to here.</p>
                <p>12. As regards quartic surfaces, only particular forms have been much studied. A
                    quartic surface can have at most 16 conical points (cnicnodes); an instance of
                    such a surface is Fresnel’s wave surface, which has 4 real cnicnodes in one of
                    the principal planes, 4 × 2 imaginary ones in the other two principal planes,
                    and 4 imaginary ones at infinity,—in all 16 cnicnodes; the same surface has also
                    4 real+ 12 imaginary planes each touching the surface along a circle
                    (cnictropes),—in all 16 cnictropes. It was easy by a mere homographic
                    transformation to pass to the more general surface called the tetrahedroid; but
                    this was itself only a particular form of the general surface with 16 cnicnodes
                    and 16 cnictropes first studied by Kummer. Quartic surfaces with a smaller
                    number of cnicnodes have also been considered.</p>
                <p>Another very important form is the quartic surface having a nodal conic; the
                    nodal conic may be the circle at infinity, and we have then the so-called
                    anallagmatic surface, otherwise the cyclide (which includes the particular form
                    called Dupin’s cyclide). These correspond to the bicircular quartic curve of
                    plane geometry. Other forms of quartic surface might be referred to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Congruences and Complexes.</hi></p>
                <p>13. A congruence is a doubly infinite system of lines. A line depends on four
                    parameters and can therefore be determined so as to satisfy four conditions; if
                    only two conditions are imposed on the line we have a doubly infinite system of
                    lines or a congruence. For instance, the lines meeting each of two given lines
                    form a congruence. It is hardly necessary to remark that, imposing on the line
                    one more condition, we have a ruled surface or regulus; thus we can in an
                    infinity of ways separate the congruence into a singly infinite system of reguli
                    or of torses (see <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> No. 16).</p>
                <p>Considering in connexion with the congruence two· arbitrary lines, there will be
                    in the congruence a determinate number of lines which meet each of these two
                    lines; and the number of lines thus meeting the two lines is said to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">order-class</hi> of the congruence. If the two arbitrary lines are
                    taken to intersect each other, the congruence lines which meet each of the two
                    lines separate themselves into two sets,—those which lie in the plane of the two
                    lines and those which pass through their intersection. There will be in the
                    former set a determinate number of congruence lines which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">order</hi> of the congruence, and in the latter set a determinate
                    number of congruence lines which is the <hi rend="italic">class</hi> of the
                    congruence. In other words, the order of the congruence is equal to the number
                    of congruence lines lying in an arbitrary plane, and its class to the number of
                    congruence lines passing through an arbitrary point.</p>
                <p>The following systems of lines form each of them a congruence :—(A) lines meeting
                    each of two given curves;. (B) lines meeting a given curve twice; (C) lines
                    meeting a given curve and touching a given surface; (D) lines touching each of
                    two given surfaces; (E) lines touching a given surface twice, or, say, the
                    bitangents of a given surface.</p>
                <p>The last case is the most general one; and conversely for a given congruence
                    there will be in general a surface having the congruence lines for bitangents.
                    This surface is said to be the <hi rend="italic">focal surface</hi> of the
                    congruence; the general surface with 16 cnicnodes first presented itself in this
                    manner as the focal surface of a congruence. But the focal surface may
                    degenerate into the forms belonging; to the other cases A, B, C, D.</p>
                <p>14. A complex is a triply infinite system of lines,—for instance, the tangent
                    lines of a surface. Considering an arbitrary point in connexion with the
                    complex, the complex lines which pass through the point form a cone; considering
                    a plane in connexion with it, the complex lines which lie in the plane envelope
                    a curve. It is easy to see that the class of the curve is equal to the order of
                    the cone; in fact each of these numbers is equal to the number of complex lines
                    which lie in an arbitrary plane and pass through an arbitrary point of that
                    plane; and we then say <hi rend="italic">order</hi> of complex = order of curve;
                    <hi rend="italic">rank</hi> of complex = class of curve = order of cone; <hi
                    rend="italic">class</hi> of complex = class of cone. It is to be observed that,

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0698-0671"/> for a congruence there is in general a surface
                    having the congruence lines for bitangents, for a complex there is not in
                    general any surface having the complex lines for tangents; the tangent lines of
                    a surface are thus only a special form of complex. The theory of complexes first
                    presented itself in the researches of Malus on systems of rays of light in
                    connexion with double refraction.</p>
                <p>15. The analytical theory as well of congruences as of complexes is most easily
                    carried out by means of the six coordinates of a line; viz., there are
                    coordinates (a, <hi rend="italic">b, c, f, g, h)</hi> connected by the equation
                    <hi rend="italic">af+ bg + ch =</hi> 0, and therefore such that the ratios <hi
                    rend="italic">a :b :c :f ∙.g: h</hi> constitute a system of four arbitrary
                    parameters. We have thus a congruence of the order <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    represented by a single homogeneous equation of that order (*)(<hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b, c, f, g, h</hi>) <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, = 0 between the
                    six coordinates; two such relations determine a congruence. But we have in
                    regard to congruences the same difficulty as that which presents itself in
                    regard to curves in space: it is not every congruence which can be represented
                    completely and precisely by <hi rend="italic">two</hi> such equations.</p>
                <p>The linear equation (*)(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b, c, f, g,
                    h)</hi> = 0 represents a congruence of the first order or linear congruence;
                    such congruences are interesting both in geometry and in connexion with the
                    theory of forces acting on a rigid body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Curves of Curvature; Asymptotic Lines.</hi></p>
                <p>16. The normals of a surface form a congruence. In any congruence the lines
                    consecutive to a given congruence line do not in general meet this line; but
                    there is a determinate number of consecutive lines which do meet it; or,
                    attending for the moment to only one of these, say the congruence line is met by
                    a consecutive congruence line. In particular, each normal is met by a
                    consecutive normal; this again is met by a consecutive normal, and so on. That
                    is, we have a singly infinite system of normals each meeting the consecutive
                    normal, and so forming a torse; starting from different normals successively, we
                    obtain a singly infinite system of such torses. But each normal is in fact met
                    by two consecutive normals, and, using in the construction first the one and
                    then the other of these, we obtain two singly infinite systems of torses each
                    intersecting the given surface at right angles. In other words, if in place of
                    the normal we consider the point on the surface, we obtain on the surface two
                    singly infinite systems of curves such that for any curve of either system the
                    normals at consecutive points intersect each other; moreover, for each normal
                    the torses of the two systems intersect each other at right angles; and
                    therefore for each point of the surface the curves of the two systems intersect
                    each other at right angles. The two systems of curves are said to be the curves
                    of curvature of the surface.</p>
                <p>The normal is met by the two consecutive normals in two points which are the
                    centres of curvature for the point on the surface; these lie either on the same
                    side of the point or on opposite sides, and the surface has at the point in
                    question like curvatures or opposite curvatures in the two cases respectively
                    (see <hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> No. 4).</p>
                <p>17. In immediate connexion with the curves of curvature we have the so-called
                    asymptotic curves (Haupt-tangenten-linien). The tangent plane at a point of the
                    surface cuts the surface in a curve having at that point a node. Thus we have at
                    the point of the surface two directions of passage to a consecutive point, or,
                    say, two elements of arc; and, passing along one 'of these to the consecutive
                    point, and thence to a consecutive point, and so on, we obtain on the surface a
                    curve. Starting successively from different points of the surface we thus obtain
                    a singly infinite system of curves; or, using first one and then the other of
                    the two directions, we obtain two singly infinite systems of curves, which are
                    the curves above referred to. The two curves at any point are equally inclined
                    to the two curves of curvature at that point, or—what is the same thing— the
                    supplementary angles formed by the two asymptotic lines are bisected by the two
                    curves of curvature. In the case of a quadric surface the asymptotic curves are
                    the two systems of lines on the surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geodesic Lines.</hi></p>
                <p>18. A geodesic line (or curve) is a shortest curve on a surface; more accurately,
                    the element of arc between two consecutive points of a geodesic line is a
                    shortest arc on the surface. We are thus led to the fundamental property that at
                    each point of the curve the osculating plane of the curve passes through the
                    normal of the surface; in other words, any two consecutive arcs <hi
                    rend="italic">PP', PP'</hi> are <hi rend="italic">in plano</hi> with the normal
                    at <hi rend="italic">P.</hi> Starting from a given point <hi rend="italic"
                    >P</hi> on the surface, we have a singly infinite system of geodesics proceeding
                    along the surface in the direction of the several tangent lines at the point P;
                    and, if the direction <hi rend="italic">PP</hi> is given, the property gives a
                    construction by successive elements of arc for the required geodesic line.</p>
                <p>Considering the geodesic lines which proceed from a given point <hi rend="italic"
                    >P</hi> of the surface, any particular geodesic line is or is not again
                    intersected by the consecutive generating line; if it is thus intersected, the
                    generating line is a shortest line on the surface up to, but not beyond, the
                    point at which it is first intersected by the consecutive generating line; if it
                    is not intersected, it continues a shortest line for the whole course.</p>
                <p>In the analytical theory both of geodesic lines and of the curves of curvature,
                    and in other parts of the theory of surfaces, it is very convenient to consider
                    the rectangular coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> of a point of the
                    surface as given functions of two independent parameters <hi rend="italic">p,
                    q</hi>; the form of these functions of course determines the surface, since by
                    the elimination of <hi rend="italic">p, q</hi> from the three equations we
                    obtain the equation in the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> We have
                    for the geodesic lines a differential equation of the second order between <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q;</hi> the general solution contains
                    two arbitrary constants, and is thus capable of representing the geodesic line
                    which can be drawm from a given point in a given direction on the surface. In
                    the case of a quadric surface the solution involves hyperelliptic integrals of
                    the first kind, depending on the square root of a sextic function.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Curvilinear Coordinates.</hi></p>
                <p>19. The expressions of the coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> in terms of
                    <hi rend="italic">p, q</hi> may contain a parameter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi>
                    and, if this is regarded as a given constant, these expressions will as before
                    refer to a point on a given surface. But, if <hi rend="italic">p, q, r</hi> are
                    regarded as three independent parameters, <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> will be
                    the coordinates of a point in space, determined by means of the three parameters
                    <hi rend="italic">p,q,r ',</hi> these parameters are said to be the curvilinear
                    coordinates, or (in a generalized sense of the term) simply the coordinates of
                    the point. We arrive otherwise at the notion by taking <hi rend="italic">p, q,
                    r</hi> each as a given function of <hi rend="italic">x, y, z;</hi> say we have
                    <hi rend="italic">p=f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">(x,y,z),
                    q=f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">(x,y,z), r=f</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">(x,y,z),</hi> which equations of
                    course lead to expressions for <hi rend="italic">p, q, r</hi> each as a function
                    of <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> The first equation determines a singly
                    infinite set of surfaces: for any given value of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> we
                    have a surface; and similarly the second and third equations determine each a
                    singly infinite set of surfaces. If, to fix the ideas, <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    are taken to denote each a rational and integral function of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x, y, z,</hi> then two surfaces of the same set will not intersect each other,
                    and through a given point of space there will pass one surface of each set; that
                    is, the point will be determined as a point of intersection of three surfaces
                    belonging to the three sets respectively; moreover, the whole of space will be
                    divided by the three sets of surfaces into a triply infinite system of elements,
                    each of them being a parallelepiped.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0699-0672"/><hi rend="italic">Orthotomic Surfaces; Parallel
                    Surfaces.</hi></p>
                <p>20. The three sets of surfaces may be such that the three surfaces through any
                    point of space whatever intersect each other at right angles; and they are in
                    this case said to be orthotomic. The term curvilinear coordinates was almost
                    appropriated by Lamé, to whom this theory is chiefly due, to the case in
                    question: assuming that the equations <hi rend="italic">p=f</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (<hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi>), <hi rend="italic"
                    >q=f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (<hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi>), <hi
                    rend="italic">r=f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (<hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z</hi>), refer to a system of orthotomic surfaces, we have in the restricted
                    sense <hi rend="italic">p, q, r</hi> as the curvilinear coordinates of the
                    point.</p>
                <p>An interesting special case is that of confocal quadric surfaces. The general
                    equation of a surface confocal with the ellipsoid - <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi>
                    ^ <hi rend="subscript"> +3</hi>.lfa - <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> +</hi>-^-l∙</p>
                <p>and, if in this equation we consider <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> as given, we
                    have for <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> a cubic equation with three real roots <hi
                    rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> and thus we have through the point three real
                    surfaces, one an ellipsoid, one a hyperboloid of one sheet, and one a
                    hyperboloid of two sheets.</p>
                <p>21. The theory is connected with that of curves of curvature by Dupin’s theorem.
                    Thus in any system of orthotomic surfaces each surface of any one of the three
                    sets is intersected by the surfaces of the other two sets in its curves of
                    curvature.</p>
                <p>22. No one of the three sets of surfaces is altogether arbitrary: in the equation
                    <hi rend="italic">p=f</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (<hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z</hi>), <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is not an arbitrary function of <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> but it must satisfy a certain partial differential
                    equation of the third order. Assuming that <hi rend="italic">p</hi> has this
                    value, we have <hi rend="italic">q = ffx, y, z)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r =
                    f</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">(x, y, z)</hi>
                    determinate functions of <hi rend="italic">x,y,z</hi> such that the three sets
                    of surfaces form an orthotomic system.</p>
                <p>23. Starting from a given surface, it has been seen (No. 16) that the normals
                    along the curves of curvature form two systems of torses intersecting each
                    other, and also the given surface, at right angles. But there are, intersecting
                    the two systems of torses at right angles, not only the given surface, but a
                    singly infinite system of surfaces. If at each point of the given surface we
                    measure off along the normal one and the same distance at pleasure, then the
                    locus of the points thus obtained is a surface cutting all the normals of the
                    given surface at right angles, or, in other words, having the same normals as
                    the given surface; and it is therefore a parallel surface to the given surface.
                    Hence the singly infinite system of parallel surfaces and the two singly
                    infinite systems of torses form together a set of orthotomic surfaces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Minimal Surface.</hi></p>
                <p>24. This is the surface of minimum area—more accurately, a surface such that, for
                    any indefinitely small closed curve which can be drawn on it round any point,
                    the area of the surface is less than it is for any other surface whatever
                    through the closed curve. It at once follows that the surface at every point is
                    concavo-con vex; for, if at any point this was not the case, we could, by
                    cutting the surface by a plane, describe round the point an indefinitely small
                    closed plane curve, and the plane area within the closed curve would then be
                    less than the area of the element of surface within the same curve. The
                    condition leads to a partial differential equation of the second order for the
                    determination of the minimal surface: considering <hi rend="italic">z</hi> as a
                    function of <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> and writing as usual <hi rend="italic"
                    >p, q, r, s, t</hi> for the first and second differential coefficients of <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> in regard to <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> respectively, the
                    equation (as first shown by Lagrange) is (1+ <hi rend="italic">q</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)r - 2 <hi rend="italic">pqs</hi> + (1+ <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) <hi rend="italic">t</hi> =
                    0, or, as this may also be written, <hi rend="italic">f- .</hi> + 4~ = = 0. The
                    general integral <hi rend="italic">dy</hi> √1 <hi rend="subscript"> +7</hi> y
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="subscript"> + 7</hi> 2^ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> f</hi> ⅛ √ <hi rend="subscript"> 1+j0</hi> 2 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> + i</hi> 2</p>
                <p>contains of course arbitrary functions, and, if we imagine these so determined
                    that the surface may pass through a given closed curve, and if, moreover, there
                    is but one minimal surface passing through that curve, we have the solution of
                    the problem of finding the surface of minimum area within the same curve. The
                    surface continued beyond the closed curve is a minimal surface, but it is not of
                    necessity or in general a surface of minimum area for an arbitrary bounding
                    curve not wholly included within the given closed curve. It is hardly necessary
                    to remark that the plane is a minimal surface, and that, if the given closed
                    curve is a plane curve, the plane is the proper solution; that is, the plane
                    area within the given closed curve is less than the area for any other surface
                    through the same curve. The given closed curve is not of necessity a single
                    curve: it may be, for instance, a skew polygon of four or more sides.</p>
                <p>The partial differential equation was dealt with in a very remarkable manner by
                    Riemann. From the second form given above it appears that we have <hi
                    rend="italic strikethrough"> -JyL≈</hi> ∖ 1 +7&gt; <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> + ç <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = a complete differential, or, putting
                    this = <hi rend="italic">dζ,</hi> we introduce into the solution a variable <hi
                    rend="italic">ζ,</hi> which combines with 3 in the forms <hi rend="italic">z±iζ
                    (i=</hi> √ - 1 as usual). The boundary conditions have to be satisfied by the
                    determination of the conjugate variables <hi rend="italic">η, η'</hi> as
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">z + iζ, z - iζ,</hi> or, say, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Z, Z'</hi> respectively, and by writing <hi rend="italic">S,
                    S'</hi> to denote <hi rend="italic">x + iy, x - iy</hi> respectively. Riemann
                    obtains finally two ordinary differential equations of the first order in <hi
                    rend="italic">S, S', η, η', Z, Z',</hi> and the results are completely worked
                    out in some very interesting special cases.</p>
