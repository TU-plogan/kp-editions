                    the introduction of submarine telegraphy that extensive efforts have been made
                    to obtain a complete knowledge of the contour of the ocean-bed. As early as the
                    middle of last century a few deep soundings were recorded in various parts of
                    the world: Ellis made one in 1749 of 891 fathoms off the north-west coast of
                    Africa. But these early results must be accepted only with great caution, for
                    the methods then in use were not such as to ensure accuracy at any depth greater
                    than a few hundred fathoms. Sir John Ross, the arctic explorer, was much in
                    advance of his times as regarded such investigations; he invented a “deep-sea
                    clamm” for bringing up a portion of the bottom, and on September 1, 1819, in
                    Possession Bay, made a successful sounding at a depth of 1000 fathoms, which is
                    especially memorable because it was clear, from the organisms which came up
                    entangled in the line, that animal life existed at that depth.</p>
                <p>The operation of sounding is readily performed in shallow water by letting down a
                    weight attached to a cord, which is marked off into fathoms by worsted tucked
                    under the strands, the tens and hundreds being indicated by different colours.
                    The bottom of the weight usually presents a hollow, which is filled with tallow,
                    so that a portion of the material from the bottom may be brought up and give an
                    indication of its nature. Sometimes a valved cavity is used instead of the
                    tallow. It is easy to see that the longer the line let out the greater will be
                    its friction in passing through the water, the more slowly the weight will
                    descend, and the slighter will be the shock transmitted to the upper extremity
                    when it reaches the bottom; indeed, at what are now considered very moderate
                    depths this becomes quite imperceptible: hence in deep-sea sounding the line is
                    carefully watched as it runs out, and the time each 100-fathom mark enters the
                    water is noted down. Owing to the increasing friction these intervals gradually
                    lengthen, but any sudden increment indicates that the bottom has been reached,
                    for it shows that the weight has ceased to act, and that further descent of the
                    line is due merely to its own gravitation. For instance, in one of the
                    “Challenger” soundings, with a line 1 inch in circumference, and with a weight
                    of 4 cwts. attached, the time occupied in descending from 2900 to 3000 fathoms
                    was 2 m. 10 s.; from 3000 to 3100 fathoms 2 m. 13 s., and from 3100 to 3200
                    fathoms 3 m. 14 s., this sudden increase showing that the bottom had been
                    reached in the interval.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the weight required to sink a line in deep<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0298-0281"/> water with sufficient rapidity for purposes of
                    accurate observation is so great that it is found impracticable to bring it up
                    again without putting an undue strain upon the rope or seriously pro longing the
                    operation. Hence in 1854</p>
                <p>Brooke, an American, devised an ap paratus by which the weight was de tached when
                    it reached the bottom and only a small tube containing a sample of the bottom
                    was brought up. This was in fact a modifica tion of an apparatus which had been
                    devised by Hooke in the 17th century; he made an arrangement in which a light
                    sphere was sunk by a heavy weight, but was liberated on reach ing the
                    bottom,—the depth being then de duced from the time which elapsed between the
                    sinking of the globe and its reappearance at the surface. Of the various
                    modifications of</p>
                <p>Brooke’s sounding ma chine, perhaps the most famous is that con structed by the
                    black smith of H.M.S. “Hy dra,” and commonly known as the “Hydra sounding rod.”
                    It was used on the cruises of the “Lightning” and</p>
                <p>“Porcupine” and dur ing the earlier part of the “Challenger” expe dition. This
                    apparatus is shown in fig. 1, where AB is the rod, terminating in a tube below
                    so that it may bring up a sample of the bottom; the weights F fit loosely round
                    it and are supported by the wire E which passes over the stud D, where a spring
                    presses against it, the strength of which is so adjusted that it is unable to
                    displace the wire as long as the strain of the weights is upon it, but so soon
                    as this is relieved by their resting on the bottom the wire is thrust off the
                    stud, and when the line is hauled in the weights and wire are left behind.</p>
                <p>An improved apparatus has recently been invented by Mr J. Y. Buchanan, and used
                    by him on board the telegraph ships “Dacia” and “Buccaneer,” which can be used
                    either in shallow or deep water, and has the advantage of bringing up samples
                    both of the water and of the mud from the bottom. It consists of a hollow
                    cylinder A, fig. 2, at the top and bottom of which are india-rubber valves H, K,
                    opening upwards, so that water passes freely through them during the descent but
                    is retained as soon as a plug of mud occupies the tube B. The weight EE which
                    surrounds the cylinder is supported by a wire F passing over a peculiar hook D,
                    shown separately in figs. 3, 4, 5; when sounding in shallow water it is not
                    necessary to detach the weight, and the wire is therefore placed as in fig. 3;
                    when working at greater depths the wire rests on the other side of the hook, as
                    in fig. 4,—the result being that on the bottom being reached it falls into the
                    upper part of the notch, fig. 5, and continues to press the tube into the mud,
                    but when hauling up commences the wire slips out altogether and the weight is
                    left at the bottom. A valve L, M, N is sometimes used to retain the sample of
                    the bottom.</p>
                <p>At the present time deep-sea sounding is extensively practised for telegraphic
                    purposes, and is almost entirely conducted by means of wire instead of rope, a
                    method introduced by Sir William Thomson. The friction of the wire in passing
                    through the water is of course very much less than that of rope, and hence it
                    runs out and can be hauled in much more rapidly; a smaller sinker may be used,
                    and in very many instances it can be recovered. It is customary in sounding for
                    cables to make very frequent observations (once in from 1 to 50 miles), for it
                    is found that the laying can be accomplished with much less risk of accident if
                    the contour of the ocean-bed be accurately known. The saving of time by the use
                    of wire is very considerable; but the advantage is not so obvious in running out
                    as in hauling in, because a heavier weight is used to increase the rate, this of
                    course involving a loss of iron sinkers. For instance, an apparatus similar to
                    that mentioned above as being used by the “Challenger” took on an average <hi
                    rend="italic">24</hi> m. <hi rend="italic">22 s. to</hi> sink 2000 fathoms,
                    whilst in a recent sounding by the “Albatross” the weight ran out 2000 fathoms
                    in 20 m. 30 s. and was hauled in in 21 m. 9 s.,—a rate which would have been
                    quite unattainable by the aid of rope. The saving in the matter of sinkers is by
                    no means inconsiderable; instead of 3 or <hi rend="italic">4</hi> cwts <hi
                    rend="italic">.,</hi> only 50 to 60 lb are used, and Sigsbee has calculated that
                    this difference is sufficient to pay for any extra loss there may be by the
                    breaking of the wire. Captain Magnaghi of the Italian navy and Captains Sigsbee
                    and Belknap of the American Survey have successfully developed the method of
                    sounding with wire, and owing to its use the last-mentioned officer was able to
                    survey the route from San Francisco to Japan, doing all his sounding by hand,
                    which would have been quite impossible had hempen rope been used. When soundings
                    are made for scientific purposes it is customary to ascertain the temperature,
                    both at the bottom and at intermediate depths, by a thermometer of special
                    construction.</p>
