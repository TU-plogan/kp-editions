                <p><label type="entry">SPECTACLES</label> are flat glasses, prisms, spherical or
                    cylindrical lenses, employed to detect and correct defects of the eyes. They are
                    made usually of crown glass or rock crystal (“pebbles ”), the latter being
                    somewhat lighter and cooler to wear. They are mounted in the well-known rigid
                    spectacle frame when for continuous use,—eye-glasses being preferable where they
                    are worn intermittently, and handglasses or lorgnettes where they are required
                    to supplement temporarily the spectacles usually worn, or where, as with extreme
                    shortness of sight, no glass could be employed with comfort for any length of
                    time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preserves.—</hi> Preserves are used to conceal deformities or
                    to protect the eyes in the many conditions where they cannot tolerate bright
                    light, such as ulceration and inflammation of the cornea, certain diseases of
                    the iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina. They are made of bluish, “smoked,”
                    or almost black coloured glass, and are of very various shapes, according to the
                    amount of obscuration necessary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prisms.—</hi> Prisms are of great value in cases of double
                    vision due to a slight tendency to squinting, caused by weakness or over-action
                    of the muscular apparatus of the eyeball. Prisms deflect rays of light towards
                    their bases. Hence, if a prism is placed in front of the eye with its base
                    towards the nose, a ray of light falling upon it will be bent inwards, and seem
                    to come from a point further out from the axis of vision. Conversely, if. the
                    base of the prism is turned towards the temple, the ray of light will seem to
                    come from a point nearer the axis, and will induce the eye to turn inwards, to
                    converge towards its fellow. In cases of myopia or short-sight owing to weakness
                    of the internal recti muscles, the eyes in looking at a near object, instead of
                    converging, tend to turn outwards, and so double vision results. If a suitable
                    prism is placed in front of the eyes the double vision may be prevented. These
                    prisms may be combined with concave lenses, which correct the myopia, or, since
                    a concave lens may be considered as composed of two prisms united at their
                    apices, the same effect may be obtained by making the distance between the
                    centres of the concave lenses greater than that between the centres of the
                    pupils. Again, to obviate the necessity for excessive convergence of the eyes so
                    common in hypermetropia, the centre of the pupil should be placed outside the
                    centre of the corrective convex lenses; these will then act as prisms with their
                    bases inwards. Where, on the other hand, there is no tendency to squinting, care
                    must be taken in selecting spectacles that the distances between the centres of
                    the glasses and the centres of the pupils are quite equal, otherwise squinting,
                    or at any rate great fatigue, of the eyes may be induced.</p>

                    (meniscus) lenses are employed in ophthalmic practice in the treatment of errors
                    of refraction. Until recently these spherical lenses were numbered in terms of

                    Owing principally to differences in the length of the inch in various countries,
                    this method had great inconveniences, and is now giving place to a universal
                    system, in which the unit is the refractive power of a lens whose focal length
                    is one metre. This unit is called a “dioptric” (usually written “D ”). A lens of
                    twice its strength has a refractive power of 2 D, and a focal length of half a
                    metre, and so on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Concave lenses</hi> are used in the treatment of myopia or
                    short-sight. In this condition the eye is elongated from before backwards, so
                    that the retina lies behind the principal focus. All objects, therefore, which
                    lie beyond a certain point (the conjugate focus of the dioptric system of the
                    eye, the far point) are indistinctly seen; rays from them have not the necessary
                    divergence to be focused in the retina, but may obtain it by the interposition
                    of suitable concave lenses. Concave lenses should never be used for work within
                    the far point; but they may be used in all cases to improve distant vision, and
                    in very short-sighted persons to remove the far point so as to enable fine work
                    such as sewing or reading to be done at a convenient distance. The weakest pair
                    of concave lenses with which one can read clearly test types at a distance of 18
                    feet is the measure of the amount of myopia, and this fully correcting glass may
                    be worn in the slighter forms of short-sight. In higher degrees, where full
                    correction might increase the myopia by inducing a strain of the accommodation,
                    somewhat weaker glasses should be used for near work. In the highest degrees the
                    complete correction may be employed, but lorgnettes are generally preferred, as
                    they can be removed when the eyes become fatigued. It must be remembered that
                    short-sight tends to increase during the early, especially the school, years of
                    life, and that hygienic treatment, good light, good type, and avoidance of
                    stooping are important for its prevention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Convex Lenses.—</hi> In hypermetropia the retina is in front of
                    the principal focus of the eye. Hence in its condition of repose such an eye
                    cannot distinctly see parallel rays from a distance and, still less, divergent
                    rays from a near object. The defect may be overcome more or less completely by
                    the use of the accommodation. In the slighter forms no inconvenience may result;
                    but in higher degrees prolonged work is apt to give rise to aching and watering
                    of the eyes, headache, inability to read or sew for any length of time, and even
                    to double vision and internal strabismus. Such cases should be treated with
                    convex lenses, which should be theoretically of such a strength as to fully
                    correct the hypermetropia. Practically it is found that a certain amount of
                    hypermetropia remains latent, owing to spasm of the accommodation, which relaxes
                    only gradually. At first glasses may be given of such a strength as to relieve
                    the troublesome symptoms; and the strength may be gradually increased till the
                    total hypermetropia is corrected. Young adults with slighter forms of
                    hypermetropia need glasses only for near work; elderly people should have one
                    pair of weak glasses for distant and another stronger pair for near vision.
                    These may be conveniently combined, as in Franklin glasses, where the upper half
                    of the spectacle frame contains a weak lens, and the lower half, through which
                    the eye looks when reading, a stronger one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anisometropia.—</hi> It is difficult to lay down rules for the
                    treatment of cases where the refraction of the two eyes is unequal. If only one
                    eye is used, its anomaly should be alone corrected; where both are used and
                    nearly of equal strength, correction of each often gives satisfactory
                    results.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Presbyopia.—</hi> Where distant vision remains unaltered, but,
                    owing to gradual failure of the accommodative apparatus of the eye, clear vision
                    within 8 inches becomes impossible, convex lenses should be used for reading of
                    such a strength as to enable the eye to see clearly about 8 inches distance.
                    Presbyopia is arbitrarily said to commence at the age of forty, because it is
                    then that the need of spectacles for reading is generally felt; but it appears
                    later in myopia and earlier in hypermetropia. It advances with years, requiring
                    from time to time spectacles of increasing strength.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cylindrical Lenses.—</hi> In astigmatism, owing to differences
                    in the refractive power of the various meridians of the eye, great defect of
                    sight, frequently accompanied by severe headache, occurs. This condition may be
                    cured completely, or greatly improved, by the use of lenses whose surfaces are
                    segments of cylinders. They may be used either alone or in combination with
                    spherical lenses. The correction of astigmatism is in many cases a matter of
                    considerable difficulty, but the results to vision almost always reward the
                    trouble.</p>
                <p>Convex spectacles were invented towards the end of the 13th century, perhaps by
                    Roger Bacon. Concave glasses were introduced soon afterwards. Airy, the
                    astronomer, about 1827, corrected his own astigmatism by means of a cylindrical
                    lens. Periscopic glasses were introduced by Dr W. H. Wollaston. (A. BR.)</p>
