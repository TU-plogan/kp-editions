                <p><label type="entry">SWINE</label>. The oldest known even-toed or Artiodactyle
                    Ungulates (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 429) were neither
                    Oxen, Antelopes, Deer, Camels, nor Pigs, but presented a generalized type, which
                    by modification in various directions has given rise to all these very diverse
                    forms. They were mostly of small size, and had invariably the full number of
                    teeth of the typical mammalian heterodont dentition, viz., 44, of which the
                    incisors were <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> on
                    each side, the canines <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, the premolars <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>, and the true molars <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The molars were short and square, crowned with blunt,
                    rounded cusps, and the canines were not remarkably developed. All the feet
                    terminated in four toes, the two middle ones (the third and fourth of the
                    complete typical mammalian extremity) of nearly equal size, the outer ones
                    (second and fifth) smaller, and also equal. The five-toed ancestor of these
                    forms has not yet been discovered. They had no special weapons, as horns or
                    antlers, on their foreheads. Such was the condition of all the hitherto
                    discovered animals of this division at the commencement of the Tertiary period.
                    Very early a change took place in the characters of the molar teeth in certain
                    members of the group: the rounded tubercles became sharp ridges curved in a
                    crescentic form, and better adapted for a purely herbivorous diet, especially
                    for cutting and bruising the comparatively dry and hard blades of grass which
                    grow in open plains. The animals thus separated from the rest —the Selenodont
                    (crescent-toothed) Artiodactyles—have undergone various further modifications of
                    teeth, teet, and other parts, and constitute the diverse forms of ruminating
                    animals mentioned above. Those whose molar teeth retained more of the primitive
                    tuberculated (bunodont) form, were the ancestors of the present family of Swine,
                    some of which, looking upon their organization as a whole, have undergone less
                    change since the Eocene period than almost any other mammals.</p>
                <p>Remains of very generalized swine-like animals have been abundantly found in
                    Eocene and early Miocene formations both in America and Europe. In the former
                    continent they never (as far as present evidence indicates) underwent any great
                    diversity of modification, but gradually dwindled away and almost died out,
                    being only represented in the actual fauna by the two closely-allied species of
                    peccary, among the smallest and most insignificant members of the group, which
                    have existed almost unchanged since the Miocene age at least, if the evidence of
                    teeth alone can be trusted. In the Old World, on the other hand, the swine have
                    played a more important part in recent times, having become widely distributed,
                    and throwing off some curiously specialized forms. At the present time, though
                    not very numerous in species, they range through the greater part of the Old
                    World except within or near the Arctic Circle, although, in common with all the
                    other members of the great Ungulate order, they were completely absent from the
                    whole of the Australian region until introduced by man in very recent times.</p>
                <p>The existing swine-like animals may be divided naturally into three families :—I.

                    either recent or fossil, having been found in America. The family has been
                    divided into three genera, according to the number of the incisor teeth. (1) <hi

                    are directed upwards and outwards with a gentle backward curve, their hinder
                    edges working and wearing against the front edges of the upper canines.<note

                    root of the tooth. The natives of the Fiji Islands avail themselves of this
                    circumstance to produce one of their most valued ornaments—a circular boar’s
                    tusk: the upper canines being extracted, the lower ones are allowed to grow to
                    the desired form.</p></note> They appear externally to the mouth as tusks, the
                    form of the upper lip being modified to allow of their protrusion, but are much
                    less developed in the females than in the males. The teeth of the molar series
                    gradually increase in size and complexity from first to last, and are arranged
                    in contiguous series, except that the first lower premolar is separated by an

                    quadrate crowns, with four principal obtuse conical cusps, around which numerous
                    accessory cusps are clustered. The crown of the third molar is nearly as long
                    (antero-posteriorly) as those of the first and second together, having, in
                    addition to the four principal lobes, a large posterior talon or heel, composed
                    of numerous clustered conical cusps, and supported by several additional roots.

                    the size, form, and direction of the canine. Vertebrae: C 7, D 13-14, L 6, S 4,
                    C 20-21. The hairy covering of the body varies much under different conditions
                    of climate, but when best developed, as in the European wild boar, consists of
                    long stiff bristles, mostly abundant on the back and sides, and of a close
                    softer curling under-coat.</p>

                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Sus</hi> proper comprises a number of animals found in a
                    wild state throughout the greater part of Europe (except where exterminated by
                    human agency), the north of Africa, southern continental Asia, and the great
                    islands of the Malayan archipelago, Formosa, and Japan. The following among

                    pigs, but it must be borne in mind that through the whole of this region, and in
                    fact now throughout the greater part of the habitable world, pigs are kept by
                    man in a domesticated state, and it is still an open question whether some of
                    the wild pigs of the islands named above may not be local races derived
                    originally from imported domestic specimens. In New Zealand a wild or rather
                    “feral race is already established, the origin of which is of course quite
                    recent, as it is well ascertained that no animal of the kind ever lived upon the
                    island until after its settlement by Europeans. Whether the various breeds of
                    domestic pigs have been derived from one or several sources is still unknown. As
                    in so many similar cases there is no historic evidence upon the subject, and the
                    researches of naturalists, as Nathusius, Rutimeyer, Rolleston, and others, who
                    have endeavoured to settle the question on anatomical evidence, have not led to
                    satisfactory conclusions. It is, however, tolerably certain that all the species
                    or forms of wild pigs enumerated above and all the domestic races are closely
                    allied, and it is probable (though of this there has been no opportunity of
                    proof)</p>
                <p>will breed freely together. It is a curious circumstance that the young of all
                    the wild kinds of pigs (as far as is known at present) present a uniform
                    coloration, being dark brown with longitudinal stripes of a paler colour, a
                    character which completely disappears after the first few months. On the other
                    hand, this peculiar marking is rarely seen in domestic pigs in any part of the
                    world, although it has been occasionally observed. It is stated by Darwin that
                    the pigs which have run wild in Jamaica<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0805-0774"/> and the semiferal pigs of New Granada have
                    resumed this aboriginal character, and produce longitudinally striped young;
                    these must of course be the descendants of domestic animals introduced from
                    Europe since the Spanish conquest, as before that time there were no true pigs
                    in the New World. Another character by which the European domestic pig differs
                    from any of the wild species is the concave outline of the frontal region of the
                    skull, a form still retained by the feral pigs in New Zealand.<note

                    late years been practised with more care and skill than formerly, especially in
                    the United States, where the "hog product” ranks with wheat and cotton as one of
                    the leading agricultural exports. Several volumes have been published of the
                    pedigrees of two breeds—the Berkshire and the Poland-China. The Official
                    estimate of the number of swine in the United States in 1886 is 46,000,000, and
                    about the same number is assigned unofficially to Europe, where Servia takes the
                    lead in proportion to population and Norway stands lowest.</p></note></p>

                    has been known of this curious little animal, scarcely larger than a hare. The
                    recent acquisition of living specimens in the London Zoological Gardens has,
                    however, afforded opportunities for careful anatomical observation.<note

                <p>C. Two well-marked species of African swine have been with more reason separated
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Potamochοerus.</hi> The dentition differs
                    from that of true <hi rend="italic">Sus,</hi> inasmuch as the anterior premolars
                    have a tendency to disappear; sometimes in adult specimens the first upper
                    premolar is retained, but it is usually absent, as well as the first and often
                    the second lower premolars. The molar teeth are also less complex; the last
                    especially has a much less developed heel. There are also characteristic cranial
                    differences. The two species are very distinct in outward appearance and
                    coloration. One is <hi rend="italic">P. africanus,</hi> the South African
                    River-Hog, or Bosch-Vark, of a grey colour, and the other <hi rend="italic">P.
                    porcus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">penicillatus,</hi> the West African Red
                    River-Hog, remarkable for its vivid colouring and long pencilled ears. It should
                    be noted that the young of both these species, as well as of the pigmy <hi
                    rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi rend="italic">salvanius,</hi> present the striped
                    character of true <hi rend="italic">Sus,</hi> a strong indication of close
                    affinities, whereas in all the following forms this is -absent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Babirussa.—</hi> Dentition: <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi

                    number of teeth is therefore considerably reduced, the outer upper incisor and
                    the two anterior premolars of both jaws being absent. The molars, especially the
                    last, are smaller and simpler than in <hi rend="italic">Sus,</hi> but the great
                    peculiarity of this genus is the extraordinary development of the canines of the
                    male. These teeth are ever-growing, long, slender, and curved, and entirely
                    without enamel covering. Those of the upper jaw are directed upwards from their
                    base, so that they never enter the mouth, but pierce the skin of the face,
                    resembling horns rather than teeth, and curve backwards, downwards, and finally
                    often forwards again, almost or quite touching the skin of the forehead. There
                    is but one species, <hi rend="italic">B. alfurus,</hi> found only in the islands
                    of Celebes and Buru. Its external surface is almost entirely devoid of hair.
                    With regard to the curiously modified dentition, Wallace (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Malay Archipelago,</hi> i. p. 435) makes the following observations. “It is
                    difficult to understand what can be the use of these horn-like teeth. Some of
                    the old writers supposed that they served as hooks by which the creature could
                    rest its head on a branch.</p>
                <p>But the way in which they usually diverge just over and in front of the eye has
                    suggested the more probable idea, that they serve to guard these organs from
                    thorns and spines while hunting for fallen fruits among the tangled thickets of
                    rattans and other spiny plants. Even this, however, is not satisfactory, for the
                    female, who must seek her food in the same way, does not possess them.</p>
                <p>I should be inclined to believe rather that these tusks were once useful, and
                    were then worn down as fast as they grew, but that changed conditions of life
                    have rendered them unnecessary, and they now develop into a monstrous form, just
                    as the incisors of the beaver and rabbit will go on growing if the opposite
                    teeth do not wear them away. In old animals they reach an enormous size, and are
                    generally broken off as if by fighting.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phacochcerus.—</hi> The Wart-Hogs, so called from the large
                    cutaneous lobes projecting from each side of the face, have the teeth still more
                    remarkably modified than in <hi rend="italic">Babirussa.</hi> The milk
                    dentition, and even the early condition of the permanent dentition, is formed on
                    the same general type as that of <hi rend="italic">Sus,</hi> except that certain
                    of the typical teeth are absent, the formula being <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi

                    3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, total 34; but as age advances all the
                    teeth have a tendency to disappear, except the canines and the posterior molars,
                    but these, which in some cases are the only teeth left in the jaws, attain an
                    extraordinary development. The upper canines especially are of great size, and
                    curve outwards, forwards, and upwards. Their enamel covering is confined to the
                    apex, and soon wears away. The lower canines are much more slender, but follow
                    the same curve; except on the posterior surface, their crowns are covered with
                    enamel. Unlike those of the babirussa, the canines of the wart-hog are large in
                    both sexes. The third molar tooth of both jaws is of great size, and presents a
                    structure at first sight unlike that of any other mammal, being composed of
                    numerous (22-25) parallel cylinders or columns, each with pulp cavity, dentine,
                    and enamel covering, and packed together with cement. Careful examination will,
                    however, show that a similar modification to that which has transformed the
                    comparatively simple molar tooth of the mastodon into the extremely complex
                    grinder of the Indian elephant has served to change the tooth of the common pig
                    into that of <hi rend="italic">Phaco-choerus.</hi> The tubercles which cluster
                    over the surface of the crown of the common pig are elongated and drawn out into
                    the columns of the wart-hog, as the low transverse ridges of the mastodon’s
                    tooth become the leaf-like plates of the elephant’s.</p>
                <p>Two species of this genus are distinguished :— <hi rend="italic">P.
                    africanus,</hi> Aelian’s Wart-Hog, widely distributed over the continent; and
                    <hi rend="italic">P. aethiopicus,</hi> Pallas’s Wart-Hog, confined to

                    specimens the upper incisors are absent and the lower ones worn down to the
