                    the happy thought occurred to the brothers Smith of feigning that the most
                    popular poets of the time had been among the competitors and issuing a volume of
                    unsuccessful addresses in parody of their various styles. They divided the task
                    between them, James taking Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, and Crabbe, while
                    Byron, Moore, Scott, and Bowles were assigned to Horace.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The particulars of the authorship are given
                    in the 18th edition (1820), and in the memoir of his brother by Horace prefixed
                    to a collection of fugitive pieces (1840). James contributed the first stanza to
                    the imitation of Byron, but otherwise they worked independently.</p></note> The
                    parodists were ready with their small volume by October, but they had some
                    difficulty in getting a publisher, although the success of their clever
                    imitations once published was such that seven editions were called for within
                    three months. The <hi rend="italic">Rejected Addresses</hi> are the most widely
                    popular parodies ever published in England, and have taken quite a classical
                    rank in that kind of literature. The brothers fairly divided the honours: the
                    elder brother’s Wordsworth is evenly balanced by the younger’s Scott, and both
                    had a hand in Byron. A striking feature in the parodies is the absence of
                    malice; none of the caricatured bards took offence, while the imitation is so
                    clever that both Byron and Scott are recorded to have said in effect that they
                    could hardly believe they had not written the addresses ascribed to them.</p>
                <p>After this brilliant success James, the elder brother, determined, as he said,
                    “to leave off a winner’’and follow Warburton’s advice to Anstey: “Young man, you
                    have written a highly successful work; never put pen to paper again.” He was
                    tempted occasionally to transgress this self-denying ordinance, and made another
                    hit in writing <hi rend="italic">Country Cousins, A Trip to Paris, A Trip to
                    America,</hi> and other lively skits for Charles Mathews, earning from the
                    comedian the praise of being “the only man who can write clever nonsense.” His
                    social reputation as a wit stood high. He was reputed one of the best of
                    conversers in an age when the art was studied, and it was remarked that he held
                    his own without falling into the great error of wits,—sarcasm. But for all his
                    good-nature he did not wholly escape the Charybdis of great talkers,—the charge
                    of being something of a bore. In his old age the irreverent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraser's</hi> put him in its gallery of living portraits as a gouty and elderly
                    but painstaking joker. He died in London on 26th December 1839.</p>
                <p>Horace Smith was less timorously careful of his poetical reputation than his
                    elder brother, whom he survived, and, after making a fortune as a stockbroker,
                    followed in the wake of Scott and wrote about a score of historical novels, <hi
                    rend="italic">—Βrambletye House, Tor Hill, Reuben Apsley, Zillah, The New)
                    Forest, Walter Colyton,</hi> &amp;c. His sketches of eccentric character are
                    brilliant and amusing; but he was more of an essayist than a story-teller. He
                    began in 1826, when Scott, still retaining his hold on the public, had made
                    success impossible for imitators with less wealth of historical substance and
                    inferior command of stirring incident. As he went on he encountered such
                    competitors as Bulwer Lytton, Disraeli, Marryat, and Dickens. Still Horace Smith
                    established a fair reputation, and some of his novels may still be found in the
                    smoking-rooms of country houses. He was also a frequent contributor to the <hi
                    rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine</hi> under the editorship of Campbell. Three
                    volumes of <hi rend="italic">Gaieties and Gravities,</hi> published in 1826,
                    contain many witty essays both in prose and in verse, but the only single piece
                    that has taken a permanent place is the “Address to the Mummy in Belzoni’s
                    Exhibition.” There is more of earnest in this than is generally found in his
                    jesting. In private life Horace Smith was not less popular than his brother,
                    though less ambitious of renown as a talker. It was of him that Shelley said:
                    “Is it not odd that the only truly generous person I ever knew who had money
                    enough to be generous with should be a stockbroker? He writes poetry and
                    pastoral dramas and yet knows how to make money, and does make it, and is still
                    generous.” Horace Smith died at Tunbridge Wells on 12th July 1849.</p>
