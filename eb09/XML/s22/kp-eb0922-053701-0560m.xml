                    erecting clay engines and similar mechanical amusements. Afterwards he drove the

                    father in firing the engine at a shilling a day. He set himself diligently to
                    qualify himself for higher duties, and in his seventeenth year was appointed
                    engineman or plugman. As yet he was unable to read, but, stimulated by the
                    desire to obtain fuller information regarding the wonderful inventions of
                    Boulton and Watt, he began in his eighteenth year to attend a night school, and
                    soon made remarkably rapid progress. In 1801 he obtained the situation of
                    brakesman, and in 1812 was appointed engine-wright at Killingworth high pit at a
                    salary of £100 a year. Meantime he had been employing his leisure in watch and
                    clock cleaning, in studying mechanics, and in various experiments with a view of
                    solving the difficulties connected with the construction of a satisfactory
                    locomotive. Having obtained permission from Lord Ravensworth, the principal
                    partner of the Killingworth colliery to incur the outlay for constructing a
                    “travelling engine” for the tramroads between the colliery and the shipping port
                    nine miles distant, he made a successful trial with the engine, which he named
                    “My Lord,” 25th July 1814. Setting himself diligently to improve his invention,
                    he thoroughly satisfied himself that for the proper success of the locomotive a
                    railway as nearly as possible level was an essential condition. In 1822 he
                    succeeded in impressing with the importance of his invention the projectors of
                    the Stockton and Darlington Railway, who had contemplated using horses for their
                    waggons, and was appointed engineer of the railway, with liberty to carry out
                    his own plans, the result being the opening, 27th September 1825, of the first
                    railway over which passengers and goods were carried by a locomotive. The
                    success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway led to the employment of
                    Stephenson in the construction of the Liverpool aud Manchester Railway, which,
                    notwithstanding prognostications of failure by the most eminent engineers of the
                    day, he carried successfully through Chat Moss. He also succeeded in persuading
                    the directors to give the locomotive a trial, and, as his improved invention,
                    the “Rocket,” during her trial trip made 29 miles an hour, his suggestion met
                    with complete approval; with the opening of the line, 15th September 1830, the
                    modern era of railways may be said to have been definitely inaugurated. While
                    his experiments in connexion with locomotives were in progress, the construction
                    of a safety lamp for use in mines occupied much of his attention. There can be
                    no doubt regarding the justice of his claims to be considered the first inventor
                    of the tube safety lamp, notwithstanding that the name of Sir Humphry Davy has
                    been chiefly associated with the discovery. In recognition of the “valuable
                    service he had thus rendered to mankind,” subscriptions were in 1815 collected
                    in behalf of Stephenson which amounted to £1000, a sum which he found of great
                    convenience in connexion with his locomotive experiments. Stephenson was closely
                    connected with the more important of the railway projects which the success of
                    the Liverpool and Manchester line called into existence, but he strongly
                    disapproved of the railway mania which ensued, and predicted that only ruin
                    could result from the prevalent disposition towards railway speculation. He was
                    frequently consulted in regard to the construction of foreign railways, and in
                    this connexion visited Belgium and Spain in 1845. Towards the close of his life
                    he retired from active duties, and at his residence at Tupton House,</p>
                <p>Chesterfield, interested himself chiefly in farming and horticultural pursuits.
                    He died 12th August 1848.</p>
