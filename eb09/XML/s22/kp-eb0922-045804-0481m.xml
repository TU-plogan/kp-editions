                <p><label type="entry">STATE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Great Officers of</hi></label>.
                    All the principal ministers of the British crown are popularly called the great
                    officers of state. Under this designation are more or less accurately included
                    the premier for the time being, the other members of the cabinet, and the
                    leading functionaries of the court. But properly speaking the great offices of
                    state are only nine in number, and it is to the holders of them alone that the
                    description of “the great officers of state” strictly and distinctively applies.
                    They are the lord high steward, the lord high chancellor, the lord high
                    treasurer, the lord-president of the privy council, the lord-keeper of the privy
                    seal, the lord great chamberlain, the lord high constable, the earl marshal, and
                    the lord high admiral. Of these, three—the lord chancellor, the lord-president
                    of the council, and the lord privy seal— are the first and second always and the
                    third almost always cabinet ministers. The offices of two more—those of the lord
                    treasurer and the high constable—are now executed by commission, the chief of
                    the lords commissioners, known severally as the first lord of the treasury and
                    the first lord of the admiralty, being likewise members of the cabinet, while
                    the first lord of the treasury is usually at the head of the Government. But,
                    although it has become the rule for the treasury and the admiralty to be put in
                    commission, there is nothing except usage of longer or shorter duration to
                    prevent the crown from making a personal appointment to either of them, and the
                    functions which formerly appertained to the lord treasurer and the high admiral
                    are still regularly performed in the established course of the national
                    administration. The four offices of the high steward, the great chamberlain, the
                    high constable, and the earl marshal stand on a different footing, and can be
                    regarded at the present day as little else than survivals from an earlier
                    condition of society. They have practically ceased to have any relation to the
                    ordinary routine of business in the country or of ceremonial in the palace, and
                    the duties associated with them have either passed entirely into abeyance or are
                    restricted within extremely narrow limits, save on certain occasions of
                    exceptional pomp and solemnity. All of them were once hereditary, and, taking
                    the three kingdoms together, they or their counterparts and equivalents continue
                    to be held by right of inheritance in one or other of them even now. The prince
                    of Wales is the hereditary great steward of Scotland, and the carl of Shrewsbury
                    is the hereditary grand seneschal of Ireland. The great chamberlainship of
                    England is held jointly by Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lord Carrington on the
                    one part and on the other part by the marquis of Cholmondeley. The hereditary
                    high constable of Scotland is the earl of Erroll, and the hereditary earl
                    marshal of England is the duke of Norfolk. It is of the great offices of the
                    steward, the chamberlain, the constable, and the marshal that we shall at
                    present speak, the rest of those we have mentioned being dealt with under their
                    proper headings, or in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabinet, Ministry,
                    Privy Council,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Royal Household.</hi></p>
                <p>The lord high steward of England ranks as the first of the great officers of
                    state. His office is called out of abeyance by commission under the great seal
                    only for coronations and for trials by the House of Lords. At the former he
                    bears the crown of St Edward immediately before the sovereign in the procession
                    to Westminster Abbey, and he presides at the latter on the arraignment of a peer
                    or a peeress for treason or felony. From the reign of Richard II. to that of
                    Henry VII. it was the duty of the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0482-0459"/> lord high steward to sit judicially in the court
                    of claims to hear and determine all claims to render services of grand serjeanty
                    to the king or queen at his or her coronation. Since the accession of the house
                    of Tudor, however, this function has generally been discharged by a specially
                    appointed commission, or a committee of the privy council. According to the
                    tradition once current among lawyers and antiquaries, the steward of England
                    was, under the Norman and Angevin kings, the second personage in the realm, the
                    viceroy in the absence and the chief minister in the presence of the sovereign.
                    Coke says, on the more than doubtful authority of an ancient manuscript, that
                    his office was to superintend under the king and next after the king the whole
                    kingdom and all the ministers of the law within the kingdom in time of both
                    peace and war. But of this there is no satisfactory evidence. It is not
                    improbable that the steward of England may for a short period after the Conquest
                    have occupied a position analogous to that of the Saxon heah-gerefa or that of
                    the Norman seneschal, or of the two in combination. But, as Stubbs points out,
                    the chief minister and occasional viceroy, either alone or with others, of the
                    Conqueror and his earlier successors was the person to whom the historians and
                    the later constitutional writers give the name of justiciarius with or without
                    the prefix “summus” or “capitalis.” He adds that most likely the Norman
                    seueschalship was the origin of the English justiciarship, that under Henry II.
                    the seneschal of Normandy receives the name of justiciar, and that it is only in
                    the same reign that the office in England acquires the exclusive right to the
                    definite name of “summus” or “capitalis justitiarius” or “justitiarius totius
                    Angliae.” But whatever may have been his original condition the steward had been
                    by that time at the latest eclipsed in his most important functions by the
                    justiciar, and he makes, as Stubbs observes, in his official capacity no great
                    figure in English history. By the reign of Henry II. at any rate all connexion
                    between the stewardship and the justiciarship had come to an end; and, while the
                    second retained its authority unimpaired until its extinction, the first became
                    a grand serjeanty, primarily annexed to the barony of Hinckley, it is said, and
                    afterwards to the earldom of Leicester. On the attainder of Simon de Montfort
                    the earldom and stewardship were forfeited, and both were granted by Edward I.
                    to his brother Edmund Plantagenet, earl of Lancaster, from whom they descended
                    to the daughter and eventual heiress of Henry Plantagenet, duke of Lancaster.
                    She was the first wife of John of Gaunt and the mother of Henry IV. On the
                    accession of her son to the throne they became merged in the crown, from which
                    period the stewardship has been revived only <hi rend="italic">hac vice</hi>
                    from time to time as occasion required. It is indeed to John of Gaunt that the
                    pre-eminent position accorded to the office since the end of the 14th century is
                    really due. It emerged from the comparative obscurity in which it had rested for
                    nearly three hundred years as soon as he became the tenant of it by courtesy in
                    right of his deceased wife. As far as any records show to the contrary he was
                    the first steward of England who took part in the coronation of a king or queen,
                    and he was certainly the first steward of England who sat in the court of claims
                    or who presided at a trial by the House of Lords. It seems to have been by him
                    also that the precedence of the stewardship before all the other great offices
                    of state was secured, a restoration or augmentation of rank which is the more
                    remarkable in that the steward of Scotland gave place to the chamberlain and the
                    seneschal of Ireland gave place to the constable of the two kingdoms
                    respectively. John of Gaunt may be regarded, in fact, as the creator of the lord
                    high stewardship and all its privileges and prerogatives as they have existed
                    from his days to our own.</p>
                <p>The lord great chamberlain of England ranks as the sixth great officer of state.
                    Whenever the sovereign attends the palace of Westminster the keys are delivered
                    to him, and he is for the time in command of the building. At the opening or
                    closing of the session of parliament by the sovereign in person he disposes of
                    the sword of state to be carried by any peer he may select, and walks himself in
                    the procession on the right of the sword of state, a little before it and next
                    to the sovereign. He assists at the introduction of all peers into the House of
                    Lords on their creation, and at the homage of all bishops after their
                    consecration. At a coronation he receives the regalia from the dean and chapter
                    of Westminster, and distributes them to the personages who are to bear them in
                    the ceremony. On that day it is his duty to carry the sovereign his shirt and
                    wearing apparel before he rises and to serve him with water to wash his hands
                    before and after dinner. The chamberlain was originally a financial officer; his
                    work, Stubbs says, was rather that of auditor or accountant than that of
                    treasurer; he held a more definite position in the household than most of the
                    other great officers, “and in the judicial work of the country he was only less
                    important than the justiciar.” The office was hereditary in the Veres, earls of
                    Oxford, from the reign of Henry I. to the reign of Charles I., when it passed
                    through an heiress to the Berties, Lords Willoughby de Eresby, and afterwards
                    earls of Lindsey and dukes of Ancaster, and from the Berties it was transmitted
                    through coheiresses to the present inheritors of the dignity. The Stuarts, dukes
                    of Lennox, were hereditary great chamberlains of Scotland in the 16th and 17th
                    centuries. The office on their extinction was granted by Charles II. to James,
                    duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch, on whose attainder it passed to Charles, duke of
                    Richmond and Lennox, by whom it was surrendered to the crown in 1703.</p>
                <p>The lord high constable of England ranks as the seventh of the great officers of
                    state. His office is called out of abeyance for coronations alone, when it is
                    his duty to assist in the reception of the regalia from the dean and chapter of
                    Westminster, and during the coronation banquet to ride into Westminster Hall on
                    the right hand of the champion. The constable was originally the commander of
                    the royal armies and the master of the horse. He was also one of the judges of
                    the court of chivalry or court of honour. The constableship was granted as a
                    grand serjeanty with the earldom of Hereford by the empress Maud to Milo of
                    Gloucester, and was carried by his heiress to the Bohuns, earls of Hereford and
                    Essex. Through a coheiress of the Bohuns it descended to the Staffords, dukes of
                    Buckingham; and on the attainder of Edward Stafford, third duke of Buckingham,
                    in the reign of Henry VIII. it became merged in the crown. The Lacys and Verduns
                    were hereditary constables of Ireland from the 12th to the 14th century; and the
                    Hays, earls of Erroll, have been hereditary constables of Scotland from early in
                    the 14th century until the present time.</p>
                <p>The earl marshal of England ranks as the eighth of the great officers of state.
                    He is the head of the college of arms, and has the appointment of the
                    kings-of-arms, heralds, and pursuivants at his discretion. He attends the
                    sovereign in opening and closing the session of parliament, walking opposite to
                    the lord great chamberlain on his or her right hand. It is his duty to make
                    arrangements for the order of all state processions and ceremonials, especially
                    for coronations and royal marriages and funerals. Like the lord high constable
                    he rides into Westminster Hall with the champion after a coronation, taking his
                    place on the left hand, and with the lord great chamberlain he assists at the
                    introduction of all newly-created peers into the House of Lords. The marshal
                    appears in the feudal<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0483-0460"/> armies to have been in command of the cavalry
                    under the constable, and to have in some measure superseded him as master of the
                    horse in the royal palace. He exercised joint and co-ordinate jurisdiction with
                    the constable in the court of chivalry, and afterwards became the sole judge of
                    that tribunal. The marshalship of England was made hereditary in the Clares and
                    Marshals, earls of Pembroke, in the reign of Stephen or Henry II., and through a
                    coheiress passed to the Bigots, earls of Norfolk, and by Roger Bigot, fifth earl
                    of Norfolk, it was surrendered with his other dignities to Edward I. It was
                    granted by Edward II. to his brother Thomas of Brotherton, earl of Norfolk, and,
                    after it had been variously disposed of by Edward III., was by Richard II.
                    erected into an earldom and conferred on Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, who
                    was the great-grandson and heir of Thomas of Brotherton. One of the coheiresses
                    of the Mowbrays was the mother of John Howard, duke of Norfolk, who was created
                    earl marshal by Richard III. After several attainders and partial restorations
                    in the reigns of the Tudors and the Stuarts, the earl marshalship was finally
                    entailed by Charles II. on the male line of the Howards, with many specific
                    remainders and limitations, under which settlement it has regularly descended to
                    the present duke of Norfolk. The Clares and Marshals, earls of Pembroke, and the
                    Lords Morley appear to have been hereditary marshals of Ireland from the
                    invasion of the island until the end of the 15th century. The Keiths were Earls
                    Marischal of Scotland from the institution of the office by James II. in 1458
                    until the attainder of George, the tenth earl, in 1716.</p>
