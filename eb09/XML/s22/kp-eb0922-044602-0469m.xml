                    stone, erected at a cost of £8500. The town formerly possessed fourteen parish
                    churches, but now has only six, viz., St Mary’s, erected at the end of the 13th
                    century, possessing an Early English tower, with Decorated spire, the principal
                    other parts of the building being Perpendicular; All Saints, also of the 13th
                    century, the steeple being built at the expense of John Brown, merchant of the
                    staple at Calais, in the beginning of the 15th century; St Michael’s, rebuilt in
                    1836 on the site of one erected in 1269; St George’s, Early English, Decorated,
                    and Perpendicular, for the most part rebuilt in 1450 at the expense of William
                    Bruges, first garter king-at-arms; St John Baptist’s, Perpendicular, erected
                    about 1452; and St Martin’s, Perpendicular, in which Lord Treasurer Burghley is
                    buried. Formerly there were several religious houses :—the Benedictine monastery
                    of St Leonard’s, founded in the 7th century, of which there are still some
                    remains; the Carmelite monastery (1291), of which the west gate still stands;
                    and houses for grey friars (time of Henry IIL), Dominicans (1240), Gilbertines
                    (1291), and Augustinians (1316). The principal secular buildings are the
                    town-hall (rebuilt 1776), the corn exchange (1859), and the literary and
                    scientific institute (1842), with a library of 6000 volumes. There are a large
                    number of charitable institutions, including the Stamford and Rutland infirmary
                    (1828), Browne’s hospital, founded in the time of Richard III., Snowden’s
                    almshouses (1604), Truesdale’s almshouses (1700), and Burghley hospital, founded
                    by Lord Treasurer Burghley (1597). Ratcliffe’s and Browne’s high school for boys
                    was lately erected at a cost of £7000 on the site of Ratcliffe’s free school;
                    and Brown’s school for girls in St Martin’s was erected in 1876 at a cost of
                    £5000. The prosperity of the town depends chiefly on its connexion with
                    agriculture. It possesses iron foundries, agricultural implement works, waggon
                    factories, and breweries. There is also some trade in coal, timber, stones, and
                    slates. The population of the municipal borough (area 1766 acres) in 1871 was
                    7846 and in 1881 it was 8773; that of the parliamentary borough (area 1894
                    acres) in the same years was 8086 and 8993. The latter was merged in the
                    counties in 1885, giving its name to a parliamentary division of
                    Lincolnshire.</p>
                <p>The town is of very remote antiquity, and is supposed to have grown into
                    importance after the decay of the Roman village of Bridge Casterton two miles
                    distant. Its name, an early form of which was Staenford, was derived from a
                    passage at the town across the Welland by stone. It was the scene of the first
                    battle of the Picts and Scots against the Britons and Saxons in 449, and
                    subsequently became one of the five great Danish boroughs. A castle was built
                    early in the 10th century on the south bank of the river opposite the town, but
                    has long disappeared; and of another on the north-west of the town, fortified by
                    Stephen, only the foundations now remain. The town was at one time enclosed by
                    walls, and there are still traces of gateways on the east and west sides. In the
                    reign of Henry III. the lectures of the Carmelites on divinity and the liberal
                    arts led to the erection of colleges, and Stamford became celebrated as a place
                    of education. When dissensions arose among the students of Oxford in the reign
                    of Edward III. many removed thither, and ultimately the universities both of
                    Oxford and Cambridge thought it necessary to pass statutes prohibiting their
                    students from proceeding to other places for any part of their education,
                    Stamford being specially mentioned in the<pb break="no"

                    Stamford was governed by aldermen. It was incorporated by charter in the reign
                    of Edward IV. In 1663 it received a charter from Charles II., constituting its
                    chief magistrate a mayor. It returned two members to parliament from the reign
                    of Edward I. till 1867, and one from 1867 to 1885. The deanery of Stamford is an
                    ancient peculiar, the appointment being vested in the bishop of Lincoln.</p>
