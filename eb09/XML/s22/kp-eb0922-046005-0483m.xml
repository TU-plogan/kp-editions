                    width of the ruled spaces. The pens consist of grooved slips of sheet brass
                    coming to a fine point, which in their upper part are covered by a sheet of felt
                    saturated with a flowing ink, whence each pen obtains the supply required for
                    tracing its line. The paper is carried forward by endless tapes or threads which
                    pass around cylinders. In a recent form of machine the rulers consist of metal
                    disks with thin edges, which take up printing ink from an india-rubber cylinder,
                    and print the lines on the paper as it passes around a revolving cylinder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paper-Folding</hi> machinery is used for numerous purposes in
                    the stationery trade, apart from its application to the folding of sheets for
                    the bookbinder. Devices for folding come most prominently forward in connexion
                    with the envelope manufacture, an industry which received an enormous
                    development by the introduction of uniform postage rates. In envelope-making the
                    folding is commonly associated with gumming, and sometimes with embossing, in
                    the same system of machinery. The first efficient automatic machine for envelope
                    manufacture was devised by Edwin Hill and Warren de la Rue, and by them patented
                    in 1845. Many forms of envelope folding and gumming machine now exist. In making
                    envelopes the blanks are first cut out by shaped cutters or punches acting at
                    one stroke on a thickness of from 200 to 300 sheets of paper. These blanks in
                    the latest form of machine are gummed by a pad which takes gum from a roller and
                    presses it on the edges of the paper, just as printing ink is received from
                    cylinders and pressed on paper in printing. The gummed surface of the pad lifts
                    each blank separately, places it under a plunger, which, descending, passes it
                    to folders, whence it is delivered into a clip in an endless band of
                    considerable length. The envelopes are delivered into the clips in the band at
                    the rate of about 100 to 150 per minute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Perforating</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Punching</hi> give rise
                    to a range of machines of varied form and complexity. The idea of perforating
                    paper so as to allow of the ready detaching of portions by tearing was conceived
                    and. patented in 1848 by Mr Henry Archer. Of such utility was Mr Archer’s
                    conception deemed by the post-office authorities as a convenience for detaching
                    stamps from sheets that in 1853 he was awarded £4000 for his patent rights. The
                    applications of perforation are now very numerous, but its value still remains
                    most obvious in connexion with the detachment of adhesive stamps from
                    sheets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Numbering</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Paging</hi> constitute
                    another series of stationery operations, for which ingenious machines have been
                    devised. For consecutive numbering a series of printing disks are employed, on
                    the periphery of which the series of digits 1 to 0 are raised. The outer disk
                    moves a number after each impression, the second disk moves once in ten times,
                    and so on, thus automatically imprinting consecutive numbers up to the limit of
                    the disks on the machine. Such a machine prints only on one side of the paper,
                    and where the numbering is required on both sides the disks must be geared to
                    move two places, numbering only odd or even numbers, two printings being thus
                    required. For printing right and left consecutively an endless band machine is
                    used, which prints alternately below and above for the two sides of the
                    sheet.</p>
