                <p><label type="entry">SPECIES</label>. In logic the term “species” is applied to
                    any group of individuals agreeing in some common attribute or attributes, and
                    included along with other groups in a higher category, that of “genus,” which
                    comprehends the fewer and more general attributes in which all agree and ignores
                    those in which they differ. The application of these terms in logic is thus
                    purely relative; any genus, however large, may be but a species of a still
                    larger genus. But in arranging the innumerable objects of the natural sciences
                    the naturalist finds it necessary to restrict the terms “species” and “genus” to
                    the two lowest groupings and to distinguish the higher aggregates by special
                    terms, as “family,” “order,” “class,” &amp;c. Early writers had but a loose
                    conception of many different “kinds” of animals and plants, and spoke only of
                    species and genus in their purely logical relations, with varying breadth of
                    content. The term “species” was limited to its natural history usage in the end
                    of the 17th century by John Ray. His conception of “specific characters” rested,
                    not only on close and constant resemblance in outward form, but also on the
                    likeness of offspring to parent, a considerable measure of variability being,
                    however, recognized. Amongst subsequent authors this conception of common
                    descent or parentage became more and more prominent, while the progress of
                    successful definition of species made the limits of their variability seem
                    always narrower and of less importance; and in this way the useful working
                    conception of the tolerable definiteness of species gradually crystallized into
                    the absolute dogma of their fixity. Then Linnaeus in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophia Botanica</hi> gave the aphorism “species tot sunt diversae,
                    quot diversae formae ab initio sunt creatae” (we reckon just as many species as
                    there were forms created at the beginning), which was generally accepted.
                    Buffon’s obstinate rejection of the Linnaean classification was associated with
                    a belief in the modifiability of species, and showed some foresight of the
                    doctrine elaborated soon afterwards by <hi rend="smallcaps">Lamarck</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(q.v).</hi> The general acceptance of this dogma was, however,
                    effected by the influence of Cuvier; its overthrow dates only from the
                    publication of Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> (1859), of
                    which the argument need not be here repeated. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Evolution, Morphology.)</hi> The genealogical conception of species was
                    thus established more firmly than ever, though cleared from its former
                    associations; in Haeckel’s phrase, the species is the whole succession of
                    organisms which exhibit the same form in the same environment. The rash
                    generalization, that distinct species are to be recognized by their incapacity
                    for the production of fertile hybrids, was next overthrown, while closer study
                    has cleared away the notion of the equal definiteness of all specific forms. We
                    now know that, while many forms, like the pearly nautilus or the Venus’s
                    fly-trap, do indeed exhibit the most perfect specific definiteness, the
                    demarcation of equally definite species in other genera is rendered impossible
                    by the existence of the most complete series of transitional forms, and the
                    number of the species defined thus comes to depend simply on the personal
                    equation of the systematist, on his predilection for “lumping” or “splitting,”
                    as the case may be. Thus, for example, the number of described German species of
                    hawkweed <hi rend="italic">(Hieracium)</hi> has ranged from 300 for one author,
                    through 106 for another and 52 for a third, to less than 20 for a fourth.
                    Similar instances of variable genera are afforded by the willows and the
                    brambles, and many other common forms. This wide variability, as might be
                    expected, seems to be more prevalent among the lowest forms of life, and the
                    classical example of the relativity and variability of species has been
                    furnished by Haeckel’s beautiful monograph on the calcareous sponges <hi
                        rend="italic">(Monographie der Kalkschwämme,</hi> Jena, 1872), in which he
                    offers twelve distinct arrangements of the same set of forms from various points
                    of view, among which the two most nearly conventional propose respectively 21
                    genera and 111 species and 39 genera and 289 species. All such variable forms
                    are in fact species in the making, which become definite in proportion as
                    certain varieties become especially adapted to their environment, and become
                    isolated by the dying out of the intermediate forms. With these limitations,
                    however, the working usefulness of the morphological conception of species
                    remains undiminished. The want of any absolute standard of specific difference
                    is largely made up by practical experience and common sense; and the
                    evolutionary systematists are less in danger than were their predecessors of
                    either exaggerating or understating the importance of mere varieties. (See <hi
