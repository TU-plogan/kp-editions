                    who, calling it “Le Caurâle ou petit Paon des roses,” announced it as hitherto
                    undescribed, and placed it among the Rails. In the same year appeared the
                    above-cited paper by Pallas, who, notwithstanding his remote abode, was better
                    informed as to its history than his great contemporary, whose ignorance, real or
                    affected, of his fellow-countryman’s priority in the field is inexplicable; and
                    it must have been by inadvertence that, writing “roses” for “roseaux,” Buffon
                    turned the colonial name from one that had a good meaning into nonsense. In 1783
                    Boddaert, equally ignorant of what Pallas had done, called it <hi rend="italic"

                        <hi rend="italic">(Synopsis,</hi> iii. p. 156), by whom it was introduced to
                    English readers as the “Caurale Snipe.” Thus within a dozen years this bird was
                    referred to three perfectly distinct genera, and in those days genera meant much
                    more than they do now. Not until 1811 was it recognized as forming a genus of
                    its own. This was done by Illiger, whose appellation <hi rend="italic"
                        >Buryρyga</hi> has been generally accepted.</p>
                <p>The Sun-Bittern is about as big as a small Curlew, but with much shorter legs and
                    a rather slender, slightly decurved bill, blunt at the tip. The wings are
                    moderate, broad, and rounded, the tail rather long and broad. The head is black
                    with a white stripe over and another under each eye, the chin and throat being
                    also white. The rest of the plumage is not to be described in a limited space
                    otherwise than generally, being variegated with black, brown, chestnut, bay,
                    buff, grey, and white—so mottled, speckled, and belted<pb break="no"

                    somewhat to resemble certain moths. The bay colour forms two conspicuous patches
                    on each wing, and also an antepenultimate bar on the tail, behind which is a
                    subterminal band of black. The irides are red; the bill is greenish olive; aud
                    the legs are pale yellow. As in the case of most South-American birds, very
                    little is recorded of its habits in freedom, except that it frequents the muddy
                    and wooded banks of rivers, feeding on small fishes and insects. In captivity it
                    soon becomes tame, and has several times made its nest and reared its young
                    (which, when hatched, are clothed with mottled down; <hi rend="italic">Proc.
                        Zool. Society,</hi> 1866, p. 76, ρl. ix. fig. 1) in the Zoological Gardens
                    (London), where examples are generally to be seen and their plaintive piping
                    heard. It ordinarily walks with slow and precise steps, keeping its body in a
                    horizontal position, but at times, when excited, it will go through a series of
                    fantastic performances, spreading its broad wings and tail so as to display
                    their beautiful markings. This species inhabits Guiana and the interior of
                    Brazil; but in Colombia and Central America occurs a larger and somewhat
                    differently coloured form which is known as <hi rend="italic">E. major.</hi></p>
                <p>For a long while it seemed as if <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga</hi> had no near
                    ally, but, on the colonization of New Caledonia by the French, an extremely
                    curious bird was found inhabiting most parts of that island, to which it is
                    peculiar. This the natives called the Kagu, and it is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rhinochetus jubatus</hi> of ornithology. Its original describers, MM. Jules
                    Verreaux and Des Murs, regarded it first as a Heron and then as a Crane <hi
                        rend="italic">(Rev. et Mag. de Zoologie,</hi> 1860, pp. 439-441, pl. 21;
                    1862, pp. 142-144); but, on Mr George Bennett sending two live examples to the
                    Zoological Gardens, Mr Bartlett quickly detected in them an affinity to <hi
                        rend="italic">Eurypyga (Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1862, pp. 218, 219, pl.
                    xxx.), and in due time anatomical investigation showed him to be right. The
                    Kagu, however, would not strike the ordinary observer as having much outward
                    resemblance to the Sun-Bittern, of which it has neither the figure nor posture.
                    It is rather a long-legged bird, about as large as an ordinary Fowl, walking
                    quickly and then standing almost motionless, with bright red bill and legs,
                    large eyes, a full pendent crest, and is generally of a light slate-colour,
                    paler beneath, and obscurely barred on its longer wing-coverts and tail with a
                    darker shade. It is only when it spreads its wings that these are seen to be
                    marked and spotted with white, rust-colour, and black, somewhat after the
                    pattern of those of the Sun-Bittern. Like that bird too, the Kagu will, in
                    moments of excitement, give up its ordinary placid behaviour and execute a
                    variety of violent gesticulations, some of them even of a more extraordinary
                    kind, for it will dance round, holding the tip of its tail or of one of its
                    wings in a way that no other bird is known to do. Its habits in its own country
                    were described at some length in 1863 by M. Jouan (<hi rend="italic">Mém. Soc.
                        Sc. Nat. Cherbourg,</hi> ix. pp. 97 and 235), and in 1870 by M. Marie <hi

                    of whom predicts the speedy extinction of this interesting form, a fate
                    foreboded also by the statement of Messrs Layard <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi>
                    1882, pp. 534, 535) that it has nearly disappeared from the neighbourhood of the
                    more settled and inhabited parts.</p>
                <p>The internal and external structure of both these remarkable forms has been
                    treated in much detail by Prof. Parker in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
