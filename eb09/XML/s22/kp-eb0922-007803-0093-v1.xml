                <p><label type="entry">SIMON MAGUS</label>. In the extant documents of the first
                    three centuries we meet with Simon Magus in a threefold aspect :—(1) as
                    Samaritan Messiah attempting by the aid of Christianity to establish a new
                    religion; (2) as founder of a school of Gnostics and as father of heresy; (3) as
                    a caricature of the apostle Paul. The Tübingen critics (Baur, Volkmar, Zeller,
                    Lipsius, and until the year 1878 Hilgenfeld also) have tried to show that the
                    oldest accounts are those in which Simon is represented in the last-named
                    aspect; they have accordingly denied his existence, maintaining that all the
                    features attributed to him in the oldest sources are accounted for by the life
                    and personality of Paul. In particular they would explain Simon’s visit to Rome
                    by the apostle’s journey thither, and further would have it that the church
                    tradition of Peter’s having gone to Rome arose solely out of the supposition
                    that the great apostle who had withstood the Paul-Simon everywhere else must
                    have followed up his<pb break="no"

                    According to this view, Simon Magus is an invention of the Jewish Christians, a
                    distorted Paul, whom the church at large partly accepted as historical and
                    partly catholicized, adding fresh touches to the picture of Simon, making him
                    the father of all the heresies, the head of all the magi, a pseudo-Messiah, and
                    so forth, but at last destroying the whole point of the story by adding that
                    Peter and Paul had jointly overcome the magian in Rome.</p>
                <p>Were this view of the Tübingen critics established, their whole conception of
                    apostolic and post-apostolic times would also be proved; it would have been made
                    out (1) that legends of an anti-Pauline tendency form the basis of the tradition
                    of the church; (2) that the Acts of the Apostles is a compromise, and rests upon
                    Jewish-Christian myths in part no longer understood; (3) that the ecclesiastical
                    tradition about Peter’s journeyings had its origin merely in those of Paul; and
                    (4) there would be established an indisputable example of the production of
                    biassed and fabricated history within primitive Christianity so remarkable that
                    upon the ground of it alone we should be justified in simply regarding the
                    greater part of the historical statements of the first two Christian centuries
                    as deliberate inventions.</p>
                <p>But on no other point are the proofs of the Tübingen school weaker than in this.
                    Only by inverting the historical order of the original documents, by dint of
                    violent assertion, and by declaring with reference to the most important
                    arguments that they existed in writings which now are lost, has it been possible
                    for them to give even the appearance of stability to their hypothetical
                    structure. The three assertions of the Tübingen critics—(1) that the written
                    sources of the pseudo-Clementine <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Recognitions</hi> go back to the 1st century, (2) that already
                    in these Paul has become distorted into Simon Magus and Peter is represented as
                    having combated the Simon-Paul in Rome, and (3) that the Acts of the Apostles,
                    Justin, and other church fathers in their statements about Simon and about
                    Peter’s stay in Rome depend upon these Jewish-Christian writings—can none of
                    them be proved. On the other hand,—apart from the Acts of the Apostles,—the
                    existence of a Samaritan magus, Simon, in apostolic times, as well as of a sect
                    of Simonians in the 2d century (in Samaria, and elsewhere in the Roman empire),
                    is quite conclusively attested through Justin Martyr, and also through Celsus,
                    Clement, Hippolytus, and Origen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            wished to gain disciples by his magical arts. His impositions were
                            virtually without result at the time, while at present, in my belief,
                            the number of his adherents throughout the world does not amount to
                            thirty. And perhaps this estimate is too high. At most there are only a
                            few in Palestine, while in the other parts of the world where he desired
                            to make his name illustrious it is quite unknown. Where it is known, the
                            fact is entirely due to the Acts of the Apostles. Christians alone still
                            speak of him.” Some would fain find a testimony in Josephus also; but
                            the Jewish conjurer Simon, of Cyprus, mentioned in <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ant.,</hi> xx. 7 has nothing whatever to do with the Samaritan.
                            Renan would recognize Simon Magus in the second beast of Rev. xiii.; but
                            this hypothesis is utterly baseless.</p></note> Even the Tübingen
                    critics themselves could . not deny the existence of a sect of Simonians; they
                    have therefore been obliged to advance the desperate theory that the sect arose
                    solely on the basis of the Jewish-Christian romance of Simon.</p>
                <p>The oldest account of Simon Magus occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. When Philip
                    the evangelist came to Samaria about 37 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> he found
                    a great religious movement going on. One named Simon had given himself out for
                    some great person, and by dint of his extraordinary works had stirred up and
                    gained over the whole popula∙ tion, who took him for the exalted manifestation
                    of the Divine Power itself. Philip converted the majority of Simon’s adherents;
                    and Simon himself, amazed at the deeds wrought by Philip, received baptism, and
                    joined the evangelist’s society. Peter and John then came to Samaris to impart
                    to the baptized the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; and Simon offered the
                    apostles money to invest him with a like power of conferring the gift. But Peter
                    sternly rebuked him, exhorting him to repent and beseech God that the evil
                    thought of his heart might be forgiven him. Simon thereupon begged the apostles
                    'to pray on his behalf. We have no means of checking this account, since we
                    possess no other independent source. The author of the Acts seems to have known
                    nothing of Simon Magus from other quarters, else he would hardly have closed the
                    narrative as we have it. Simon is not yet viewed as hostile to Christianity.
                    There is no justification for doubt as regards the main points of this account.
                    That in the fourth decade of the 1st century a pseudo-Messiah, named Simon,
                    appeared in Samaria; that he gained a considerable following; that he tried to
                    effect a union with the Christian missionaries, who, however, soon perceived his
                    real character and shook him off,—these facts must be treated as
                        historical.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same
                            historical certainty cannot be claimed for the meeting of Peter and
                            Simon, because in the Acts (ch. i.-xv. ) Peter is throughout pushed to
                            the front, and because the motive assigned for his journey to Samaria is
                            open to some suspicion. Still, the fact that even in the
                            Jewish-Christian Acts of the Apostles Peter and Simon have personal
                            dealings affords presumptive evidence that they did meet.</p></note>
                    They are vouched for by Justin, whose statement is not borrowed from the
                        Acts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Unfortunately,
                            Justin’s <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi> against the heretics, in which
                            he dealt at greater length with Simon, is no longer extant; we are
                            therefore limited to the meagre references in his <hi rend="italic"
                                >Apology</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dialogue,</hi> and the
                            statements of later writers who had read the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Syntagma.</hi></p></note> Justin, it is true, makes no direct
                    statement about any relations whatever between Simon and Christianity, but
                    represents him as one who gave himself out for God and as the founder of an
                    entirely new religion; but, since on the other hand he groups him with Menander
                    and Marcion, and thinks of him as the devil-sent father of heretics, it is plain
                    that he knew quite well of some relation between Simon and the Christians.</p>
                <p>The conception of Simon as the father of heresy within the church is in no way
                    suggested in the Acts; nor has Justin in the writings which we possess given any
                    hint of a reason why Simon should be viewed in such a light. But the testimony
                    of the Acts (viii. 13) that Simon received baptism, and for a while joined
                    himself to the Christians, enables us at least in some degree to understand how
                    he afterwards got the reputation alluded to. We shall see presently, moreover,
                    that Simon must have introduced certain Christian elements into his
                        teaching.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Justin
                            repeatedly and emphatically says that Simon pretended to be a god, and

                <p>Justin has a good deal more about Simon that is not to be found in Acts :—(1) he
                    gives his birthplace as Gittha in Samaria; (2) he states that Simon came to Rome
                    in the reign of Claudius, and there by his magical arts gained some followers,
                    and was taken for a god, and that a statue was erected to him on the Tiber
                    Island with the inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">simoni deo sancto;</hi> and (3)
                    he states that the adherents of Simon passed off a woman named Helena,<pb

                <p>As regards the first of these statements we may point to a Samaritan village
                    “Gît” (Karjet-Gît), not quite 3 miles south-south-west from the town of

                    other hand, the allegation that a statue was erected to Simon in Rome is not
                        authentic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A happy
                            accident of the rarest kind has put us in a position to correct Justin’s
                            statement. In 1574 a stone which had once served as the base of a statue
                            was dug out upon the Tiber Island. It bore the following inscription:
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">semoni banco deo . fidio sacrvm</hi> (see
                            Orelli, <hi rend="italic">Inscr.,</hi> vol. i. p. 337 n., 1860). “Semo
                            Sancus” is a Sabine god (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fash,</hi> vi. 213 <hi
                                rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Lactantius, <hi rend="italic">Inst.
                                Div.,</hi> i. c. 15). The inscription having been found in the very
                            place where, according to Justin, Simon’s statue must have stood, most
                            scholars suppose, and rightly, that Justin by mistake confounded “Semo
                            Sancus” with “Simon Sanctus.”</p></note> and consequently most critics
                    have regarded the narrative of Simon’s journey to Rome as legendary. Some
                    suppose that Justin was led only through the words of the inscription which he
                    has wrongly referred to Simon to believe that Simon himself was in Rome; others
                    (the Tübingen critics) think, on the contrary, that Justin had been already
                    acquainted with the Jewish-Christian Acts of the Apostles, and had thence
                    learned that Simon (Paul) had gone to Rome and that the inscription therefore
                    only confirmed him in the belief of Simon’s presence there. But in either case
                    the distinct assertion of Justin that Simon went to Rome in the time of Claudius
                    remains unexplained; for the hypothesis that Justin added the arrival of Simon
                    under Claudius because he already knew and credited the legend of Peter’s having
                    lived twenty-five years in Rome deserves no refutation. Consequently we may
                    assume—seeing there is absolutely no trace of any influence of the
                    Jewish-Christian legend upon Justin—that in the Roman community, in the time of
                    that author, a tradition was current that Simon Magus visited Rome in the reign
                    of Claudius. We are no longer in a position to test the trustworthiness of this
                    tradition; but, seeing there is no indication of any tendency out of which it
                    could have arisen, we have no ground for declaring it incredible. The fact
                    attested by Justin, Celsus, and Origen, that there were Simonians also beyond
                    the limits of Samaria <hi rend="italic">(ἐv ἄλλoις ἔθvεσιv),</hi> favours the
                    view that Simon had travelled. With reference, lastly, to the statement about
                    Helena, we have to observe that here Justin has reported a doctrine not of Simon
                    but of the Simonians. Simon, we are to understand, came to Rome with a woman
                    named Helena, and his adherents afterwards took her for the aeon mentioned.
                    Justin gave fuller accounts of Helena and the doctrines of the Simonians in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi>; and we know their substance from
                    Hegesippus, Irenaeus, Tertullian, pseudo-Tertullian, Epiphanius, and
                    Philastrius. Simon, it would appear, declared himself to be “the highest power
                    ”—the Supreme God Himself; he taught that among the Jews he manifested himself
                    as the Son, in Samaria as the Father, and among other nations as the Holy
                    Spirit. Helena, whom he had purchased in a brothel at Tyre, he gave out to be
                    his <hi rend="italic">πρώτη ἔvvoια,</hi> the mother of all, by whom he had
                    called the angels and archangels into being. She had proceeded from him, had
                    been initiated into his purposes, had voluntarily come down from heaven and
                    become the mother of the angels and powers who created this world; but after the
                    completion of her work she had been laid under bonds by her own children, the
                    world-creating angels, who desired to be independent, and who knew not the first
                    father Simon; they imprisoned her in a human body, and subjected her to every
                    affront; she had to migrate out of one body into another; she became, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that Helen on whose account the Trojan War was
                    waged; finally she found herself in a brothel, out of which Simon at length
                    rescued her, thereby fulfilling the parable of the lost sheep. The supreme
                    god—Simon—had come down in order to redeem his <hi rend="italic">πρώτη
                        ἔvvoια</hi>, and to bring salvation to all men through the knowledge of
                    himself. He decided upon this descent on seeing that the angels, from their
                    desire for supremacy, were in conflict with each other and were misgoverning the
                    worlds. He assumed every form necessary for the restoration of lost harmony: to
                    men he appeared as man, without being really a man, and in appearance he
                    suffered in Judaea. Henceforth it was a duty to believe in Simon and Helena, but
                    to disbelieve the prophets, who were inspired by the world-creating angels, and
                    not by Simon. Believers in Simon are at liberty to do what they will, for by the
                    grace of Simon should men be blessed—but not on account of good works. Should a
                    Simonian do anything wicked he is nevertheless undeserving of punishment, for he
                    is not wicked by nature but only of his free-will; the law proceeded from the
                    world-creating angels, who thought thereby to enslave their subjects; Simon,
                    however, will bring the world to nought along with the dominion of those angels,
                    and save all who Believe on him. To this it is added that the Simonians live
                    dissolutely, vie with each other in the practice of magic, make use of
                    exorcisms, charms, mystic formulas, &amp;c., and further that they worship
                    images of Simon (as Zeus) and of Helena (as Athene), under the names of “The
                    Lord” and “The Lady.”</p>

                            relations of Simon to other Samaritan pseudo-Messiahs, viz., to
                            Dositheus, Cleobulus, and Menander (see Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius,
                                <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> iv. 22); but the nature of its
                            statements can no longer be with certainty ascertained. We are in the
                            dark especially as to the relation between Simon and Dositheus. But the
                            mere fact that in Samaria, in the time of the apostles, so many Messiahs
                            purporting to be founders of religions should have appeared on the scene
                            is extremely interesting. It is a very noteworthy circumstance also that
                            Justin, Hegesippus, and Irenaeus knew nothing about Peter having met
                            Simon in Rome, and having withstood him there.</p></note> That we have
                    here before us, not the genuine teaching of Simon, but the gnosis of the</p>
                <p>Simonians is very evident; this gnosis, however, is just as much bound up with
                    the person of Simon as is the Christian gnosis with the person of Jesus Christ.
                    Simon is the manifested Deity Himself; but—and herein lies the Christian, or
                    more properly the anti-Christian element— Simon is at the same time represented
                    as Christ, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> is identified with Christ. The fusing
                    together of Simon and Christ, a syncretistic-gnostic conception of the world and
                    its creation, and an ethical antinomianism are the distinctive features of this
                    new universal religion. That we have here an attempt to found a new religion,
                    and that a world-religion, upon the principle of embodying all important
                    articles of the older ones, appears also from the fact that Simon is identified
                    not only with Christ but also with Zeus, and that Greek legends and mythologies
                    are utilized for the system. We have therefore in Simonianism a rival system to
                    Christianity, in which the same advantages are offered, and in which accordingly
                    Christian elements are embodied, even Christ Himself being identified with the
                    Supreme God (Simon). The attempt to establish such a system in that time of
                    religious syncretism has nothing incredible about it; and in view of the
                    religious conditions then prevailing in the locality it can easily be understood
                    that it proceeded from a Samaritan.<pb break="no"

                    who claimed to be a god and yet derived something from the Christian
                    missionaries; but the development was due to his followers in the 2d century,
                    who may have borne to the original Simonians exactly the same relation as did
                    the Valentinians to the first Christians. From the circles of these later
                    Simonians, who worshipped Simon especially under the mysterious name of “The

                    the title Ή <hi rend="italic">ἀποϕάσις ἡ μεγάλη,</hi> from which Hippolytus has
                    given us extracts in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophumena.</hi> From these it
                    appears—as indeed might have been expected from the statements of Irenaeus
                    (Justin)—that the later Simonianism combined the worship of Simon with a
                    complicated Gnostic system, for which it utilized the Greek mythology, as well
                    as isolated sayings of the Old Testament, of the Gospels, and of the apostolic
                    epistles. In point of form, design, medium, and relationship to Christianity,
                    Simonianism bears a striking resemblance to Manichaeism, which sprang up two
                    centuries later; but Mani did not so bluntly as Simon lay claim to be a god, and
                    the Manichaeans never had the hardihood to proceed to absolute identification of
                    Mani with Christ; as regards their tenets, however, and viewed as attempts to
                    found a universal religion, Simonianism and Manichaeism are widely
                    different.</p>
                <p>We can understand, then, how it was that the Christians in the 1st and 2d
                    centuries regarded Simon as the emissary of devils and the father of all heresy;
                    and we can also understand why—apart from Samaria—this effort to establish a new
                    religion bore little fruit. It rests upon falsifications and a wild jumbling of
                    religions, while it is lacking in religious elements of its own.</p>
                <p>Until about the year 220 ecclesiastical tradition knows Simon only as a
                    devil-inspired founder of a religion, and as father of heresy; it sees in him a
                    caricature of Christ, not of the apostle Paul, and it knows nothing about Peter
                    having again confuted him after what is narrated in Acts viii. It knows indeed
                    that Simon came to Rome in the time of Claudius, but previous to the 3d century
                    no ecclesiastical writer mentions his having met with Peter there, although all
                    state that Peter went to the capital. The first ecclesiastical author to combine
                    the two traditions was Hippolytus (<hi rend="italic">Philos.</hi>, vi. 20).
                    Having referred to the events narrated in Acts viii., he proceeds: “Simon even
                    went to Rome, and there met with the apostles. As he led many astray through his
                    sorceries, Peter frequently withstood him. He came at last . . .<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A hiatus occurs in the
                            text here.</p></note> and taught sitting under a plane-tree. When after
                    lengthened reasoning Simon was on the point of being worsted, he declared that
                    if he were to be buried alive he would on the third day rise again. He actually
                    caused a grave to be dug for him by his disciples, and gave orders that he
                    should be buried. The disciples did as they were bid; he remains in the grave,
                    however, unto this day, for he was not Christ.” This legend is found only in
                    Hippolytus; it evidently corresponds with the idea that Simon was a false
                    Christ, but has no relation whatever with the notion that he was Paul.
                    Hippolytus, moreover, does not say that in Rome Simon met with Peter only, but
                    with the apostles, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., with Paul and Peter. The origin
                    of the legend is very intelligible from what we know of the historical premises.
                    Given that Simon alleged himself to be Christ, that in Samaria he met with
                    Peter, that he as well as Peter afterwards travelled to Rome, then we can very
                    easily explain the origin of a legend which brings Peter once more into personal
                    contact with Simon in Rome, and alleges that Simon became the victim of his
                    nefarious mimicry of Christ.</p>
                <p>At the same time the expression <hi rend="italic">∏ρὸς Σίμωvα πολλὰ ∏έτρoς
                        ἐν</hi> Pώ <hi rend="italic">μη ἀνακατέστη</hi> makes it seem a probable
                    thing to many that Hippolytus already knew of that legend about Simon in which
                    the Tübingen critics think they have found the key to all traditions about him.
                    In the pseudo-Clementine <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Homilies,</hi> or rather in their documentary sources, Simon
                    plays a very important part. He appears as the representative of all possible
                    heresies, and as the great antagonist of Peter, who followed him up throughout
                    Samaria and the east coast of the Mediterranean, engaging him in great
                    disputations, and always coming off the victor. Some of the features attributed
                    in these legends to Simon are indisputably borrowed from the apostle Paul,
                    others from Marcion, others from Valentinus and Basilides. These legends
                    therefore arose in strict Jewish-Christian anti-Pauline circles; we find them,
                    however, in the <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Homilies</hi> already subjected to catholic revision. This revision cannot
                    have taken place before the first half of the 3d century, and probably is of
                    much later date. The age of the documentary sources cannot be exactly
                    determined; they may be very old; but what is of most importance is (1) that
                    their influence upon church tradition cannot be traced before the 3d century,
                    and (2) that in those Jewish-Christian sources, as well as in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Homilies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi>
                    themselves, only disputations between Peter and Simon in Samaria and adjacent
                    countries are narrated, nothing whatever being said of any controversies between
                    Simon and Peter in Rome. Even if, therefore, the Simon of the Jewish-Christians
                    bears unmistakable traces of Paul, it is also true on the other hand that these
                    Jewish-Christians knew nothing of a journey of Simon to Rome. Hence all the
                    combinations of the Tübingen critics as to the origin of the “Peter tradition,”
                    and as to the origin of the statement that Simon came to Rome, completely fall
                    to the ground. Hippolytus was the first to combine “Peter in Rome” and “Simon in
                    Rome,” without knowing anything whatever of a Simon-Paul legend. Not until after
                    his day, after the Jewish-Christian legends had become naturalized in the
                    catholic church through the medium of the <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Homilies,</hi> did these legends become current within the
                    church, and only there. It now began to be told that Paul and Peter<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic"
                                >Acta Pauli et Petri.</hi></p></note> had gone to Rome to withstand
                    Simon. Simon was now represented partly in accordance with those
                    Jewish-Christian legends, the tendency of which was not understood. Much,
                    however, that was new was added, such as that Simon appeared before the emperor,
                    that he miserably perished in attempting to fly, and so on. From the 3d (or
                    rather 4th) century the Simon of church tradition becomes invested with some
                    features of Paul in a distorted form. The <hi rend="italic">Recognitions,</hi>
                    as translated by Rufinus, were extensively read in the East, and, along with the
                    Acts of the Apostles, kept fresh the memory of the great magian and his Helena
                    in the Middle Ages. Simon also came to figure in popular literature. “Doctor
                    Faustus” has preserved several traits of the ancient magian. Neither are Pauline
                    characteristics wanting in the legendary Faustus; they are traceable even in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> of Goethe, the “homunculus” of the Simon-Faust
                    being originally a travesty of the “new man” who according to Paul is created
                    through the Gospel. It was not only as the great magian, however, that Simon
                    remained known to the Middle Ages, but also as the first who attempted to
                    purchase spiritual gifts with money, an association made permanent in the word
                    “simony.”</p>
