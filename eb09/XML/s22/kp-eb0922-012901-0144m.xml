                <p><label type="entry">SLAVERY</label>, . <hi rend="smallcaps">It appears to be true
                    that, in the words of Dunoyer, the economic régime of every society which has
                    recently become sedentary is founded on the slavery of the industrial
                    professions. In the hunter period the savage warrior does not enslave his
                    vanquished enemy, but slays him; the women of a conquered tribe he may, however,
                    carry off and appropriate as wives or as servants, for in this period domestic
                    labour falls almost altogether on their sex. In the pastoral stage slaves will
                    be captured only to be sold, with the exception of a few who may be required for
                    the care of flocks or the small amount of cultivation which is then undertaken.
                    It is in proportion as a sedentary life prevails, and agricultural exploitation
                    is practised on a larger scale, whilst warlike habits continue to exist, that
                    the labour of slaves is increasingly introduced to provide food for the master,
                    and at the same time save him from irksome toil. Of this stage in the social
                    movement slavery seems to have been, as we have said, a universal and inevitable
                    accompaniment.</hi></p>
                <p>But wherever theocratic organizations established themselves slavery in the
                    ordinary sense did not become a vital element in the social system. The members
                    of the lowest class were not in a state of individual subjection: the entire
                    caste to which they belonged was collectively subject. It is in the communities
                    in which the military order obtained an ascendency over the sacerdotal, and
                    which were directly organized for war, that slavery (as the word is commonly
                    understood) had its really natural and appropriate place. And, as war performed
                    an indispensable function in human history, our just horror for some aspects of
                    slavery must not prevent us from recognizing that institution as a necessary
                    step in social progress. It is not merely that in its first establishment
                    slavery was an immense advance by substituting for the immolation of captives,
                    often accompanied by cannibalism, their permanent occupation in labour for the
                    benefit of the victor. This advantage, recalled by an old though erroneous<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Servus</hi>
                    is not cognate with <hi rend="italic">servare,</hi> as has often been supposed;
                    it is really related to the Homeric <hi rend="italic">εἴρερoς</hi> and the verb
                    <hi rend="italic">εἴρω</hi>, with which the Latin <hi rend="italic">sero</hi> is
                    to be connected. It may be here mentioned that <hi rend="italic">slave</hi> was
                    originally a national name; it meant a man of Slavonic race captured and made a
                    bondman to the Germans. “From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in the state of
                    captives or subjects, . .. they [the Slavonians] overspread the land, and the
                    national appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Slaves</hi> has been degraded by
                    chance or malice from the signification of glory to that of servitude” (Gibbon,
                    <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall,</hi> ch. lv. ). The historian alludes to the
                    derivation of the national name from <hi rend="italic">slava,</hi> glory. See
                    Skeat’s <hi rend="italic">Etym. Dict., s.v.;</hi> see also Slavs. </p></note>
                    etymology, is generally acknowledged. But it is not so well understood that
                    slavery discharged important offices in the later social evolution—first, by
                    enabling military action to prevail with the degree of intensity and continuity
                    requisite for the system of incorporation by conquest which was its final
                    destination; and, secondly, by forcing the captives, who with their descendants
                    came to form the majority of the population in the conquering community, to an
                    industrial life, in spite of the antipathy to regular and sustained labour which
                    is deeply rooted in human nature, especially in the earlier stages of the social
                    movement, when insouciance is so common a trait, and irresponsibility is hailed
                    as a welcome relief. With respect to the latter consideration, it is enough to
                    say that nowhere has productive industry developed itself in the form of
                    voluntary effort; in every country of which we have any knowledge it was imposed
                    by the strong upon the weak, and was wrought into the habits of the people only
                    by the stern discipline of constraint. From the former point of view the
                    freeman, then essentially a warrior, and the slave were mutual auxiliaries,
                    simultaneously exercising different and complementary functions —each necessary
                    to the maintenance and furthering the activity of the other, and thus
                    co-operating, without competition or conflict, towards a common public end. In
                    modern slavery, on the other hand, where the occupations of both parties were
                    industrial, the existence of a servile class, instead of rendering the citizens
                    disposable for social service in a different field, only guaranteed for some of
                    them the possibility of self-indulgent ease, whilst it imposed on others the
                    necessity of indigent idleness.</p>
                <p>It was in the Roman state that military action—in Greece often purposeless and,
                    except in the resistance to Persia, on the whole fruitless—worked out the social
                    mission which formed its true justification. Hence at Rome slavery also most
                    properly found its place, so long as that mission was in progress of
                    accomplishment. As soon as the march of conquest had reached its natural limit,
                    slavery began to be modified; and when the empire was divided into the several
                    states which had grown up under it, and the system of defence characteristic of
                    the Middle Ages was substituted for the aggressive system of antiquity, slavery
                    gradually disappeared, and was replaced by serfdom, which again, with the rise
                    of modern industrial life, gave way to personal freedom.</p>
                <p>We have so far dealt with the <hi rend="italic">political</hi> results of ancient
                    slavery, and have found it to have been in certain respects not only useful but
                    indispensable. When we consider its moral effects, whilst endeavouring to the
                    utmost to avoid exaggeration, we must yet pronounce its influence to have been
                    profoundly detrimental. In its action on the slave it marred in a great measure
                    the happy effects of habitual industry by preventing the development of the
                    sense of human dignity which lies at the foundation of morals, whilst the
                    culture of his ideas and sentiments was in most cases entirely neglected, and
                    the spontaneous education arising from the normal family relations was too often
                    altogether denied him. On the morality of the masters— whether personal,
                    domestic, or social—the effects of the institution were disastrous. The habit of
                    absolute rule, always dangerous to our nature, was peculiarly corrupting when it
                    penetrated every department of daily life, and when no external interference
                    checked individual caprice in its action on the feelings and fortunes of
                    inferiors. It tended to destroy the power of self-command, and exposed the
                    master to the baneful influences of flattery. As regards domestic morality, the
                    system offered constant facilities for libertinism, and tended to subvert
                    domestic peace by compromising the just dignity and ruining the happiness of the
                    wife. The sons of the family were familiarized with vice, and the general tone
                    of feeling of the younger generation was lowered by their intimate association
                    with a despised and degraded class. On social morality, properly so called, the
                    habits of cruelty, or at least of harshness, engendered by the relation, had a
                    powerful reaction. Hume observes on “the little humanity commonly observed in
                    persons accustomed from their infancy to exercise so great authority over their
                    fellow-creatures and to trample upon human nature. . . . Nor,” he adds, “can a
                    more probable reason be assigned for the severe, I might say, barbarous manners
                    of ancient times than the practice of domestic slavery, by which every man of
                    rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated amidst the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0145-0130"/>flattery, submission, and low debasement of his
                    slaves.” These deplorable results were, of course, not universally produced;
                    there were admirable exceptions both amongst masters and amongst
                    slaves—instances of benevolent protection on the one side and of unselfish
                    devotion on the other, which did honour to human nature; but the evil effects
                    without doubt greatly preponderated.</p>
                <p>We proceed to a closer study of the institution of slavery as it existed in the
                    Greek and Roman societies respectively.</p>
                <p>We find it already fully established in the Homeric period. The prisoners taken
                    in war are retained as slaves, or sold (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi>., xxiv. 752)
                    or held at ransom (<hi rend="italic">Il</hi>., vi. 427) by the captor. Sometimes
                    the men of a conquered town or district are slain and the women carried off (<hi
                    rend="italic">Od.,</hi> ix. 40). Not unfrequently free persons were kidnapped by
                    pirates and sold in other regions, like Eumaeus in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi> The slave might thus be by birth of equal rank with his master,
                    who knew that the same fate might befall himself or some of the members of his
                    family. The institution does not present itself in a very harsh form in Homer,
                    especially if we consider (as Grote suggests) that “all classes were much on a
                    level in taste, sentiment, and instruction.” The male slaves were employed in
                    the tillage of the land and the tending of cattle, and the females in domestic
                    work and household manufactures. The principal slaves often enjoyed the
                    confidence of their masters and had important duties entrusted to them; and,
                    after lengthened and meritorious service, were put in possession of a house and
                    property of their own <hi rend="italic">{Od.,</hi> xiv. 64). Grote’s idea that
                    the women slaves were in a more pitiable condition than the males does not seem
                    justified, except perhaps in the case of the <hi rend="italic">aletrides,</hi>
                    who turned the household mills which ground the flour consumed in the family,
                    and who were sometimes overworked by unfeeling masters (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Od.,</hi> xx. 110-119). Part of the agricultural work was sometimes done by
                    poor hired freemen (<hi rend="italic">thetes),</hi> who are spoken of as a
                    wretched class (<hi rend="italic">Od.,</hi> xi. 490), and were perhaps employed
                    almost exclusively by the smaller landholders. Having no powerful protector to
                    whom they could look up, and depending on casual jobs, they were probably in a
                    less desirable position than the average slave. Homer conceives the lot of the
                    latter as a bitter one (<hi rend="italic">Od.,</hi> viii. 528; 77., xix. 302);
                    but it must be remembered that the element of change from a former elevated
                    position usually enters into his descriptions. He marks in a celebrated couplet
                    his sense of the moral deterioration commonly wrought by the condition of
                    slavery (<hi rend="italic">Od.,</hi> xvii. 322).</p>
                <p>It is, however, in historic Greece, where we have ample documentary information,
                    that it is most important to study the system of slavery,—and especially at
                    Athens, where the principal work of Greek civilization found its accomplishment.
                    The case of Sparta, in some respects peculiar, must be separately
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The sources of slavery in Greece were :—1. Birth, the condition being hereditary.
                    This was not an abundant source, women slaves being less numerous than men, and
                    wise masters making the union of the sexes rather a reward of good service than
                    a matter of speculation (Xen., <hi rend="italic">(Econ.,</hi> ix. 5). It was in
                    general cheaper to buy a slave than to rear one to the age of labour. 2. Sale of
                    children by their free parents, which was tolerated, except in Attica, or their
                    exposure, which was permitted, except at Thebes. The consequence of the latter
                    was sometimes to subject them to a servitude worse than death, as is seen in the
                    plays of Plautus and Terence, which, as is well known, depict Greek, not Roman,
                    manners. Freemen, through indigence, sometimes sold themselves, and at Athens,
                    up to the time of Solon, an insolvent debtor became the slave of his creditor.
                    3. Capture in war. Not only Asiatics and Thracians thus became slaves, but in
                    the many wars between Grecian states, continental or colonial, Greeks were
                    reduced to slavery by men of their own race. Thus Spartans were slaves at Tegea,
                    and Gelon sold out of their country the commonalty of Hybaean Megara. At
                    Plataea, at Scione, in Melos, the men were massacred or deported, the women
                    enslaved. Athenians were sold at Samos, and in Sicily after the failure of the
                    expedition. In the struggle of parties at Corcyra, each faction, when
                    triumphant, condemned the other to massacre or slavery. Callicratidas pronounced
                    against the enslavement of Greeks by Greeks, but violated his own principle, to
                    which, however, Epaminondas and Pelopidas appear to have been faithful. Philip
                    sold his Olynthian captives, and, after Thebes was taken by Alexander, 30,000
                    women and children are said to have been sold. 4. Piracy and kidnapping. The
                    descents of pirates on the coasts were a perpetual source of danger; the pirate
                    was a gainer either by the sale or by the redemption of his captives. If
                    ransomed, the victim became by Athenian law the slave of his redeemer till he
                    paid in money or labour the price which had been given for him. Kidnappers (<hi
                    rend="italic">andrapodistae)</hi> carried off children even in cities, and
                    reared them as slaves. Whether from hostile forays or from piracy, any Greek was
                    exposed to the risk of enslavement; it was a sword of Damocles suspended over
                    all heads. 5. Commerce. Besides the sale of slaves which took place as a result
                    of the capture of cities or other military operations, there was a systematic
                    slave trade. Syria, Pontus, Lydia, Galatia, and above all Thrace were sources of
                    supply. Egypt and Ethiopia also furnished a certain number, and Italy a few. Of
                    foreigners, the Asiatics bore the greatest value, as most amenable to command,
                    and most versed in the arts of luxurious refinement. But Greeks were highest of
                    all in esteem, and they were much sought for foreign sale. Greece proper and
                    Ionia supplied the petty Eastern princes with courtesans and female musicians
                    and dancers. Athens was an important slave-market, and the state profited by a
                    tax on the sales; but the principal marts were those of Cyprus, Samos, Ephesus,
                    and especially Chios.</p>
                <p>The slaves were employed either in domestic service—as household managers,
                    attendants, or personal escorts—or in work of other kinds, agricultural or
                    urban. In early Attica, and even down to the time of Pericles, the landowners
                    lived in the country. The Peloponnesian War introduced a change; and after that
                    time the proprietors resided at Athens, and the cultivation was in the hands of
                    slaves. In manufactures and commerce, also, servile gradually displaced free
                    labour. Speculators either directly employed slaves as artisans or commercial
                    and banking agents, or hired them out, sometimes for work in mines or factories,
                    sometimes for service in private houses, as cooks, flute-players, &amp;c., or
                    for viler uses. There were also public slaves; of these some belonged to
                    temples, to which they were presented as offerings, amongst them being the
                    courtesans who acted as <hi rend="italic">hierodules</hi> at Corinth and at Eryx
                    in Sicily; others were appropriated to the service of the magistrates or to
                    public works; there were at Athens 1200 Scythian archers for the police of the
                    city; slaves served, too, in the fleets, and were employed in the
                    armies,—commonly as workmen, and exceptionally as soldiers.</p>
                <p>The number of slaves in Greece, or even at Athens, can scarcely be determined
                    with any tolerable approach to certainty. It is stated by Athenaeus (vi. 20), on
                    the authority of Ctesicles, that the census of Demetrius Phalereus gave for
                    Athens 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics (resident foreigners), and 400,000 slaves.
                    It is also stated by the same author that Corinth had possessed 460,000 slaves
                    and Aegina 470,000. Hume, in his <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> “On the
                    Populousness of Ancient Nations,” maintained that the assertion of Athenaeus
                    respecting Athens is quite incredible,—that the number of Athenian slaves “is at
                    least augmented by a whole cipher, and ought not to be regarded as more than
                    40,000.” Boeckh and Letronne have since made the question the subject of fresh
                    studies. The former has fixed the number of Attic slaves at about 365,000, the
                    latter at 100,000 or 120,000. M. Wallon has revised the labours of these
                    scholars, and adduced further considerations of his own.<note anchored="true"

                    statement in Athenaeus. </p></note> He estimates the number of slaves employed
                    in all Attica in domestic service at 40,000; in agriculture at 35,000; in the
                    mines at 10,000; in manufactures and commerce at 90,000. To these must be added,
                    for old people and children under twelve years of age, 6000 and 20,000
                    respectively, and also the public slaves, of whom, as we have said, 1200 were
                    Scythian archers. He thus arrives at the conclusion that the servile population
                    of Attica was comprised between the limits of 188,000 and 203,000 souls, the
                    free population being about 67,000, and the metics amounting to 40,000. The
                    slaves thus bore to the free native population the ratio of 3 to 1. The numbers
                    given by Athenaeus for Corinth and Aegina, though accepted by Boeckh, appear to
                    be excessive, and are rejected by Clinton and by M. Wallon; the true numbers
                    were no doubt large, but we have no means of determining them even
                    approximately. Next after these cities in the magnitude of their slave
                    population came, on the mainland, Megara, and, amongst the insular states, Chios
                    and Rhodes. Miletus, Phocaea, Tarentum, Sybaris, and Cyrene also had numerous
                    bodies of slaves.</p>
                <p>The condition of slaves at Athens was not in general a wretched one. Demosthenes
                    (<hi rend="italic">In Mid.,</hi> p. 530) says that, if the barbarians from whom
                    the slaves were bought were informed of the mild treatment they received, they
                    would entertain a great esteem for the Athenians. Plautus in more than one place
                    thinks it necessary to explain to the spectators of his plays that slaves at
                    Athens enjoyed such privileges, and even licence, as must be surprising to a
                    Roman audience. The slave was introduced with certain customary rites into his
                    position in the family; he was in practice, though not by law, permitted to
                    accumulate a private fund of his own; his marriage was also recognized by
                    custom; though in general excluded from sacred ceremonies and public sacrifices,
                    slaves were admissible to religious associations of a private kind; there were
                    some popular festivals in which they were allowed to participate; they had even
                    special ones for themselves both at Athens and in other Greek centres. Their
                    remains were deposited in the family tomb of their master, who sometimes erected
                    monuments in testimony of his affection and regret. They often lived on terms of
                    intimacy either with the head of the house or its younger members; but it is to
                    be feared that too often this intimacy was founded, not<pb break="no"

                    Ulysses and Eumaeus, but on insolent self-assertion on the one side and a spirit
                    of unworthy compliance on the other, the latter having its <hi rend="italic"
                    >raison d’être</hi> in degrading services rendered by the slave. Aristophanes
                    and Plautus show us how often resort was had to the discipline of the lash even
                    in the case of domestic slaves. Those employed in workshops, whose overseers
                    were themselves most commonly of servile status, had probably a harder lot than
                    domestics; and the agricultural labourers were not unfrequently chained, and
                    treated much in the same way as beasts of burden. The displeasure of the master
                    sometimes dismissed his domestics to the more oppressive labours of the mill or
                    the mine. A refuge from cruel treatment was afforded by the temples and altars
                    of the gods and by the sacred groves. Nor did Athenian law leave the slave
                    without protection. He had, as Demosthenes boasts, an action for outrage like a
                    freeman, and his death at the hand of a stranger was avenged like that of a
                    citizen (Eurip., <hi rend="italic">Hec.,</hi> 288), whilst, if caused by his
                    master’s violence, it had to be atoned for by exile and a religious expiation.
                    Even when the slave had killed his master, the relatives of the house could not
                    themselves inflict punishment; they were obliged to hand him over to the
                    magistrate to be dealt with by legal process. The slave who had just grounds of
                    complaint against his master could demand to be sold; when he alleged his right
                    to liberty, the law granted him a defender and the sanctuaries offered him an
                    asylum till judgment should be given. Securities were taken against the revolt
                    of slaves by not associating those of the same nationality and language; they
                    were sometimes fettered to prevent flight, and, after a first attempt at escape,
                    branded to facilitate their recovery. There were treaties between states for the
                    extradition of fugitives, and contracts of mutual assurance between individuals
                    against their loss by flight. Their inclination to take advantage of
                    opportunities for this purpose is shown by the number that escaped from Athens
                    to join the Spartans when occupying Decelea. There were formidable revolts at
                    the mines of Laurium, and more than once in Chios. The evidence of slaves—women
                    as well as men—was often, with the consent of their masters, taken by torture;
                    and that method is generally commended by the orators as a sure means of
                    arriving at the truth, though sometimes, when it suits their immediate object,
                    they take a different tone. The several forms of the “question” are enumerated
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> of Aristophanes. If the slave was mutilated
                    or seriously injured in the process, compensation was made, not to him, but to
                    his master by the person who had demanded the use of torture.</p>
                <p>The slave could purchase his liberty with his peculium by agreement with his
                    master. He could be liberated by will, or, during his master’s life, by
                    proclamation in the theatre, the law courts, or other public places, or by
                    having his name inscribed in the public registers, or, in the later age of
                    Greece, by sale or donation to certain temples—an act which did not make the
                    slave a hierodule but a freeman. Conditions were sometimes attached to
                    emancipation, as of remaining for life or a definite time with the former
                    master, or another person named by him, or of performing some special service;
                    payments or rights of succession to property might also be reserved. By
                    manumission the Athenian slave became in relation to the state a metic, in
                    relation to his master a client. He was thus in an intermediate condition
                    between slavery and complete freedom. If the freedman violated his duties to his
                    patron he was subject to an action at law, and if the decision were against him
                    he was again reduced to slavery. He became a full member of the state only, as
                    in the case of foreigners, by a vote in an assembly of six thousand citizens;
                    and even this vote might be set aside by a <hi rend="italic">graphe
                    paranomon.</hi> Slaves who had rendered eminent services to the public, as those
                    who fought at Arginusae and at Chaeronea, were at once admitted to the status of
                    citizens in the class of (so-called) Plataeans. But it would appear that even in
                    their case some civic rights were reserved and accorded only to their children
                    by a female citizen. The number of freedmen at Athens seems never to have been
                    great.</p>
                <p>It is well known that Aristotle held slavery to be necessary and natural, and,
                    under just conditions, beneficial to both parties in the relation—views which
                    were correct enough from the political side, regard being had to the
                    contemporary social state. His practical motto, if he is the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Economics</hi> attributed to him, is—“no outrage, and no
                    familiarity.” There ought, he says, to be held out to the slave the hope of
                    liberty as the reward of his service. Plato condemned the practice, which the
                    theory of Aristotle also by implication sets aside as inadmissible, of Greeks
                    having Greeks for slaves. In the <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> he accepts the
                    institution as a necessary though embarrassing one, and recommends for the
                    safety of the masters that natives of different countries should be mixed and
                    that they should all be well treated. But, whilst condemning harshness towards
                    them, he encourages the feeling of contempt for them as a class. Xenophon also,
                    in urging a mild treatment of them, seems to have in view, not their own
                    well-being, but the security of the masters. The later moral schools of Greece
                    scarcely at all concern themselves with the institution.</p>
                <p>The Epicurean had no scruple about the servitude of those whose labours
                    contributed to his own indulgence and tranquillity; he would at most cultivate
                    an easy temper in his dealings with them. The Stoic regarded the condition of
                    freedom or slavery as an external accident, indifferent in the eye of wisdom; to
                    him it was irrational to see in liberty a ground of pride or in slavery a
                    subject of complaint; from intolerable indignity suicide was an ever-open means
                    of escape. The poets—especially the authors of the New Comedy—strongly inculcate
                    humanity, and insist on the fundamental equality of the slave. The celebrated
                    “homo sum” is a translation from Alexis, and the spirit of it breathes in many
                    passages of the Greek drama. A fragment of Philemon declares, as if in reply to
                    Aristotle, that not nature, but fortune, makes the slave. Euripides, as might be
                    expected from his humanitarian cast of sentiment, and the “premature modernism”
                    which has been remarked in him, rises above the ordinary feelings of his time in
                    regard to the slaves. As Mr Paley says, he loves "to record their fidelity to
                    their masters, their sympathy in the trials of life, their gratitude for
                    kindness and considerate treatment, and their pride in bearing the character of
                    honourable men. . . . He allows them to reason, to advise, to suggest; and he
                    even makes them philosophize on the follies and the indiscretions of their
                    superiors” (compare <hi rend="italic">Med.,</hi> 54; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orest.,</hi> 869; <hi rend="italic">Hel.,</hi> 728; <hi rend="italic">Ion,</hi>
                    854; <hi rend="italic">Frag. Melam,</hi> 506; <hi rend="italic">Phrix.,</hi>
                    823). But we are not to suppose that even he, latitudinarian and innovator as he
                    was, could have conceived the possibility of abolishing an institution so deeply
                    rooted in the social conditions, as well as in the ideas, of his time.</p>
                <p>The case of the Helots of Laconia was different from that of the slaves in most
                    Grecian communities. The origin of this class is disputed, and we cannot here
                    enter into the controversy. They were regarded as the property of the state,
                    which gave their services to individuals but kept in its own hands the power of
                    emancipating them. The domestic servants of the Spartans were all Helots, and
                    they waited on their masters at the <hi rend="italic">syssitia</hi> or public
                    meal. But they were in the main serfs, living in small country villages or in
                    detached farms, cultivating the lands of the Spartan proprietors, and paying to
                    those proprietors a proportion of the produce which could not be increased. They
                    enjoyed their homes, wives, and families, could acquire property, were not to be
                    sold out of the country, and perhaps could not be sold at all. They were,
                    doubtless, employed in public works; in war they commonly acted as light-armed
                    troops attending on the Spartan or Perioecic hoplites, but in particular
                    emergencies themselves served as hoplites (Thucyd., iv. 80). They were sometimes
                    rewarded for good service by emancipation, which, however, did not make them
                    Perioeci, but introduced them into a special class known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >neodamodeis.</hi> The condition of the Helot does not seem to have been
                    economically onerous; but his consciousness of Grecian lineage, which Grote
                    regards as an alleviation of his lot, must surely have been one of its bitterest
                    elements, whilst it constantly kept alive the fear and consequent hatred of his
                    Spartan masters, and made the relation between the two classes less natural than
                    that of the ordinary Greek masters with slaves of foreign and less civilized
                    races. By the ruling powers of Sparta the Helots were never trusted, and in one
                    memorable case some two thousand of them, selected for special military merit,
                    were massacred in secret (Thucyd., iv. 80). According to Plutarch, whose
                    statement, however, has not always been credited, the ephors declared war
                    against the Helots every year, and there was a practice, known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">kryρteia,</hi> of detailing a number of young Spartan citizens for
                    the purpose of assassinating such of them as were considered formidable. Wallon
                    estimates the number of the Helots at 220,000, that of the Spartans being
                    32,000. The Penestae in Thessaly and the Clarotae in Crete seem to have occupied
                    a position somewhat similar to that of the Helots in Laconia.</p>
                <p>We have already observed that the Roman system of life was that in which slavery
                    had its most natural and relatively legitimate place; and accordingly it was at
                    Rome that, as Blair has remarked, the institution was more than anywhere else
                    “extended in its operation and methodized in its details.” Not only on this
                    ground is it especially deserving of our study, but because out of the
                    slave-class, as it was organized by the Romans in the countries subject to the
                    empire, the modern proletariate has been historically evolved.</p>
                <p>We must distinguish from the later slavery at Rome what Mommsen calls “the old,
                    in some measure innocent” slavery, under which the farmer tilled the land along
                    with his slave, or, if he possessed more land than he could manage, placed the
                    slave— either as a steward, or as a sort of lessee obliged to render up a
                    portion of the produce—over a detached farm. Though slaves were obtained by the
                    early victories of Rome over her Italian neighbours, no large number was
                    employed on the small holdings of those periods. But the extension of properties
                    in the hands of the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0147-0132"/>patricians, and the continual absences of citizens
                    required by the expanding system of conquest, necessarily brought with them a
                    demand for slave labour, which was increasingly supplied by captives taken in
                    war. Of the number furnished from this source a few particulars from the time of
                    the mature republic and the first century of the empire will give some idea. In
                    Epirus, after the victories of Aemilius Paullus, 150,000 captives were sold. The
                    prisoners at Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae were 90,000 Teutons and 60,000 Cimbri.
                    Caesar sold on a single occasion in Gaul 63,000 captives; Augustus made 44,000
                    prisoners in the country of the Salassi; after immense numbers had perished by
                    famine and hardship and in the combats of the arena, 97,000 slaves were acquired
                    by the Jewish war. But slavery, as Hume has shown, is unfavourable to
                    population, and even the wars of Rome were insufficient to maintain the supply.
                    Hence a regular commerce in slaves was established, which was based on the
                    “systematically-prosecuted hunting of man,” and indicated an entire perversion
                    of the primitive institution, which was essentially connected with conquest. The
                    pirates sold great numbers of slaves at Delos, where was the chief market for
                    this kind of wares; and these sales went on as really, though more obscurely,
                    after the successful expedition of Pompey. There was a regular importation at
                    Rome of slaves, brought to some extent from Africa, Spain, and Gaul, but chiefly
                    from Asiatic countries—Bithynia, Galatia, Cappadocia, and Syria. A
                    portorium—apparently one-eighth for eunuchs, one-fortieth for others—was paid on
                    their import or export, and a duty of 2 or 4 per cent. on their sale.</p>
                <p>There were other sources from which slavery was alimented, though of course in a
                    much less degree. Certain offences reduced the guilty persons to slavery <hi
                    rend="italic">(servi poenae),</hi> and they were employed in public work in the
                    quarries or the mines. Originally, a father could sell his children. A creditor
                    could hold his insolvent debtor as a slave, or sell him out of the city <hi
                    rend="italic">(trans Tiberim).</hi> The enslavement of creditors, overwhelmed
                    with usury in consequence of losses by hostile raids or their own absence on
                    military service, led to the revolt of the Mons Sacer (493 b.c.). The Poetelian
                    law (326 b.c.) restricted the creditor’s lien (by virtue of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >nexum)</hi> to the goods of his debtor, and enacted that for the future no
                    debtor should be put in chains; but we hear of debtors <hi rend="italic"
                    >addicti</hi> to their creditors by the tribunals long after—even in the time of
                    the Punic Wars.</p>
                <p>There were <hi rend="italic">servi publici</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic"
                    >privati.</hi> The service of the magistrates was at first in the hands of
                    freemen; but the lower offices, as of couriers, servants of the law courts, of
                    prisons, and of temples, were afterwards filled by slaves. The execution of
                    public works also came to be largely committed to them,—as the construction of
                    roads, the cleansing of the sewers, and the maintenance of the aqueducts. Both
                    kinds of functions were discharged by slaves, not only at Rome, but in the rural
                    and provincial municipalities. The slaves of a private Roman were divided
                    between the <hi rend="italic">familia rustica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >familia urbana.</hi> At the head of the <hi rend="italic">familia rustica</hi>
                    was the <hi rend="italic">villicus,</hi> himself a slave, with the wife who was
                    given him at once to aid him and to bind him to his duties. Under him were the
                    several groups employed in the different branches of the exploitation and the
                    care of the cattle and flocks, as well as those who kept or prepared the food,
                    clothing, and tools of the whole staff and those who attended on the master in
                    the various species of rural sports. A slave prison <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ergastulum)</hi> was part of such an establishment, and there were slaves
                    whose office it was to punish the offences of their fellows. To the <hi
                    rend="italic">familia urbana</hi> belonged those who discharged the duties of
                    domestic attendance, the service of the toilet, of the bath, of the table, of
                    the kitchen, besides the entertainment of the master and his guests by dancing,
                    singing, and other arts. There were, besides, the slaves who accompanied the
                    master and mistress out of doors, and who were chosen for their beauty and grace
                    as guards of honour, for their strength as chairmen or porters, or for their
                    readiness and address in remembering names, delivering messages of courtesy, and
                    the like. There were also attached to a great household physicians, artists,
                    secretaries, librarians, copyists, preparers of parchment, as well as pedagogues
                    ,and preceptors of different kinds,—readers, grammarians, men of letters and
                    even philosophers,—all of servile condition, besides accountants, managers, and
                    agents for the transaction of business. Actors, comic and tragic, pantomimi, and
                    the performers of the circus were commonly slaves, as were also the gladiators.
                    These last were chosen from the most warlike races—as the Samnites, Gauls, and
                    Thracians. <hi rend="italic">Familiae</hi> of gladiators were kept by private
                    speculators, who hired them out; they were sometimes owned by men of high
                    rank.</p>
                <p>As to the numbers of slaves belonging to individual masters, though we have no
                    distinct general statement in the Roman writers, several special examples and
                    other indirect indications serve to show that the wealthier men possessed very
                    large <hi rend="italic">familiae.</hi> This may be inferred from the <hi
                    rend="italic">columbaria</hi> of the house of Livia and of other great houses.
                    Vettius armed four hundred of his own slaves when he entered on the revolt which
                    was a prelude to the Second Servile War. The slaves of Pedanius Secundus, who,
                    in spite of a threatened outbreak of the indignant populace, were all put to
                    death because they had been under their master’s roof when he was murdered, were
                    four hundred in number. Pliny tells us that Caecilius, a freedman of the time of
                    Augustus, left by his will as many as 4116. The question as to the total number
                    of slaves at Rome or in Italy is a very difficult one, and it is not, perhaps,
                    possible to arrive with any degree of certainty at an approximate estimate.
                    Gibbon supposes that there were in the Roman world in the reign of Claudius at
                    least as many slaves as free inhabitants. But Blair seems right in believing
                    that this number, though probably correct for an earlier period, is much under
                    the truth for the age to which it is assigned. He fixes the proportion of slaves
                    to free men as that of three to one for the time between the conquest of Greece
                    (146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) and the reign of Alexander Severus (222-235
                    a.d.). The entire number of slaves in Italy would thus have been, in the reign
                    of Claudius, 20,832,000, that of the free population being 6,944,000.</p>
                <p>By the original Roman law the master was clothed with absolute dominion over the
                    slave, extending to the power of life and death, which is not surprising when we
                    consider the nature of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas.</hi> The slave
                    could not possess property of any kind; whatever he acquired was legally his
                    master’s. He was, however, in practice permitted to enjoy and accumulate chance
                    earnings or savings, or a share of what he produced, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">peculium.</hi> A master could not enter into a contract with his
                    slave, nor could he accuse him of theft before the law; for, if the slave took
                    anything, this was not a subtraction, but only a displacement, of property. The
                    union of a male and female slave had not the legal character of a marriage; it
                    was a cohabitation <hi rend="italic">(contubernium)</hi> merely which was
                    tolerated, and might be terminated at will, by the master; a slave was,
                    therefore, not capable of the crime of adultery. Yet general sentiment seems to
                    have given a stronger sanction to this sort of connexion; the names of husband
                    and wife are freely used in relation to slaves on the stage, and even in the
                    laws, and in the language of the tombs. For entering the military service or
                    taking on him any state office a slave was punished with death. He could not in
                    general be examined as a witness, except by torture. A master, when accused,
                    could oiler his slaves for the “question,” or demand for the same purpose the
                    slaves of another; and, if in the latter case they were injured or killed in the
                    process, their owner was indemnified. A slave could not accuse his master,
                    except of adultery or incest (under the latter name being included the violation
                    of sacred things or places); the case of high treason was afterwards added to
                    these. An accused slave could not invoke the aid of the tribunes. The penalties
                    of the law for crime were more severe on guilty slaves than on freemen; “majores
                    nostri,” say the legists, “in omni supplicio severius servos quam liberos
                    punierunt.” The capital punishment of the freeman was by the sword or the
                    precipice,—of the slave by the axe or the cross. The lex Cornelia punished the
                    murder of a slave or a freeman alike; but the master who killed his own slave
                    was not affected by this law.</p>
                <p>Columella, like Xenophon, favours a certain friendliness and familiarity in one’s
                    intercourse with his farm slaves. Cato ate and drank the same coarse victuals as
                    his slaves, and even had the children suckled by his wife, that they might
                    imbibe a fondness for the family. But that rigid old economist had a strict eye
                    to profit in all his dealings with them. He allowed the contubernium of male and
                    female slaves at the price of a money payment from their peculium. Columella
                    regarded the gains from the births as a sufficient motive for encouraging these
                    unions, and thought that mothers should be rewarded for their fecundity; Varro,
                    too, seems to have taken this view. The immense extension of the rural estates
                    <hi rend="italic">(latifundia)</hi> made it impossible for masters to know their
                    slaves, even if they were disposed to take trouble for the purpose. Effective
                    superintendence even by overseers became less easy; the use of chains was
                    introduced, and these were worn not only in the field during working hours but
                    at night in the ergastulum where the labourers slept—a practice which Pliny
                    lamented as a disgrace to agriculture. Urban slaves had probably often a life as
                    little enviable, especially those who worked at trades for speculators. Even in
                    private houses at Rome, so late as the time of Ovid, the porter was chained. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">familia urbana</hi> the favourites of the master had good
                    treatment, and might exercise some influence over him which would lead to their
                    receiving flattery and gifts from those who sought his vote or solicited his
                    support. Doubtless there was often genuine mutual affection; slaves sometimes,
                    as in noted instances during the civil wars, showed the noblest spirit of
                    devotion to their masters. Those who were not inmates of the household, but were
                    employed outside of it as keepers of a shop or boat, chiefs of workshops, or
                    clerks in a mercantile business, had the advantage of greater freedom of action.
                    The slaves of the <hi rend="italic">leno</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lanista</hi> were probably in most cases not only degraded but unhappy. The
                    lighter punishments inflicted by masters were commonly personal chastisement or
                    banishment from the town house to rural labour; the severer were employment in
                    the mill <hi rend="italic">(pistrinum)</hi> or relegation to the mines or<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0148-0133"/>quarries. To the mines speculators also sent
                    slaves; they worked half-naked, men and women, in chains, under the lash and
                    guarded by soldiers. Vedius Pollio, in the time of Augustus, was said to have
                    thrown his slaves, condemned sometimes for trivial mistakes or even accidents,
                    to the lampreys in his fishpond. Cato advised the agriculturist to sell his old
                    oxen and his old slaves, as well as his sick ones; and sick slaves were exposed
                    in the island of Aesculapius in the Tiber; by a decree of Claudius slaves so
                    exposed, if they recovered, could not be reclaimed by their masters.</p>
                <p>Though the Roman slaves were not, like the Spartan Helots, kept obedient by
                    systematic terrorism, their large numbers were a constant source of solicitude
                    in the later period of the republic and under the early empire. The law under
                    which the slaves of Pedanius were put to death, probably first made under
                    Augustus and more fully enacted under Nero, is sufficient proof of this anxiety,
                    which indeed is strongly stated by Tacitus in his narrative of the facts. There
                    had been many conspiracies amongst the slaves in the course of Roman history,
                    and some formidable insurrections. We hear of a conspiracy about 500 b. c. and
                    another in 419 b.c.; again just before the sea-fight of Duilius and between the
                    battles of Trasimenus and Cannae. In 198 b.c. a servile war had almost broken
                    out; in 196 b.c. there was a rising in Etruria and in 185 b.c. in Apulia. The
                    growth of the latifundia made the slaves more and more numerous and formidable.
                    Free labour was discountenanced. Cato, Varro, and Columella all agree that slave
                    labour was to be preferred to free except in unhealthy regions and for large
                    occasional operations, which probably transcended the capacity of the permanent
                    <hi rend="italic">familia rustica.</hi> Cicero and Livy bear testimony to the
                    disappearance of a free plebs from the country districts and its replacement by
                    gangs of slaves working on great estates. The policy of the Gracchi and their
                    successors of the popular party was opposed to this reduction of the free
                    working population, which they sought to counteract by agrarian laws and by
                    colonization on a large scale—projects which could not be effectively carried
                    out until civil supremacy was united with military power in the hands of a
                    popular chief, and which, even when this condition was satisfied by the
                    establishment of the empire, were inadequate to meet the evil. The worst form of
                    praedial slavery existed in Sicily, whither Mommsen supposes that its peculiarly
                    harsh features had been brought by the Carthaginians. In Sicily, accordingly,
                    the first really serious servile insurrections took place, at once provoked by
                    the misery of the slaves and facilitated by the habits of brigandage which, it
                    is said, the proprietors had tolerated and even encouraged as lightening the
                    cost of subsistence of their slaves. The rising under Eunus in 133 b.c. was with
                    some difficulty suppressed by Rupilius. Partial revolts in Italy succeeded; and
                    then came the second Sicilian insurrection under Trypho and Athenio, which,
                    after a severe struggle, was put down by Aquilius. These were followed by the
                    Servile War in Italy under Spartacus, which, occurring at an otherwise critical
                    period, severely tested the military resources of Rome. In the subsequent civil
                    conflicts the aid of slaves was sought by both parties, even by Marius himself,
                    and afterwards by Catiline, though he finally rejected their services. Clodius
                    and Milo employed bands of gladiators in their city riots, and this action on
                    the part of the latter was approved by Cicero. In the First Civil War they were
                    to be found in both camps, and the murderers of Caesar were escorted to the
                    Capitol by gladiators. Antony, Octavius, and Sextus Pompeius employed them in
                    the Second Civil War; and it is recorded by Augustus on the Monumentum Ancyranum
                    that he gave back to their masters for punishment about 30,000 slaves who had
                    absconded and borne arms against the state. Under Tiberius, at the death of
                    Caligula, and in the reign of Nero there were threatening movements of the
                    slaves. In the wars from Otho to Vespasian they were employed, as Tacitus tells
                    us, even by the most scrupulous generals.</p>
                <p>Of the moral influences of slavery we have already spoken. In the particular case
                    of Rome it cannot be doubted that it largely contributed to the impurities which
                    disgraced private life, as seen in the pages of Juvenal, Martial, and Petronius.
                    It is shocking to observe the tone in which Horace, so characterized by
                    geniality and bonhomie, speaks of the subjection of slaves to the brutal
                    passions of their masters <hi rend="italic">(Sat.,</hi> i. 2, 116). The
                    hardening effect of the system appears perhaps most strikingly in the barbarous
                    spectacles of the amphitheatre, in which even women took pleasure and joined in
                    condemning the gladiator who did not by his desperate courage satisfy the
                    demands of a sanguinary mob. It led, further, to a contempt for industry, even
                    agriculture being no longer held in esteem (“quum sit publice accepta et
                    confirmata jam vulgaris existimatio, rem rusticam sordidum opus,” Col., i.,
                    praef. 20). The existence of slavery, degrading free labour while competing with
                    freemen for urban employment, multiplied the idle and worthless population of
                    Rome, who sought only “panem et circenses.” These had to be supported by public
                    distributions, which the emperors found they could not discontinue, and by the
                    bounty of patrons, and, like the “mean whites” of modern America, formed a
                    dangerous class, purchasable by selfish ambitions and ready to aid in civil
                    disturbances.</p>
                <p>Blair, in comparing the Greek and Roman systems of slavery, points with justice
                    to the greater facility and frequency of emancipation as the great superiority
                    of the latter. No Roman slave, he says, “needed to despair of becoming both a
                    freeman and a citizen.” Manumission was of two kinds— <hi rend="italic"
                    >justa</hi> or regular, and <hi rend="italic">minus justa.</hi> Of <hi
                    rend="italic">manumissio justa</hi> there were four modes :— (1) by adoption,
                    rarely resorted to; (2) by testament, already recognized in the Twelve Tables;
                    (3) by <hi rend="italic">census</hi>, which was of exceptional use, and did not
                    exist later than the time of Vespasian; and (4) by <hi rend="italic"
                    >vindicta</hi>, which was the usual form. In the last method the master turned
                    the slave round, with the words “liber esto,” in the presence of the praetor,
                    that officer or his lictor at the same time striking the slave with his rod. The
                    <hi rend="italic">manumissio minus justa</hi> was effected by a sufficient
                    manifestation of the will of the master, as by letter, by words, by putting the
                    <hi rend="italic">pileus</hi> (or cap of liberty) on the slave, or by any other
                    formality which had by usage become significant of the intention to liberate, or
                    by such an act as making the slave the guardian of his children. This
                    extra-legal sort of manumission was incomplete and precarious; even after the
                    lex Julia Norbana (19 a.d.), which assimilated the position of those so
                    liberated to that of the Latin colonists, under the name of Latini juniores, the
                    person remained in the eye of the law a slave till his death and could not
                    dispose of his peculium.</p>
                <p>A freedman, unless he became such by operation of law, remained client of his
                    master, and both were bound by the mutual obligations arising out of that
                    relation. These obligations existed also in the case of freedmen of the state,
                    of cities, temples, and corporations. The freedman took his former master’s
                    name; he owed him deference <hi rend="italic">(obsequium)</hi> and aid <hi
                    rend="italic">(officium)·,</hi> and neglect of these obligations was punished,
                    in extreme cases even with loss of liberty. Conditions might be annexed by the
                    master to the gift of freedom, as of continued residence with him, or of general
                    service or some particular duty to be performed, or of a money payment to be
                    made. But the praetor Rutilius, about the beginning of the 1st century b.c.,
                    limited the excessive imposition of such conditions, and his restrictions were
                    carried further by the later jurists and the imperial constitutions. Failing
                    natural heirs of an intestate freedman, the master, now patron, succeeded to his
                    property at his death; and he could dispose by will of only half his
                    possessions, the patron receiving the other half. Freedmen and their sons were
                    subject to civil disabilities; the third generation became <hi rend="italic"
                    >ingenua</hi> (full citizens). Thus, by a process of constant infiltration, the
                    slave element tended to merge itself in the general popular body; and Scipio
                    Aemilianus could reply to the murmurs of a plebeian crowd, “Taceant quibus
                    Italia noverca est; non efficietis ut solutos verear quos alligatos adduxi”
                    (Val. Max., vi. 2, 3).</p>
                <p>It was often a pecuniary advantage to the master to liberate his slave; he
                    obtained a payment which enabled him to buy a substitute, and at the same time
                    gained a client. This of course presupposes the recognition of the right of the
                    slave to his peculium; and the same is implied in Cicero’s statement that a
                    diligent slave could in six years purchase his freedom. Augustus set himself
                    against the undue multiplication of manumissions, probably considering the rapid
                    succession of new citizens a source of social instability, and recommended a
                    similar policy to his successor. The lex Aelia Sentia (about 3 a.d.) forbade
                    manumission, except in strictly limited cases, by masters under 20 years of age
                    or of slaves under 30; and the lex Furia Caninia (about 7 a.d.) fixed the
                    proportion of a man’s slaves which he could liberate by testament, and forbade
                    more than a hundred being so enfranchised whatever might be the number of the
                    familia. Under the empire the freedmen rose steadily in influence; they became
                    admissible to the rank of equites and to the senate; they obtained provincial
                    governments, and were appointed to offices in the imperial household which
                    virtually placed them at the head of administrative departments. Pallas and
                    Narcissus are familiar types of the unworthy members of this class, and there
                    were doubtless many outside of official life who exhibited the ostentation and
                    insolence of the parvenu; but there were others who were highly deserving of
                    esteem. Freedmen of humbler rank filled the minor offices in the administrative
                    service, in the city cohorts, and in the army; and we shall find that they
                    entered largely into the trades and professions when free labour began to
                    revive. They appeared also in literature; we hear of several historical and
                    biographical memoirs by freedmen under the republic and the early empire; many
                    of them were professors of grammar and the kindred arts, as Tiro, the amanuensis
                    of Cicero, and Hyginus, the librarian of Augustus; and names of a higher order
                    are those of Livius Andronicus, Caecilius, Statius, Terence, Publius Syrus,
                    Phaedrus, and Epictetus.</p>
                <p>In the 2d century of the Christian era we find a marked change with respect to
                    the institution of slavery, both in the region of thought and in that of law.
                    Already the principles of reason and humanity had been applied to the subject by
                    Seneca who, what-<pb break="no"

                    gratitude for the just and liberal sentiments he expressed respecting the
                    slaves, who, he says, should be treated as “humble friends,” and especially for
                    his energetic reprobation of gladiatorial combats and of the brutality of the
                    public who enjoyed those sanguinary shows. But it was in the 2d century, as we
                    have said, that “the victory of moral ideas” in this, as in other departments of
                    life became “decisive. . . . Dio Chrysostom, the adviser of Trajan, is the first
                    Greek writer who has pronounced the principle of slavery to be contrary to the
                    law of nature” (Mark Pattison). And a parallel change is found in the practical
                    policy of the state. The military vocation of Rome was now felt to have reached
                    its normal limits; and the emperors, understanding that, in the future,
                    industrial activity must prevail, prepared the abolition of slavery as far as
                    was then possible, by honouring the freedmen, by protecting the slave against
                    his master, and by facilitating manumissions. The jurists who, in the absence of
                    a recognized spiritual power, provisionally discharged in their own way the
                    office of systematizing practical morals, modified, by means of the useful
                    fiction of the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">naturale,</hi> the
                    presumptions of law and the interpretation of doubtful instruments. (“Quod ad
                    jus naturale attinet, omnes homines aequales sunt ”—Ulpian. "Servitus est
                    constitutio juris gentium, qua quis dominio alieno contra naturam
                    subjicitur”—Florentinus.) The general tendency both of the imperial
                    constitutions and of the maxims of the legists is in favour of liberty. ( “Nec
                    ignotum est quod multa contra juris rigorem pro libertate sint constituta
                    ”—Ulpian. ) The practices of exposure and sale of children, and of giving them
                    in pledge for debt, are forbidden. An edict of Diocletian forbade a free man to
                    sell himself. Manstealers or kidnappers (<hi rend="italic">plagiarii)</hi> were
                    punished with death. The insolvent debtor was withdrawn from the yoke of his
                    creditor. While the slave trade was permitted, the atrocious mutilation of boys
                    and young men, too often practised, was punished with exile and even with death.
                    In redhibitory actions (for the annulment of sales), if a slave were returned to
                    the seller, so must also be his parents, brothers, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >personae contubernio conjunctae.</hi> In the interpretation of testaments it
                    was to be assumed that members of the same family were not to be separated by
                    the division of the succession. The law also favoured in special cases the
                    security of the peculium, though in general principle it still remained the
                    property of the master. The state granted to public slaves the right of
                    bequeathing half their possessions; and private persons sometimes permitted
                    similar dispositions even to a greater extent, though only within the familia.
                    Hadrian took from masters the power of life and death and abolished the
                    subterranean prisons. Antoninus Pius punished him who killed his own slave as if
                    he had killed another’s. Already in the time of Nero the magistrates had been
                    ordered to receive the slave’s complaint of ill-treatment; and the lex Petronia,
                    belonging to the same or an earlier period, forbade masters to hand over their
                    slaves to combats with wild beasts. Antoninus directed that slaves treated with
                    excessive cruelty, who had taken refuge at an altar or imperial image, should be
                    sold; and this provision was extended to cases in which the master had employed
                    a slave in a way degrading to him or beneath his character. M. Aurelius gave to
                    masters an action against their slaves for any cause of complaint, thus bringing
                    their relation more directly under the surveillance of law and public opinion. A
                    slave’s oath could still not be taken in a court of law; he was interrogated by
                    the “question”; but the emperors and jurists limited in various ways the
                    application of torture, adding, however, as we have mentioned, to the cases in
                    which it could previously be appealed to that of the crime of <hi rend="italic"
                    >majestas.</hi> For certain alleged offences of the master the slave could bring
                    an action, being represented for the purpose by an <hi rend="italic"
                    >adsertor.</hi> Emancipation was facilitated; some of the old formalities were
                    dispensed with; obstacles to it were removed, and legal difficulties solved in
                    such a way as to further it. The power of imposing conditions on testamentary
                    manumissions was restricted, and these conditions interpreted in the sense most
                    favourable to freedom. The emperor could confer liberty by presenting a gold
                    ring to a slave with the consent of the master, and the legal process called <hi
                    rend="italic">restitutio natalium</hi> made him a full citizen. It was decided
                    that liberty could not be forfeited even by a prescription of sixty years’
                    duration.</p>
                <p>The rise of Christianity in the Roman world still further improved the condition
                    of the slave. The sentiments it created were not only favourable to the humane
                    treatment of the class in the present, but were the germs out of which its
                    entire liberation was destined, at a later period, in part to arise. It is
                    sometimes unreasonably objected to the Christian church that it did not denounce
                    slavery as a social crime and insist on its immediate abolition, that on the
                    contrary it recognized the institution, ecclesiastical persons and societies
                    themselves being owners of slaves. We have seen that slavery was a fundamental
                    element of the old Roman constitution, not only incorporated with the laws, but
                    necessarily arising out of, and essential to, the military mission of the state.
                    When the work of conquest had been sufficiently achieved, it could not be
                    expected that a radical alteration should be suddenly wrought either in the
                    social system which was in harmony with it, or even in the general ideas which
                    had grown up under its influence. The latter would, indeed, be gradually
                    affected; and accordingly we have observed a change in the policy of the law,
                    indicating a change in sentiment with respect to the slave class, which does not
                    appear to have been at all due to Christian teaching, but to have arisen from
                    the spontaneous influence of circumstances co-operating with the softened
                    manners which were inspired by a pacific regime. But the institution itself
                    could not be at once seriously disturbed; it was too deeply rooted and too
                    closely bound up with the whole existing order of things. If it could have been
                    immediately abolished, the results must have been disastrous, most of all to the
                    slave population itself. Before that end could be accomplished, an essentially
                    new social situation must come into existence; society must be organized for
                    defence as it had previously been for conquest; and this transformation could
                    not be wrought in a day. But in the meantime much might be done towards further
                    mitigating the evils of slavery, especially by impressing on master and slave
                    their relative duties and controlling their behaviour towards one another by the
                    exercise of an independent moral authority. This was the work open to the
                    Christian priesthood, and it cannot be denied that it was well discharged.
                    Whilst the fathers agree with the Stoics of the 2d century in representing
                    slavery as an indifferent circumstance in the eye of religion and morality, the
                    contempt for the class which the Stoics too often exhibited is in them replaced
                    by a genuine sympathy. They protested against the multiplication of slaves from
                    motives of vanity in the houses of the great, against the gladiatorial combats
                    (ultimately abolished by the noble self-devotion of a monk), and against the
                    consignment of slaves to the theatrical profession, which was often a school of
                    corruption. The church also encouraged the emancipation of individual slaves and
                    the redemption of captives. And its influence is to be seen in the legislation
                    of the Christian emperors, which softened some of the harshest features that
                    still marked the institution. There is not, indeed, a uniform advance in this
                    legislation; there is even retrogression in some particulars under Constantine,
                    as in his renewed permission to fathers to sell their children and to the finder
                    of an exposed child to make it his slave—enactments which it is sometimes sought
                    to excuse by the prevailing poverty of his period. But a stronger influence of
                    Christianity appears in Theodosius, and this influence is at the highest in the
                    legislation of Justinian. Its systematic effort is, in his own words, “pro
                    libertate, quam et fovere et tueri Romanis legibus et praecipue nostro numini
                    peculiare est.” Law still refused in general to recognize the marriages of
                    slaves; but Justinian gave them a legal value after emancipation in establishing
                    rights of succession. Unions between slaves and free women, or between a freeman
                    and the female slave of another, continued to be forbidden, and were long
                    punished in certain circumstances with atrocious severity. As witness, the slave
                    was still subject to the question; as criminal, he was punished with greater
                    rigour than the freeman. If he accused his master of a crime, unless the charge
                    was of treason, he was burnt. But he could maintain a legal claim to his own
                    liberty, not now merely through an <hi rend="italic">adsertor,</hi> but in
                    person. A female slave was still held incapable of the offence of adultery; but
                    Justinian visited with death alike the rape of a slave or freed-woman and that
                    of a free maiden. Already the master who killed his slave had been punished as
                    for homicide, except in the case of his unintended death under correction;
                    Constantine treated as homicide a number of specially-enumerated acts of
                    cruelty. Even under Theodosius the combats of the amphitheatre were permitted,
                    if not encouraged, by the state authorities; these sports were still expected
                    from the candidates for public honours. Combats of men with beasts were longest
                    continued; they had not ceased even in the early years of the reign of
                    Justinian. A new process of manumission was now established, to be performed in
                    the churches through the intervention of the ministers of religion; and it was
                    provided that clerics could at any time by mere expression of will liberate
                    their slaves. Slaves who were admitted to holy orders, or who entered a
                    monastery, became freemen, under certain restrictions framed to prevent fraud or
                    injustice. Justinian abolished the personal conditions which the legislation of
                    Augustus had required to be satisfied by the master who emancipated and the
                    slave who was manumitted, and removed the limitation of number. The liberated
                    slave, whatever the process by which he had obtained his freedom, became at once
                    a full citizen, his former master, however, retaining the right of patronage,
                    the abolition of which would probably have discouraged emancipation.</p>
                <p>The slavery of the working classes, justly described by Hume as the most
                    important difference between the social life of antiquity and that of modern
                    times, was not directly changed into the system of personal freedom. There was
                    an intermediate stage which has not always been sufficiently discriminated from
                    slavery, though the<pb break="no"

                    misconceptions. We mean the régime of serfdom. In studying the origin of this
                    transitional state of things, four principal considerations have to be kept in
                    view. (1) As Gibbon observes, the substantial completion of the Roman system of
                    conquest and incorporation reduced the supply of slaves by restricting the
                    dealings in them to such trade as took place within the now fixed limits of the
                    empire. It is true that, when the barbarian invasions began in the 3d century,
                    many captives were made, who, when not enrolled in the army, were employed in
                    agriculture or domestic service; but the regular importation was greatly and
                    increasingly diminished, and the Romans were obliged to have recourse to “the
                    milder but more tedious method of propagation.” The effect of this was to
                    improve the condition of the slave by rendering his existence an object of
                    greater value to his master. It tended, indeed, directly to the transformation
                    of slavery into serfdom by making it the interest of each family to preserve
                    indefinitely its own hereditary slaves, who could not be replaced except with
                    difficulty and at great expense. The abolition of the external slave trade
                    tended, in fact, to put an end to internal sales, and the slaves became attached
                    to the households or lands of their masters. (2) The diminished supply of slaves
                    further acted in the direction of the rehabilitation of free labour. A general
                    movement of this kind is noticeable from the 2d century onwards. Freemen had
                    always been to some extent employed in the public service— <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a)</hi> as subordinate assistants to the magistrates and priests; the places
                    of scribes, viatores, criers could be filled only by citizens; the apparitors
                    attached to the new imperial administration were also free plebeians, with
                    slaves in the lower ranks; but these apparitorships were usually held by
                    freedmen. So also <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> public works were in the 2d century
                    divided amongst corporations of free plebeians, with public slaves under them.
                    In private service the superior posts were often filled by freedmen; the higher
                    arts—as medicine, grammar, painting—were partly in the hands of freedmen and
                    even of <hi rend="italic">ingenui;</hi> the more successful actors and
                    gladiators were often freedmen. In the factories or workshops kept by wealthy
                    persons slave labour was mainly employed; but free artisans sometimes offered
                    their services to these establishments or formed associations to compete with
                    them. We have seen that free persons had all along been to some extent employed
                    in the cultivation of land as hired labourers, and, as we shall presently find,
                    also as tenants on the great estates. How all this operated we shall understand
                    when we examine the remarkable organization of the state introduced by
                    Diocletian and his successors. (3) This organization established in the Roman
                    world a personal and hereditary fixity of professions and situations which was
                    not very far removed from the caste system of the East. The purpose of this was
                    doubtless to resist by a strong internal consolidation the shock of the
                    invasions, to secure public order, to enforce industrious habits, and to
                    guarantee the financial resources of the state. Personal independence was
                    largely sacrificed, but those still more important ends were in a great measure
                    attained. The all-pervading nature of this discipline will be understood from
                    the following particulars. Members of the administrative service were absolutely
                    bound to their employments; they could not choose their wives or marry their
                    daughters out of the collegia to which they respectively belonged, and they
                    transmitted their obligations to their children. If they abandoned their posts,
                    they were sought for everywhere and forced to return. In municipalities, even
                    the <hi rend="italic">curiales,</hi> or members of the local senates, were bound
                    to their places and their functions; there were other members of the municipal
                    service who might supply a substitute on condition of resigning to him their
                    lands, but this power was rarely used; they commonly remained in their posts;
                    their families, too, were bound to remain; they were attached to the collegia or
                    other bodies to which they belonged. The soldier, procured for the army by
                    conscription, served as long as his age fitted him for his duties, and his sons
                    were bound to similar service. The same sort of compulsion appears to have been
                    exercised upon those belonging to, at least, such free industrial corporations
                    as were recognized and regulated by the state. Every one was treated, in fact,
                    as a servant of the state, and was bound to furnish labour or money, or both;
                    and the nature of his labour was permanently fixed for him; he was, in the
                    language of the law, “conditionis laqueis irretitus.” This general system, by
                    diminishing the freeman’s mastery over himself and his power to determine his
                    occupation, reduced the interval between him and the slave; and the latter on
                    the one hand, the free domestic servant and workshop labourer on the other, both
                    passed insensibly into the common condition of serfdom. (4) The corresponding
                    change, in the case of the rural slaves, took place through their being merged
                    in the order of <hi rend="italic">coloni.</hi> The Roman colonus was originally
                    a free person who took land on lease, contracting to pay to the proprietor
                    either a fixed sum annually or (when a <hi rend="italic">colonus
                    partiarius)</hi> a certain proportion of the produce of the farm. Under the
                    emperors of the 4th century the name designated a cultivator, who, though
                    personally free, was attached to the soil, and transmitted his condition to his
                    descendants; and this became the regular status of the great mass of Roman
                    cultivators. In sanctioning this personal and hereditary fixity, the law
                    probably only recognized a state of things which had previously existed, having
                    been spontaneously brought about by the circumstances of society, and especially
                    by the needs of agriculture. The class of coloni appears to have been composed
                    partly of tenants by contract who had incurred large arrears of rent and were
                    detained on the estates as debtors <hi rend="italic">(obaerati),</hi> partly of
                    foreign captives or immigrants who were settled in this condition on the land,
                    and partly of small proprietors and other poor men who voluntarily adopted the
                    status as an improvement in their position. They paid a fixed proportion of the
                    produce (<hi rend="italic">pars agraria)</hi> to the owner of the estate, and
                    gave a determinate amount of labour <hi rend="italic">{operse)</hi> on the
                    portion of the domain which he kept in his own hands (<hi rend="italic">mansus
                    dominicus).</hi> The law for a long time took no notice of these customary
                    tenures, and did not systematically constitute them until the 4th century. It
                    was indeed the requirements of the fiscus and the conscription which impelled
                    the imperial Government to regulate the system. The coloni were inscribed <hi
                    rend="italic">{adscripti)</hi> on the registers of the census as paying taxes to
                    the state, for which the proprietor was responsible, reimbursing himself for the
                    amount. In a constitution of Constantine (332 a.d.) we find the colonus
                    recognized as permanently attached to the land. If he abandoned his holding he
                    was brought back and punished; and any one who received him had not only to
                    restore him but to pay a penalty. He could not marry out of the domain; if he
                    took for wife a colona of another proprietor, she was restored to her original
                    locality, and the offspring of the union were divided between the estates. The
                    children of a colonus were fixed in the same status, and could not quit the
                    property to which they belonged. They and their descendants were retained, in
                    the words of a law of Theodosius, “quodam aeternitatis jure,” and by no process
                    could be relieved from their obligations. By a law of Anastasius, at the end of
                    the 5th century, a colonus who had voluntarily come into an estate was by a
                    tenure of thirty years for ever attached to it. The master (<hi rend="italic"
                    >dominus)</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0151-0136"/>could inflict on his coloni “moderate
                    chastisement,” and could chain them if they attempted to escape, but they had a
                    legal remedy against him for unjust demands or injury to them or theirs. In no
                    case could the rent or the labour dues be increased. The colonus could possess
                    property of his own, but could not alienate it without the consent of the
                    master. Thus, whilst the members of the class were personally free, their
                    condition had some incidents of a semi-servile character. They are actually
                    designated by Theodosius, though the lax language of the codes must not be taken
                    too literally, “servi terrae cui nati sunt.” And Salvian treats the proposition
                    “coloni divitum fiunt” as equivalent to “vertuntur in servos.” This is indeed an
                    exaggeration; a deduction must always be made from the phrases of the mediaeval
                    Jeremiah; the colonatus was not an oppressive system; it afforded, on the
                    contrary, real security against unreasonable demands and wanton disturbance, and
                    it was a great advance on the system of cultivation by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >familia rustica.</hi> But the point which it is important for our present
                    purpose to observe is, that there was a certain approximation between the
                    condition of the colonus and the slave which tended towards the fusion of both
                    in a single class. To make this plain, we must go a little further into
                    detail.</p>
                <p>Besides the coloni there were on a great estate—and those of the 4th century were
                    on a specially large scale— a number of praedial slaves, who worked collectively
                    under overseers on the part of the property which the owner himself cultivated.
                    But it was a common practice to settle certain of the slaves (and possibly also
                    of the freedmen) on other portions of the estate, giving them small farms on
                    conditions similar to those to which the coloni were subject. These slaves are,
                    in fact, described by Ulpian as <hi rend="italic">quasi coloni.</hi> They had
                    their own households and were hence distinguished as <hi rend="italic"
                    >casati.</hi> In law these slaves were at first absolutely at the disposal of
                    their masters; they had no property in the strict sense of the word, and could
                    be sold to another proprietor and separated from their families. But the
                    landlord’s interest and the general tone of feeling alike modified practice even
                    before the intervention of legislation; they were habitually continued in their
                    holdings, and came to possess in fact a perpetual and hereditary enjoyment of
                    them. By a law of Valentinian I. (377) the sale of these slaves was interdicted
                    unless the land they occupied were at the same time sold. The legal distinction
                    between the coloni and the slave tenants continued to exist after the invasions;
                    but the practical difference was greatly attenuated. The colonus often occupied
                    a servile mansus, and the slave a mansus originally appropriated to a colonus.
                    Intermarriages of the two classes became frequent. Already at the end of the 7th
                    century it does not appear that the distinction between them had any substantial
                    existence. The servile tenures were, no less than the others, stable and
                    hereditary; and the charges to be borne by the former were not necessarily the
                    heavier.</p>
                <p>Whilst giving their due weight to the social and economic circumstances which
                    tended thus to merge the free labourer and colonus on the one hand and the slave
                    on the other in a common class of serfs, we must never leave out of account the
                    directly moral agencies which worked towards the same result by modifying
                    slavery. Nor ought we to have in view only the influence of Christian doctrine
                    and precept considered in themselves; we must regard them as constantly applied
                    in daily life by an independent spiritual order, which was revered alike by the
                    two classes whose relations it assisted in regulating, and whose general
                    attitude towards slavery is sufficiently shown by the celebrated declaration of
                    Gregory the Great.</p>
                <p>A review of what has been said will make it plain that the Northern invasions had
                    little to do with the transition from slavery to serfdom. Only two modes have
                    been suggested in which they may possibly have accelerated the change. It is not
                    likely that the newly established proprietors would understand, or respect in
                    practice, nice distinctions between classes of cultivators; they would probably
                    regard the coloni and slaves, now that their conditions were so much
                    assimilated, as standing on the same basis. And, secondly, the Germans, if we
                    may believe Tacitus, had in their original seats no menial slaves, whilst, on
                    the other hand, they were familiar with the system of slaves settled on separate
                    portions of a domain and paying a fixed share of the produce to its owner. There
                    may be a certain value in these considerations. But, on the whole, it appears
                    that, as in the case of the rise of the feudal system generally, so in the
                    particular respect of the qualified personal freedom which accompanied it, the
                    influence of the Northern nations was really of little account, and that both
                    changes would have equally, though perhaps not so speedily, taken place if the
                    invasions had never occurred.</p>
                <p>Whilst ancient slavery was, as we have seen, a system fitted to endure under
                    given social conditions, and had a definite political function to fulfil,
                    serfdom, which succeeded when that function was exhausted, was a merely
                    transitory condition, with no other destination than that of leading the working
                    population up to a state of entire personal freedom. How the serf in cities and
                    towns became a free labourer for hire can be easily conceived; he doubtless in
                    many cases purchased his liberty out of his earnings, and in others it was not
                    the master’s interest to retain his services at the cost of his maintenance. The
                    emancipation of this entire class was favoured by the movement (not, however, to
                    be confounded with it) which established free industrial communities and gave
                    them municipal jurisdiction. But it is very difficult to trace the steps by
                    which the rural serf was transmuted into a free tenant. “The time and manner,”
                    says Adam Smith, “in which so important a revolution was brought about is one of
                    the most obscure points in modern history.” Smith himself attributes the change
                    to two causes—(1) the greater advantage to the proprietor derived from the
                    exertions of the cultivator when he worked entirely for himself, and (2) the
                    encouragement which sovereigns, jealous of the great lords, gave to the villeins
                    (under which term Smith seems to comprehend the whole mixed class of non-free
                    tenants) to encroach on their authority. To these economic and political
                    reasons, though doubtless real and important, Smith appears to attribute too
                    exclusive an efficacy, neglecting the moral and religious causes which conspired
                    to the same result, especially the personal influence of the clergy, who were
                    natural mediators between the serfs and the proprietors. The serfs were best
                    treated on the ecclesiastical estates, and many on private properties were
                    liberated “pro amore Dei” and “pro remedio animae.”</p>
                <p>Let us examine more particularly the circumstances of the transition in France
                    and in England.</p>
                <p>M. Guérard has shown that from the conquest by Caesar to the abolition of
                    feudalism there was a steady improvement in the condition of the class
                    originally enslaved. He distinguishes three periods—one of slavery proper,
                    lasting till the conquest of Gaul by the barbarians; the second, ending about
                    the close of the reign of Charles the Bald (d. 877), in which slavery is
                    replaced by an intermediate state which he calls by the indeterminate name of
                    “servitude,” the rights of the <hi rend="italic">servus</hi> being recognized,
                    respected, and protected, if not yet in a sufficient degree by the civil laws,
                    at least by those of the church and by social manners; and a third in which,
                    under the developed regime of feudalism, serfdom proper is fully established and
                    the serf-tenant has become simply a tributary under various appellations (<hi
                    rend="italic">homme de corps</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de pôté, main</hi><pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"

                    vilain).</hi> The three personal conditions here described coexisted to some
                    extent in all these periods, one of them, however, greatly preponderating in
                    each. Towards the end of the 9th century the serf-tenants were already
                    proprietors of their holdings; under the third dynasty they were rather subjects
                    than tenants, and the dues they paid were rather taxes than rents; they were, in
                    short, vassals occupying the lowest round of the feudal ladder. Guérard
                    enumerates as immediate causes which led to the liberation of serfs (besides the
                    master’s voluntary gift or bequest) their flight,—with the prescription which
                    arose after a certain interval off absence,—ordination, redemption by themselves
                    or others, marriages with women of higher status, and the action of law in the
                    case of certain wrongs inflicted by the master. The church co-operated to the
                    same result, as might be shown by many instances. Thus St Benedict of Aniane (d.
                    821), the reformer of the monasteries in the Carolingian territories, received a
                    number of donations of lands from the faithful; but, whilst accepting them for
                    his religious establishments, he enfranchised the serfs who inhabited them. All
                    the serfs, not merely in a village, bourg, or city, but in whole districts, were
                    liberated by charters of sovereigns or lords. Such documents are most common in
                    the 13th century. The general edicts of Louis X. (1315) and Philip V. (1318) are
                    little more than recognitions of a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli,</hi> and
                    were dictated, at least in part, by financial motives. Some relics of serfdom
                    continued to exist in local customs down to the Revolution, and were not
                    abolished till the night of the 4th August 1789. But these survivals do not
                    affect the truth of the proposition that the work of emancipation was
                    essentially accomplished early in the 14th century.</p>
                <p>Guérard has observed on the difficulty created by the ambiguity of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">servus</hi> in the mediaeval authorities. In the study of English
                    serfdom, even eminent writers like Robertson, Hallam, and Kemble have obscured
                    the subject by the use of the term <hi rend="italic">slave,</hi> sometimes in
                    its proper sense, sometimes in relation to the <hi rend="italic">serf.</hi> Dr
                    Stubbs has avoided this equivocal nomenclature, and by attending more to social
                    fact than to the letter of the law has placed the history of the class in a
                    clear light. The slaves of Anglo-Saxon times were “regarded as the stock of
                    their owner; . . . their offences against a third person he must answer for, as
                    for the mischief done by his cattle; . . . they had no credibility, no legal
                    rights; wrongs done to them were regarded as wrongs done to their master.”
                    Practice, indeed, was kinder to them than legal theory; as in the case of the
                    Roman peculium, they were “in some unexplained way” allowed to keep their
                    savings, and so to purchase their freedom; and “the spiritual law could enforce
                    a penance on the master for ill-treating them.” There were laws of Ethelbert and
                    Canute forbidding the sale of men to heathen masters, and the slave trade, the
                    principal seat of which was Bristol, was put down by the preaching of St
                    Wulfstan. The villein of Domesday Book is not a slave; he represents the
                    Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">ceorl</hi>; he is an irremovable cultivator, now
                    regarded as customary tenant of a lord. The Norman knights probably confounded
                    with the <hi rend="italic">villanus</hi> the <hi rend="italic">bordarii</hi> and
                    other tenants who stood on a less favourable footing. Whilst the free ceorl
                    became a villein, the <hi rend="italic">servus (theow)</hi> disappeared
                    altogether. The position which the class constituted by this fusion came to
                    occupy was one “compatible with much personal comfort and some social ambition.”
                    The villeins "were safe in the possession of their homes; they had a remedy
                    against the violence of their masters; they could, if they chose to renounce
                    their holdings and take refuge in a town, become members of the guild, and
                    there, when unclaimed for a year and a day, obtain the full rights of freemen;
                    they could obtain manumission by the intervention of the church, which always
                    proclaimed the liberation of the villein to be a work of merit on the part of
                    the master. . . . Under a fairly good lord, under a monastery or a college, the
                    villein enjoyed immunities and security that might be envied by his superiors;
                    he had a ready tribunal for his wrongs, a voice in the management of his
                    village; he might with a little contrivance redeem his children and start them
                    in a higher state of life.” Walter Map declares that in his time (12th century)
                    the villeins were educating their ignoble offspring in the liberal arts. In the
                    early part of the 14th century “it was by a mere legal form that the villeins
                    were described as less than free.” In the reign of Richard II. it seems that
                    “the legal theory of their status has become hardened and sharpened so as to
                    warrant almost wanton oppression;” but social causes, on the other hand, have
                    ameliorated their actual lot. It was not their normal condition that led to the
                    insurrection of 1381, but the enforcement of (the Statute of Labourers and the
                    attempt of the lords to reassert legal claims which were practically obsolete.
                    Serfdom died out in England without any special legislation against it. It
                    survived in exceptional instances, as in France; Hallam mentions as the latest
                    deed of enfranchisement one of Elizabeth in 1574 in favour of the bondmen on
                    some of her manors; and it appears that in Scotland the workers in coal and salt
                    mines were in a state of serfdom until they were liberated by Acts of the 15th
                    and 39th years of the reign of George III.</p>
                <p>Essentially similar movements took place in the other countries of the West. In
                    Italy “the 11th and 12th centuries,” says Hallam,</p>
                <p>“saw the number of slaves” (by which word he means serfs) "begin to decrease;
                    early in the 15th a writer quoted by Muratori speaks of them as no longer
                    existing. . . . The greater part,” he adds, “of the peasants in some countries
                    of Germany had acquired their liberty before the end of the 13th century; in
                    other parts . . . they remained in a sort of villenage till the present age.”
                    The most rigorous forms of serfdom (<hi rend="italic">Leibeigenschaft)</hi>
                    existed in those German districts which were once Wendish,—as Lusatia,
                    Pomerania, and Mecklenburg,—and in Holstein. The last remains of the system in
                    Germany were abolished in 1832 and 1848. In Castile the serfs were slowly
                    converted into <hi rend="italic">solariegos,</hi> who cultivated the land of the
                    lord under obligations similar to those of the colonus. Alphonso X. (El Sabio)
                    declared that the solariego could quit his holding when he wished, though he
                    could not alienate it or demand anything for his improvements. Alphonso XI. (El
                    Justiciero) decreed that no lord should take the <hi rend="italic">solar</hi>
                    (holding) from the tenant, nor from his sons or grandsons, so long as they paid
                    the fixed dues. They thus became irremovable, and their tenures were
                    hereditary.</p>
                <p>By these gradual processes every form of servitude disappeared from the social
                    order of western Europe, whilst at the same time was bequeathed to the modern
                    world the inexorable problem, still but partially solved, of the definitive
                    position of the classes whose origin is traceable to that condition.</p>
                <p>But not very long after the disappearance of serfdom in the most advanced
                    communities comes into sight the new system of colonial slavery, which, instead
                    of being the spontaneous outgrowth of social necessities and subserving a
                    temporary need of human development, was politically as well as morally a
                    monstrous aberration, and never produced anything but evil.</p>
                <p>In 1442, when the Portuguese under Prince Henry the Navigator were exploring the
                    Atlantic coast of Africa, one of his officers, Antam Gonsalves, who had captured
                    some Moors, was directed by the prince to carry them back to Africa. He received
                    from the Moors in exchange for them ten blacks and a quantity of gold dust. This
                    excited the cupidity of his fellow-countrymen; and they fitted out a large
                    number of ships for the trade, and built several forts on the African coast.
                    Many negroes were brought into Spain from these Portuguese settlements, and the
                    colonial slave trade first appears in the form of the introduction into the
                    newly-discovered western world of children or descendants of these negroes. When
                    Ovando was sent out in 1502 as governor of Hispaniola, whilst regulations,
                    destined to prove illusory, were made for the protection of the natives of the
                    island, permission was given to carry to the colony negro slaves, born in
                    Seville and other parts of Spain, who had been instructed in the Christian
                    faith. It appears from a letter of Ovando in 1503 that there were at that time
                    numbers of negroes in Hispaniola; he requested that no more might be permitted
                    to be brought out. In 1510 and the following years King Ferdinand ordered a
                    number of Africans to be sent to that colony for the working of the mines.</p>
                <p>Before this time Columbus had proposed an exchange of his Carib prisoners as
                    slaves against live stock to be furnished to Hispaniola by Spanish merchants.
                    Infidels, he represented, would thus be converted, the royal treasury enriched
                    by a duty on the slaves, and the colonists supplied with live stock free of
                    expense. He actually sent home in the ships of Antonio Torres, in 1494, above
                    500 Indian prisoners taken in wars with the caciques, who, he suggested, might
                    be sold as slaves at Seville. But, after a royal order had been issued for their
                    sale, Queen Isabella, interested by what she had heard of the gentle and
                    hospitable character of the natives and of their docility, procured a letter to
                    be written to Bishop Fonseca, the superintendent of Indian affairs, suspending
                    the order until inquiry should be made into the causes for which they had been
                    made prisoners, and into the lawfulness of their sale. Theologians differed on
                    the latter question, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0153-0138"/>Isabella directed that these Indians should be
                    sent back to their native country, and that a policy of conciliation should be
                    followed there instead of one of severity.</p>
                <p>Bartolomé de las Casas, the celebrated bishop of Chiapa, accompanied Ovando to
                    Hispaniola, and was a witness of the cruelties from which the Indians suffered
                    under his administration. He came to Spain in 1517 to obtain measures in their
                    favour, and he then made the suggestion to Charles that each Spanish resident in
                    Hispaniola should have licence to import a dozen negro slaves. Las Casas, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Historia de las Indias</hi> (lib. iii. cap. 101), frankly
                    confesses the grave error into which he thus fell. “This advice that licence
                    should be given to bring negro slaves to these lands the clerigo Casas first
                    gave, not considering the injustice with which the Portuguese take them and make
                    them slaves; which advice, after he had apprehended the nature of the thing, he
                    would not have given for all he had in the world.” Other good men appear to have
                    given similar advice about the same time, and, as has been shown, the practice
                    was not absolutely new; indeed the young king had in 1516, whilst still in
                    Flanders, granted licences to his courtiers for the importation of negroes into
                    the colonies, though Ximenes, as regent of Castile, by a decree of the same year
                    forbade the practice. The suggestion of Las Casas was no doubt made on the
                    ground that the negroes could, better than the Indians, bear the labour in the
                    mines, which was rapidly exhausting the numbers of the latter.<note

                    of fifteen years subsequent to the discovery of the West Indies, had, as
                    Robertson mentions, reduced the natives of Hispaniola from a million to 60,000.
                    </p></note> He has sometimes on this plea been exonerated from all censure; but,
                    as we have seen, he did not exculpate himself; and, though entitled to honour
                    for the zeal and perseverance which he showed on behalf of the natives of the
                    New World, he must in justice bear the blame due from posterity for his
                    violation or neglect of moral principle. His advice was unfortunately adopted.
                    “Charles,” says Robertson, “granted a patent to one of his Flemish favourites,
                    containing an exclusive right” of supplying 4000 negroes annually to Hispaniola,
                    Cuba, Jamaica, and Porto Rico. “The favourite sold his patent to some Genoese
                    merchants for 25,000 ducats”; these merchants obtained the slaves from the
                    Portuguese; and thus was first brought into a systematic form that odious
                    “commerce between Africa and America which has since been carried on to such an
                    amazing extent,” the action of the Spaniards being “imitated by all the nations
                    of Europe who have acquired territories in the warmer climates of the New
                    World.”</p>
                <p>The first Englishman who engaged in the hateful traffic was Captain John Hawkins
                    (<hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> The English slave traders were at first
                    altogether occupied in supplying the Spanish settlements. Indeed the reign of
                    Elizabeth passed without any English colony having been permanently established
                    in America. But in 1620 a Dutch ship from the coast of Guinea visited Jamestown
                    in Virginia, and sold a part of her cargo of negroes to the tobacco-planters.
                    This was the first beginning of slavery in British America; the number of
                    negroes was afterwards continually increased— though apparently at first
                    slowly—by importation, and the field-labour was more and more performed by
                    servile hands, so that in 1790 the State of Virginia, which is only a small part
                    of the original colony so named, contained 200,000 negroes.</p>
                <p>The African trade of England was long in the hands of exclusive companies; but by
                    an Act of the first year of William and Mary it became free and open to all
                    subjects of the crown. The African Company, however, continued to exist, and
                    obtained from time to time large parliamentary grants. By the treaty of Utrecht

                    forbade their acquiring territory to the east of the meridian line of 100 miles
                    west of the Azores. They could therefore supply their American possessions with

                    supplying the Spanish colonies with 4800</p>
                <p>negroes annually, which had previously passed from the Dutch to the French, was
                    transferred to Great Britain; an English company was to enjoy the monopoly for a
                    period of thirty years from 1st May 1713. But the contract came to an end in
                    1739, when the complaints of the English merchants on one side and of the
                    Spanish officials on the other rose to such a height that Philip V. declared his
                    determination to revoke the asiento, and Sir Robert Walpole was forced by
                    popular feeling into war with Spain. Between 1680 and 1700 about 140,000 negroes
                    were exported by the African Company, and 160,000 more by private adventurers,
                    making a total of 300,000. Between 1700 and the end of 1786 as many as 610,000
                    were transported to Jamaica alone, which had been an English possession since
                    1655. Bryan Edwards estimated the total import into all the British colonies of
                    America and the West Indies from 1680 to 1786 at 2,130,000, being an annual
                    average of 20,095. But this, he admits, is much less than was in his time
                    commonly supposed. The British slave trade reached its utmost extension shortly
                    before the War of American Independence. It was then carried on principally from
                    Liverpool, but also from London, Bristol, and Lancaster; the entire number of
                    slave ships sailing from those ports was 192, and in them space was provided for
                    the transport of 47,146 negroes. During the war the number decreased, but on its
                    termination the trade immediately revived. When Edwards wrote (1791), the number
                    of European factories on the coasts of Africa was 40; of these 14 were English,
                    3 French, 15 Dutch, 4 Portuguese, and 4 Danish. As correct a notion as can be
                    obtained of the numbers annually exported from the continent about the year 1790
                    by traders of the several European countries engaged in the traffic is supplied
                    by the following statement :— “By the British, 38,000; by the French, 20,000; by
                    the Dutch, 4000; by the Danes, 2000; by the Portuguese, 10,000; total 74,000.”
                    Thus more than half the trade was in British hands. “At present,” said
                    Robertson, writing in 1791, “the number of negro slaves in the settlements of
                    Great Britain and France in the West Indies exceeds a million; and, as the
                    establishment of servitude has been found, both in ancient and modern times,
                    extremely unfavourable to population, it requires an annual importation of at
                    least 58,000 to keep up the stock.” The slaves in the Spanish dominions and in
                    North America, he thought, probably amounted to an additional million.</p>
                <p>The hunting and stealing of human beings to make them slaves, which were already
                    practised in Africa for the supply of the central states of that continent,· as
                    well as of the markets of northern Africa, Turkey, and other Mohammedan
                    countries, were greatly aggravated by the demand of the European colonies. The
                    native chiefs engaged in forays, sometimes even on their own subjects, for the
                    purpose of procuring slaves to be exchanged for Western commodities. They often
                    set fire to a village by night and captured the inhabitants when trying to
                    escape. Thus all that was shocking in the barbarism of Africa was multiplied and
                    intensified by this foreign stimulation. To the miseries thus produced, and to
                    those suffered by the captives in their removal to the coast were added the
                    horrors of the middle passage. Exclusive of the slaves who died before they
                    sailed from Africa, 12/per cent. were lost during their passage to the West
                    Indies; at Jamaica 4/per cent. died whilst in the harbours or before the sale,
                    and one-third more in the “seasoning.” Thus, out of every lot of 100 shipped
                    from Africa 17 died in about 9 weeks, and not more than 50 lived to be effective
                    labourers in the islands. The circumstances of their subsequent life on the
                    plantations were not favourable to the increase of their numbers. In Jamaica
                    there were in 1690 40,000; from that year till 1820 there were imported 800,000;
                    yet at the latter date there were only 340,000 in the island. One cause which
                    prevented the natural increase of population was the inequality in the numbers
                    of the sexes; in Jamaica alone there was in 1789 an excess of 30,000 males.</p>
                <p>It may be truly said that from the latter part of the 17th century, when the
                    nature of the slave trade began to be understood by the public, all that was
                    best in England was adverse to it. Among those who denounced it— besides some
                    whose names are now little known, but are recorded with the honour they deserve
                    in the pages of Clarkson—-were Baxter, Sir Richard Steele (in <hi rend="italic"

                    >Oroonoko),</hi> Pope, Thomson, Shenstone, Dyer, Savage, and above all Cowper
                    (see his <hi rend="italic">Charity,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Task,</hi> bk.

                    Tucker. The question of the legal existence of slavery in Great Britain and
                    Ireland was raised in consequence of an opinion given in 1729 by York and
                    Talbot, attorney-general and solicitor-general at the time,<pb break="no"

                    countries from the West Indies did not become free, and might be compelled by
                    his master to return to the plantations. Chief-Justice Holt had expressed a
                    contrary opinion; and the matter was brought to a final issue by Mr Granville
                    Sharp in the case of the negro Somerset. It was decided by Lord Mansfield, in
                    the name of the whole bench, on June 22d 1772, that as soon as a slave set his
                    foot on the soil of the British islands he became free. In 1776 it was moved in
                    the House of Commons by David Hartley, son of the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on Man,</hi> that “the slave trade was contrary to the laws of God
                    and the rights of men”; but this motion—the first which was made on the
                    subject—failed; public opinion on the question was far from being yet fully
                    ripe.</p>
                <p>The first persons in England who took united practical action against the slave
                    trade were the Quakers, following the expression of sentiment which had emanated
                    so early as 1671 from their founder George Fox. In 1727 they declared it to be
                    “not a commendable or allowed” practice; in 1761 they excluded from their
                    Society all who should be found concerned in it, and issued appeals to their
                    members and the public against the system. In 1783 there was formed amongst them
                    an association “for the relief and liberation of the negro slaves in the West
                    Indies, and for the discouragement of the slave trade on the coast of Africa.”
                    This was the first society established in England for the purpose. The Quakers
                    in America had taken action on the subject still earlier than those in England.
                    The Pennsylvanian Quakers advised their members against the trade in 1696; in
                    1754 they issued to their brethren a strong dissuasive against encouraging it in
                    any manner; in 1774 all persons concerned in the traffic, and in 1776 all slave
                    holders who would not emancipate their slaves, were excluded from membership.
                    The Quakers in the other American provinces followed the lead of their brethren
                    in Pennsylvania. The individuals amongst the American Quakers who laboured most
                    earnestly and indefatigably on behalf of the Africans were John Woolman
                    (1720-1773) and Anthony Benezet (1713-1784), the latter a son of a French
                    Huguenot driven from France by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. The former
                    confined his efforts chiefly to America and indeed to his coreligionists there;
                    the latter sought, and not without a large measure of success, to found a
                    universal propaganda in favour of abolition. A Pennsylvanian society was formed
                    in 1774 by James Pemberton and Dr Benjamin Rush, and in 1787 (after the war) was
                    reconstructed on an enlarged basis under the presidency of Franklin. Other
                    similar associations were founded about the same time in different parts of the
                    United States. The next important movement took place in England. Dr Peckard,
                    vice-chancellor of the university of Cambridge, who entertained strong
                    convictions against the slave trade, proposed in 1785 as subject for a Latin
                    prize dissertation the question, “An liceat invitos in servitutem dare.” Thomas
                    Clarkson resolved to compete for the prize. Reading Anthony Benezet’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Historical Account of Guinea</hi> and other works in the course of
                    his study of the subject, he became so powerfully impressed with a sense of the
                    vile and atrocious nature of the traffic that he ere long determined to devote
                    his life to the work of its abolition, a resolution which he nobly kept. His
                    essay, which obtained the first prize, was translated into English in an
                    expanded form by its author, and published in 1786 with the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the Slavery and Commerce of the Human Species.</hi> In
                    the process of its publication he was brought into contact with several persons
                    already deeply interested in the question; amongst others with Granville Sharp,
                    William Dillwyn (an American by birth, who had known Benezet), and the Rev.
                    James Ramsay, who had lived nineteen years in St Christopher, and had published
                    an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Treatment and Conversion of the African Slaves
                    in the British Sugar Colonies.</hi> The distribution of Clarkson’s book led to
                    his forming connexions with many persons of influence, and especially with
                    William Wilberforce, who, having already occupied himself with the subject, went
                    fully into the evidence bearing on it which Clarkson laid before him, and, as
                    the result of his inquiries, undertook the parliamentary conduct of the movement
                    which was now decisively inaugurated. A committee was formed on 22d May 1787 for
                    the abolition of the slave trade, under the presidency of Granville Sharp, which
                    after twenty years of labour succeeded, with the help of eminent public men, in
                    effecting the object of its foundation, and thus removing a grave blot on the
                    character of the British nation, and mitigating one of the greatest evils that
                    ever afflicted humanity. It is unquestionable that the principal motive power
                    which originated and sustained their efforts was Christian principle and
                    feeling. The most earnest and unremitting exertions were made by the persons so
                    associated in investigating facts and collecting evidence, in forming branch
                    committees and procuring petitions, in the instruction of the public and in the
                    information and support of those who pleaded the cause in parliament. To the
                    original members were afterwards added several remarkable persons, amongst whom
                    were Josiah Wedgwood, Bennet Langton (Dr Johnson’s friend), and, later, Zachary
                    Macaulay, Henry Brougham, and James Stephen.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the numerous petitions presented to parliament, a committee of
                    privy council was appointed by the crown in 1788 to inquire concerning the slave
                    trade; and Mr Pitt moved that the House of Commons should early in the next
                    session take the subject into consideration. Wilberforce’s first motion for a
                    committee of the whole House upon the question was made on 19th March 1789, and
                    this committee proceeded to business on 12th May of the same year. After an
                    admirable speech, Wilberforce laid on the table twelve resolutions which were
                    intended as the basis of a future motion for the abolition of the trade. The
                    discussion of these was postponed to the next session, and in 1790-91 evidence
                    was taken upon them. At length, on 18th April of the latter year, a motion was
                    made for the introduction of a bill to prevent the further importation of slaves
                    into the British colonies in the West Indies. Opinion had been prejudiced by the
                    insurrections in St Domingo and Martinique, and in the British island of
                    Dominica; and the motion was defeated by 163 votes against 88. Legislative
                    sanction was, however, given to the establishment of the Sierra Leone Company,
                    for the colonization of a district on the west coast of Africa and the
                    discouragement of the slave trade there. It was hoped at the time that that
                    place would become the centre from which the civilization of Africa would
                    proceed; but this expectation was not fulfilled. On 2d April 1792 Wilberforce
                    again moved that the trade ought to be abolished; an amendment in favour of
                    gradual abolition was carried, and it was finally resolved that the trade should
                    cease on 1st January 1796. When a similar motion was brought forward in the
                    Lords the consideration of it was postponed to the following year, in order to
                    give time for the examination of witnesses by a committee of the House. A bill
                    in the Commons in the following year to abolish that part of the trade by which
                    British merchants supplied foreign settlements with slaves was lost on the third
                    reading; it was renewed in the Commons in 1794 and carried there, but defeated
                    in the Lords. Then followed several years during which efforts were made by the
                    abolitionists<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0155-0140"/>in parliament with little success. But in 1806,
                    Lord Grenville and Fox having come into power, a bill was passed in both Houses
                    to put an end to the British slave trade for foreign supply, and to forbid the
                    importation of slaves into the colonies won by the British arms in the course of
                    the war. On 10th June of the same year Fox brought forward a resolution “that
                    effectual measures should be taken for the abolition of the African slave trade
                    in such a manner and at such a period as should be deemed advisable,” which was
                    carried by a large majority. A similar resolution was successful in the House of
                    Lords. A bill was then passed through both Houses forbidding the employment of
                    any new vessel in the trade. Finally, in 1807, a bill was presented by Lord
                    Grenville in the House of Lords providing for the abolition of the trade, was
                    passed by a large majority, was then sent to the Commons (where it was moved by
                    Lord Howick), was there amended and passed, and received the royal assent on
                    25th March. The bill enacted that no vessel should clear out for slaves from any
                    port within the British dominions after 1st May 1807, and that no slave should
                    be landed in the colonies after 1st March 1808.</p>
                <p>In 1807 the African Institution was formed, with the primary objects of keeping a
                    vigilant watch on the slave traders and procuring, if possible, the abolition of
                    the slave trade by the other European nations. It was also to be made an
                    instrument for promoting the instruction of the negro races and diffusing
                    information respecting the agricultural and commercial capabilities of the
                    African continent.</p>
                <p>The Act of 1807 was habitually violated, as the traders knew that, if one voyage
                    in three was successful, they were abundantly remunerated for their losses. This
                    state of things, it was plain, must continue as long as the trade was only a
                    contraband commerce, involving merely pecuniary penalties. Accordingly, in 1811,
                    Brougham carried through parliament a bill declaring the traffic to be a felony
                    punishable with transportation. Some years later another Act was passed, making
                    it a capital offence; but this was afterwards repealed. The law of 1811 proved
                    effectual, and brought the slave trade to an end so far as the British dominions
                    were concerned. Mauritius, indeed, continued it for a time. That island, which
                    had been ceded by France in 1810, three years after the abolition, had special
                    facilities for escaping observation in consequence of the proximity of the
                    African coast; but it was soon obliged to conform.</p>
                <p>The abolition of the French slave trade was preceded by stormy struggles and by
                    many deplorable excesses. The western part of St Domingo, nominally belonging to
                    Spain, had been occupied by buccaneers, who were recognized and supported by the
                    French Government, and had been ceded to France at the peace of Ryswick in 1697.
                    So vast was the annual importation of enslaved negroes into this colony before
                    1791 that the ratio of the blacks to the whites was as 16 to 1. In that year
                    there were in French St Domingo 480,000 blacks, 24,000 mulattoes, and only
                    30,000 whites. The French law for the regulation of slavery in the plantations,
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Code Noir</hi> (framed under Louis XIV. in 1685),
                    was humane in its spirit; but we are informed that its provisions were
                    habitually disregarded by the planters, whilst the free mulattoes laboured under
                    serious grievances and were exposed to irritating indignities. A “Société des
                    Amis des Noirs” was formed in Paris in 1788 for the abolition, not only of the
                    slave trade, but of slavery itself. The president was Condorcet, and amongst the
                    members were the Duc de la Rochefoucault, the Abbé Gregoire, Brissot, Clavière,
                    Pétion, and La Fayette; Mirabeau was an active sympathizer. The great motor of
                    the parallel effort in England was the Christian spirit; in France it was the
                    enthusiasm of humanity which was associated with the revolutionary movement.
                    There were in 1789 a number of mulattoes in Paris, who had come from St Domingo
                    to assert the rights of the people of colour in that colony before the national
                    assembly. The Declaration of the Rights of Man in August 1789 seemed to meet
                    their claims, but in March 1790 the assembly, alarmed by rumours of the
                    discontent and disaffection of the planters in St Domingo, passed a resolution
                    that it had not been intended to comprehend the internal government of the
                    colonies in the constitution framed for the mother country, and added that the
                    assembly would not cause any innovation to be made, directly or indirectly, in
                    any system of commerce in which the colonies were already concerned,' —a
                    declaration which could only be interpreted as sanctioning the continuance of
                    the slave trade. Vincent Ogé, one of the mulatto delegates in Paris, disgusted
                    at the overthrow of the hopes of his race, returned to St Domingo, and on
                    landing in October</p>
                <p>1790 addressed a letter to the governor announcing his intention of taking up
                    arms on behalf of the mulattoes if their wrongs were not redressed. He rose
                    accordingly with a few followers, but was soon defeated and forced to take
                    refuge in the Spanish part of the island. He was afterwards surrendered, tried,
                    and sentenced to be broken on the wheel. When the news of this reached Paris, it
                    created a strong feeling against the planters; and on the motion of the Abbé
                    Gregoire it was resolved by the assembly on 15th May</p>
                <p>1791 “that the people of colour resident in the French colonies, born of free
                    parents, were entitled to, as of right, and should be allowed, the enjoyment of
                    all the privileges of French citizens, and among others those of being eligible
                    to seats both in the parochial and colonial assemblies.” On the 23d August a
                    rebellion of the negroes broke out in the northern province of St Domingo, and
                    soon extended to the western province, where the mulattoes and blacks combined.
                    Many enormities were committed by the insurgents, and were avenged with scarcely
                    inferior barbarity. The French assembly, alarmed by these scenes, and fearing
                    the loss of the colony, repealed on 24th September the decree of the preceding
                    May. This lamentable vacillation put an end to all hope of a reconciliation of
                    parties in the island. Civil commissioners sent out from France quarrelled with
                    the governor and called the revolted negroes to their assistance. The white
                    inhabitants of Cape François were massacred and the city in great part destroyed
                    by fire. The planters now offered their allegiance to Great Britain; and an
                    English force landed in the colony. But it was insufficient to encounter the
                    hostility of the republican troops and the revolted negroes and mulattoes; it
                    suffered dreadfully from disease, and was obliged to evacuate the island in
                    1798. On the departure of the British the government remained in the hands of
                    Toussaint l'Ouverture, the noblest type ever produced by the African race.
                    Slavery had disappeared; the blacks were employed as hired servants, receiving
                    for their remuneration the third part of the crops they raised; and the
                    population was rapidly rising in civilization and comfort. The whole island was
                    now French, the Spanish portion having been ceded by the treaty of Basel. The
                    wish of Toussaint was that St Domingo should enjoy a practical independence
                    whilst recognizing the sovereignty and exclusive commercial rights of France. Of
                    the violent and treacherous conduct of Bonaparte towards the island and its
                    eminent chief we cannot here give an account; the final issue was that the
                    blacks drove from their soil the forces sent to subdue them, and founded a
                    constitution of their own, which was more than once modified. There can be no
                    doubt that the Government of the Restoration, in seeking to obtain possession of
                    the island, had the intention of re-establishing slavery, and even of reopening
                    the slave trade for the purpose of recruiting the diminished population. But
                    Bonaparte abolished that trade during the Hundred Days, though he also failed to
                    win back the people of St Domingo, or, as it was now called by its original
                    name, Hayti, to obedience. The Bourbons, when again restored, could not
                    reintroduce the slave trade; the notion of conquering the island had to be given
                    up; and its independence was formally recognized in 1825. Thus France lost her
                    most important colonial possession, which had yielded produce to an amount
                    almost as great as that of all the rest of the West Indies; and the negro race
                    obtained its first and hitherto its only independent settlement outside the
                    African continent.</p>
                <p>England had not been the first European power to abolish the slave trade; that
                    honour belongs to Denmark; a royal order was issued 16th May 1792 that the
                    traffic should cease in the Danish possessions from the end of 1802. The United
                    States had in 1794 forbidden any participation by American subjects in the slave
                    trade to foreign countries; they now prohibited the importation of slaves from
                    Africa into their own dominion. This Act was passed 2d March 1807; it did not,
                    however, come into force till 1st January 1808. At the congress of Vienna
                    (opened November 1, 1814) the principle was acknowledged that the slave trade
                    should be abolished as soon as possible; but the determination of the limit of
                    time was reserved for separate negotiation between the powers. It had been
                    provided in a treaty between France and Great Britain, May 30, 1814, that no
                    foreigner should<pb break="no"

                    colonies, and that the trade should be absolutely interdicted to the French
                    themselves after June 1, 1819. This postponement of abolition was dictated by
                    the wish to introduce a fresh stock of slaves into Hayti, if that island should
                    be recovered. Bonaparte, as we have seen, abolished the French slave trade
                    during his brief restoration, and this abolition was confirmed at the second
                    peace of Paris, November 20, 1815, but it was not effectually carried out by
                    French legislation until March 1818. In January 1815 Portuguese subjects were
                    prohibited from prosecuting the trade north of the equator, and the term after
                    which the traffic should be everywhere unlawful was fixed to end on 21st January
                    1823, but was afterwards extended to February 1830; England paid £300,000 as a
                    compensation to the Portuguese. A royal decree was issued on 10th December 1836
                    forbidding the export of slaves from any Portuguese possession. But this decree
                    was often violated. It was agreed that the Spanish slave trade should come to an
                    end in 1820, England paying to Spain an indemnification of £400,000. The Dutch
                    trade was closed in 1814; the Swedish had been abolished in 1813. By the peace
                    of Ghent, December 1814, the United States and England mutually bound themselves
                    to do all in their power to extinguish the traffic. It was at once prohibited in
                    several of the South American states when they acquired independence, as in La
                    Plata, Venezuela, and Chili. In 1831 and 1833 Great Britain entered into an
                    arrangement with France for a mutual right of search within certain seas, to
                    which most of the other powers acceded; and by the Ashburton treaty (1842) with
                    the United States provision was made for the joint maintenance of squadrons on
                    the west coast of Africa. By all these measures the slave trade, so far as it
                    was carried on under the flags of European nations or for the supply of their
                    colonies, ceased to exist.</p>
                <p>Meantime another and more radical reform had been in preparation and was already
                    in progress, namely, the abolition of slavery itself in the foreign possessions
                    of the several states of Europe. When the English slave trade had been closed,
                    it was found that the evils of the traffic, as still continued by several other
                    nations, were greatly aggravated. In consequence of the activity of the British
                    cruisers the traders made great efforts to carry as many slaves as possible in
                    every voyage, and practised atrocities to get rid of the slaves when capture was
                    imminent. It was, besides, the interest of the cruisers, who shared the price of
                    the captured slave-ship, rather to allow the slaves to be taken on board than to
                    prevent their being shipped at all. Thrice as great a number of negroes as
                    before, it was said, was exported from Africa, and two-thirds of these were
                    murdered on the high seas. It was found also that the abolition of the British
                    slave trade did not lead to an improved treatment of the negroes in the West
                    Indies. The slaves were overworked now that fresh supplies were stopped, and
                    their numbers rapidly decreased. In 1807 there were in the West Indies 800,000;
                    in 1830 they were reduced to 700,000. It became more and more evident that the
                    root of the evil could be reached only by abolishing slavery altogether. At the
                    same time, by the discussions which had for years gone on throughout English
                    society on the subject of the slave trade, men’s consciences had been awakened
                    to question the lawfulness of the whole system of things out of which that trade
                    had taken its rise.</p>
                <p>An appeal was made by Wilberforce in 1821 to Thomas Fowell Buxton to undertake
                    the conduct of this new question in parliament. An anti-slavery society was
                    established in 1823, the principal members of which, besides Wilberforce and
                    Buxton, were Zachary Macaulay, Dr Lushington, and Lord Suffield. Buxton moved on
                    5th May of the same year that the House should take into consideration the state
                    of slavery in the British colonies. The object he and his associates had then in
                    view was gradual abolition by establishing something like a system of serfdom
                    for existing slaves, and passing at the same time a measure emancipating all
                    their children born after a certain day. Canning carried against Buxton and his
                    friends a motion to the effect that the desired ameliorations in the condition
                    and treatment of the slaves should be recommended by the home Government to the
                    colonial legislatures, and enforced only in case of their resistance, direct
                    action being taken in the single instance of Trinidad, which, being a crown
                    colony, had no legislature of its own. A well-conceived series of measures of
                    reform was accordingly proposed to the colonial authorities. Thereupon a general
                    outcry was raised by the planters at the acquiescence of the Government in the
                    principles of the anti-slavery party. A vain attempt being made in Demerara to
                    conceal from the knowledge of the slaves the arrival of the order in council,
                    they became impressed with the idea that they had been set free, and accordingly
                    refused to work, and, compulsion being resorted to, offered resistance. Martial
                    law was proclaimed; the disturbances were repressed with great severity; and the
                    treatment of the missionary Smith, which was taken up and handled with great
                    ability by Brougham, awakened strong feeling in England against the planters.
                    The question, however, made little progress in parliament for some years, though
                    Buxton, William Smith, Lushington, Brougham, Mackintosh, Butterworth, and
                    Denman, with the aid of Z. Macaulay, James Stephen, and others, continued the
                    struggle, only suspending it during a period allowed to the local legislatures
                    for carrying into effect the measures expected from them. In 1828 the free
                    people of colour in the colonies were placed on a footing of legal equality with
                    their fellow-citizens. In 1830 the public began to be aroused to a serious
                    prosecution of the main issue. It was becoming plain that the planters would
                    take no steps tending to the future liberation of the slaves, and the leaders of
                    the movement determined to urge the entire abolition of slavery at the earliest
                    practicable period. The Government continued to hesitate and to press for
                    mitigations of the existing system. At length in 1833 the ministry of Earl Grey
                    took the question in hand and carried the abolition with little difficulty, the
                    measure passing the House of Commons on 7th August 1833 and receiving the Royal
                    assent 28th of the same month. A sum of 20 millions sterling was voted as
                    compensation to the planters. A system of apprenticeship for seven years was
                    established as a transitional preparation for liberty. The slaves were bound to
                    work for their masters during this period for three-fourths of the day, and were
                    to be liable to corporal punishment if they did not give the due amount of
                    labour. The master was, in return, to supply them with food and clothing. All
                    children under six years of age were to be at once free, and provision was to be
                    made for their religious and moral instruction. Many thought the postponement of
                    emancipation unwise. Immediate liberation was carried out in Antigua, and public
                    tranquillity was so far from being disturbed there that the Christmas of 1833
                    was the first for twenty years during which martial law was not proclaimed in
                    order to preserve the peace. Notwithstanding protracted and strenuous opposition
                    on the part of the Government, the House of Commons passed a resolution against
                    the continuance of the transitional system. When this was done the local
                    legislatures saw that the slaves would no longer work for the masters; they
                    accordingly cut off two years of the indentured apprenticeship, and gave freedom
                    to the slaves in August 1838 instead of 1840.</p>
                <p>The example of Great Britain was gradually followed by the other European states,
                    and some American ones had already taken action of the same kind. The immediate
                    emancipation of the slaves in the French colonies was decreed by the Provisional
                    Government of 1848. In 1858 it was enacted that every slave belonging to a
                    Portuguese subject should be free in twenty years from that date, a system of
                    tutelage being established in the meantime. This law came into operation on 29th
                    April 1878, and the status of slavery was thenceforth illegal throughout the
                    Portuguese possessions. The Dutch emancipated their slaves in 1863. Several of
                    the Spanish American states, on declaring their independence, had adopted
                    measures for the discontinuance of slavery within their limits. It was abolished
                    by a decree of the Mexican republic on 15th September 1829. The Government of
                    Buenos Ayres enacted that all children born to slaves after 31st January 1813
                    should be free; and in Colombia it was provided that those born after 16th July
                    1821 should be liberated on attaining their eighteenth year.</p>
                <p>Three of the most important slave systems still remained in which no steps
                    towards emancipation had been taken—those of the Southern United States, of
                    Cuba, and of Brazil.</p>
                <p>Slavery was far from being approved in principle by the most eminent of the
                    fathers of the American Union. Washington in his will provided for the
                    emancipation of his own slaves; he said to Jefferson that it was “among<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0157-0142"/>his first wishes to see some plan adopted by which
                    slavery in his country might be abolished by law,’ and again he wrote that to
                    this subject his own suffrage should never be wanting. John Adams declared his
                    abhorrence of the practice of slaveholding, and said that “every measure of
                    prudence ought to be assumed for the eventual total extirpation of slavery from
                    the United States.” Franklin’s opinions we have already indicated; and Madison,
                    Hamilton, and Patrick Henry all reprobated the principle of the system.
                    Jefferson declared that in the presence of the institution “he trembled for his
                    country when he remembered that God was just.” The last-named statesman, at the
                    first continental congress after the evacuation by the British forces, proposed
                    a draft ordinance (1st March 1784) for the government of the territory—including
                    the present Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi— ceded already or to be ceded by
                    individual States to the United States; and it was an article of this ordinance
                    that “after the year 1800 there should be neither slavery nor involuntary
                    servitude in any of the said States, otherwise than in punishment of crime.”
                    This proviso, however, was lost. At the convention of Philadelphia in 1787,
                    where the constitution was settled, the sentiments of the framers were against
                    slavery; but South Carolina and Georgia insisted on its recognition as a
                    condition of their joining the Union, and even an engagement for the mutual
                    rendition of fugitive slaves was embodied in the federal pact. The <hi
                    rend="italic">words</hi> “slave” and “slavery” were, however, excluded from the
                    constitution, “because,” as Madison says, “they did not choose to admit the
                    right of property in man” in direct terms; and it was at the same time provided
                    that Congress might interdict the foreign slave trade after the expiration of
                    twenty years. It must not be forgotten that either before or soon after the
                    formation of the Union the Northern States—beginning with Vermont in 1777, and
                    ending with New Jersey in 1804—either abolished slavery or adopted measures to
                    effect its gradual abolition within their boundaries. But the principal
                    operation of (at least) the latter change was simply to transfer Northern slaves
                    to Southern markets.</p>
                <p>We cannot follow in detail the several steps by which the slave power for a long
                    time persistently increased its influence in the Union. The acquisition of
                    Louisiana— including the State so named, Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas—(1803),
                    though not made in its interest, the Missouri compromise (1820), the annexation
                    of Texas (1845), the Fugitive Slave Law (1850), the Kansas-Nebraska bill (1854),
                    the Dred Scott decision (1856), the attempts to acquire Cuba (1854) and to
                    reopen the foreign slave trade (1859-60), were the principal steps—only some of
                    them successful—in its career of aggression. They roused a determined spirit of
                    opposition, founded on deep-seated convictions. The pioneer of the more recent
                    abolitionist movement was Benjamin Lundy (1789-1839). He was followed by William
                    Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879), Elijah P. Lovejoy (1802-1837)—a martyr, if ever
                    there was one—Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner, John Brown (b. 1800, hanged
                    1859), all of whom were in their several ways leading apostles or promoters of
                    the cause. The best intellect of America outside the region of practical
                    politics has been on the anti-slavery side. William E. Channing, R. W. Emerson,
                    the poets Bryant, Longfellow, pre-eminently Whittier, and more recently Whitman,
                    have spoken on this theme with no uncertain sound. The South, and its partisans
                    in the North, made desperate efforts to prevent the free expression of opinion
                    respecting the institution, and even the Christian churches in the slave States
                    used their influence in favour of the maintenance of slavery. But in spite of
                    every such effort opinion steadily grew. Public sentiment in the North was
                    deeply stirred by the <hi rend="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</hi> of Mrs Harriet
                    Beecher Stowe (1852), which, as Senior said, under the disguise of a novel was
                    really a pamphlet against the Fugitive Slave Law. It gradually became apparent
                    that the question could not be settled without an armed conflict. The
                    designation of Abraham Lincoln as president in November 1860 was the signal for
                    the rising of the South. The North at first took arms simply to maintain the
                    Union; but the far-sighted politicians from the first, and soon the whole
                    nation, saw that the real issue was the continued existence or the total
                    abolition of slavery. See United States.</p>
                <p>The war was closed by the surrender at Appomattox (9th April 1865), but already
                    in 1862 slavery in the Territories had been abolished by Congress; on 22d of
                    September of the same year Lincoln had issued his proclamation of freedom to the
                    slaves; and in 1864 a constitutional amendment had been passed abolishing and
                    for ever prohibiting slavery throughout the United States.</p>
                <p>The Spanish slave code, promulgated in 1789, is admitted on all hands to have
                    been very humane in its character; and, in consequence of this, after Trinidad
                    had become an English possession, the anti-slavery party resisted—and
                    successfully—the attempt of the planters (1811) to have the Spanish law in that
                    island replaced by the British. But, notwithstanding this mildness of the code,
                    so habitually and glaringly were its provisions violated in the colonies of
                    Spain, that Dr R. R. Madden, who had personal knowledge of the affairs of Cuba,
                    declared in 1840 that “slavery in Cuba was more destructive to human life, more
                    pernicious to society, degrading to the slave and debasing to the master, more
                    fatal to health and happiness, than in any other slaveholding country on the
                    face of the habitable globe.” “It is in Cuba at this day,” wrote Cairnes in
                    1862, “. . . that we see in the servile class the coarsest fare, the most
                    exhausting and unremitting toil, and even the absolute destruction of a portion
                    of its numbers every year by the slow torture of overwork and insufficient sleep
                    and rest.” The slave population of the island was estimated in 1792 at 84,000;
                    in 1817 at 179,000; in 1827 at 286,000; and in 1843 at 436,000. An Act was
                    passed by the Spanish legislature in 1870, providing that every slave who had
                    then passed, or should thereafter pass, the age of sixty should be at once free,
                    and that all yet unborn children of slaves should also be free. The latter,
                    however, were to be maintained at the expense of the proprietors up to their
                    eighteenth year, and during that time to be kept, as apprentices, to such work
                    as was suitable for their age. This is known as the Moret Law, having been
                    carried through the house of representatives by Señor Moret y Prendergast, then
                    minister for the colonies. By the census of 1867 there was in Cuba a total
                    population of 1,370,211 persons, of whom 764,750 were whites and 605,461 black
                    or coloured; and of the latter number 225,938 were free and 379,523 were slaves.
                    In 1873 the Cubans roughly estimated the population at 1,500,000,—of whom
                    500,000, or one-third, were slaves. Mr Crowe, consul-general in the island, has
                    lately (1885) stated that “the institution is rapidly dying,—that in a year, or
                    at most two, slavery, even in its present mild form, will be extinct.”</p>
                <p>There was a convention between Great Britain and Brazil in 1826 for the abolition
                    of the slave trade, but it was habitually violated in spite of the English
                    cruisers. In 1830 the traffic was declared piracy by the emperor of Brazil.
                    England asserted by the Aberdeen Act (1845) the right of seizing suspected craft
                    in Brazilian waters. Yet by the connivance of the local administrative
                    authorities 54,000 Africans continued to be annually imported. In 1850 the trade
                    is said to have been decisively put down. The planters and mine proprietors
                    cried out against this as a national calamity. The closing of the traffic made
                    the labour of the slaves more severe, and led to the employment on the
                    plantations of many who before had been engaged in domestic work; but the
                    slavery of Brazil has always been lighter than that of the United States. On
                    28th September 1871 the Brazilian chambers decreed that slavery should be
                    abolished throughout the empire. Though existing slaves were to remain slaves
                    still, with the exception of those possessed by the Government, who were
                    liberated by the Act, facilities for emancipation were given; and it was
                    provided that all children born of female slaves after the day on which the law
                    passed should be free. They were, however, bound to serve the owners of their
                    mothers for a term of 21 years. A clause was inserted to the effect that a
                    certain sum should be annually set aside from fines to aid each province in
                    emancipating slaves by purchase. Seven years before the passing of this Act the
                    emperor, whose influence has always been exerted in favour of freedom, had
                    liberated his private slaves, and many Brazilians after 1871 followed his
                    example. According to the census of 1835 there were then in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n158/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0158-0143"/>Brazil 2,100,000 slaves. It was estimated that at
                    the beginning of 1875 there were not more than 1,476,567. But in 1884 they are
                    spoken of as 3,000,000 in number. A gradual separation has been for some time
                    taking place between the parts of the country in which slave labour is used and
                    the free-labour regions. Slavery is being concentrated in the districts between
                    Maranhão and São Paulo. In 1880 the deputy Joachim Nabuco, leader of the
                    anti-slavery movement, obtained leave to introduce a bill for a more rapid
                    liberation of slaves than was attainable under the law of 1871, and for the
                    final extinction of slavery in Brazil by 1st January 1890. The Government,
                    however, refused to sanction the further progress of the bill; but the question
                    has since become again of present political interest, being the principal
                    subject of discussion in the parliament which opened 1st March 1885. A bill has
                    been passed, known as the Saraiva Law, on which we cannot yet form a definitive
                    judgment, but which is understood to have disappointed the expectations of the
                    abolitionists. It is said to provide exorbitant compensation for the
                    slave-owners; and, although slaves over 60 years of age are to obtain their
                    freedom, it appears that all slaves, on being set free, as well as the
                    indentured children of slaves, are to remain three years longer with their
                    masters at very low wages, the planters thus practically receiving an additional
                    indemnity.</p>
                <p>In the colonies of more than one European country, after the prohibition of the
                    slave trade, attempts were made to replace it by a system of importing labourers
                    of the inferior races under contracts for a somewhat lengthened term; and this
                    was in several instances found to degenerate into a sort of legalized slave
                    traffic. About 1867 we began to hear of a system of this kind which was in
                    operation between the South Sea Islands and New Caledonia and the white
                    settlements in Fiji. It seems to have begun in really voluntary agreements; but
                    for these the unscrupulous greed of the traders soon substituted methods of
                    fraud and violence. The natives were decoyed into the labour ships under false
                    pretences, and then detained by force; or they were seized on shore or in their
                    canoes and carried on board. The nature of the engagements to go and work on the
                    plantations was not fully explained to them, and they were hired for periods
                    exceeding the legal term. The area of this trade was ere long further extended.
                    In 1884 attention was drawn in a special degree to the Queensland traffic in
                    Pacific Islanders by the “Hopeful” trials, and a Government commission was
                    appointed to inquire into the methods followed by labour ships in recruiting the
                    natives of New Guinea, the Louisiade Archipelago, and the D’Entrecasteaux group
                    of islands. The result of the investigations, during which nearly five hundred
                    witnesses were examined, was the disclosure of a system which in treachery and
                    atrocity was little inferior to the old African slave trade. These shameful
                    deeds have made the islanders regard it as a duty to avenge their wrongs on any
                    white men they can entice upon their shores. The noble-hearted bishop of
                    Melanesia, John Coleridge Patteson, fell a victim to this retaliation on the
                    island of Nukapu 20th September 1871. The tendency of the whole system is to
                    create a war of races. It may be questioned whether this trade in labour can be
                    safely continued at all; if so, it must be under a constant and vigorous system
                    of surveillance and regulation.</p>
                <p>We have seen that the last vestiges of the monstrous anomaly of modern colonial
                    slavery are disappearing from all civilized states and their foreign
                    possessions. It now remains to consider the slavery of primitive origin which
                    has existed within recent times, or continues to exist, outside of the Western
                    world.</p>
                <p>In Russia, a country which had not the same historical antecedents with the
                    Western nations, properly so called, and which is in fact more correctly classed
                    as Eastern, whilst slavery had disappeared, serfdom was in force down to our own
                    days. The rural population of that country, at the earliest period accessible to
                    our inquiries, consisted of (1) slaves, (2) free agricultural labourers, and (3)
                    peasants proper, who were small farmers or cottiers and members of a commune.
                    The sources of slavery were there, as elsewhere, capture in war, voluntary sale
                    by poor freemen of themselves, sale of insolvent debtors, and the action of the
                    law in certain criminal cases. In the 18th century we find the distinction
                    between the three classes named above effaced, and all of them merged in the
                    class of serfs, who were the property either of the landed proprietors or of the
                    state. They were not even <hi rend="italic">adscripti glebae,</hi> though
                    forbidden to migrate; an imperial ukase of 1721 says, “the proprietors sell
                    their peasants and domestic servants, not even in families, but one by one, like
                    cattle.” This practice, at first tacitly sanctioned by the Government, which
                    received dues on the sales, was at length formally recognized by several
                    imperial ukases. Peter the Great imposed a poll-tax on all the members of the
                    rural population, making the proprietors responsible for the tax charged on
                    their serfs; and the “free wandering people” who were not willing to enter the
                    army were required to settle on the land either as members of a commune or as
                    serfs of some proprietor. The system of serfdom attained its fullest development
                    in the reign of Catherine II. The serfs were bought, sold, and given in
                    presents, sometimes with the land, sometimes without it, sometimes in families
                    and sometimes individually, sale by public auction being alone forbidden, as
                    “unbecoming in a European state.” The proprietors could transport without trial
                    their unruly serfs to Siberia or send them to the mines for life, and those who
                    presented complaints against their masters were punished with the knout and
                    condemned to the mines. The first symptoms of a reaction appear in the reign of
                    Paul (1796-1801). He issued an ukase that the serfs should not be forced to work
                    for their masters more than three days in each week. There were several feeble
                    attempts at further reform, and even abortive projects of emancipation, from the
                    commencement of the present century. But no decisive measures were taken before
                    the accession of Alexander II. (1855). That emperor, after the Crimean War,
                    created a secret committee composed of the great officers of state, called the
                    chief committee for peasant affairs, to study the subject of serf-emancipation.
                    Of this body the grand-duke Constantine was an energetic member. To accelerate
                    the proceedings of the committee advantage was taken of the following incident.
                    In the Lithuanian provinces the relations of the masters and serfs were
                    regulated in the time of Nicholas by what were called inventories. The nobles,
                    dissatisfied with these, now sought to have them revised. The Government
                    interpreted the application as implying a wish for the abolition of serfdom, and
                    issued a rescript authorizing the formation of committees to prepare definite
                    proposals for a gradual emancipation. A circular was soon after sent to the
                    governors and marshals of the nobility all over Russia proper, informing them of
                    this desire of the Lithuanian nobles, and setting out the fundamental principles
                    which should be observed “if the nobles of the provinces should express a
                    similar desire.” Public opinion strongly favoured the projected reform; and even
                    the masters who were opposed to it saw that, if the operation became necessary,
                    it would be more safely for their interests intrusted to the nobles than to the
                    bureaucracy. Accordingly during the year 1858 a committee was created in nearly
                    every province in which serfdom existed. From the schemes prepared by these
                    committees, a general plan had to be elaborated, and the Government appointed a
                    special imperial commission for this purpose. The plan was formed, and, in spite
                    of some opposition from the nobles, which was suppressed, it became law, and
                    serfdom was abolished (19th February = 3d March 1861). Its nature and results
                    have been indicated in Russia, vol. xxi. p. 82. The total number of serfs
                    belonging to proprietors at the time of the emancipation was 21,625,609, of whom
                    20,158,231 were peasant serfs and 1,467,378 domestic serfs. This number does not
                    include the state serfs, who formed about one-half of the rural population.
                    Their position had been better, as a rule, than that of the serfs on private
                    estates; it might indeed, Mr Wallace says, be regarded as “an intermediate
                    position between serfage and freedom.” Amongst them were the serfs on the lands
                    formerly belonging to the church, which had been secularized and transformed
                    into state demesnes by Catherine II. There were also serfs on the apanages
                    affected to the use of the imperial family; these amounted to nearly three and a
                    half millions. Thus by the law of 1861 more than forty millions of serfs were
                    emancipated.</p>
                <p>The slavery of the Mohammedan East is usually not the slavery of the field but of
                    the household. The slave is a member of the family, and is treated with
                    tenderness and affection. The Koran breathes a considerate and kindly spirit
                    towards the class, and encourages manumission. The child of a slave girl by her
                    master is born free, and the mother is usually raised to be a free wife But
                    behind this slavery, however mild in itself, stands the slave trade, with its
                    systematic man-hunting, which has been, and still is, the curse of Africa. The
                    traffic in slaves has been repeatedly declared by the Ottoman Porte to be
                    illegal throughout its dominions, and there have been several conventions
                    between Great Britain and the khedive for its suppression in Egypt; but it is
                    still largely carried on both in the latter country and in Turkey, owing to the
                    laxity and too often the complicity of the Government officials.</p>
                <p>In the days of the colonial slave trade its African centre was the region about
                    the mouths of the rivers Calabar and Bonny, whither the captive negroes were
                    brought from great distances in the interior. As many slaves, Clarkson tells us,
                    came annually from this part of the coast as from all the rest of Africa
                    besides. At present, it is commonly said,—though Cameron in 1875 was otherwise
                    informed,—no slaves are exported from the western side of the continent. The
                    principal centres from which the supply is now furnished to Egypt, Turkey,
                    Arabia, and Persia are three in number. (1) The Soudan, south of the Great
                    Sahara, appears to be one vast hunting-ground. Captives are brought thence to
                    the slave market of Kuka in Bornu, where, after being bought by dealers, they
                    are, to the number of about 10,000 annually, marched over arid desert tracks
                    under a burning sun to Murzuk in Fezzan, from which place they are distributed
                    to the northern and eastern Mediterranean coasts. Their sufferings on the route
                    are dreadful; many succumb and are abandoned. Rohlfs informs us that “any one
                    who did not know the way” by which the caravans pass “would only have to follow
                    the bones which lie right and left of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n159/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0159-0144"/>the track.” Negroes are also brought to Morocco
                    from the Western Soudan and from Timbuktu. The centre of the traffic in Morocco
                    is Sidi Hamed ibn Musa, seven days’ journey south of Mogador, where a great
                    yearly fair is held. The slaves are forwarded thence in gangs to different
                    towns, especially to Morocco city, Fez, and Mequinez. About 4000 are thus
                    annually imported, and an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty is levied by
                    the sultan, which produces about £4800 of annual revenue. The total number of
                    negro slaves in Morocco appears to be about 50,000. (2) The basin of the Nile,
                    extending to the great lakes, is another region infested by the slave trade; the
                    slaves are either smuggled into Egypt or sent by the Red Sea to Turkey. The
                    khedive Ismail in 1869 appointed Sir Samuel Baker to the command of a large
                    force with which he was “to strike a direct blow at the slave trade in its
                    distant nest.” The instructions in the firman issued to him were as follows:—“To
                    subdue to our authority the countries situated to the south of Gondokoro, to
                    suppress the slave trade, to introduce a system of regular commerce, to open to
                    navigation the great lakes of the equator, and to establish a chain of military
                    stations and commercial depots throughout Central Africa.” The work
                    energetically commenced by him was continued by Colonel C. G. Gordon (1874 to
                    1879), but since the revolt of the Soudan, it is to be feared, no trace of his
                    or of Baker’s work remains in the scene of their labours. The most effectual
                    direct methods of dealing with the slave trade in the present territories of
                    Egypt seem to be those suggested by the Anti-Slavery Society to Mr Gladstone’s
                    Government in 1881—extended consular supervision, and a compulsory registration
                    of all existing slaves. (3) There has long been a slave trade from the
                    Portuguese possessions on the East African coast. The stream of supply came
                    mainly from the southern Nyassa districts by three or four routes to Ibo,
                    Mozambique, Angoche, and Kilimane. Madagascar and the Comoro Islands obtained
                    most of their slaves from the Mozambique coast. It was believed in 1862 that
                    about 19,000 passed every year from the Nyassa regions to Zanzibar, whence large
                    supplies were drawn for the markets of Arabia and Persia up to 1873. The mission
                    of Sir Bartle Frere to the sultan of Zanzibar in 1873 brought about a treaty for
                    the suppression of the slave trade, but it is to be feared that the cessation of
                    the traffic from that port has not extinguished the traffic but has in part only
                    given it a different direction, through Somali markets. In Madagascar, which had
                    been supplied from the Mozambique coast, the import and sale of slaves were
                    prohibited within the Hova dominions by Queen Ranavalona II. in June 1877. The
                    rulers of the Comoro Islands, Mohilea and Anjuan (or Johanna), have signed
                    treaties for the abolition of the status of slavery in their dominions after
                    1890, the fulfilment of which, however, it will probably be difficult to
                    enforce. The stations established by the English universities in the valley of
                    the Rovuma and by the Established and Free Churches of Scotland on Lake Nyassa
                    doubtless contributed much to the diminution of the traffic in those parts. It
                    is said that, whereas no less than 10,000 slaves formerly passed the southern
                    end of the Nyassa every year, in 1876 not more than 38 were known to have been
                    conveyed by that route. Lieutenant O’Neill, British consul at Mozambique,
                    writing in 1880, fixed at about 3000 the number then annually exported from the
                    coast between the rivers Rovuma and Zambesi. But since that date the traffic
                    seems to have received a fresh impetus from an increased demand for ivory, the
                    slave and ivory trades being “hand and glove.” The Portuguese appear to be the
                    most determined upholders of the evil system, and in consequence are everywhere
                    detested by the natives.</p>
                <p>There are other minor branches of the trade elsewhere in Africa. Thus from Harar
                    in Somâli-land caravans are sent to Berbera on the coast, where there is a great
                    annual fair. The slaves are collected from the inland Galla countries, from
                    Gurâgwe, and from Abyssinia.</p>
                <p>Clarkson first, and Buxton afterwards, whilst they urged all other means for the
                    suppression or discouragement of the slave trade and slavery, saw clearly that
                    the only thoroughly effectual method would be the development of legitimate
                    commerce in Africa itself. When Buxton published in 1840 his book entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Slave Trade and its Remedy,</hi> this was the remedy he
                    contemplated. The unfortunate Niger expedition of 1841 was directed to similar
                    ends; and it has been more and more felt by all who were interested in the
                    subject that here lies the radical solution of the great problem. It was for
                    some time thought that from Sierra Leone as a centre industry and civilization
                    might be diffused amongst the nations of the continent; and in 1822 the colony
                    (which in 1847 became the independent republic) of Liberia had been founded by
                    Americans with a similar object; but in neither case have these expectations
                    been fulfilled. A new, and it would seem really hopeful, effort for the same
                    great end has recently been undertaken.</p>
                <p>Leopold II., king of the Belgians, invited in September 1876 representative
                    geographers to a conference in his palace, to discuss the question of the
                    exploration and civilization of Africa through the development of commerce and
                    the abolition of the slave trade.</p>
                <p>Six European nations were represented, and an International African Association
                    was formed. The central committee organized seven successive expeditions from
                    the east coast to Lake Tanganyika. The exploration of the Congo by Stanley
                    turned attention to the west coast, and he went out to the Congo in 1879 as
                    commander-in-chief of the association, to open up that river. The association
                    obtained, by treaties with the native chiefs, the cession of certain
                    territories. The recognition of its flag and its territorial rights by the
                    European Powers has transformed the association into the Congo Free State. A
                    conference was held at Berlin on 15th November 1884, attended by
                    plenipotentiaries from all the European states, to regulate the position of the
                    new state, and one of its declarations was that “these regions shall not be used
                    as markets or routes of transit for the trade in slaves, no matter of what race;
                    each of these powers binds itself to use all the means at its disposal to put an
                    end to this trade and to punish those engaged in it.” The territory of the new
                    state was fixed so as to comprise 1,065,200 square miles, with an estimated
                    population of 42,608,000 souls. Stations have been built at points extending for
                    nearly 1500 miles into the centre of Africa.</p>
                <p>There are, it cannot be denied, real dangers connected with this great enterprise
                    for the civilization of Africa. Disputes may arise between the powers having
                    interests in the territories of the new state, and, still worse, the natives may
                    be led to take sides in such disputes. That the African population should be
                    sometimes oppressed, or have justice denied them, by European traders or
                    officials is by no means unlikely in the present state of opinion with respect
                    to our duties towards the retarded races. Difficulties, too, may be created by
                    the rivalries and mutual jealousies of the missionaries of the several Western
                    communions. But, whilst foreseeing these possibilities and urging the necessity
                    of guarding, as far as possible, against the evils referred to, we ought not to
                    view in a grudging or suspicious spirit an enterprise which is begun with pure
                    intentions, and will probably do much to right the wrongs and improve the
                    position of a deeply-injured portion of our race. The establishment of the state
                    will be no reason for the cessation of any effort which Western Governments can
                    make, by the exercise of influence and by remonstrance, to induce Turkey and
                    Egypt to fulfil their engagements respecting the slave trade. The rulers of
                    those states are well disposed to appropriate the results of more advanced
                    civilization; and we need not despair of the disappearance in Mohammedan
                    communities of slave-holding and its ally polygamy, since those practices are
                    not enjoined, but only tolerated, by a religious code which social progress will
                    inevitably lead its adherents to modify by interpretation.</p>

                    to slavery and serfdom; but they are somewhat loose and uncritical; the author,
                    too, repeats himself much, and dwells on many topics scarcely if at all
                    connected with his main themes. The largest and most philosophical views on
                    slavery generally will be found in Hume’s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> “On the
