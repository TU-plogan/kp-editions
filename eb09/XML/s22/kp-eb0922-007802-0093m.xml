                    of mounted Indian fighters, which kept him in the Seminole country, young Simms
                    was brought up by his grandmother, who gave him as good an education as her
                    limited means would allow. He was clerk in a drug store for some years, and
                    afterwards studied law, the bar of Charleston admitting him to practice in 1827,
                    but he soon abandoned his profession for literature. At the age of eight he
                    wrote verses, and in his 19th year he produced a <hi rend="italic">Monody on
                    Gen. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.</hi> Two years later, in 1827, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyrical and Other Poems</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Early Lays</hi>
                    appeared; and in 1828 he began journalism, editing with conspicuous ability and
                    partly owning the <hi rend="italic">City Gazette—</hi> a paper opposed to the
                    doctrine of nullification. The enterprise failed, and the editor devoted his
                    attention entirely to letters, and in rapid succession published <hi
                    rend="italic">The Vision of Cortes, Cain, and other Poems</hi> (1829), <hi
                    rend="italic">The Tricolor, or Three Days of Blood in Paris</hi> (1830), and his
                    strongest poem, <hi rend="italic">Atalantis,</hi> a story of the sea (1832). <hi
                    rend="italic">Atalantis</hi> established his fame as an author, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Martin Faber,</hi> the story of a criminal, his first tale,
                    written in the following year, was warmly received. From this time forward his
                    writings became very abundant; a classified list is given below. Though
                    sensational and full of excessive colouring, they are held in good repute in the
                    Southern States. During the American Civil War Simms espoused the side of the
                    Secessionists in a weekly newspaper, and suffered damage at the hands of the
                    Federal troops when they entered Charleston. He held a seat in the State
                    legislature for some years, and the university of Alabama conferred on him the
                    degree of LL.D. He died at Charleston on 11th June 1870.</p>
                <p>In addition to the works mentioned above, Simms published the following poetry :—
                    <hi rend="italic">Southern Passages and Pictures,</hi> lyrical, sentimental, and
                    descriptive poems, 1839; <hi rend="italic">Donna Florida,</hi> 1843; <hi
                    rend="italic">Grouped Thoughts and Scattered Fancies,</hi> sonnets, 1845; <hi
                    rend="italic">Areytos, or Songs of the South,</hi> 1846; <hi rend="italic">Lays
                    of the Palmetto,</hi> 1848; <hi rend="italic">The Eye and the Wing,</hi> 1848;
                    <hi rend="italic">The Cassique of Accabee, a Tale of Ashley River,</hi> with
                    other pieces, 1849; <hi rend="italic">The City of the Silent,</hi> 1850. To
                    dramatic literature he contributed <hi rend="italic">Norman Maurice, or the Man
                    of the People; Michael Bonham, or the Fall of the Alamo</hi>; and a stage
                    adaptation of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> all of which have been
                    acted with success. His revolutionary romances are— <hi rend="italic">The
                    Partisan,</hi> 1835; <hi rend="italic">Mellichampe,</hi> 1836; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Katherine Walton, or the Rebel of Dorchester,</hi> 1851; <hi rend="italic">The
                    Scout</hi> (originally <hi rend="italic">The Kinsman), or the Black Riders of

                    rend="italic">The Sword and the Distaff),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eutaw,</hi>
                    1856. These tales describe social life at Charleston, and the action covers the
                    whole revolutionary period, with faithful portraits of the political and
                    military leaders of the time. Of border tales the list includes <hi

                    series of which <hi rend="italic">Martin Faber</hi> was the first, and treating
                    principally of domestic life and motive, are <hi rend="italic">Carl Werner,</hi>

                    also a frequent contributor to the magazines and literary papers, six of which
                    he founded and conducted. He wrote on a great variety of subjects, and discussed
                    with spirit and boldness the leading political, social, and literary topics of
                    the day. In the discussion on slavery he upheld the views of the pro-slavery
                    party. He edited the seven dramas ascribed to Shakespeare, with notes and an
                    introduction to each play. In the capacity of lecturer and orator, he was in
