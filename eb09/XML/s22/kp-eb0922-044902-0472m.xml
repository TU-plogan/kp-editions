                    the Swiss city to the study of mathematics, and acquiring from the associations
                    connected with Switzerland an intense love of liberty. He contested the
                    representation of the city of Westminster without success in 1774, when only
                    just of age; but from the general election of 1780 until his accession to the
                    peerage on the 7th of March 1786 he represented through the influence of Lord
                    Shelburne the Buckinghamshire borough of High Wycombe, and during the sessions
                    of 1783 and 1784 he gave his support to the administration of William Pitt,
                    whose sister Lady Hester Pitt he married on 19th December 1774. When Pitt ceased
                    to be inspired by the Liberal principles of his early days, his brother-in-law
                    severed their political connexion and opposed with all the impetuosity of his
                    fiery heart the arbitrary measures which the ministry favoured. Lord Stanhope’s
                    character was without any taint of meanness, and his conduct was marked by a
                    lofty consistency never influenced by any petty motives; but his speeches, able
                    as they were, had no weight on the minds of his compeers in the upper chamber,
                    and, from a disregard of their prejudices, too often drove them into the
                    opposite lobby. He was the chairman of the “Revolution Society," founded in
                    honour of the Revolution of 1688, the members of which in 1790 expressed their
                    sympathy with the aims of the French republicans. He brought forward in 1794 the
                    case of Muir, one of the Edinburgh politicians who were transported to Botany
                    Bay, and in 1795 he introduced into the Lords a motion deprecating any
                    interference with the internal affairs of France. In all of these points he was
                    hopelessly beaten, and in the last of them he was in a “minority of one ”—a
                    sobriquet which stuck to him throughout life,—whereupon he seceded from
                    parliamentary life for five years. The lean and awkward figure of Lord Stanhope
                    figured in a host of the caricatures of Sayers and Gillray, reflecting on his
                    political opinions and his personal relations with his children. His first wife
                    died on 20th July 1780, and he married on 17th March 1781 Louisa, daughter and
                    sole heiress of the Hon. Henry Grenville (governor of Barbados in 1746 and
                    ambassador to the Porte in 1762), a younger brother of the first Earl Temple and
                    George Grenville. Through his union with this lady, who survived until March
                    1829, he was doubly connected with the family of Grenville. By his first wife he
                    had three daughters, one of whom was Lady Hester Stanhope (see below), and his
                    second wife was the mother of three sons. Lord Stanhope died at the family seat
                    of Chevening, Kent, on 15th December 1816.</p>
                <p>Earl Stanhope was elected a fellow of the Royal Society so early as November
                    1772, and devoted a large part of his income to experiments in science and
                    philosophy. He invented a method of securing buildings from fire (which,
                    however, proved impracticable), the printing press and the lens which bear his
                    name, and a monochord for tuning musical instruments, suggested improvements in
                    canal locks, made experiments in steam navigation in 1795-97, and contrived two
                    calculating machines. When he acquired an extensive property in Devonshire, he
                    projected a canal through that county from the Bristol to the English Channel
                    and took the levels himself. Electricity was another of the subjects which he
                    studied, and the volume of <hi rend="italic">Principles of Electricity</hi>
                    which he issued in 1779 contained the rudiments of his theory on the “return
                    stroke” resulting from the contact with the earth of the electric current of
                    lightning, which were afterwards amplified in a contribution to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1787. His principal labours in
                    literature consisted of a reply to Burke’s <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the
                    French Revolution</hi> (1790) and an <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> on the rights
                    of juries (1792), and he long meditated the compilation of a digest of the
                    statutes. His scientific theories, his mechanical experiments, and his studies
                    in music absorbed all his thoughts, and for them he neglected his wives and his
                    children. His youngest daughter, Lady Lucy Rachael Stanhope, eloped with Mr
                    Thomas Taylor of Sevenoaks, the family apothecary, and her father refused to be
                    reconciled to her, an inconsistency in a republican which subjected him to a
                    caricature from Gillray. Lady Hester Stanhope abandoned her home and went to
                    live with her mother’s relations. Lord Stanhope’s high qualities were marred by
                    an impracticable disposition.</p>
