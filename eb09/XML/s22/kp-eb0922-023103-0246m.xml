                    of the leaders of Greek thought and culture. He began life as a sculptor; and in
                    the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> a group of the Graces, supposed to
                    be his work, was still to be seen on the road to the Acropolis. But he soon
                    abandoned art and gave himself to what may best be called education, conceiving
                    that he had a divine commission, witnessed by oracles, dreams, and signs, not
                    indeed to teach any positive doctrine, but to convict men of ignorance mistaking
                    itself for knowledge, and by so doing to promote their intellectual and moral
                    improvement. He was on terms of intimacy with some of the most distinguished of
                    his Athenian contemporaries, and, at any rate in later life, was personally
                    known to very many of his fellow-citizens. His domestic relations were, it is
                    said, unhappy. The shrewishness of his wife Xanthippe became proverbial with the
                    ancients, as it still is with ourselves. Aristotle, in his remarks upon genius
                    and its degeneracy <hi rend="italic">(Rhet.,</hi> ii. 15), speaks of Socrates’s
                    sons as dull and fatuous; and in Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi>
                    one of them, Lamprocles, receives a formal rebuke for undutiful behaviour
                    towards his mother.</p>
                <p>Socrates served as a hoplite at Potidaea (432-429), where on one occasion he
                    saved the life of Alcibiades, at Delium (424), and at Amphipolis (422). In these
                    campaigns his bravery and endurance were conspicuous. But, while he thus
                    performed the ordinary duties of a Greek citizen with credit, he neither
                    attained nor sought political position. His “divine voice,” he said, had warned
                    him to refrain from politics, presumably because office would have entailed the
                    sacrifice of his principles and the abandonment of his proper vocation. Yet in
                    406 he was a member of the senate; and on the first day of the trial of the
                    victors of Arginusae, being president of the prytanes, he resisted— first, in
                    conjunction with his colleagues, afterwards, when they yielded, alone—the
                    illegal and unconstitutional proposal of Callixenus, that the fate of the eight
                    generals should be decided by a single vote of the assembly. Not less courageous
                    than this opposition to the “civium ardor prava jubentium” was his disregard of
                    the “vultus instantis tyranni” two years later. During the reign of terror of
                    404 the Thirty, anxious to implicate in their crimes men of repute who might
                    otherwise have opposed their plans, ordered five citizens, one of whom was
                    Socrates, to go to<pb break="no"

                    Leon. Socrates alone disobeyed. But, though he was exceptionally obnoxious to
                    the Thirty,—as appears, not only in this incident, but also in their threat of
                    punishment under a special ordinance forbidding “the teaching of the art of
                    argument,”—it was reserved for the reconstituted democracy to bring him to trial
                    and to put him to death. In 399, four years after the restoration and the
                    amnesty, he was indicted as an offender against public morality. His accusers
                    were Meletus the poet, Anytus the tanner, and Lycon the orator, all of them
                    members of the democratic or patriot party who had returned from Phyle with
                    Thrasybulus. The accusation ran thus: “Socrates is guilty, firstly, of denying
                    the gods recognized by the state and introducing new divinities, and secondly,
                    of corrupting the young.” In his unpremeditated defence, so far from seeking to
                    conciliate his judges, Socrates defied them. He was found guilty by 280 votes,
                    it is supposed, against 220. Meletus having called for capital punishment, it
                    now rested with the accused to make a counter-proposition; and there can be
                    little doubt that, had Socrates without further remark suggested some smaller
                    but yet substantial penalty, the proposal would have been accepted. But, to the
                    amazement of the judges and the distress of his friends, Socrates proudly
                    declared that for the services which he had rendered to the city he deserved,
                    not punishment, but the reward of a public benefactor,—maintenance in the
                    Prytaneum at the cost of the state; and, although at the close of his speech he
                    professed himself willing to pay a fine of one mina, and upon the urgent
                    entreaties of his friends raised the amount of his offer to thirty minas, he
                    made no attempt to disguise his indifference to the result. His attitude
                    exasperated the judges, and the penalty of death was decreed by an increased
                    majority. Then in a short address Socrates declared his contentment with his own
                    conduct and with the sentence. Whether death was a dreamless sleep or a new life
                    in Hades, where he would have opportunities of testing the wisdom of the heroes
                    and the sages of antiquity, in either case he esteemed it a gain to die. In the
                    same spirit he refused to take advantage of a scheme arranged by his friend
                    Crito for an escape from prison. Under ordinary circumstances the condemned
                    criminal drank the cup of hemlock on the day after the trial; but in the case of
                    Socrates the rule that during the absence of the sacred ship sent annually to
                    Delos no one should be put to death caused an exceptional delay. For thirty days
                    he remained in imprisonment, receiving his intimates and conversing with them in
                    his accustomed manner. How in his last conversation he argued that the wise man
                    will regard approaching death with a cheerful confidence Plato relates in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Phaedo;</hi> and, while the central argument—which rests the
                    doctrine of the soul’s immortality upon the theory of ideas—must be accounted
                    Platonic, in all other respects the narrative, though not that of an
                    eye-witness, has the air of accuracy and truth.</p>
                <p>But what were the personal characteristics which won for this man, poor in
                    worldly goods, the affectionate regard of the best of his contemporaries? Why
                    was it that the Athenians, forgetting his loyal performance of civic duties, his
                    virtuous life, and his disinterested anxiety for their welfare, brought him to
                    trial, condemned him, put him to death? What were the principles upon which his
                    teaching rested, and what was the message which, instant in season, out of
                    season, he carried to his countrymen? How were his principles interpreted by his
                    followers, and what influence did his teaching exert upon subsequent
                    speculation? These are the questions which demand consideration in the present
                    article.</p>
                <p>Happily, though Socrates left no writings behind him, and indeed, as will
                    hereafter appear, was by his principles precluded from dogmatic exposition, we
                    have in the <hi rend="italic">’Απομνημονεύματα</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs</hi> and other works of Xenophon records of Socrates’s conversation,
                    and in the dialogues of Plato refined applications of his method. Xenophon,
                    having no philosophical views of his own to develop, and no imagination to lead
                    him astray,—being, in fact, to Socrates what Boswell was to Johnson,—is an
                    excellent witness. The <hi rend="italic">’Απομνημονεύματα</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Memorabilia</hi> are indeed confessedly apologetic, and it is easy
                    to see that nothing is introduced which might embitter those who, hating
                    Socrates, were ready to persecute the Socratics; but the plain, straightforward
                    narrative of Socrates’s talk, on many occasions, with many dissimilar
                    interlocutors, carries with it in its simplicity and congruity the evidence of
                    substantial justice and truth. Plato, though he understood his master better, is
                    a less trustworthy authority, as he makes Socrates the mouthpiece of his own
                    more advanced and even antagonistic doctrine. Yet to all appearance the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology</hi> is a careful and exact account of Socrates’s habits
                    and principles of action; the earlier dialogues, those which are commonly called
                    “Socratic,” represent, with such changes only as are necessitated by their form,
                    Socrates’s method; and, if in the later and more important dialogues the
                    doctrine is the doctrine of Plato, echoes of the master’s teaching are still
                    discoverable, approving themselves as such by their accord with the Xenophontean
                    testimony. In the face of these two principal witnesses other evidence is of
                    small importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Personal Characteristics.—</hi> What, then, were the personal
                    characteristics of the man? Outwardly his presence was mean and his countenance
                    grotesque. Short of stature, thick-necked, and somewhat corpulent, with
                    prominent eyes, with nose upturned and nostrils outspread, with large mouth and
                    coarse lips, he seemed the embodiment of sensuality and even stupidity. Inwardly
                    he was, as his friends knew, “so pious that he did nothing without taking
                    counsel of the gods, so just that he never did an injury to any man, whilst he
                    was the benefactor of his associates, so temperate that he never preferred
                    pleasure to right, so wise that in judging of good and evil he was never at
                    fault,—in a word, the best and the happiest of men.” “His self-control was
                    absolute; his powers of endurance were unfailing; he had so schooled himself to
                    moderation that his scanty means satisfied all his wants.” “To want nothing,” he
                    said himself, “is divine; to want as little as possible is the nearest possible
                    approach to the divine life”; and accordingly he practised temperance and
                    selfdenial to a degree which some thought ostentatious and affected. Yet the
                    hearty enjoyment of social pleasures was another of his marked characteristics;
                    for to abstain from innocent gratification from fear of falling into excess
                    would have seemed to him to imply either a pedantic formalism or a lack of real
                    self-control. In short, his strength of will, if by its very perfection it led
                    to his theoretical identification of virtue and knowledge, secured him in
                    practice against the ascetic extravagances of his associate Antisthenes.</p>
                <p>The intellectual gifts of Socrates were hardly less remarkable than his moral
                    virtues. Naturally observant, acute, and thoughtful, he developed these
                    qualities by constant and systematic use. The exercise of the mental powers was,
                    he conceived, no mere occupation of leisure hours, but rather a sacred and
                    ever-present duty; because, moral error being intellectual error translated into
                    act, he who would live virtuously must first rid himself of ignorance and folly.
                    He had, it may be conjectured, but little turn for philosophical speculation;
                    yet by the careful study of the ethical problems which met him in himself and in
                    others he acquired a remarkable tact in dealing with questions of practical
                    morality; and in the course of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0248-0233"/> the lifelong war which he waged against vagueness
                    of thought and laxity of speech he made himself a singularly apt and ready
                    reasoner.</p>
                <p>While he regarded the improvement, not only of himself but also of others, as a
                    task divinely appointed to him, there was in his demeanour nothing exclusive or
                    pharisaical. On the contrary, deeply conscious of his own limitations and
                    infirmities, he felt and cherished a profound sympathy with erring humanity, and
                    loved with a love passing the love of women fellow-men who had not learnt, as he
                    had done, to overcome human frailties and weaknesses. Nevertheless great wrongs
                    roused in him a righteous indignation which sometimes found expression in fierce
                    and angry rebuke. Indeed it would seem that Plato in his idealized portrait
                    gives his hero credit not only for a deeper philosophical insight but also for a
                    greater urbanity than facts warranted. Hence, whilst those who knew him best met
                    his affection with a regard equal to his own, there were, as will be seen
                    hereafter, some who never forgave his stern reproofs, and many who regarded him
                    as an impertinent busybody.</p>
                <p>He was a true patriot. Deeply sensible of his debt to the city in which he had
                    been born and bred, he thought that in giving his life to the spread of sounder
                    views in regard to ethical and political subjects he made no more than an
                    imperfect return; and, when in the exercise of constitutional authority that
                    city brought him to trial and threatened him with death, it was not so much his
                    local attachment, strong though that sentiment was, as rather his sense of duty
                    which forbade him to retire into exile before the trial began, to acquiesce in a
                    sentence of banishment when the verdict had been given against him, and to
                    accept the opportunity of escape which was offered him during his imprisonment.
                    Yet his patriotism had none of the narrowness which was characteristic of the
                    patriotism of his Greek contemporaries. His generous benevolence and unaffected
                    philanthropy taught him to overstep the limits of the Athenian demus and the
                    Hellenic race, and to regard himself as a “citizen of the world.”</p>
                <p>He was blest with an all-pervading humour, a subtle but kindly appreciation of
                    the incongruities of human nature and conduct. In a less robust character this
                    quality might have degenerated into sentimentality or cynicism; in Socrates, who
                    had not a trace of either, it showed itself principally in what his
                    contemporaries knew as his “accustomed irony.” Profoundly sensible of the
                    inconsistencies of his own thoughts and words and actions, and shrewdly
                    suspecting that the like inconsistencies were to be found in other men, he was
                    careful always to place himself upon the standpoint of ignorance and to invite
                    others to join him there, in order that, proving all things, he and they might
                    hold fast that which is good. “Intellectually the acutest man of his age,” says
                    W. H. Thompson in a brilliant and instructive appendix to his edition of Plato’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Phaedrus,</hi> “he represents himself in all companies as the
                    dullest person present. Morally the purest, he affects to be the slave of
                    passion, and borrows the language of gallantry to describe a benevolence too
                    exalted for the comprehension of his contemporaries. He is by turns an <hi
                    rend="italic">ἐραστής,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">πρoαγωγός,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">µαστρoπός</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">µαιευτικoς</hi>, disguising
                    the sanctity of his true vocation by names suggestive of vile or ridiculous
                    images. The same spirit of whimsical paradox leads him, in Xenophon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Banquet,</hi> to argue that bis own satyr-like visage was superior
                    in beauty to that of the handsomest man present. That this irony was to some
                    extent calculated is more than probable; it disarmed ridicule by anticipating
                    it; it allayed jealousy and propitiated envy; and it possibly procured him
                    admission into gay circles from which a more solemn teacher would have been
                    excluded. But it had for its basis a real greatness of soul, a hearty and
                    unaffected disregard of public opinion, a perfect disinterestedness, an entire
                    abnegation of self. He made himself a fool that others by his folly might be
                    made wise; he humbled himself to the level of those among whom his work lay that
                    he might raise some few among them to his own level; he was ‘ all things to all
                    men, if by any means he might win some.’” It would seem that this humorous
                    depreciation of his own great qualities, this pretence of being no better than
                    his neigh bours, led to grave misapprehension amongst his contemporaries. That
                    it was the foundation of the slanders of the Peripatetic Aristoxenus can hardly
                    be doubted.</p>
                <p>Socrates was further a man of sincere and fervent piety. “No one,” says Xenophon,
                    “ever knew of his doing or saying anything profane or unholy.” There was indeed
                    in the popular mythology much which he could not accept. It was incredible, he
                    argued, that the gods should have committed acts which would be disgraceful in
                    the worst of men. Such stories, then, must be regarded as the inventions of
                    lying poets. But, when he had thus purified the contemporary polytheism, he was
                    able to reconcile it with his own steadfast belief in a Supreme Being, the
                    intelligent and beneficent Creator of the universe, and to find in the national
                    ritual the means of satisfying his religious aspirations. For proof of the
                    existence of “the divine,” he appealed to the providential arrangement of
                    nature, to the universality of the belief, and to the revelations and warnings
                    which are given to men through signs and oracles. Thinking that the soul of man
                    partook of the divine, he maintained the doctrine of its immortality as an
                    article of faith, but not of knowledge. While he held that, the gods alone
                    knowing what is for man’s benefit, man should pray, not for particular goods,
                    but only for that which is good, he was regular in prayer and punctual in
                    sacrifice. He looked to oracles and signs for guidance in those matters, and in
                    those matters only, which could not be resolved by experience and judgment, and
                    he further supposed himself to receive special warnings of a mantic character
                    through what he called his “divine sign” (<hi rend="italic">δαιµόvιov</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">δαιμόvιov σηµειov</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>Socrates’s frequent references to his “divine sign” were, says Xenophon, the
                    origin of the charge of “introducing new divinities” brought against him by his
                    accusers, and in early Christian times, amongst Neoplatonic philosophers and
                    fathers of the church, gave rise to the notion that he supposed himself to be
                    attended by a “genius” or “daemon.” Similarly in our own day spiritualists have
                    attributed to him the belief—which they justify—in “an intelligent spiritual
                    being who accompanied him through life,—in other words, a guardian spirit” (A.
                    R. Wallace). But the very precise testimony of Xenophon and Plato shows plainly
                    that Socrates did not regard his “customary sign” either as a divinity or as a
                    genius. According to Xenophon, the sign was a warning, either to do or not to do
                    which it would be folly to neglect, not superseding ordinary prudence, but
                    dealing with those uncertainties in respect of which other men found guidance in
                    oracles and tokens; Socrates believed in it profoundly, and never disobeyed it.
                    According to Plato, the sign was a “voice” which warned Socrates to refrain from
                    some act which he contemplated; he heard it frequently and on the most trifling
                    occasions; the phenomenon dated from his early years, and was, so far as he
                    knew, peculiar to himself. These statements have been variously interpreted.
                    Thus it has been maintained that, in laying claim to supernatural revelations,
                    Socrates (1) committed a pious fraud, (2) indulged his “accustomed irony,” (3)
                    recognized the voice of conscience, (4) indicated a general belief in a divine
                    mission, (5) described “the inward voice of his individual tact, which in
                    consequence partly of his experience and penetration, partly of his knowledge of
                    himself and exact appreciation of what was in harmony with his individuality,
                    had attained to an unusual accuracy,” (6) was mad (“était fou”), being subject
                    not only to hallucinations of sense but also to aberrations of reason.
                    Xenophon’s testimony that Socrates was plainly sincere in his belief excludes
                    the first and the second of these theories; the character of the warnings given,
                    which are always concerned, not with the moral worth of actions, but with their
                    uncertain results, warrants the rejection of the third and the fourth; the
                    fifth, while it sufficiently accounts for the matter of the warning, leaves
                    unexplained its manner, the vocal utterance; the sixth, while it plausibly ex<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0249-0234"/> plains the manner of the warning, goes beyond the
                    facts when it attributes to it irrationality of matter. It remains for us, then,
                    modifying the fifth hypothesis, that of Diderot, Zeller, and others, and the
                    sixth, that of Lélut and Littré, and combining the two, to suppose that Socrates
                    was subject, not indeed to delusions of mind, but to hallucinations of the sense
                    of hearing, so that the rational suggestions of his own brain, exceptionally
                    valuable in consequence of the accuracy and delicacy of his highly cultivated
                    tact, seemed to him to be projected without him, and to be returned to him
                    through the outward ear. It appears that, though in some of the best known
                    instances—for example, those of Cowper and Sidney Walker—hallucinations of the
                    sense of hearing, otherwise closely resembling Socrates’s “divine sign,” have
                    been accompanied by partial derangement of reason, cases are not wanting in
                    which “the thoughts transformed into external sensorial impressions” are
                    perfectly rational.</p>
                <p>The eccentricity of Socrates’s life was not less remarkable than the oddity of
                    his appearance and the irony of his conversation. His whole time was spent in
                    public,—in the market-place, the streets, the gymnasia. Thinking with Dr Johnson
                    that “a great city is the school for studying life,” he had no liking for the
                    country, and seldom passed the gates. “Fields and trees,” Plato makes him
                    say,</p>
                <p>“won’t teach me anything; the life of the streets will.” He talked to all
                    comers,—to the craftsman and the artist as willingly as to the poet or the
                    politician,—questioning them about their affairs, about the processes of their
                    several occupations, about their notions of morality, in a word, about familiar
                    matters in which they might be expected to take an interest. The ostensible
                    purpose of these interrogatories was to test, and thus either refute or explain,
                    the famous oracle which had pronounced him the wisest of men. Conscious of his
                    own ignorance, he had at first imagined that the God was mistaken. When,
                    however, experience showed that those who esteemed themselves wise were unable
                    to give an account of their knowledge, he had to admit that, as the oracle had
                    said, he was wiser than others, in so far as, whilst they, being ignorant,
                    supposed themselves to know, he, being ignorant, was aware of his ignorance.
                    Such, according to the <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> was Socrates’s account of
                    his procedure and its results. But it is easy to see that the statement is
                    coloured by the accustomed irony. When in the same speech Socrates tells his
                    judges that he would never from fear of death or any other motive disobey the
                    command of the god, and that, if they put him to death, the loss would be, not
                    his, but theirs, since they would not readily find any one to take his place, it
                    becomes plain that he conceived himself to hold a commission to educate, and was
                    consciously seeking the intellectual and moral improvement of his countrymen.
                    His end could not be achieved without the sacrifice of self. His meat and drink
                    were of the poorest; summer and winter his coat was the same; he was shoeless
                    and shirtless. “A slave whose master made him live as you do,” says a sophist in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi> "would run away.” But by the surrender
                    of the luxuries and the comforts of life Socrates secured for himself the
                    independence which was necessary that he might go about his appointed business,
                    and therewith he was content.</p>
                <p>His message was to all, but it was variously received. Those who heard him
                    perforce and occasionally were apt to regard his teaching either with
                    indifference or with irritation,—with indifference if, as might be, they failed
                    to see in the elenchus anything more than elaborate trifling; with irritation
                    if, as was probable, they perceived that, in spite of his assumed ignorance,
                    Socrates was well aware of the result to which their enforced answers tended.
                    Amongst those who deliberately sought and sedulously cultivated his acquaintance
                    there were some who attached themselves to him as they might have attached
                    themselves to any ordinary sophist, conceiving that by temporary contact with so
                    acute a reasoner they would best prepare themselves for the logomachies of the
                    law courts, the assembly, and the senate. Again, there were others who saw in
                    Socrates at once master, counsellor, and friend, and hoped by associating with
                    him “to become good men and true, capable of doing their duty by house and
                    household, by relations and friends, by city and fellow-citizens” (Xenophon).
                    Finally, there was a little knot of intimates who, having something of
                    Socrates’s enthusiasm, entered more deeply than the rest into his principles,
                    and, when he died, transmitted them to the next generation. Yet even those who
                    belonged to this inner circle were united, not by any common doctrine, but by a
                    common admiration for their master’s intellect and character.</p>
                <p>For the paradoxes of Socrates’s personality and the eccentricity of his
                    behaviour, if they offended the many, fascinated the few. “It is not easy for a
                    man in my condition,” says the intoxicated Alcibiades in Plato’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Symposium,</hi> “to describe the singularity of Socrates’s
                    character. But I will try to tell his praises in similitudes. He is like the
                    piping Silenes in the statuaries’ shops, which, when you open them, are found to
                    contain images of gods. Or, again, he is like the satyr Marsyas, not only in
                    outward appearance—that, Socrates, you will yourself allow— but in other ways
                    also. Like him, you are given to frolic, —I can produce evidence to that; and,
                    above all, like him, you are a wonderful musician. Only there is this
                    difference,—what he does with the help of his instrument you do with mere words;
                    for whatsoever man, woman, or child hears you, or even a feeble report of what
                    you have said, is struck with awe and possessed with admiration. As for myself,
                    were I not afraid that you would think me more drunk than I am, I would tell you
                    on oath how his words have moved me,—ay, and how they move me still. When I
                    listen to him my heart beats with a more than Corybantic excitement; he has only
                    to speak and my tears flow. Orators, such as Pericles, never moved me in this
                    way,—never roused my soul to the thought of my servile condition; but this
                    Marsyas makes me think that life is not worth living so long as I am what I am.
                    Even now, if I were to listen, I could not resist. So there is nothing for me
                    but to stop my ears against this siren’s song and fly for my life, that I may
                    not grow old sitting at his feet. No one would think that I had any shame in me;
                    but I am ashamed in the presence of Socrates.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Accusation and its Causes.—</hi> The life led by Socrates
                    was not likely to win for him either the affection or the esteem of the vulgar.
                    Those who did not know him personally, seeing him with the eyes of the comic
                    poets, conceived him as a “visionary” (<hi rend="italic">μετεωρoληγoς</hi>) and
                    a “bore” (<hi rend="italic">ἀδoλέσχης</hi>). Those who had faced him in
                    argument, even if they had not smarted under his rebukes, had at any rate winced
                    under his interrogatory, and regarded him in consequence with feelings of
                    dislike and fear. But the eccentricity of his genius and the ill-will borne
                    towards him by individuals are not of themselves sufficient to account for the
                    tragedy of 399. It thus becomes necessary to study the circumstances of the
                    trial, and to investigate the motives which led the accusers to seek his death
                    and the people of Athens to acquiesce in it.</p>
                <p>Socrates was accused (1) of denying the gods recognized by the state and
                    introducing instead of them strange divinities (<hi rend="italic"
                    >δαιμόνια</hi>), and (2) of corrupting the young. The first of these charges
                    rested upon the notorious fact that he supposed himself to be guided by a divine
                    visitant or sign (<hi rend="italic">δαιμόνιον</hi>). The second, Xenophon tells
                    us, was supported by a series of particular allegations,—(<hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>) that he taught his associates to despise the institutions of the state,
                    and especially election by lot; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that he had numbered
                    amongst his associates Critias and Alcibiades, the most dangerous of the
                    representatives of the oligarchical and democratical parties respectively; (<hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>) that he taught the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"

                    prefer his own authority to theirs; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that he was in
                    the habit of quoting mischievous passages of Homer and Hesiod to the prejudice
                    of morality and democracy.</p>
                <p>It is plain that the defence was not calculated to conciliate a hostile jury.
                    Nevertheless, it is at first sight difficult to understand how an adverse
                    verdict became possible. If Socrates rejected portions of the conventional
                    mythology, he accepted the established faith and performed its offices with
                    exemplary regularity. If he talked of a <hi rend="italic">δαιμόνιον,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">δαιμόνιον</hi> was no new divinity, but a mantic sign divinely
                    accorded to him, presumably by the gods of the state. If he questioned the
                    propriety of certain of the institutions of Athens, he was prepared to yield an
                    unhesitating obedience to all. He had never countenanced the misdeeds of Critias
                    and Alcibiades, and indeed, by a sharp censure, had earned the undying hatred of
                    one of them. Duty to parents he inculcated as he inculcated other virtues; and,
                    if he made the son wiser than the father, surely that was not a fault. The
                    citation of a few lines from the poets ought not to weigh against the clear
                    evidence of his large-hearted patriotism; and it might be suspected that the
                    accuser had strangely misrepresented his application of the familiar words.</p>
                <p>To the modern reader Xenophon’s reply, of which the foregoing paragraph is in
                    effect a summary, will probably seem sufficient, and more than sufficient. But
                    it must not be forgotten that Athenians of the old school approached the subject
                    from an entirely different point of view. Socrates was in all things an
                    innovator,—in religion, inasmuch as he sought to eliminate from the theology of
                    his contemporaries “those lies which poets tell”; in politics, inasmuch as he
                    distrusted several institutions dear to Athenian democracy; in education,
                    inasmuch as he waged war against authority, and in a certain sense made each man
                    the measure of his own actions. It is because Socrates was an innovator that we,
                    who see in him the founder of philosophical inquiry, regard him as a great man;
                    it was because Socrates was an innovator that old-fashioned Athenians, who saw
                    in the new-fangled culture the origin of all their recent distresses and
                    disasters, regarded him as a great criminal. It is, then, after all in no wise
                    strange that a majority was found first to pronounce him guilty, and afterwards,
                    when he refused to make any submission and professed himself indifferent to any
                    mitigation of the penalty, to pass upon him the sentence of death. That the
                    verdict and the sentence were not in any way illegal is generally
                    acknowledged.</p>
                <p>But, though the popular distrust of eccentricity, the irritation of individuals
                    and groups of individuals, the attitude of Socrates himself, and the prevalent
                    dislike of the intellectual movement which he represented go far to account for
                    the result of the trial, they do not explain the occasion of the attack.
                    Socrates’s oddity and brusquerie were no new things; yet in the past, though
                    they had made him unpopular, they had not brought him into the courts. His
                    sturdy resistance to the demus in 406 and to the Thirty in 404 had passed, if
                    not unnoticed, at all events unpunished. His political heresies and general
                    unorthodoxy had not caused him to be excluded from the amnesty of 403. Why was
                    it, then, that in 399, when Socrates’s idiosyncrasies were more than ever
                    familiar, and when the constitution had been restored, the toleration hitherto
                    extended to him was withdrawn? What were the special circumstances which induced
                    three members of the patriot party, two of them leading politicians, to unite
                    their efforts against one who apparently was so little formidable?</p>
                <p>For an answer to this question it is necessary to look to the history of Athenian
                    politics. Besides the oligarchical party, properly so called, which in 411 was
                    represented by the Four Hundred and in 404 by the Thirty, and the democratical
                    party, which returned to power in 410 and in 403, there was at Athens during the
                    last years of the Peloponnesian War a party of “moderate oligarchs,”
                    antagonistic to both. It was to secure the cooperation of the moderate party
                    that the Four Hundred in 411 promised to constitute the Five Thousand, and that
                    the Thirty in 404 actually constituted the Three Thousand. It was in the hope of
                    realizing the aspirations of the moderate party that Theramenes, its most
                    prominent representative, allied himself, first with the Four Hundred,
                    afterwards with the Thirty. In 411 the policy of Theramenes was temporarily
                    successful, the Five Thousand superseding the Four Hundred. In 404 the Thirty
                    outwitted him; for, though they acted upon his advice so far as to constitute
                    the Three Thousand, they were careful to keep all real power in their own hands.
                    But on both occasions the “polity”—for such, in the Aristotelian sense of the
                    term, the constitution of 411-410 was, and the constitution of 404-403 professed
                    to be—was insecurely based, so that it was not long before the “Unmixed
                    democracy” was restored. The programme of the “moderates”—which included (1) the
                    limitation of the franchise, by the exclusion of those who were unable to
                    provide themselves with the panoply of a hoplite and thus to render to the city
                    substantial service, (2) the abolition of payment for the performance of
                    political functions, and, as it would seem, (3) the disuse of the lot in the
                    election of magistrates—found especial favour with the intellectual class. Thus
                    Alcibiades and Antiphon were amongst its promoters, and Thucydides commends the
                    constitution established after the fall of the Four Hundred as the best which in
                    his time Athens had enjoyed.. Now it is expressly stated that Socrates disliked
                    election by lot; it is certain that, regarding paid educational service as a
                    species of prostitution, he would account paid political service not a whit less
                    odious; and the stress laid by the accuser upon the Homeric quotation <hi
                    rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi> ii. 188-202) —which ends with the lines <hi
                    rend="italic">δαιμόνι</hi> ' <hi rend="italic">, ἀτρέμας ησo, καὶ ἄλλων μυθον
                    ἄκovε οΐ σέo φέρτερoί εἰσι</hi> ∙ <hi rend="italic">σὺ δ’ ἀπτόλμος καὶ ἄναλκις,
                    oὔτε ποτ</hi> ' <hi rend="italic">ἐv πoλέμῳ</hi> ἐ <hi rend="italic">ναρίθμιος
                    οὔτ ἐvὶ βoυλη—</hi> becomes intelligible if we may suppose that Socrates, like
                    Theramenes, wished to restrict the franchise to those who were rich enough to
                    serve as hoplites at their own expense. Thus, as might have been anticipated,
                    Socrates was a “moderate,” and the treatment which he received from both the
                    extreme parties suggests—even if with Grote we reject the story told by Diodorus
                    (xiv. 5), how, when Theramenes was dragged from the altar, Socrates attempted a
                    rescue—that his sympathy with the moderate party was pronounced and notorious.
                    Even in the moment of democratic triumph the “moderates” made themselves heard,
                    Phormisius proposing that those alone should exercise the franchise who
                    possessed land in Attica; and it is reasonable to suppose that their position
                    was stronger in 399 than in 403. These considerations seem to indicate an easy
                    explanation of the indictment of Socrates by the democratic politicians. It was
                    a blow struck at the “moderates,” Socrates being singled out for attack because,
                    though not a professional politician, he was the very type of the malcontent
                    party, and had done much, probably more than any man living, to make and to
                    foster views which, if not in the strict sense of the term oligarchical, were
                    confessedly hostile to the “Unmixed democracy.” His eccentricity and heterodoxy,
                    as well as the personal animosities which he had provoked, doubtless
                    contributed, as his accusers had foreseen, to bring about the conviction; but,
                    in the judgment of the present writer, it was the fear of what may be called
                    “philosophical radicalism” which prompted the action of Meletus, Anytus, and
                    Lycon. The result did not disappoint their expectations. The friends of
                    Socrates<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0251-0236"/> abandoned the struggle and retired into exile;
                    and, when they returned to Athens, the most prominent of them, Plato, was
                    careful to confine himself to theory, and to announce in emphatic terms his
                    withdrawal from the practical politics of his native city.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Method and Doctrine.—</hi> Socrates was not a “philosopher,”
                    nor yet a “teacher,” but rather an “educator,” having for his function “to
                    rouse, persuade, and rebuke” (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> 30 E).
                    Hence, in examining his life’s work it is proper to ask, not What was his
                    philosophy? but What was his theory, and what was his practice, of education? It
                    is true that he was brought to his theory of education by the study of previous
                    philosophies, and that his practice led to the Platonic revival; hut to
                    attribute to him philosophy, except in that loose sense in which philosophy is
                    ascribed to one who, denying the existence of such a thing, can give an account
                    of his disbelief, is misleading and even erroneous.</p>
                <p>Socrates’s theory of education had for its basis a profound and consistent
                    scepticism; that is to say, he not only rejected the conflicting theories of the
                    physicists,—of whom “some conceived existence as a unity, others as a plurality;
                    some affirmed perpetual motion, others perpetual rest; some declared becoming
                    and perishing to be universal, others altogether denied such things,”—but also
                    condemned, as a futile attempt to transcend the limitations of human
                    intelligence, their <hi rend="italic">φιλοσοφία,</hi> their “pursuit of
                    knowledge for its own sake.” Unconsciously, or more probably consciously,
                    Socrates rested his scepticism upon the Protagorean doctrine that man is the
                    measure of his own sensations and feelings; whence he inferred, not only that
                    knowledge such as the philosophers had sought, certain knowledge of nature and
                    its laws, was unattainable, hut also that neither he nor any other person had
                    authority to overbear the opinions of another, or power to convey instruction to
                    one who had it not. Accordingly, whereas Protagoras and others, abandoning
                    physical speculation and coming forward as teachers of culture, claimed for
                    themselves in this new field power to instruct and authority to dogmatize,
                    Socrates, unable to reconcile himself to this inconsistency, proceeded with the
                    investigation of principles until he found a resting-place, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >που στω,</hi> in the distinction between good and evil. While all opinions were
                    equally true, of those opinions which were capable of being translated into act
                    some, he conceived, were as working hypotheses more serviceable than others. It
                    was here that the function of such a one as himself began. Though he had neither
                    the right nor the power to force his opinions upon another, he might by a
                    systematic interrogatory lead another to substitute a better opinion for a
                    worse, just as a physician by appropriate remedies may enable his patient to
                    substitute a healthy sense of taste for a morbid one. To administer such an
                    interrogatory and thus to he the physician of souls was, Socrates thought, his
                    divinely appointed duty; and, when he described himself as a “talker” or
                    “converser,” he not only negatively distinguished himself from those who,
                    whether philosophers or sophists, called themselves “teachers” (διδάσκαλοι), but
                    also positively indicated the method of question and answer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(διαλεκτική)</hi> which he consistently preferred and habitually practised.</p>
                <p>That it was in this way that Socrates was brought to regard “dialectic,”
                    “question and answer,” as the only admissible method of education is, in the
                    opinion of the present writer, no matter of mere conjecture. In the review of
                    theories of knowledge which has come down to us in Plato’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus</hi> mention is made (172 B) of certain “incomplete Protagoreans,”
                    who held that, while all impressions are equally true, one impression is better
                    than another, and that the “wise man” is one who by his arguments causes good
                    impressions to take the place of bad ones, thus reforming the soul of the
                    individual or the laws of a state by a process similar to that of the physician
                    or the farmer (166 D <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>; and these “incomplete
                    Protagoreans” are identified with Socrates and the Socratics by their insistence
                    (167 D) upon the characteristically Socratic distinction between disputation and
                    dialectic, as well as by other familiar traits of Socratic converse. In fact,
                    this passage becomes intelligible and significant if it is supposed to refer to
                    the historical Socrates; and by teaching us to regard him as an “incomplete
                    Protagorean” it supplies the link which connects his philosophical scepticism
                    with his dialectical theory of education. It is no doubt possible that Socrates
                    was unaware of the closeness of his relationship to Protagoras; but the fact,
                    once stated, hardly admits of question.</p>
                <p>In the application of the “dialectical” or “maieutic” method two processes are
                    distinguishable,—the destructive process, by which the worse opinion was
                    eradicated, and the constructive process, by which the better opinion was
                    induced. In general it was not mere “ignorance” with which Socrates had to
                    contend, but “ignorance mistaking itself for knowledge” or “false conceit of
                    wisdom,”— a more stubborn and a more formidable foe, who, safe so long as he
                    remained in his entrenchments, must be drawn from them, circumvented, and
                    surprised. Accordingly, taking his departure from some apparently remote
                    principle or proposition to which the re spondent yielded a ready assent,
                    Socrates would draw from it an unexpected but undeniable consequence which was
                    plainly inconsistent with the opinion impugned. In this way he brought his
                    interlocutor to pass judgment upon himself, and reduced him to a state of
                    “doubt” or “perplexity” <hi rend="italic">(ἀπορία).</hi> “Before I ever met
                    you,” says Meno in the dialogue which Plato called by his name (79 E), “I was
                    told that you spent your time in doubting and leading others to doubt; and it is
                    a fact that your witcheries and spells have brought me to that condition; you
                    are like the torpedo: as it benumbs any one who approaches and touches it, so do
                    you. For myself, my soul and my tongue are benumbed, so that I have no answer to
                    give you.” Even if, as often happened, the respondent, baffled and disgusted by
                    the <hi rend="italic">ἔλεγχoς</hi> or destructive process, at this point
                    withdrew from the inquiry, he had, in Socrates’s judgment, gained something;
                    for, whereas formerly, being ignorant, he had supposed himself to have
                    knowledge, now, being ignorant, he was in some sort conscious of his ignorance,
                    and accordingly would be for the future more circumspect in action. If, however,
                    having been thus convinced of ignorance, the respondent did not shrink from a
                    new effort, Socrates was ready to aid him by further questions of a suggestive
                    sort. Consistent thinking with a view to consistent action being the end of the
                    inquiry, Socrates would direct the respondent’s attention to instances analogous
                    to that in hand, and so lead him to frame for himself a generalization from
                    which the passions and the prejudices of the moment were, as far as might be,
                    excluded. In this constructive process, though the element of surprise was no
                    longer necessary, the interrogative form was studiously preserved, because it
                    secured at each step the conscious and responsible assent of the learner.</p>
                <p>Of the two processes of the dialectical method, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ἔλεγχoς</hi> or destructive process attracted the more attention, both in
                    consequence of its novelty and because many of those who willingly or
                    unwillingly submitted to it stopped short at the stage of “perplexity.” But to
                    Socrates and his intimates the constructive process was the proper and necessary
                    sequel. It is true that in the dialogues of Plato the destructive process is not
                    always, or even often, followed by construction, and that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memorabilia</hi> of Xenophon construction is not always, or even
                    often, preceded by the destructive process. There is, however, in this nothing
                    surprising. On the one hand, Xenophon, having for his principal purpose the
                    defence of his master against vulgar calumny, seeks to show by effective
                    examples the excellence of his positive teaching, and accordingly is not careful
                    to distinguish, still less to emphasize, the negative procedure. On the other
                    hand, Plato’s aim being not so much to preserve Socrates’s positive teaching as
                    rather by written words to stimulate the reader to self-scrutiny, just as the
                    spoken words of the master had stimulated the hearer, he is compelled by the
                    very nature of his task to keep the constructive element in the background, and,
                    where Socrates would have drawn an unmistakable conclusion, to confine himself
                    to enigmatical hints. For example, when we compare Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorabilia,</hi> iv. 6, 2-4, with Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Euthyphro,</hi> we
                    note that, while in the former the interlocutor is led by a few suggestive
                    questions to define “piety” as “the knowledge of those laws which are concerned
                    with the gods,” in the latter, though on a further scrutiny it appears that
                    “piety” is “that part of justice which is concerned with the service of the
                    gods,” the conversation is ostensibly inconclusive. In short, Xenophon, a mere
                    reporter of Socrates’s conversations, gives the results, but troubles himself
                    little about the steps which led to them; Plato, who in early manhood was an
                    educator of the Socratic type, withholds the results that he may secure the
                    advantages of the elenctic stimulus.</p>
                <p>What, then, were the positive conclusions to which Socrates carried his hearers?
                    and how were those positive conclusions obtained? Turning to Xenophon for an
                    answer to these questions, we note (1) that the recorded conversations are
                    concerned with practical action, political, moral, or artistic; (2) that in
                    general there is a process from the known to the unknown through a
                    generalization, expressed or implied; (3) that the generalizations are sometimes
                    rules of conduct, justified by examination of known instances, sometimes
                    definitions similarly established. Thus, in <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi>
                    iv. 1, 3, Socrates argues from the known instances of horses and dogs that the
                    best natures stand most in need of training, and then applies the generalization
                    to the instance under discussion, that of men; and in iv. 6, 13-14, he leads his
                    interlocutor to a definition of “the good citizen,” and then uses it to decide
                    between two citizens for whom respectively superiority is claimed. Now in the
                    former of these cases the process—which Aristotle would describe as “example”
                    <hi rend="italic">(παράδειγμα),</hi> and a modern might regard as “induction” of
                    an uncritical sort—sufficiently explains itself. The conclusion is a provisional
                    assurance that in the particular matter in hand a certain course of action is,
                    or is not, to he adopted. But it is necessary to say a word of explanation about
                    the latter case, in which, the generalization being a definition, that is to
                    say, a declaration that to a given term the interlocutor attaches in general a
                    specified meaning, the conclusion is a provisional assurance that the
                    interlocutor may, or may not, with-<pb break="no"

                    question to a certain person or act. Moral error, Socrates conceived, is largely
                    due to the misapplication of general terms, which, once affixed to a person or
                    to an act, possibly in a moment of passion or prejudice, too often stand in the
                    way of sober and careful reflection. It was in order to exclude error of this
                    sort that Socrates insisted upon <hi rend="italic">τὸ</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> ὁ</hi><hi rend="italic">ριξεσθαι καθόλου</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >ἐπακτικοὶ</hi> λόγοι for its basis. By requiring a definition and the reference
                    to it of the act or person in question, he sought to secure in the individual at
                    any rate consistency of thought, and, in so far, consistency of action.
                    Accordingly he spent his life in seeking and helping others to seek “the what”
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(</hi><hi rend="italic">τὸ</hi> τί), or the definition, of
                    the various words by which the moral quality of actions is described, valuing
                    the results thus obtained, not as contributions to knowledge, but as means to
                    right action in the multifarious relations of life.</p>
                <p>While, however, Socrates sought neither knowledge, which in the strict sense of
                    the word he held to be unattainable, nor yet, except as a means to right action,
                    true opinion, the results of observation accumulated until they formed, not
                    perhaps a system of ethics, but at any rate a body of ethical doctrine. Himself
                    blessed with a will so powerful that it moved almost without friction, he fell
                    into the error of ignoring its operations, and was thus led to regard knowledge
                    as the sole condition of well-doing. Where there is knowledge,—that is to say,
                    practical wisdom (<hi rend="italic">φρόνησις</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the
                    only knowledge which he recognized,—right action, he conceived, follows of
                    itself; for no one knowingly prefers what is evil; and, if there are cases in
                    which men seem to act against knowledge, the inference to be drawn is, not that
                    knowledge and wrongdoing are compatible, but that in the cases in question the
                    supposed knowledge was after all ignorance. Virtue, then, is knowledge,
                    knowledge at once of end and of means irresistibly realizing itself in act.
                    Whence it follows that the several virtues which are commonly distinguished are
                    essentially one. “Piety,” “justice,” “courage,” and “temperance” are the names
                    which “wisdom” bears in different spheres of action: to be pious is to know what
                    is due to the gods; to be just is to know what is due to men; to be courageous
                    is to know what is to be feared and what is not; to be temperate is to know how
                    to use what is good and avoid what is evil. Further, inasmuch as virtue is
                    knowledge, it can be acquired by education and training, though it is certain
                    that one soul has by nature a greater aptitude than another for such
                    acquisition.</p>
                <p>But, if virtue is knowledge, what has this knowledge for its object? To this
                    question Socrates replies, Its object is the Good. What, then, is the Good? It
                    is the useful, the advantageous. Utility, the immediate utility of the
                    individual, thus becomes the measure of conduct and the foundation of all moral
                    rule and legal enactment. Accordingly, each precept of which Socrates delivers
                    himself is recommended on the ground that obedience to it will promote the
                    pleasure, the comfort, the advancement, the wellbeing of the individual; and
                    Prodicus’s apologue of the Choice of Heracles, with its commonplace offers of
                    worldly reward, is accepted as an adequate statement of the motives of virtuous
                    action. Of the graver difficulties of ethical theory Socrates has no conception,
                    having, as it would seem, so perfectly absorbed the lessons of what Plato calls
                    “political virtue” that morality has become with him a second nature, and the
                    scrutiny of its credentials from an external standpoint has ceased to be
                    possible. His theory is indeed so little systematic that, whereas, as has been
                    seen, virtue or wisdom has the Good for its object, he sometimes identifies the
                    Good with virtue or wisdom, thus falling into the error which Plato (<hi
                    rend="italic">Republic,</hi> vi. 505 C), perhaps with distinct reference to
                    Socrates, ascribes to certain “cultivated thinkers.” In short, the ethical
                    theory of Socrates, like the rest of his teaching, is by confession
                    unscientific; it is the statement of the convictions of a remarkable nature,
                    which statement emerges in the course of an appeal to the individual to study
                    consistency in the interpretation of traditional rules of conduct. For a
                    critical examination of the ethical teaching which is here described in outline,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethics.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Socratics.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been seen that, so far from having any system, physical or metaphysical,
                    to enunciate, Socrates rejected “the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake” as a
                    delusion and a snare,—a delusion, inasmuch as knowledge, properly so called, is
                    unattainable, and a snare, in so far as the pursuit of it draws us away from the
                    study of conduct. He has therefore no claim to be regarded as the founder of a
                    philosophical school. But he had made some tentative contributions to a theory
                    of morality; he had shown both in his life and in his death that his principles
                    stood the test of practical application; he had invented a method having for its
                    end the rectification of opinion; and, above all, he had asserted “the autonomy
                    of the individual intellect.” Accordingly, not one school but several schools
                    sprang up amongst his associates, those of them who had a turn for speculation
                    taking severally from his teaching so much as their pre-existing tendencies and
                    convictions allowed them to assimilate. Thus Aristippus of Cyrene interpreted
                    hedonistically the theoretical morality; Antisthenes the Cynic copied and
                    caricatured the austere example; Euclides of Megara practised and perverted the
                    elenctic method; Plato the Academic, accepting the whole of the Socratic
                    teaching, first developed it harmoniously in the sceptical spirit of its author,
                    and, afterwards conceiving that he had found in Socrates’s agnosticism the germ
                    of a philosophy, proceeded to construct a system which should embrace at once
                    ontology, physics, and ethics. From the four schools thus established sprang
                    subsequently four other schools,— the Epicureans being the natural successors of
                    the Cyrenaics, the Stoics of the Cynics, the Sceptics of the Megarians, and the
                    Peripatetics of the Academy. In this way the teaching of Socrates made itself
                    felt throughout the whole of the post - Socratic philosophy. Of the influence
                    which he exercised upon Aristippus, Antisthenes, and Euclides, the “incomplete
                    Socratics,” as they are commonly called, as well as upon the “complete Socratic”
                    Plato, something must now be said.</p>
                <p>The “incomplete Socratics” were, like Socrates, sceptics; but, whereas
                    Aristippus, who seems to have been in contact with Protagoreanism before he made
                    acquaintance with Socrates, came to scepticism, as Protagoras had done, from the
                    standpoint of the pluraliste, Antisthenes, like his former master Gorgias, and
                    Euclides, in whom the ancients rightly saw a successor of Zeno, came to
                    scepticism from the standpoint of Eleatic monism. In other words, Aristippus was
                    sceptical because, taking into account the subjective element in sensation, he
                    found himself compelled to regard what are called “things” as successions of
                    feelings, which feelings are themselves absolutely distinct from one another;
                    while Antisthenes and Euclides were sceptical because, like Zeno, they did not
                    understand how the same thing could at the same moment bear various and
                    inconsistent epithets, and consequently conceived all predication which was not
                    identical to be illegitimate. Thus Aristippus recognized only feelings, denying
                    things; Antisthenes recognized things, denying attributions; and it is probable
                    that in this matter Euclides was at one with him. For, though since
                    Schleiermacher many historians, unnecessarily identifying the εἰ <hi
                    rend="italic">δωv φίλοι</hi> of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Sophist</hi> with the
                    Megarians, have ascribed to Euclides a theory of “ideas,” and on the strength of
                    this single passage thus conjecturally interpreted have added a new chapter to
                    the history of Megarianism, it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how, if
                    the founder of the school had broken loose from the trammels of the Zenonian
                    paradox, his successors, and amongst them Stilpo, should have reconciled
                    themselves, as they certainly did, to the Cynic denial of predication.</p>
                <p>While the “incomplete Socratics” made no attempt to overpass the limits which
                    Socrates had imposed upon himself, within those limits they occupied each his
                    department. Aristippus, a citizen of the world, drawn to Athens by the fame of
                    Socrates, and retained there by the sincere affection which he conceived for
                    him, interpreted the ethical doctrine of Socrates in accordance with his own
                    theory of pleasure, which in its turn came under the refining influence of
                    Socrates’s theory of <hi rend="italic">φρόνησις.</hi> Contrariwise, Antisthenes,
                    a rugged but not ungenerous nature, a hater of pleasure, troubled himself little
                    about ethical theory and gave his life to the imitation of his master’s
                    asceticism. Virtue, he held, depended upon “works,” not upon arguments or
                    lessons; all that was necessary to it was the strength of a Socrates (Diog.
                    Laert., vi. 11). Yet here too the Socratic theory of <hi rend="italic"
                    >φρόνησις</hi> had a qualifying effect; so that Cyrenaic hedonism and Cynic
                    asceticism sometimes exhibit unexpected approximations. The teaching of
                    Euclides, though the Good is still supposed to be the highest object of
                    knowledge, can hardly be said to have an ethical element; and in consequence of
                    this deficiency the dialectic of Socrates degenerated in Megarian hands, first
                    into a series of exercises in fallacies, secondly into a vulgar and futile
                    eristic. In fact, the partial Socraticisms of the incomplete Socratics
                    necessarily suffered, even within their own narrow limits, by the dismemberment
                    which the system had undergone. Apparently the maieutic theory of education was
                    not valued by any of the three; and, however this may be, they deviated from
                    Socratic tradition so far as to establish schools, and, as it would seem, to
                    take fees like the professional educators called Sophists.</p>
                <p>Of the relations in which the metaphysic of Plato stood to the Socratic search
                    for definitions there are of necessity almost as many theories as there are
                    interpretations of the Platonic system. Hence in this place the writer must
                    content himself with a summary statement of his own views. Initiated into
                    philosophical speculation by the Heraclitean Cratylus, Plato began his
                    intellectual life as an absolute sceptic, the followers of Heraclitus having
                    towards the end of the 5th century pushed to its conclusion the unconscious
                    scepticism of their master. There would have been then nothing to provoke
                    surprise, if, leaving speculation, Plato had given himself to politics. In 407,
                    however, he became acquainted with Socrates, who gave to his thoughts a new
                    direction. Plato now found an occupation for his intellectual energies, as
                    Socrates had done, in the scrutiny of his beliefs and the systematization of his
                    principles of action. But it was not until the catastrophe of 399 that Plato
                    gave himself to his life’s work. An exile, cut off from political ambitions, he
                    came forward as the author of dialogues<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n253/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0253-0238"/> which aimed at producing upon readers the same
                    effect which the voice of the master had produced upon hearers. For a time he
                    was content thus to follow in the steps of Socrates, and of this period we have
                    records in those dialogues which are commonly designated Socratic. But Plato had
                    too decided a bent for metaphysics to linger long over propaedeutic studies.
                    Craving knowledge—not merely provisional and subjective knowledge of ethical
                    concepts, such as that· which had satisfied Socrates, but knowledge of the
                    causes and laws of the universe, such as that which the physicists had sought—he
                    asked himself what was necessary that the “right opinion” which Socrates had
                    obtained by abstraction from particular instances might be converted into
                    “knowledge” properly so called. In this way Plato was led to assume for every
                    Socratic universal a corresponding unity, eternal, immutable, suprasensual, to
                    be the cause of those particulars which are called by the common name. On this
                    assumption the Socratic definition or statement of the “what” of the universal,
                    being obtained by the inspection of particulars, in some sort represented the
                    unity, form, or “idea” from which they derived their characteristics, and in so
                    far was valuable; but, inasmuch as the inspection of the particulars was partial
                    and imperfect, the Socratic definition was only a partial and imperfect
                    representation of the eternal, immutable, suprasensual idea. How, then, was the
                    imperfect representation of the idea to be converted into a perfect
                    representation? To this question Plato’s answer was vague and tentative. By
                    constant revision of the provisional definitions which imperfectly represented
                    the ideas he hoped to bring them into such shapes that they should culminate in
                    the definition of the supreme principle, the Good, from which the ideas
                    themselves derive their being. If in this way we could pass from uncertified
                    general notions, reflections of ideas, to the Good, so as to be able to say, not
                    only that the Good causes the ideas to be what they are, but also that the Good
                    causes the ideas to be what we conceive them, we might infer, he thought, that
                    our definitions, hitherto provisional, are adequate representations of real
                    existences. But the Platonism of this period had another ingredient. It has been
                    seen that the Eleatic Zeno had rested his denial of plurality upon certain
                    supposed difficulties of predication, and that they continued to perplex
                    Antisthenes as well as perhaps Euclides and others of Plato’s contemporaries.
                    These difficulties must be disposed of if the new philosophy was to hold its
                    ground; and accordingly, to the fundamental assertion of the existence of
                    eternal immutable ideas, the objects of knowledge, Plato added two subordinate
                    propositions, namely, (1) “the idea is immanent in the particular,” and (2)
                    “there is an idea wherever a plurality of particulars is called by the same
                    name.” Of these propositions the one was intended to explain the attribution of
                    various and even inconsistent epithets to the same particular at the same time,
                    whilst the other was necessary to make this explanation available in the case of
                    common terms other than the Socratic universals. Such was the Platonism of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo,</hi> a
                    provisional ontology, with a scheme of scientific research, which, as Plato
                    honestly confessed, was no more than an unrealized aspiration. It was the
                    non-Socratic element which made the weakness of this the earlier theory of
                    ideas. Plato soon saw that the hypothesis of the idea’s immanence in particulars
                    entailed the sacrifice of its unity, whilst as a theory of predication that
                    hypothesis was insufficient, because applicable to particulars only, not to the
                    ideas themselves. But with clearer views about relations and negations the
                    paradox of Zeno ceased to perplex; and with the consequent withdrawal of the two
                    supplementary articles the development of the fundamental assumption of ideas,
                    eternal, immutable, suprasensual, might be attempted afresh. In the more
                    definite theory which Plato now propounded the idea was no longer a Socratic
                    universal, perfected and hypostatized, but rather the perfect type of a natural
                    kind, to which type its imperfect members were related by imitation, whilst this
                    relation was metaphysically explained by means of a “thoroughgoing idealism” (R.
                    D. Archer-Hind). Thus, whereas in the earlier theory of ideas the ethical
                    universals of Socrates had been held to have a first claim to hypostatization in
                    the world of ideas, they are now peremptorily excluded, whilst the idealism
                    which reconciles plurality and unity gives an entirely new significance to so
                    much of the Socratic element as is still retained.</p>
                <p>The growth of the metaphysical system necessarily influenced Plato’s ethical
                    doctrines; but here his final position is less remote from that of Socrates.
                    Content in the purely Socratic period to elaborate and to record ethical
                    definitions such as Socrates himself might have propounded, as soon as the
                    theory of ideas offered itself to Plato’s imagination he looked to it for the
                    foundation of ethics as of all other sciences. Though in the earlier ages both
                    of the individual and of the state a sound utilitarian morality of the Socratic
                    sort was useful, nay valuable, the morality of the future should, he thought,
                    rest upon the knowledge of the Good. Such is the teaching of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Republic.</hi> But with the revision of the metaphysical system
                    came a complete change in the view which Plato took of ethics and its prospects.
                    Whilst in the previous period it had ranked as the first of sciences, it was now
                    no longer a science; because, though Good absolute still occupied the first
                    place, Good relative and all its various forms—justice, temperance, courage,
                    wisdom—not being ideas, were incapable of being “known.” Hence it is that the
                    ethical teaching of the later dialogues bears an intelligible, though perhaps
                    unexpected, resemblance to the simple practical teaching of the unphilosophical
                    Socrates.</p>
                <p>Yet throughout these revolutions of doctrine Plato was ever true to the Socratic
                    theory of education. His manner indeed changed; for, whereas in the earlier
                    dialogues the characteristics of the master—</p>
                <p>“The soft and intricate discourse,</p>
                <p>The wit that makes us tolerant perforce,</p>

                <p>are studiously and skilfully preserved, in the later dialogues Socrates first
                    becomes metaphysical, then ceases to be protagonist, and at last disappears from
                    the scene. But in the later dialogues, as in the earlier, Plato’s aim is the aim
                    which Socrates in his conversation never lost sight of, namely, the dialectical
                    improvement of the learner.</p>
