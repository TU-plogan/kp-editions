                    hands of the Persians (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Elam).</hi> The site of the
                    town, which has been fixed by the explorations of Loftus and Churchill, lies in
                    the plain, but within sight of the mountains, between the courses of the Kerkha
                    (Choaspes) and the Dizful, one of the affluents of the Pasitigris. The Shápúr, a
                    small tributary of the Dizful, washes the eastern base of the ruin-mounds of Sús
                    or Shúsh. Thus the whole district was fruitful and well watered, fit to support
                    a great city; the surrounding rivers with their canals gave protection and a
                    waterway to the Persian Gulf; while the position of the town between the Semitic
                    and Iranian lands of the empire was convenient for administrative purposes. It
                    is not therefore surprising that Susa became a vast and populous capital; Greek
                    writers assign to it a circuit of 15 or 20 miles,—a statement which is fairly
                    well borne out by the remains. These include three main mounds, of which one is
                    identified with the strong citadel<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Greeks called the citadel the Mε <hi rend="italic"
                    >μvόvιov</hi> (Strabo, xv. 3, 2), and supposed it to have been founded by the
                    Ethiopian Memnon. It was strong enough to withstand Molon in his war with
                    Antiochus the Great (Polyb., v. 48).</p></note> and a second shows the relics of
                    the great palace built by Darius I. and completed by Artaxerxes Mnemon. Susa was
                    still a place of importance under the Sasanians, and after having been razed to
                    the ground in consequence of a revolt seems to have been rebuilt by Shápúr II.
                    under the name of Éránshahr-Shápúr (Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Gesch, d. Perser
                    aus Tabari,</hi> p. 58). The fortifications were destroyed at the time of the
                    Moslem conquest (Mokaddasi, p. 307); but the site, which is now deserted, was
                    inhabited in the Middle Ages, and a seat of sugar-manufacture.</p>
                <p>In Daniel viii. 2 the river of Shushan is called Ulai, a name which is identical
                    with Avrai of the Bundehesh and Eulaeus of classical writers. What is told of
                    the Eulaeus makes it impossible to identify it with the inconsiderable Shápúr;
                    but authorities differ as to whether it is another name for the Choaspes or
                    rather denotes the Dizful or the Pasitigris. Susa in the days of its greatness
                    must have stretched nearly from river to river. There is a sanctuary of the tomb
                    of Daniel on the banks of the Shápúr, and Arabic geographers relate that this
                    tomb was a frequented shrine before the Moslem conquest and that the Arabs
                    turned the stream over the grave.</p>
