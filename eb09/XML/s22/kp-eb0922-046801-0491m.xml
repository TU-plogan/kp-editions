                    It forms a part of the <hi rend="italic">lex scripta,</hi> or written law, which
                    by English legal authorities is used solely for statutory law, a sense much
                    narrower than it bore in Roman law. To make a statute the concurrence of the
                    crown and the three estates of the realm is necessary. Thus a so-called statute
                    of 5 Ric. II. c. 5, directed against the Lollards, was afterwards repudiated by
                    the Commons as passed without their assent. The validity of a statute was indeed
                    at times claimed for ordinances such as that just mentioned, not framed in
                    accordance with constitutional rule, and was actually given to royal
                    proclamations by 31 Hen. VIII. c. 8. But this Act was repealed by 1 Edw. VI. c.
                    12, and since that time nothing but a statute has possessed the force of a
                    statute, unless indeed certain rules or orders depending ultimately for their
                    sanction upon a statute may be said to have such force. Examples of what may be
                    called indirect legislation of this kind are orders in council (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Privy Council),</hi> by-laws made under the powers of the
                    Public Health Act, and rules of court such as those made under the powers of the
                    Judicature Acts and Acts of Sederunt of the Court of Session.</p>
                <p>The history of statutory legislation and the modern procedure by which bills
                    become statutes are sufficiently treated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Act of
                    Parliament</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Parliament.</hi> It is proposed in this
                    place to deal with the legal rather than the political aspect of the subject,
                    and to give a short list of some of the more important statutes which have been
                    passed by the legislature.</p>
                <p>The list of statutes as at present existing begins with the Statute of Merton,
                    1235.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ruffhead’s edition
                    of the statutes begins with the Magna Carta of 1225. But in the <hi

                    appears as a statute of the year 1297. It is often known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confirmatio Cartarum,</hi> and is a recital and confirmation by Edward I. of
                    the chief provisions of John’s charter.</p></note> Many of the earlier statutes
                    are known by the names of the places at which they were passed, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Statutes of Merton, Marlbridge, Gloucester,
                    Westminster, or by their initial words, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Quia Emptores,
                    Circumspecte agatis.</hi> The earliest existing statute roll is 6 Edw. I. (the
                    Statute of Gloucester). After 4 Hen. VII. the statute roll ceased to be made up,
                    and enrolments in Chancery (first made in 1485) take its place. Some of the Acts
                    prior to the Statute of Gloucester are of questionable authority, but have
                    gained recognition by a kind of prescription.</p>
                <p>All statutes were originally public, irrespectively of their subject matter. The
                    division into public and private dates from the reign of Richard III. At present
                    statutes are of four kinds—public general Acts, public local and personal Acts,
                    private Acts printed by the queen’s printers, and private Acts not so printed.
                    The division into public general and public local and personal rests upon a
                    resolution of both Houses of Parliament in 1798. In 1815 a resolution was passed
                    in accordance with which private Acts are printed, with the exception of name,
                    estate, naturalization, and divorce Acts. The last two are now practically
                    superseded by the provisions of the Divorce Act, 1857, and the Naturalization
                    Act, 1870. Since 1815 it has been usual to refer to public general Acts by
                    Arabic numerals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 5 and 6 Vict. c. 21, public local
                    and personal Acts by small Roman numerals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 5 and 6
                    Vict. c. xxi. Each Act is strictly but a chapter of the legislation of the
                    session, which is regarded as composing a single Act divided into chapters for
                    convenience, the chapters themselves being also called Acts. The citation of
                    previous Acts is provided for by 13 and 14 Vict. c. 21, § 3. It is now usual for
                    each chapter or Act to contain<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Elementary Education Act, 1870. Sometimes a series
                    of Acts is grouped under a generic title, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Merchant Shipping Acts, 1854 to 1883.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A short title has been occasionally given by retrospection
                    to an Act which did not originally possess it. For instance, the Conveyancing
                    Act, 1881, enacts that the Act of 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 62, the original title of
                    which is of unwieldy length, may be cited for the future as the Statutory
                    Declarations Act, 1835. In some cases the title has been changed. Thus the name
                    of the Summary Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1864, was changed in 1881 to that of
                    the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1864.</p></note> 8 and 9 Vict. c. 113, § 3, makes
                    evidence the queen’s printers’ copies of private and local and personal Acts. A
                    private Act not printed by the queen’s printers is proved by an examined copy of
                    the parliament roll. A public Act binds all subjects of the realm, and need not
                    be pleaded (except where the law from motives of policy specially provides for
                    pleading certain Acts, as in the defences of not guilty by statute, the Statute
                    of Frauds, and the Statute of Limitations). A private Act must generally be
                    pleaded, and does not as a rule bind strangers to its provisions. Formerly an
                    Act took effect from the first day of the session in which it was passed. The
                    hardship caused by this technical rule has been obviated by 33 Geo. III. c. 13,
                    by which an Act takes effect from the day on which it receives the royal assent,
                    where no other date is named. This has been held to mean the beginning of the
                    day, so as to govern all matters occurring on that day. An Act cannot in the
                    strict theory of English law become obsolete by disuse. Nothing short of repeal
                    can limit its operation. The law has, however, been interpreted in some recent
                    cases with somewhat less rigour. In the case of a prosecution for blasphemy in
                    1883 (Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ramsay) Lord Coleridge said, “though the
                    principles of law remain unchanged, yet (and it is one of the advantages of the
                    common law) their application is to be changed with the changing circumstances
                    of the times.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    opinion carries out to a certain extent the view of Locke, who in Article 79 of
                    his Carolina Code recommended the determination of Acts of the legislature by
                    effluxion of time after a hundred years from their enactment.</p></note> This
                    would be applicable as much to the interpretation of statutes as to other parts
                    of the common law. The title, preamble, and marginal notes are strictly no part
                    of a statute, though they may at times aid in its interpretation.</p>
                <p>Besides the fourfold division above mentioned, statutes are often classed
                    according to their subject-matter, as perpetual and temporary, penal and
                    beneficial, imperative and directory, enabling and disabling. Temporary Acts are
                    those which expire at a date fixed in the Act itself. Thus the Army Act is
                    passed annually and continues for a year; the Ballot Act, 1872, expired at the
                    end of 1880, and the Regulation of Railways Act, 1873, at the end of five years.
                    By means of these temporary Acts experimental legislation is rendered possible
                    in many cases where the success of a new departure in legislation is doubtful.
                    In every session an Expiring Laws Continuance Act is passed for the purpose of
                    continuing (generally for a year) a considerable number of these temporary Acts.
                    By 48 Geo. III. c. 106 a continuing Act is to take effect from the date of the
                    expiration of a temporary Act, where a bill for continuing the temporary Act is
                    in parliament, even though it be not actually passed before the date of the
                    expiration.</p>
                <p>Penal Acts are those which impose a new disability, beneficial those which confer
                    a new favour. An imperative statute (often negative or prohibitory in its terms)
                    makes a certain act or omission absolutely necessary, and subjects a
                    contravention of its provisions to a penalty. A directory statute (generally
                    affirmative in its terms) recommends a certain act or omission, but imposes no
                    penalty on non-observance of its provisions. To determine whether an Act is
                    imperative or directory the Act itself must be looked at, and many nice
                    questions have arisen on the application of the rule of law to a particular
                    case.</p>
                <p>Enabling statutes are those which enlarge the common law, while disabling
                    statutes restrict it. This division is to some extent coincident with that into
                    beneficial and penal. Declaratory statutes, or those simply in affirmance of the
                    common law, were at one period not uncommon, but they are now practically
                    unknown. The Statute of Treasons of Edward III. is an example of such a statute.
                    Statutes are sometimes passed in order to overrule specific decisions of the
                    courts. Examples are the Factors Act, 1877, the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction
                    Act, 1878, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1879.</p>
                <p>The construction or interpretation of statutes depends partly on the common law,
                    partly on statute. The main rules of the common law, as gathered from the best
                    authorities, are these. (1) Statutes are to be construed, not according to their
                    mere letter, but according to the intent and object with which they were made.
                    (2) The relation of the statute to the common law is to be considered. In the
                    words of the resolution of the Court of Exchequer in Heydon’s Case, 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">Coke’s Rep.,</hi> 7, the points for consideration are—“1, What was
                    the common law before the making of the Act? 2, What was the mischief and defect
                    against which the common law did not provide? 3, What remedy the parliament hath
                    resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the Commonwealth? 4, The true
                    reason of the remedy.” (3) Beneficial or remedial statutes are to be liberally,
                    penal more strictly, construed. (4) Other statutes <hi rend="italic">in pari
                    materia</hi> are to be taken into consideration. (5) A statute which treats of
                    persons of inferior rank cannot by general words be extended to those of
                    superior rank. (6) A statute does not bind the crown, unless it be named
                    therein. (7) Where the provision of a statute is general, everything necessary
                    to make such provision effectual is implied. (8) A later statute repeals an
                    earlier, as far as the two are repugnant, but, if they may stand together,
                    repeal will not be presumed. (9) There is a presumption against creation of new
                    or ousting of existing jurisdictions, against impairing obligations, against
                    retrospective effect, against violation of international law, against
                    monopolies, and in general against what is inconvenient or unreasonable. (10) If
                    a statute inflicts a penalty, the penalty implies a prohibition of the act or
                    omission for which the penalty is imposed. Whether the remedy given by statute
                    is the only one depends on the words of the particular Act. In some cases an
                    action or an indictment will lie; in others the statutory remedy, generally
                    summary, takes the place of the common law remedy. In some few instances the
                    courts have construed the imposition of a penalty as operating not to invalidate
                    a contract but to create a tax upon non-compliance with the terms of the
                    statute. What may be called the statutory rules of construction provide, <hi
                    rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> that any Act referring to England includes Wales
                    and Berwick-upon-Tweed (20 Geo. II. c. 42), and that all words importing the
                    masculine gender shall be taken to include females, and the singular to include
                    the plural and the plural the singular (13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 21, § 4). The same
                    Act further provides that, where any Act repealing in whole or in part any
                    former Act is itself repealed, such last repeal shall not revive the Act or
                    provisions before repealed unless words be added to that effect (§ 5), and that,
                    wherever any Act shall be made repealing in whole or in part any former Act and
                    substituting some provision or provisions instead of the provision or provisions
                    repealed, such provision or pro-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0493-0470"/> visions so repealed shall remain in force until
                    the substituted provision or provisions shall come into operation by force of
                    the last Act (§ 6). Numerous interpretations of particular words are contained
                    in Acts of Parliament, either general, as “month,” “county,” “land,” and other
                    words in 13 and 14 Vict. c. 21, § 4, or for the purposes of the Act, as
                    “settlement” for the purposes of the Settled Land Act, 1882.</p>
                <p>The earlier Acts are generally simple in character and language, and
                    comparatively few in number. At present the number passed every session is
                    enormous; in the session of 1885 it was 80 general and 190 local and personal
                    Acts. Without going as far as to concede with an eminent legal authority that of
                    such legislation three-fourths is unnecessary and the other fourth mischievous,
                    it may be admitted that the immense library of the statutes would be but a
                    trackless desert without trustworthy guides. Revision of the statutes was
                    evidently regarded by the legislature as desirable as early as 1563 (see the
                    preamble to 5 Eliz. c. 4). It was demanded by a petition of the Commons in 1610.
                    Both Coke and Bacon were employed for some time on a commission for revision. At
                    times Consolidation Acts in the nature of digests of law (generally amending as
                    well as consolidating) were passed, such as the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, and
                    the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts of 1861. The most important action, however,
                    was the nomination of a revision committee by Lord Chancellor Cairns in 1868,
                    the practical result of which has been the issue of an edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revised Statutes</hi> in eighteen volumes, bringing the revision
                    of statute law down to 1878. This edition is of course subject to the
                    disadvantage that it becomes less accurate every year as new legislation
                    appears. An index to the statutes which are still law is published about every
                    three years by the Council of Law Reporting.</p>
                <p>The principal statutes may be classified under various heads according to the
                    matter with which they deal. It should be remembered at the same time that many
                    of them—Magna Carta, for example—might fall with equal correctness under more
                    than one head. A division, convenient, if not exhaustive, would be into
                    historical, constitutional, legal, and social.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Historical.—</hi> Under this head would come those Acts which
                    to a greater or less extent mark important epochs in the national history, such
                    as the Statute of Rhuddlan, the Acts of Union defining the relations of Wales,
                    Scotland, and Ireland to England, the Act of Settlement, the Stamp Act of
                    1765—the proximate cause of the revolt of the American colonies,—the Acts
                    abolishing the slave trade and the corn laws, and those defining the position of
                    dependencies, such as the Act for the Better Government of India, 1858, and the
                    British North America Act, 1867.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitutional.—</hi> The principal Acts of this class would be
                    Magna Carta, the statutes <hi rend="italic">De Tallagio non Concedendo</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">De Praerogativa Regis</hi> and those dealing with mortmain and
                    treason, the Petition of Right, the Bill of Rights, the Septennial Act, the
                    Royal Marriage Act, the Mutiny, Militia, Naval Discipline, and Foreign
                    Enlistment Acts, and the Acts affecting the parliamentary franchise from the
                    time of Henry VI. to the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885. Under this head too
                    might be placed the numerous Acts dealing with the question of religion. Some of
                    the more interesting of these are the <hi rend="italic">Articuli Clem,</hi> the
                    Statutes of Provisors, the Acts of Henry VIII. abolishing monasteries, the Acts
                    of Supremacy and Uniformity of Henry VIII., Elizabeth, and Charles II., the
                    Toleration, Catholic Emancipation, Tithe Commutation, Church Discipline, Public
                    Worship Regulation, Irish Church, and Scottish Patronage Abolition Acts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Legal.—</hi> The most important of this class are perhaps the
                    Statutes of <hi rend="italic">Quia Emptores</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De
                    Donis,</hi> the Statutes of Uses and of Wills, the Statutes of Limitation, the
                    Statute of Frauds and its amendments, the Fines and Recoveries Act, the
                    Conveyancing, Settled Land and Settled Estates, and Married Women’s Property
                    Acts, and the Acts for the amendment of procedure, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the Chancery Amendment, Common Law Procedure, Judicature, and Appellate
                    Jurisdiction Acts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Social.—</hi> Social legislation (other than mere sumptuary
                    laws) is of comparatively modern introduction. Among earlier instances are the
                    Statute of Labourers of Edward III. and the Poor Law of Elizabeth. More modern
                    examples are the Factory, Public Health, and Artisans’ Dwellings Act, and,
                    perhaps greatest of all, the Education Acts. Besides these there are the Acts
                    dealing with patent, copyright, summary jurisdiction, friendly and building
                    societies, trades unions, savings banks, theatres, commons preservation, and
                    agricultural holdings. Acts which have trade for their special object are the
                    Bank Charter, Merchant Shipping, Bills of Lading, Bills of Exchange, Crossed
                    Cheques, Factors, Stamp, Licensing, Bankruptcy, and Trade Marks Acts.</p>
                <p>The chief editions of the statutes are the <hi rend="italic">Statutes of the
                    Realm</hi> printed by the queen’s printers, Ruffhead’s, and the fine edition
                    issued from 1810 to 1824 in pursuance of an address from the House of Commons to
                    George III. The safest authority is of course the <hi rend="italic">Revised
                    Statutes.</hi> Chitty’s collection of statutes of practical utility is a useful
                    compilation. Among the earlier works on statute law may be mentioned the
                    readings on statutes by great lawyers, such as the second volume of Coke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Reading on the Statute
                    of Uses,</hi> Barrington’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on the more Ancient
                    Statutes from Magna Carta to the 21 Jac. I. c. 27</hi> (5th ed. 1796), and the
                    Introduction to Blackstone’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries.</hi> Among the
                    later works are the treatises of Dwarris (2d ed. 1848) and Sir P. B. Maxwell (2d
                    ed. 1883) on the interpretation of statutes, and Sir H. Thring’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Practical Legislation, or the Composition and Language of Acts of
                    Parliament.</hi><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The statutes of the Scottish
                    parliament before the Union differed from the English statutes in two important
                    respects, —they were passed by the estates of the kingdom sitting together and
                    not in separate Houses, and from 1367 to 1690 they were discussed only after
                    preliminary consideration by the Lords of Articles. An Act of the Scottish
                    parliament may in certain cases cease to be binding by desuetude. “To bring an
                    Act of Parliament like those we are dealing with” (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi>, the Sabbath Profanation Acts) “into what is called in
                    Scotch law the condition of desuetude, it must be shown that the offence
                    prohibited is not only practised without being checked, but is no longer
                    considered or dealt with in this country as an offence against law” (Lord
                    Justice General Inglis in Bute’s Case, 1 <hi rend="italic">Couper's Rep.,</hi>
                    495). Acts of the imperial parliament passed since the Union extend in general
                    to Scotland, unless that country be excluded from their operation by express
                    terms or necessary implication.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> Originally the lord deputy appears to have held
                    parliaments at his option, and their Acts were the only statutory law which
                    applied to Ireland, except as far as judicial decisions had from motives of
                    policy extended to that country the obligation of English statutes. In 1495 the
                    Act of the Irish parliament known as Poyning’s Law or the Statute of Drogheda
                    enacted that all statutes lately made in England be deemed good and effectual in
                    Ireland. This was construed to mean that all statutes made in England prior to
                    the 18 Hen. VII. were valid in Ireland, but none of later date were to have any
                    operation unless Ireland were specially named therein or unless adopted by the
                    Irish parliament (as was done, for instance, by Yelverton’s Act, 21 and 22 Geo.
                    III. c. 48, i.). Another article of Poyning’s Law secured an initiative of
                    legislation to the English privy council, the Irish parliament having simply a
                    power of acceptance or rejection of proposed legislation. The power of the
                    parliament of Great Britain to make laws to bind the people of Ireland was
                    declared by 6 Geo. I. c. 5. This Act and the article of Poyning’s Law were
                    repealed in 1782, and the short-lived independence of the parliament of Ireland
                    was recognized by 23 Geo. III. c. 28. The application of Acts passed since the
                    Union is the same as in the case of Scotland.<pb break="no"

                    Acts of the imperial parliament do not extend to the Isle of Man, the Channel
                    Islands, or the colonies, unless they are specially named therein. By 28 and 29
                    Vict. c. 63 any colonial law repugnant to the provisions of any Act of
                    Parliament extending to the colony is void to the extent of such repugnancy, and
                    no colonial law is to be void by repugnancy to the law of England unless it be
                    repugnant to such an Act of Parliament. For colonies without representative
                    legislatures the crown usually legislates, subject to the consent of parliament
                    in particular cases. For instance, it was the opinion of the judicial committee
                    of the privy council in 1876 that a cession of British territory in India to a
                    native state would probably need the concurrence of the imperial parliament
                    (Damodhar Gordhan <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Deoram Kanji, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Rep.,</hi> 1 <hi rend="italic">Appeal Cases,</hi> 332).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> By the constitutions of many States
                    English statute law, as it existed at the time of the separation from England,
                    and as far as it is applicable, has been adopted as part of the law of the
                    States. The United States and the State are not bound by an Act of Congress or a
                    State law unless specially named. The States legislate for themselves within the
                    limits of their own constitution and that of the United States. Here appears the
                    striking difference between the binding force of a statute of the United Kingdom
                    and an Act passed by congress or a State legislature. In the United Kingdom
                    parliament is supreme; in the United States an Act is only of authority if it is
                    in accordance with the constitution. The courts may declare an Act void if it
                    contravene the constitution of the United States or of a State, so that
                    practically the Supreme Court of the United States is the ultimate legislative
                    authority. Examples of recent cases where the constitutionality of an Act has
                    been contested will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Payment</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Privilege.</hi> The restrictions upon legislation contained in
                    the constitution of the United States provide against the suspension of the writ
                    of habeas corpus, except in case of rebellion or invasion, the passing of a bill
                    of attainder or <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> law, the imposition of
                    capitation or other direct tax, unless in accordance with a previous article of
                    the constitution, or of a tax or duty on exports, the preference of the ports of
                    one State over those of another, the drawing of money from the treasury except
                    by appropriations made by law, and the grant of a title of nobility. The amended
                    constitution contains further limitations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    taking of private property for public use without just compensation, and the
                    abridging of the right of citizens on account of race, colour, or previous
                    condition of servitude. State legislation is limited by § 10:—“No State shall
                    make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, pass any
                    bill of attainder, <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> law, or law impairing
                    the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.” The section
                    further forbids imposition of duties on imports or exports or any duty of
                    tonnage without consent of congress. State constitutions often contain further
                    restrictions; among the more usual are provisions against laws with a
                    retrospective operation, or impairing the obligation of contracts, or dealing
                    with more than one subject to be expressed in the title. The time when a statute
                    is to take effect after its passing is often fixed by State constitutions. The
                    statutes of the United States were revised under the powers of an Act of
                    Congress passed in 1874 (sess. i. c. 333), and the volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revised Statutes</hi> (frequently amended since) was issued on February 22,
                    1875. Many of the States have also issued revised editions of their statutes.
                    The rules of construction are in general agreement with those adopted in
                    England. See Sedgwick, <hi rend="italic">Statutory Law.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >International Law.—</hi> The term statute is used by international jurists and
                    civilians to denote the whole body of the municipal law of the state. In this
                    sense statutes are either real, personal, or mixed. A real statute is that part
                    of the law which deals directly with property, whether movable or immovable. A
                    personal statute has for its object a person, and deals with questions of
                    status, such as marriage, legitimacy, or infancy. A mixed statute affects both
                    property and person, or, according to some authorities, it deals with acts and
                    obligations. Personal statutes are of universal validity; real statutes have no
                    extra-territorial authority. The determination of the class under which a
                    particular law ought to fall is one of great difficulty, and one in which there
                    is often a conflict of legal opinion. On the whole the division appears to have
                    created more difficulties than it has solved, and it is rejected by Savigny as
                    unsatisfactory. See Story, <hi rend="italic">Conflict of Laws,</hi> §§ 12-16;
                    Phillimore, <hi rend="italic">International Law,</hi> vol. iv. ch. xvi. (J.
