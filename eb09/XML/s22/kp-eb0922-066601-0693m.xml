                    Coup de Soleil;, Thermic Fever),</hi> a term applied to the effects produced
                    upon the central nervous system, and through it upon other organs of the body,
                    by exposure to the sun or to overheated air. Although most frequently observed
                    in tropical regions, this disease occurs also in temperate climates during hot
                    weather. A moist condition of the atmosphere, which interferes with cooling of
                    the overheated body, greatly increases the liability to suffer from this
                    ailment.</p>
                <p>Sunstroke has been chiefly observed and investigated as occurring among soldiers
                    in India, where formerly, both in active service and in the routine of ordinary
                    duty, cases of this disease constituted a considerable item of sickness and
                    mortality. The increased attention now paid by military authorities to the
                    personal health and comfort of the soldier, particularly as regards barrack
                    accommodation and dress, together with the care taken in adjusting the time and
                    mode of movement of troops, has done much to lessen the mortality from this
                    cause. It would appear that, while any one exposed to the influence of strong
                    solar heat may suffer from the symptoms of sunstroke, there are certain
                    conditions which greatly predispose to it in the case of individuals. Causes
                    calculated to depress the health, such as previous disease, particularly
                    affections of the nervous system,—anxiety, worry, or overwork, irregularities in
                    food, and in a marked degree intemperance— have a powerful predisposing
                    influence, while personal uncleanliness, which prevents among other things the
                    healthy action of the skin, the wearing of tight garments, which impede the
                    functions alike of heart and lungs, and living in overcrowded and insanitary
                    dwellings have an equally hurtful tendency.</p>
                <p>While attacks of sunstroke are frequently precipitated by exposure, especially
                    during fatigue, to the direct rays of the sun, in a large number of instances
                    they come on under other circumstances. Cases are of not unfrequent occurrence
                    among soldiers in hot climates when there is overcrowding or bad ventilation in
                    their barracks, and sometimes several will be attacked in the course of a single
                    night. The same remark applies to similar conditions existing on shipboard.
                    Further, persons whose occupation exposes them to excessive heat, such as
                    stokers, laundry workers, &amp;c., are apt to suffer, particularly in hot
                    seasons. In the tropics Europeans, especially those who have recently arrived,
                    are more readily affected than natives. But natives are not exempt.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of heatstroke, which obviously depend upon the disorganization of
                    the normal heat-regulating mechanism, as well as of the functions of circulation
                    and respiration (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 394),
                    vary in their intensity and likewise to some extent in their form. Three chief
                    types of the disease are usually described.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Heat Syncope.—</hi> In this form the symptoms are those of
                    exhaustion, with a tendency towards fainting or its actual occurrence. A fully
                    developed attack of this description is usually preceded by sickness, giddiness,
                    some amount of mental excitement followed by drowsiness, and then the passage
                    into the syncopal condition, in which there are pallor and coldness of the skin,
                    a weak, quick, and intermittent pulse, and gasping or sighing respiration. The
                    pupils are often contracted. Death may quickly occur; but if timely treatment is
                    available recovery may take place.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Heat Apoplexy or Asphyxia.—</hi> In this variety the
                    attack, whether preceded or not by the premonitory symptoms already mentioned,
                    is usually sudden, and occurs in the form of an apoplectic seizure, with great
                    vascular engorgement, as seen in the flushed face, congested eyes, quick full
                    pulse, and stertorous breathing. There is usually insensibility, and convulsions
                    are not unfrequent. Death is often very sudden. This form, however, is also
                    amenable to treatment.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Ardent Thermic Fever.—</hi> This variety is characterized
                    chiefly by the excessive development of fever (hyperpyrexia), the temperature of
                    the body rising at such times to 108° to 110° Fahr. or more. Accompanying this
                    are the other symptoms of high febrile disturbance, such as great thirst, quick
                    full pulse, pains throughout the body, headache, nausea, and vomiting, together
                    with respiratory embarrassment. After the attack has lasted for a variable
                    period, often one or two days, death may ensue from collapse or from the case
                    assuming the apoplectic form already described. But here too treatment may be
                    successful if it is promptly applied.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0694-0667"/> Besides these, other varieties depending on the
                    prominence of certain symptoms are occasionally met with. The chief changes in
                    the body after death from heatstroke are those of anaemia of the brain and
                    congestion of the lungs, together with softness of the heart and of the muscular
                    tissues generally. The blood is dark and fluid and the blood corpuscles are
                    somewhat altered in shape. Attacks of sunstroke are apt to leave traces of their
                    effects upon the constitution, especially upon the nervous system. A liability
                    to severe headache, which in many cases would seem to depend upon a condition of
                    chronic meningitis, epileptic fits, mental irritability, and alterations in the
                    disposition are among the more important. It is often observed that heat in any
                    form is ever afterwards ill borne, while there also appears to be an abnormal
                    susceptibility to the action of stimulants. The mortality from sunstroke is
                    estimated at from 40 to 50 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> In respect of this disease means should be
                    adopted to prevent attacks in the case of those who must necessarily be exposed
                    to the sun. These consist in the wearing of loose clothing, with the exception
                    of the headdress, which ought to be worn close to the head, in due attention to
                    the function of the skin, and in the avoidance of alcoholic and other excesses.
                    Cold water may be drank in small quantities at frequent intervals. Sleeping in
                    the open air in very hot seasons is recommended. The treatment of a patient
                    suffering from an attack necessarily depends upon the form it has assumed. In
                    all cases he should if possible be at once removed into a shaded or cool place.
                    Where the symptoms are mostly those of syncope and there is a tendency to death
                    from heart failure, rest in the recumbent position, the use of diffusible
                    stimulants, such as ammonia or ether, &amp;c., together with friction or warmth
                    applied to the extremities, are the means to be adopted. Where, on the other
                    hand, the symptoms are those of apoplexy or of hyperpyrexia, by far the most
                    successful results are obtained by the use of cold (the cold affusion, rubbing
                    the surface with ice, enemata of ice-cold water). The effect is a marked
                    lowering of the temperature, while at the same time a stimulus is given to the
                    respiratory function. Mustard or turpentine applied to the nape of the neck or
                    chest is a useful adjuvant. Should the temperature be lowered in this way but
                    unconsciousness still persist, removal of the hair and blistering the scalp are
                    recommended. The subsequent treatment will depend upon the nature of the
                    resulting symptoms, but change to a cool climate is often followed by marked
                    benefit. (J. O. A.)</p>
