                <p><label type="entry">SIREDON</label>. At the end of last century specimens of a
                    kind of branchiate tailed Amphibian were brought to Europe from the lakes of
                    Mexico; they were examined by the zoologists of Paris and described by Cuvier in
                    Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Recueil d' Observations de Zoologie,</hi> vol. i.,
                    and by Daudin in <hi rend="italic">Hist. des Reptiles</hi> (Paris, 1802-1804),
                    under their native name of “Axolotls.” The animals were named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siren pisciformis</hi> by Shaw <hi rend="italic">(Zool.,</hi> vol. iii.).
                    Wagler, in his <hi rend="italic">Natürliches System der Amphibien</hi>
                    (Stuttgart, 1828-1833), separated the axolotl from the Linnaean genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Siren</hi> and called it <hi rend="italic">Siredon axolotl,</hi>
                    and later writers have often referred to the animal under the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Siredon pisciforme,</hi> Shaw.</p>
                <p>The axolotl of Mexico is about 6 or 7 inches in length; it has four pairs of
                    gill-slits and three pairs of long feather-like external branchiae. The
                    branchial apertures are between the hyoid arch and the first branchial arch, and
                    between the first-second, second-third, and third-fourth branchial arches. The
                    branchiae are attached to the first, second, and third branchial arches. The
                    body is cylindrical, and a median membranous fin extends along the trunk
                    dorsally, is continued along the tail, passes round the end of the latter and
                    terminates ventrally at the anus. It has four limbs, which are short and
                    somewhat stout; the anterior terminate in four and the posterior in five digits.
                    The colour of the axolotl is a uniform black.</p>
                <p>The animal is therefore, except in size, very similar to the aquatic larva of <hi
                    rend="italic">Triton,</hi> or other Salamandroid, and Cuvier expressed the
                    opinion that it was a larval form which for some unknown reason was unable to
                    attain the adult condition. That it could not be considered simply as the larva
                    of an unknown species of Salamandroid was evident from the fact that it
                    possessed fully developed sexual organs in both sexes. There was every reason to
                    believe that it bred freely in the branchiate condition in which it was
                    discovered. The animal is so common in the lakes near the city of Mexico that it
                    is brought regularly to market and used largely by the Mexicans as food
                    (9).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These numerals
                    refer to the “Literature” <hi rend="italic">infra.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>If nothing more than the above were known about the axolotl it would be classed
                    among the <hi rend="italic">Perennibranchiata,</hi> in the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Proteida,</hi> having its nearest ally in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Menobranchus.</hi> Up till the year 1865 no actual observations
                    had been made by zoologists on the breeding of the axolotl: all that was known
                    was that the genital organs in many of the specimens examined were in perfectly
                    mature condition. In that year, on January 18, 6 axolotls, 5 males and 1
                    female,—which had been living for a year in the menagerie of reptiles of the
                    Musée d’Histoire Naturelle at Paris,—began to breed, and the deposition and
                    hatching of the eggs was carefully studied by Prof. A. Duméril (1). The eggs
                    were 2 mm. in diameter, and the period of development within the <hi
                    rend="italic">egg</hi> was 28 to 30 days; the larvae were hatched in February,
                    and were 14 mm. to 16 mm. in length. In the beginning of September, when the
                    larvae had almost reached the size of the parents, it was noticed that one of
                    them was undergoing a metamorphosis similar to that of the larval <hi
                    rend="italic">Triton</hi> to the adult. In a short time yellow spots appeared on
                    the skin, the branchiae disappeared, the gill-slits closed up, the median fin
                    disappeared, the animal began to breathe air and permanently quitted the water.
                    The same process of metamorphosis was repeated by several of the larvae, until
                    finally out of several hundred about thirty reached the salamandroid condition.
                    The parents in the meantime were still alive, and had undergone no change. When
                    the structure of the transformed specimens was examined, they were found to
                    resemble in all generic characters the genus <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma,</hi>
                    of which several species were known, inhabiting various parts of North
                    America.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The generic
                    characters of <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma,</hi> Tschudi, are, according to
                    Boulenger—tongue subcircular or oval, with radiating plicae, lateral borders
                    free, anterior border slightly free; two transverse series of palatine teeth in
                    same straight line, not separated by a wide interspace in the middle; toes five;
                    tail more or less compressed.</p></note> The consideration of Duméril’s
                    discovery gives rise to several perplexing questions, which have been discussed
                    by many zoologists experienced in the study of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia,</hi> and even now can scarcely be said to be completely settled. The
                    first question is— To what species of <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> did the
                    transformed axolotls of Duméril belong? Duméril himself, in the full account (2)
                    which he published concerning the animals and their metamorphosis, was unable to
                    give a decided opinion concerning the identification of the species of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblystoma,</hi> but on a subsequent occasion he confirmed the
                    suggestion of Prof. E. D. Cope (10) that the specific characters were those of
                    <hi rend="italic">A. mavortium,</hi> Cope (described in <hi rend="italic">Proc.
                    Ac. Philad.,</hi> 1867).</p>
                <p>The publication of Duméril’s discovery excited a great deal of interest among
                    European naturalists, and for a time experiments and observations on axolotls in
                    captivity were carried on with great earnestness. The metamorphosis in the case
                    of Duméril’s specimens had taken place quite unexpectedly, but the case seemed
                    to offer an opportunity for ascertaining the action of definite conditions in
                    producing definite processes of growth. Marie von Chauvin (6), at Freiburg, at
                    the instigation of Prof. Weissmann, attempted, and with perfect success, to
                    transform young axolotls into the <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> form by
                    gradually bringing the animals from water into air.</p>
                <p>The transformed axolotls observed by Duméril were kept alive in the Paris Museum,
                    and for ten years showed no symptoms of breeding or sexual activity. It was
                    currently believed that the <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> derived from the
                    metamorphosis of <hi rend="italic">Siredon</hi> was sterile. This belief
                    ultimately proved erroneous. In the autumn of 1874 the animals in the menagerie
                    of reptiles were transferred to new premises, where they were all placed in more
                    healthy conditions. Immediately after this the <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi>
                    deposited fertilized eggs, and the fact was reported by M. Blanchard to the
                    Académie des Sciences (4), with the comment that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amblystoma</hi> was thus shown to be similar to other cold-blooded animals
                    which were capable of reproducing in both the young and the adult condition.</p>
                <p>Although at first Duméril believed and stated that his specimens of axolotl
                    belonged to the species which bears that name in Mexico, he afterwards, in his
                    more detailed work on the subject (2), explained that the grounds for his first
                    opinion had been insufficient. American zoologists, especially Baird and Cope,
                    had distinguished several species of <hi rend="italic">Siredon,</hi> and Baird
                    had separated the Mexican species, which alone was originally called axolotl, as
                    <hi rend="italic">Siredon mexicanus.</hi> Duméril came to the conclusion that
                    the axolotls in the Paris Museum were identical with <hi rend="italic">Siredon
                    lichenoides,</hi> Baird (described in Stansburg, <hi rend="italic">Exped. Gr.
                    Salt Lake, Utah).</hi> All the axolotls which were kept and studied and
                    subjected to experiment by naturalists on the Continent after Duméril’s
                    discovery were descendants of the Paris specimens, so that the results obtained
                    really did not necessarily prove anything with regard to the true Mexican
                    axolotl, <hi rend="italic">Siredon mexicanus,</hi> if that were really a
                    distinct species. There is no evidence in literature to show whence the first
                    axolotls in the Paris Museum were obtained. It was evident that <hi
                    rend="italic">Siredon lichenoides</hi> was capable of breeding in both the
                    larval and the salamandroid condition, and that its metamorphosis in captivity
                    in Europe was rare and to a certain extent controlled by definite external
                    conditions. Prof. O. C. Marsh has recorded his experience of the metamorphosis
                    of <hi rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi rend="italic">lichenoides.</hi> He obtained
                    several specimens from alpine lakes 7000 feet above the sea in Wyoming
                    Territory, and some of these metamorphosed into <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma
                    mavortium,</hi> Cope. Marsh does not say if the larvae he obtained were sexually
                    mature, nor did he ascertain if breeding of the species in the larval condition
                    took place at all in the lakes he visited; he thinks it probable that the
                    metamorphosis in that region was rare in the natural conditions.</p>
                <p>The metamorphosis of the true axolotl, undoubtedly obtained from the Lake of
                    Mexico, seems to have been observed only once— namely, by Tegetmeier in London.
                    That naturalist had 5 specimens, and one of them underwent the metamorphosis. In
                    1871 Cope (10) stated that no one had seen the metamorphosis of the true
                    siredon, <hi rend="italic">Siredon mexicanus,</hi> Baird, and that no <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblystomae</hi> had been obtained from Mexico south of the Tropic
                    of Cancer, while<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n112/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0112-0097"/> the true axolotl is found south of that line. He
                    was unaware of Tegetmeier’s observation. He further declared that Prof. Baird
                    was aware of the metamorphosis of all the North American species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Siredon</hi> so-called, excluding <hi rend="italic">S.
                    mexicanus,</hi> years before the observation of it by Duméril, though he had at
                    first named one of them <hi rend="italic">Siredon lichenoides,</hi> in the
                    belief that it was adult. Cope considered the observation of Duméril important,
                    as showing that siredons reproduced as such.</p>
                <p>Finally, according to Boulenger (7), the <hi rend="italic">S. lichenoides</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">mexicanus</hi> of Baird are synonymous, the Paris axolotl
                    is identical with the same species, and the perfect form into which it changed
                    is identical with <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum, mexicanum,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">mavortium</hi> of Cope, <hi rend="italic">obscurum</hi> of Baird,
                    while the form named <hi rend="italic">Siredon gracilis</hi> by Baird is
                    probably the larva of <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma tenebrosum.</hi> Boulenger
                    adopts the name <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum</hi> of the synonyms given above,
                    and gives as the distribution United States and Mexico; the specific diagnosis
                    is—series of palatine teeth extending to external fissure of choanae; plicae of
                    tongue radiating from behind; costal grooves twelve; head large; brown or
                    blackish, with yellow markings.</p>
                <p>It is therefore very probable that the Paris specimens were really Mexican
                    axolotls, and there is no doubt that these animals do in captivity undergo
                    metamorphosis. So far as is known, they never do so in their natural conditions.
                    But the animals are specifically identical with <hi rend="italic">A.
                    tigrinum,</hi> which is found in many parts of the United States, from New
                    Jersey to California, and normally breeds in the Salamandroid condition. It is
                    not known at present whether the larva of <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum</hi>
                    ever attains sexual maturity in other regions where the species occurs besides
                    Mexico. It is not improbable that it does so. De Filippi (8) found in a marsh on
                    the shores of the Lago Maggiore 48 larvae of <hi rend="italic">Triton
                    alpestris</hi> in the branchiate condition, which contained fully developed ova
                    and spermatozoa, so that the occurrence of sexual maturity in the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> is not unique. Prof. August Weissmann (5) has
                    discussed at considerable length and with much thoughtfulness the true
                    significance of the phenomena exhibited by the axolotl, and has concluded that
                    its ancestors passed through the normal life-history of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amblystoma,</hi> the climate of the Mexican tableland having been at one time
                    moist enough to permit of the existence of a terrestrial Salamandroid; that the
                    climate has now became so dry and unfavourable to vegetation that no amphibian
                    can live in it except in water; and that <hi rend="italic">Amblystoma</hi> has
                    become adapted to these conditions by ceasing to pass through its metamorphosis,
                    and breeding entirely in the branchiate condition. Thus the metamorphosis which
                    takes place occasionally in captivity is a case of what has been called since
                    Darwin’s epoch atavism; its peculiarity consists in the fact that the evolution
                    of the animal has resulted in the arrest of development at a larval stage, and
                    the occasional reversion is the continuation of the development to the higher
                    condition of the ancestor. Atavism is the occasional resemblance of one
                    individual to some remote ancestors instead of to its immediate parents. Another
                    possible way of explaining the axolotl is to suppose that it has remained in the
                    perennibranchiate condition while other members of the same species elsewhere
                    have developed into the Salamandroid condition. This explanation cannot be the
                    true one. It would necessitate the belief that a metamorphosis lasting a few
                    days or weeks, and induced often by the gradual removal of the animal from water
                    into air, could produce the same specific characters as a gradual development
                    which has occupied a great number of generations. The axolotl is an example of
                    one of the most curious and interesting modes by which animals may be adapted to
                    their conditions, and two species formed out of one. At present the
                    disappearance of the metamorphosis from the life-history of the axolotl has
                    taken place so recently that not even specific differences exist, according to
                    some observers, between the metamorphosed axolotl and the natural <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblystoma tigrinum.</hi> At some future time slight differences
                    are almost sure to occur, and then there will be two species or the tendency to
                    metamorphosis in the axolotl will be lost. In the latter case some slight
                    differences will probably be developed between the axolotl and the branchiate
                    larva of <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum</hi> in other parts of America; and then
                    the axolotl and <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum</hi> will be two species. Finally,
                    it may be pointed out that it is possible that the axolotl could have reached
                    its present locality and conditions without any change in the climate of Mexico.
                    The lakes in the arid district might somehow occasionally be visited by breeding
                    <hi rend="italic">A. tigrinum,</hi> and of the larvae so produced in them some
                    might become sexually mature before metamorphosing, and so give rise to the
                    present axolotls.</p>
                <p>There is some reason to believe, according to the American zoologist Prof. Cope,
                    that the perennibranchiate <hi rend="italic">Menobranchus lateralis,</hi>
                    Tschudi, of the Mississippi, which when full grown is over a foot in length, and
                    has four branchial apertures, stands in the same relation to the genus <hi
