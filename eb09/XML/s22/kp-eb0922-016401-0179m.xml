                    (1722-1771), English poet, was born at Shipbourne in Kent on 11th April 1722.
                    The discovery that Smart was anything more than an unfortunate Bohemian of
                    letters who wrote much uninteresting verse of second-rate 18th-century quality
                    is quite recent. After one or another of his superseded translations or
                    ineffective exercises in heroics had in turn been assigned the place of honour
                    as his representative literary work, his real masterpiece was discerned in a
                    poem which, except for a reprint issued in 1819, had been singularly overlooked,
                    and even omitted from the collected editions of his poetry. The history of this
                    poem, <hi rend="italic">A Song to David,</hi> is somewhat remarkable. It was
                    written in the saner moments of confinement for a fit of insanity, and was, it
                    is said, on not unimpeachable authority perhaps, indented with an iron nail or a
                    key on the wall of the cell in default of other means of writing. The real facts
                    of the case would seem to be that the unfortunate poet inscribed one or two
                    stanzas in the manner asserted, and that he either dictated or was given the
                    materials wherewith to write the rest of the poem.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0180-0165"/> There is no internal evidence of any morbid
                    origin, however, for the poem is full of a healthy and virile energy. As a boy
                    he was delicate and precocious, with a facile gift of verse, which already won
                    him a certain notoriety, of not the best effect haply, at Durham school, whither
                    he had been sent on leaving a preparatory school at Maidstone. During a holiday
                    visit to Raby castle his boyish gifts attracted the interest of the duchess of
                    Cleveland, who made him an allowance of £40 a year, which was continued until
                    her death, and which possibly served further to weaken his self-reliance. At
                    Cambridge, where he was entered at Pembroke Hall in 1739, he led a rather
                    dissipated life, getting heavily into debt, and, while he easily excelled in
                    certain congenial branches of study, he paid little attention to the usual
                    college routine. In spite of his irregularities, he was made a fellow of his
                    college in 1745, and at a later date won the newly instituted Seaton prize for
                    an English poem,—the subject each year being one of “the attributes of the
                    Supreme Being.” Smart gained this prize five times in all. Resorting then to
                    London and marrying there a daughter-in-law of Newbery, the publisher, the poet
                    attempted to make a living by literary hack-work and journalism, but sank
                    gradually into difficulties through his improvident and dissipated habits, so
                    that his wife and children were at last obliged to leave him. His misfortunes
                    seem to have culminated in the fit of insanity associated with <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Song to David,</hi> which was published in 1763, and in 1771 Smart died from
                    the effects of poverty and disease.</p>
                <p>Amid all his miseries Smart must have been fairly industrious if his journalistic
                    work was at all proportionate to his more substantial literary productions. Of
                    all that he wrote, however, <hi rend="italic">A Song to David</hi> will alone
                    bear the test of time. Unlike in its simple forceful treatment and impressive
                    directness of expression, as has been said, to anything else in 18th-century
                    poetry, the poem on analysis is found to depend for its unique effect also upon
                    a certain ingenuity of construction, and the novel way in which David’s ideal
                    qualities are enlarged upon. This will be more readily understood on reference
                    to the following verse, the first twelve words of which become in turn the
                    key-notes, so to speak, of the twelve succeeding verses :—</p>
                <p>“Great, valiant, pious, good, and clean,</p>
                <p>Sublime, contemplative, serene,</p>
                <p>Strong, constant, pleasant, wise!</p>
                <p>Bright effluence of exceeding grace;</p>
                <p>Best man !—the swiftness, and the race,</p>
                <p>The peril, and the prize.”</p>
                <p>The last line is characteristic of another peculiarity in <hi rend="italic">A
                    Song to David,</hi> the effective use of alliteration to complete the initial
                    energy of the stanza in many instances. But in the poem throughout is revealed a
                    poetic quality which eludes critical analysis and gives its writer an
                    exceptional interest hardly maintained by his other works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A Song to David</hi> is found in somewhat shortened form in
                    Ward's <hi rend="italic">English Poets,</hi> vol. iii., and Smart’s other poems
                    are given in Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">British Poets (1794),</hi> vol. xi.,
                    which contains also a full account of his life.</p>
