                <p><label type="entry">SOLOMON ISLANDS</label>, an extensive group of islands, the
                    largest and as yet least known of any in the Pacific Ocean, though among the
                    very first that were discovered. They form a double chain of seven large and
                    many small islands, extending for over 600 miles in a north-west and south-east
                    direction between 5° S. lat., 154° 40' E. long., and 10° 54' S. lat., 162° 30'
                    E. long. The northern extremity stretches to within 120 miles of New Ireland,
                    the south-eastern point to 200 miles west of Santa Cruz, and the nearest portion
                    of New Guinea lies about 400 miles to the south-west of the group.<note

                    <hi rend="italic">The larger are—in the eastern chain, Bougainville, Choiseul,
                    Ysabel, Malanta; and in the western chain, New Georgia, Guadalcanal (often
                    misspelt Guadalcanar), San Christoval. The smaller are—Buka (the most northern),
                    Shortland, Treasury, Faro, Simba (Eddystone), Rubiana, Hammond, Marsh, Savo,

                    seeing near Buena Vista a small island in a state of violent eruption; he named
                    it Sesarga. Ongtong Java is a group of coral islands in the north-east, but it
                    does not, geographically, form part of the group.</hi></p></note> See vol. xix.

                <p>The Solomon Islands vary considerably both in size and character. It is as yet
                    doubtful which of them is the largest, but seven are from 50 to over 100 miles
                    in length and from 15 to 30 miles in breadth; several must therefore equal the
                    county of Cornwall in area. They are well watered, though the streams seem to be
                    small; their coasts afford some good harbours.<note anchored="true"

                    Port Praslin, Ysabel; Maruvo, New Georgia; Port Wiseman, Florida; Curaçoa
                    Harbour in Marau Sound, Guadalcanal; Recherche Bay, Makira Bay, and Vanga
                    Harbour, San Christoval.</hi></p></note> All the large and some of the smaller
                    islands appear to be composed of ancient volcanic rock, with an incrustation of
                    coral limestone showing here and there along the coast. Their interior is
                    mountainous, and Guadalcanal, where there is an active volcano, reaches an
                    altitude of 8000 feet. Malanta and Christoval are over 4000, Ysabel and Choiseul
                    2000 feet high. The mountains of the latter fall steep to the sea, and the whole
                    of its north-east portion forms an elevated wooded plain. There is some level
                    land in Bougainville, which is also said to possess an active volcano. Every
                    traveller has extolled the beauty and fertility of the islands. In San
                    Christoval deep valleys separate the gently-rounded ridges of its forest-clad
                    mountains, lofty spurs descend from the interior, and, running down to the sea,
                    terminate, on the north, in bold rocky headlands 800 to 1000 feet in height,
                    while, on the south, they form and shelter bays of deep water. On the small high
                    island of Florida there is much undulating grass land, interspersed with fine
                    clumps of trees; but patches of cultivated land surround its numerous villages,
                    and plantations on the hill-sides testify to the richness of its soil. To the
                    south of Choiseul lies a small cliff-girt islet, Simba (Shortland’s Eddystone),
                    with a peak ending in a crater 1200 feet high, on the side of which are a
                    solfatara and two boiling springs. It is inhabited, and has a small safe
                    harbour. Surgeon Guppy, late of H.M.S. “Lark,” has recently made valuable
                    geological observations in the north and south of the group. The whole chain of
                    islands appear to be rising steadily, and traces of ancient upheaval are very
                    general,— for instance, Treasury Island, where a coral-encrusted volcanic peak
                    has been raised 1200 feet, and the atoll of Sta Anna, the ring of which now
                    stands hundreds of feet above the present level of the sea. Some of the smaller
                    islands are of recent calcareous formation. Barrier and fringing reefs, as well
                    as atolls, occur in the group, but the channels between the islands are
                    dangerous, chiefly from the strong currents which set through them.</p>
                <p>The climate is very damp and debilitating. The rainfall is unusually heavy. Fever
                    and ague prevail on the coast, but it is likely that the highlands will prove
                    much more healthy. The dry season, with north-west winds, lasts from December to
                    May.</p>
                <p>A comparatively shoal sea—under 1000 fathoms— surrounds the Archipelago, and,
                    including the New Britain and Admiralty Islands, stretches to New Guinea and
                    thence to Australia. This sufficiently accounts for the Papuan character of its
                    fauna, of which, however, it is the eastern limit, in spite of the fact that
                    this shoal water extends to the extreme south of the New Hebrides. Here the
                    strange little marsupial the cuscus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Phalanger)</hi> is
                    still to be met with; the hornbill, the cockatoo, the crimson lory, and birds of
                    a dozen other genera have already been discovered, “all,” as Wallace remarks,
                    “highly characteristic of the Moluccas and New Guinea, and quite unknown in any
                    of the more remote Pacific islands.” But, like the New Hebrides, the Solomon
                    Islands possess a megapode (<hi rend="italic">M</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >breηchleyi)</hi> which is peculiar to itself. An alligator frequents the coast,
                    and the sea teems with fish. Insects seem to be fairly well represented. The
                    flora has been even less studied than the zoology, but it also shows strong
                    Papuan affinities. Vegetation is most luxuriant: unbroken tracts of magnificent
                    forest clothe the mountains, where sandalwood, ebony, and lignum vitae have
                    already been found. Mangrove swamps are common on the coasts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Solomon Islanders, excepting those of Bellona and Rennell
                    in the south, and Ongtong Java in the north—who are pure Polynesians—are a small
                    sturdy Melanesian race, taller in the north than in the south, but averaging
                    about 5 feet 4 inches for men, and 4 feet 9 inches for women. They are well
                    proportioned, with nicely rounded limbs. Projecting brows, deeply-sunk dark
                    eyes, short noses, either straight or arched, but always depressed at the root,
                    and moderately thick lips, with a somewhat receding chin, are general
                    characteristics. The expression of the face is not unpleasing. The mesocephalic
                    appears to be the preponderant form of skull, though this is unusual among
                    Melanesian races. In colour the skin varies from a black-brown to a copperish
                    hue, but the darker are the most common shades. The hair is dark, often dyed red
                    or fawn. Crisp, inclining to woolly, it naturally hangs in a mop of ringlets 3
                    to 8 inches in length; but, when carefully tended, it forms one smooth bush—the
                    usual fashion for both sexes. Epilation is practised; little hair, as a rule,
                    grows on the face, but hairy men are not rare.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    Bougainville Strait tribes with lank, almost straight, black hair and very dark

                    by a smaller and ruder race, with whom the coast tribes wage perpetual war and
                    for whom they express great contempt.</hi></p></note><hi rend="italic">Skin

                    servants. They are fond of dancing; their music is a monotonous chant with

                    pan-pipes and jew’s harps. Of their religion and manners and customs very little
                    is known. Their language is of pure Melanesian type though a number of dialects
                    are spoken throughout the group,—many even on the same island. Broken into
                    numerous clans, they are rarely at peace with each other; but the attention
                    bestowed on plantations proves them good agriculturists. Yams, arum-roots,
                    bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and fish constitute the chief of their food. Pigs,
                    dogs, and fowls are also eaten, and, as these are mentioned by Mendana, they
                    must have been known in the islands for over three hundred years. The islanders
                    are great betel-chewers, but little palm arrack or kava seems to be drunk. The
                    respect paid to chiefs and elders varies in different islands. They are
                    cannibals, though to what extent is unknown. Trophies of human skulls are
                    common, and preserved heads—the face inlaid with shell—have been procured in
                    Guadalcanal and Rubiana. They are said to pay honour to departed spirits.
                    Carvings representing both men and animals often form the posts of houses and
                    sheds, and adorn the prows of canoes. Their houses are square or oblong,
                    strongly built, with high projecting roofs, which sometimes, as in their
                    canoe-sheds, almost reach to the ground. The floor-mats are very rough. Large
                    halls and spirit-houses exist in some of the villages, and great care and skill
                    are bestowed on their decoration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See frontispiece to Brenchley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Curaçoa.</hi></p></note> Great nicety of finish characterizes their weapons.
                    They are mostly light and graceful, and consist of bows and arrows, spears, and
                    clubs; the sling seems unknown. Some of the spears have the barbed head carved
                    out of a human leg or arm bone; others, if not cut out of the solid wood, have
                    bones, thorns, or splinters of wood attached in a most masterly manner. Arrows
                    are similarly fashioned, and their reed shafts ornamented with incised lines.
                    None of them appear to be poisoned. The bows, often large and powerful, are made
                    of palm-wood or a strip of bamboo. Clubs vary considerably in shape; their butts
                    are sometimes covered with finely-plaited coloured grass. Some, which are long
                    and slight, are sickle-or scythe-like, others lanceolate or spoon-shaped; and
                    some, smaller, resemble a very broad dagger. This is, in the Pacific, the
                    eastern limit of the shield. It is an unknown weapon in the other islands
                    —Melanesian as well as Polynesian,—but to the west, in the New Britain group,
                    and in New Guinea, various forms of it occur, whence, through the Malay islands,
                    it may be traced back to the Asiatic continent. The shield is also used by the
                    Australians. That of the Solomon Islanders is made of reeds, and is of an oval
                    or oblong form. Their canoes are built of planks sewn together and caulked, and
                    are the most beautiful in the Pacific. They are very light, slim, and taper, 20
                    to 60 feet in length, with 1 to 3 feet beam, but they balance so well that an
                    outrigger is dispensed with. The high carved prow and stern—which are said to
                    act as a shield from arrows when stem on—give the craft almost a crescent shape.
                    These and the gunwale are tastefully inlaid with mother-of-pearl and wreathed
                    with shells and feathers. Sails are not used, but the narrow pointed paddles
                    propel the canoes with great speed through the water.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rude outrigger canoes with mat sails are used
                    in some parts of the archipelago.</p></note> Graceful bowls, with some bird or
                    animal for model, are also made. They are cut out of the solid, and sometimes
                    measure over 8 feet in length. Stone adzes appear to be now used only in the
                    interior and in the north of the group. They are well ground, flat and pyriform
                    in shape, and very different from any made in the neighbouring groups of
                    islands. Clothing is of the scantiest. Both men and women not unfrequently go
                    naked; but, as a rale, some slight covering is worn, and neatly-made fringed
                    girdles are used in some districts. Tattooing and scarring of the body is but
                    slightly practised. Ornaments are used in profusion, and often are very
                    tasteful. Carved wooden belts, coloured shell-bead bands, and a variety of
                    armlets, combs, and feather head-dresses are worn, also shell disks covered with
                    tortoise-shell fretwork. Necklaces of teeth and shell are common and multiform;
                    one much prized is made of human incisors. The ears, and, in men, the septum of
                    the nose, are pierced,—frequently, also, the cartilage of one or both nostrils.
                    In these the strangest ornaments are inserted, such as tortoise-shell rings,
                    bones, teeth, shells, crab-claws, and the like.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Spanish navigator Mendana must be credited with
                    the discovery of these islands, though it is somewhat doubtful whether he was
                    actually the first European who set eyes on them. He sailed from Callao in 1567,
                    by command of the governor of Peru, to discover the southern continent, the
                    presumed existence of which in the then unknown region between America and Asia
                    had already given rise to much speculation; but he seems to have been strangely
                    unfortunate. Sailing west he discovered only a few coral islets (? Ellice group)
                    until, having crossed more than 7000 miles of ocean, he fell in with an
                    archipelago of large islands. By their size and position he considered them to
                    form part of the land he was in search of, and in pleasing anticipation of their
                    natural riches he named them Islas de Salomon. The expedition surveyed the
                    southern portion of the group, and named the three large islands San Christoval,
                    Guadalcanal, and Ysabel. On his return to Peru Mendana endeavoured to organize
                    another expedition to colonize the islands, but it was not before June 1595 that
                    he, with Quiros as second in command, was enabled to set sail for this purpose.
                    The Marquesas and Santa Cruz Islands were now discovered; but on these latter
                    islands, after various delays and troubles, Mendana died, and the expedition
                    eventually collapsed.</p>
                <p>Even the position of the Solomon Islands was now veiled in uncertainty, and they
                    were quite lost sight of until, in 1767, two centuries after their first
                    discovery, Carteret lighted on their eastern shores at Gower Island, and passed
                    to the north of the group, without, however, recognizing that it formed part of
                    the Spanish discoveries. In 1768 Bougainville found his way thither. He
                    discovered the three northern islands (Buka, Bougainville, and Choiseul), and
                    sailed through the channel which divides the latter two. In 1769 Surville
                    explored the east coast, and was the first, in spite of the hostility of the
                    natives, to make any lengthened stay in the group. He brought home some detailed
                    information concerning the islands, which he called Terres des Arsacides; but
                    their identity with Mendaña’s Islas de Salomon was soon established by French
                    geographers. In 1788 Shortland discovered New Georgia, with some of the smaller
                    islands; aud in 1792 Manning sailed through the strait which separates Ysabel
                    from Choiseul and now bears his name. In the same year, and in 1793,
                    D’Entrecasteaux surveyed portions of the coast-line of the large islands. In
                    1794 Butler visited the group, and Williamson in the “Indispensable” explored
                    the channels which divide Guadalcanal from San Christoval and Ysabel from
                    Malanta. There was a break of nearly half a century before D’Urville in 1838
                    took up the survey.</p>
                <p>Traders now endeavoured to settle in the islands, and missionaries began to think
                    of this fresh field for labour, but neither met with much success, and little
                    was heard of the islanders save accounts of murder and plunder perpetrated by
                    them. In 1845 the French Marist fathers went to Ysabel, where Mgr Epaulle, first
                    vicar-apostolic of Melanesia, was killed by the natives soon after landing.
                    Three years later this mission had to be abandoned; but since 1881 work has
                    again been resumed. In 1856 John Coleridge Patteson, afterwards bishop of
                    Melanesia, paid his first visit to the islands, and native teachers trained at
                    the Melanesian mission college have since established themselves there, as well
                    as a few traders. About this date the yacht “Wanderer” cruised in these seas,
                    but her owner was kidnapped by the natives and never afterwards heard of. In
                    1873 the “foreign-labour” traffic in plantation hands for Queensland and Fiji
                    extended its baneful influence from the New Hebrides to these islands.
                    Noteworthy recent visits are those of H.M.S. “Curaçoa” in 1865, H.M.S. “Blanche”
                    and Mr C. F. Wood’s yacht in 1872, the German war-ship “Gazelle” in 1876, and
                    H.M.S. “Lark” in 1881-84.</p>
