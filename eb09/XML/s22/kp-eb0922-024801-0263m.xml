                <p><label type="entry">SOKOTO</label>, an important Fulah kingdom or empire in
                    Central Soudan, comprising what are frequently called the Haussa states. Its
                    boundaries (see vol. i. pl. II.) are irregularly marked off by the plateau lands
                    of Air or Asben on the north, the kindred Fulah state of Gandu on the west,
                    while the river Binué practically forms its southern limit as far as the
                    meridian of 10° E.; beyond this it runs south into the Congo basin. On the east
                    lies the kingdom of Bornu. From north-west to south-east Sokoto has a length
                    little short of 900 English miles and its average breadth is about 280. The
                    whole area has been roughly computed to be equal to that of Spain (about 195,000
                    square miles), and to have a population of from ten to twelve millions. The
                    country may be described as a great undulating plain, rarely exceeding 1000 feet
                    in height, with the exception of the province of Bauchi in the centre, which
                    runs into a highland region with heights of 3000 feet, and the still more
                    imposing masses of Adamawa in the south, which are said to attain an altitude of
                    10,000 feet in Mount Alantika. In other respects Sokoto presents more varied
                    features, chiefly determined by the amount of rainfall, though the varying
                    fertility of the soil is a not unimportant factor. In the southern parts, where
                    there are almost perpetual rains,. large streams and rivers are numerous, —the
                    feeders of the Binué, the great eastern (left-hand) tributary of the Niger. Here
                    grow the virgin forests with giant growths and exuberant foliage, with creepers,
                    with bananas and plantains, palm-oil trees and yams. In the more
                    temperate—because more elevated—districts of the middle area, with a smaller
                    rainfall, the vegetation is less luxuriant, and such fruits as the date, lime,
                    and pomegranate are cultivated. In the northern parts the climate is still more
                    arid, and the country is burned up for the greater part of the year. This is the
                    region of acacias and mimosas, of baobabs, of the branching dúm palm and the
                    curiously bulged deléb. Here are no forests nor rank grass, while the exigencies
                    of a dense population have caused the clearing away of the bush except on the
                    most barren spots, where it supplies the necessary fuel for domestic purposes.
                    In this northern district there are no streams except in the wet season, and the
                    wants of the people are supplied by fountains in the more favoured places, and
                    by wells—frequently very deep—in those not so advantageously situated. Lying
                    within the tropics, Sokoto is subject to excessive heat,—damp and steamy in the
                    south, dry and furnace-like in the north, where it suffers from the hot winds
                    from the Sahara. In Adamawa the rainy season—or, to be more correct, the season
                    of excessive rains—commences in April and lasts till October or later, while in
                    Gober in the north the rains commence in June and seldom last more than three
                    months, during which the country becomes transformed from a repellent desert
                    into a well-cultivated nursery garden.</p>
                <p>For Central Africa Sokoto may be described as fairly healthy, though, as may be
                    expected from a conjunction of excessive heat with excessive rain, fevers are
                    not uncommon in the southern parts, while ophthalmia is prevalent in the north,
                    especially among the poorer classes, who are compelled to expose themselves to
                    the blinding dust from the deserts and the excessive glare of the sun reflected
                    from the burning sands.</p>
                <p>The natural productions of Sokoto are such as are more or less common throughout
                    the whole of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Soudan</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>
                    Among cereals rice and wheat are cultivated in many parts, though the staple
                    productions are Kaffre corn, millet, and maize. Sweet potatoes, ground nuts,
                    yams, onions, and other vegetables are largely grown. Of fruits dates,
                    pomegranates, citrons, and bananas abound in more restricted areas. The Shea
                    butter tree supplies an excellent oil for lamps, and also for cooking, though it
                    is only used by the poorer classes. The palm-oil tree is only found in the damp
                    basin of the Binué. The most important vegetable products are cotton and indigo,
                    which are universally grown. The cotton is manufactured into cloth, being used
                    by the native population as well as largely exported to neighbouring countries.
                    In some parts a species of silk found in the forests is largely used, and the
                    people of Yakoba in Bauchi are said to rear the silkworm. Of mineral products
                    there seem to be few, though it is known that both silver and lead occur in the
                    Binué area. Iron is extensively diffused and of excellent quality.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of this extensive region, held together by a conquering race and
                    not by any natural tie into one common kingdom, are of diverse tribes and
                    affinities. They, however, may be roughly divided into three groups. (1) First
                    come the pure Negro races of Adamawa, of which the chief tribe is the Batta. (2)
                    The Haussa form the mass of the population except in Adamawa. They are
                    pre-eminent among Negroes for their physical appearance and intellectual
                    abilities. They are wonderfully skilled in various arts and industries and noted
                    for their commercial genius and enterprise. Mohammedanism is their religion, and
                    indeed in all respects they are well advanced on the road to civilization. They
                    are very fond of voluminous clothes. (3) The Fulahs are a Hamitic race, who from
                    being simple herdsmen in the beginning of the 19th century have become the
                    rulerδ and masters over a hundred alien races between the Atlantic and Lake
                    Tchad. They have not the commercial or industrial skill of the Haussa, but in
                    other respects have reached a higher level. They are of slender build and are
                    distinguished by their light coppery colour. The inhabitants of Sokoto live
                    mostly in large towns, many of which contain from 10,000 to 20,000 inhabitants.
                    These towns are all protected by strong mud walls and outer dry moats. Their
                    interior is divided into a series of compounds, each entered through a
                    flat-roofed audience chamber. Inside are the beehive-shaped huts of the
                    household. The gateways are also strongly fortified. The ruler over Sokoto is a
                    Fulah sultan, whose power is absolute, though tempered by a species of feudal
                    system. The governors of some of the larger provinces, though owning allegiance
                    to the sovereign, are mostly hereditary, and beyond sending a yearly tribute are
                    practically independent. The tie indeed is more religious than anything else.
                    The great weakness of the empire is its want of coherence and the absence of a
                    strong central Government. Yet, though always appearing to be on the point of
                    falling to pieces, it contrives to keep together. The condition in which Barth
                    found it in 1855 was practically the same as when the present writer visited it
                    in 1885.</p>
                <p>The chief provinces of Sokoto are Zamphoro, Zaria, Katsena, Bauchi, Kano, and
                    Adamawa. The most important towns are— Sokoto, the acknowledged capital of the
                    empire, famed chiefly for its leather-work and straw hats (it divides with Wurnu
                    the distinction of being the residence of the sultan; Clapperton died here in
                    1837); Wurnu, about 18 miles farther east, the present (1887) headquarters of
                    the court; Kano, the great commercial emporium of Central Soudan; and Yakoba,
                    chiefly noted for its large size,— said to contain 150,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The history of Sokoto may be said to have commenced with the 19th century.
                    Previous to that date little is known further than that the country was divided
                    among a number of small chiefs, a prey to the powerful kings of Bornu, Kebbi,
                    and Songhwai (Songhai). In 1802 the Fulahs, then little regarded and semi-serfs
                    in position, were scattered all over the country, apparently without any
                    national tie to unite them to common action. At last, however, an imam—one
                    Othman dan Fodio—appeared, who with the watchword of Islam gave a new life to
                    his tribesmen and in an incredibly short time transformed them from peaceable
                    nomads into soldiers of the Crescent, and after a few initial reverses swept
                    like a whirlwind over an enormous area, establishing himself as ruler and
                    Mohammedanism as the religion of the whole of Central Soudan. At his death the
                    parts now known as Sokoto fell to the share of his son Bello, and in the family
                    of Othman the reins of government have since remained, though the descent is not
                    as a rule from father to son, but either to a brother or a brother’s son. The
                    latest phase in the history is the proclaiming of a protectorate over a part of
                    Sokoto on the Binué by the British Government, and the handing over of the
                    administration of the Niger region to the Royal Niger Company. To this company
                    the sultan has conceded all his rights on the Binué and a monopoly of trade
                    throughout his dominions, thus making them practically masters of all foreign
                    intercourse.</p>
                <p>The most important sources of information regarding Sokoto are—Clapperton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Journeys</hi> in the early part of the 19th century; Barth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Central Africa</hi> between 1849 and 1855—a perfect
                    mine of information; and Rohlfs’s <hi rend="italic">Reise durch Nordafrika vom
                    Mittelmeer nach dem Tschad-See</hi> in 1866-67. Among later and minor travellers
                    have been Flegel, who visited Sokoto in 1880, and Thomson, who conducted a
                    commercial and political mission to the court of the sultan in 1885. (J. TH.)<pb
