                    successful operas at Rome, Florence, Naples, and Palermo, he settled in 1803 at
                    Paris. His reception in the French capital was anything but flattering. His
                    first comic opera, <hi rend="italic">Julie,</hi> proved a failure; his second,
                    <hi rend="italic">La Petite Maison,</hi> was hissed. Undaunted by these
                    misfortunes, he abandoned the light and somewhat frivolous style of his earlier
                    works, and in <hi rend="italic">Milton,</hi> a one-act opera produced in 1804,
                    achieved a real success. Spontini henceforth aimed at a very high ideal, and
                    during the remainder of his life strove so earnestly to reach it that he
                    frequently remodelled his passages five or six times before permitting them to
                    be performed in public, and wearied his singers by introducing new improvements
                    at every rehearsal. His first masterpiece was <hi rend="italic">La Vestale,</hi>
                    completed in 1805, but kept from the stage through the opposition of a jealous
                    clique until 15th December 1807, when it was produced at the Académie, and at
                    once took rank with the finest works of its class. The composer’s second opera,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand Cortez,</hi> was received with equal enthusiasm in
                    1809; but his third, <hi rend="italic">Olympia,</hi> was much less warmly
                    welcomed in 1819.</p>
                <p>Spontini had been appointed in 1810 director of the Italian opera; but his
                    quarrelsome and grasping disposition led to his summary dismissal in 1812, and,
                    though reinstated in 1814, he voluntarily resigned his post soon afterwards. He
                    was in fact very ill fitted to act as director; yet on 28th May 1820, five
                    months after the failure of <hi rend="italic">Olympia,</hi> he settled in Berlin
                    by invitation of Frederick William III., commissioned to superintend all<pb

                    two new grand operas, or three smaller ones, every three years. But he began by
                    at once embroiling himself with the intendant, Count Brühl. Spontini’s life at
                    Berlin may be best described as a ceaseless struggle for precedence, under
                    circumstances which rendered its attainment impossible in the sense in which he
                    desired it. Yet he did good work, and did it well. <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Vestalin, Ferdinand Cortez,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Olympia—</hi> the last
                    two entirely remodelled—were produced with great success in 1821. A new opera,
                    <hi rend="italic">Nourmahal,</hi> founded on Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Lalla
                    Rookh,</hi> was performed in 1822, and another, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcidor,</hi> in 1825; and in 1826 Spontini began the composition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Agnes von Hohenstaufen,</hi> a work planned on a grander scale
                    than any of his former efforts. The first act was performed in 1827, and the
                    complete work in three acts graced the marriage of Prince William in 1829.
                    Though the German critics abused it bitterly, <hi rend="italic">Agnes van
                    Hohenstaufen</hi> is undoubtedly Spontini’s greatest work. In breadth of
                    conception and grandeur of style it exceeds both <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Vestalin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ferdinand Cortez,</hi> and its details are
                    worked out with untiring conscientiousness; yet Spontini was utterly
                    dissatisfied with it, and at once set to work upon an entire revision, which on
                    its representation in 1837 was in many parts scarcely recognizable by those who
                    had heard the opera in its original form.</p>
                <p>This was his last great work. He several times began to rewrite his early opera,
                    <hi rend="italic">Milton,</hi> and contemplated the treatment of many new
                    subjects, such as <hi rend="italic">Sappho, La Colère d'Achille,</hi> and other
                    classical myths, but with no definite result. He had never been popular in
                    Berlin; and he has been accused of endeavouring to prevent the performance of
                    <hi rend="italic">Euryanthe, Oberon, Die Hochzeit des Camacho, Jessonda, Robert
                    the Devil,</hi> and other works of genius, through sheer envy of the laurels won
                    by their composers. But the critics and reviewers of the period were so closely
                    leagued together against him that it is difficult to know what to believe. After
                    the death of Frederick William III. in 1840, Spontini’s conduct became so
                    violent and imperious that in 1842 Frederick William IV. dismissed him, with
                    power to retain his titles and live wherever he pleased in the enjoyment of his
                    full salary. He elected to settle once more in Paris, after a short visit to
                    Italy; but beyond conducting occasional performances of some of his own works he
                    made but few attempts to keep his name before the public. In 1847 he revisited
                    Berlin and was invited by the king to conduct some performances during the
                    winter. In 1848 he became deaf. In 1850 he retired to his birthplace, Majolati,
                    and died there on 14th January 1851, bequeathing all he possessed to the poor of
                    his native town.</p>
