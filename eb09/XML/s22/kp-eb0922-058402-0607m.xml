                    educated at St John’s College, Cambridge, and in 1611 was knighted, and married
                    Margaret, daughter of Francis, earl of Cumberland. In 1614 he represented
                    Yorkshire in the Addled Parliament, but, as far as is now known, it was not till
                    the parliament of 1621 that he took part in the debates. His position towards
                    the popular party was peculiar. He did not sympathize with their eagerness for
                    war with Spain, and he was eager, as no man of that time except Bacon was eager,
                    for increased activity in domestic legislation. He was what, in modern times,
                    would be called a reformer, and in those days a reformer was necessarily an
                    upholder of the authority of the crown, in whose service the most experienced
                    statesmen might be expected to be found, whilst the members of a House of
                    Commons only sum moned at considerable intervals would be deficient in the
                    qualities necessary for undertaking successful legislation. On the other hand,
                    James’s conduct of the diplomatic struggle with Spain was not such as to inspire
                    confidence, and Wentworth’s bearing was therefore marked by a certain amount of
                    hesitation. He was, however, more than most men prone to magnify his office, and
                    James’s contemptuous refusal to allow the House of Commons to give an opinion on
                    foreign politics seems to have stung him to join in the vindication of the
                    claims of the House of which he was a member. He was at all events a warm
                    supporter of the protestation which drew down a sentence of dissolution upon the
                    third parliament of James.</p>
                <p>In 1622 Wentworth’s wife died, and in February 1625 he married Arabella Holles,
                    the daughter of the earl of Clare. Of the parliament of 1624 he had not been a
                    member, but in the first parliament of Charles I. he again represented
                    Yorkshire, and at once marked his hostility to the proposed war with Spain by
                    supporting a motion for an adjournment before the House proceeded to business.
                    His election was declared void, but he was re-elected. When he returned to
                    parliament he took part in the opposition to the demand made under the influence
                    of Buckingham for war subsidies, and was consequently, after the dissolution,
                    made sheriff of Yorkshire, in order to exclude him, as hostile to the court,
                    from the parliament which met in 1626. After the dissolution of that parliament
                    he was dismissed from the justiceship of the peace and the office of <hi
                    rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi> of Yorkshire.</p>
                <p>Wentworth’s position was very different from that of the regular opposition. Ue
                    was anxious to serve the crown, but he disapproved of the king’s policy. “My
                    rule,” he wrote December 1625, “which I will never transgress, is never to
                    contend with the prerogative out of parliament, nor yet to contest with a king
                    but when I am constrained thereunto or else make shipwreck of my peace of
                    conscience.” In January 1626 he had asked for the presidency of the Council of
                    the North, and had visited and made overtures to Buckingham. His subsequent
                    dismissal was probably the result of his resolution not to support the court in
                    its design to force the country to contribute money without a parliamentary
                    grant. At all events, he refused in 1627 to contribute to the forced loan, and
                    was placed in confinement in Kent for his refusal.</p>
                <p>Wentworth’s position in the parliament of 1628 was a striking one. He joined the
                    popular leaders in resistance to arbitrary taxation and imprisonment, but he
                    tried to obtain his end with the least possible infringement of the prerogative
                    of the crown, to which he looked as a reserve force in times of crisis. With the
                    approbation of the House he led the movement for a bill which would have secured
                    the liberties of the subject as completely as the Petition of Right afterwards
                    did, but in a manner less offensive to the king. The proposal was wrecked upon
                    Charles’s refusal to make the necessary concessions, and the leadership was thus
                    snatched from Wentworth’s hands by Eliot and Coke. Later in the session he fell
                    into conflict with Eliot, as, though he supported the Petition of Right in
                    substance, he was anxious to come to a compromise with the Lords, so as to leave
                    room to the king to act unchecked in special emergencies.</p>
                <p>On July 22, 1628, not long after the prorogation, Wentworth was created Lord
                    Wentworth, and received a promise of the presidentship of the Council of the
                    North at the next vacancy. Even on political matters he had never been quite at
                    unison with the parliamentary opposition, and in church matters he was
                    diametrically opposed to them. Since the close of the discussion on the Petition
                    of Right, church matters had come into greater prominence<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n608/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0608-0585"/> than ever, and Wentworth was therefore thrown
                    strongly on the side of Charles, from whom alone opposition to Puritanism could
                    possibly come. This attachment to Charles was doubtless cemented by Buckingham’s
                    murder, but, if he took the king’s part with decision and vigour, it must be
                    remembered that, as has been already said, he •was above all a man prone to
                    magnify his office, and that things would look differently to him than they had
                    done before he was in his new position. For the charge of apostasy in its
                    ordinary meaning there is no foundation.</p>
                <p>As yet Wentworth took no part in the general government of the country. In
                    December he became Viscount Wentworth and president of the Council of the North.
                    In the speech delivered at York on his taking office he •announced his intention
                    of doing his utmost to bind up the prerogative of the crown and the liberties of
                    the subject in indistinguishable union. “Whoever,” he said, “ravels forth into
                    questions the right of a king and of a people shall never be able to wrap them
                    up again into the comeliness and order he found them.”</p>
                <p>The session of 1629 ended in a breach between the king and the parliament which
                    made the task of a moderator hopeless. Wentworth had to choose between helping a
                    Puritan House of Commons to dominate the king and helping the king to dominate a
                    Puritan House of Commons. He instinctively chose the latter course, and he threw
                    himself into the work of repression with characteristic energy, as if the
                    establishment of the royal power was the one thing needful. Yet even when he was
                    most resolute in crushing resistance he held that he and not his antagonists
                    were maintaining the old constitution which they had attempted to alter by
                    claiming supremacy for parliament.</p>
                <p>In November 1629 Wentworth became a privy councillor. In October 1631 he lost his
                    second wife, and in October 1632 he married Elizabeth Rhodes. In January 1632 he
                    had been named lord-deputy of Ireland, having performed his duties at York to
                    the king’s satisfaction, though he had given grave offence to the northern
                    gentry by the enforcement of his authority. It was a cardinal point of his
                    system that no wealth or station should exempt its possessor from obedience to
                    the king. Not only was the announcement of this principle likely to give offence
                    to those who were touched by it, but in its application Wentworth was frequently
                    harsh and overbearing. In general he may have been said to have worked rather
                    for equality under a strong Government than for liberty.</p>
                <p>In Ireland Wentworth would have to deal with a people which had not arrived at
                    national cohesion, and amongst which had been from time to time introduced
                    English colonists, some of them, like the early Norman settlers, sharing in the
                    Catholicism of the natives, whilst the later importations stood aloof and
                    preserved their Protestantism. There was also a class of officials of English
                    derivation, many of whom failed to reach a high standard of efficiency. Against
                    these Wentworth, who arrived in Dublin in July 1633, waged war sometimes with
                    scanty regard to the forms of justice, as in the case of Lord Mountnorris, whom
                    he sent before a court-martial on a merely formal charge, which necessarily
                    entailed a death sentence, not because he wanted to execute him, but because he
                    knew of no other way of excluding him from official life.</p>
                <p>The purifying of official life, however, was but a small part of Wentworth’s
                    task. In one way, indeed, he conceived his duty in the best spirit. He tried at
                    the same time to strengthen the crown and to benefit the poor by making the mass
                    of the nation less dependent on their chiefs and lords than they had been
                    before, and, though Wentworth could not do away with the effects of previous
                    mistakes, he might do much to soften down the existing antagonism between the
                    native population and the English Government. Unhappily his intentions were
                    frustrated by causes resulting partly from his own character and partly from the
                    circumstances in which he was placed.</p>
                <p>In the first place, Wentworth’s want of money to carry on the Government was
                    deplorable. In 1634 he called a parliament at Dublin, and obtained from it a
                    considerable grant, as well as its co-operation in a remarkable series of
                    legislative enactments. The king, however, had previously engaged his word to
                    make certain concessions known as the “graces,” and Wentworth resolved that some
                    of these should not be granted, and took upon himself to refuse what his master
                    had promised. The money granted by parliament, however, would not last for ever,
                    and Wentworth resolved to create a balance between revenue and expenditure
                    before the supply was exhausted. This he succeeded in doing, partly by making a
                    vast improvement in the material condition of the country, and partly by the
                    introduction of monopolies and other irregular payments, which created wide
                    dissatisfaction, especially amongst the wealthier class.</p>
                <p>Towards the native Irish Wentworth’s bearing was benevolent but thoroughly
                    unsympathetic. Having no notion of developing their qualities by a process of
                    natural growth, his only hope for them lay in converting them into Englishmen as
                    soon as possible. They must be made English in their habits, in their laws, and
                    in their religion. “I see plainly,” he once wrote, “that, so long as this
                    kingdom continues Popish, they arc not a people for the crown of England to be
                    confident of.” It is true that he had too much ability to adopt a system of
                    irritating persecution, but from time to time some word or act escaped from him
                    which allowed all who were concerned to know what his real opinion was. For the
                    present, however, he had to content himself with forging the instrument by which
                    the hoped-for conversion was to be effected. The Established Church of Ireland
                    was in a miserable plight, and Wentworth busied himself with rescuing from the
                    hands of such men as the earl of Cork the property of the church, which had in
                    troublous times been diverted from its true purpose, and with enforcing the
                    strict observance of the practices of the English Church, on the one hand upon
                    recalcitrant Puritans, and on the other hand upon lawless disregarders of all
                    decency. In this way he hoped to obtain a church to which the Irish might be
                    expected to rally.</p>
                <p>Till that time came, he must rely on force to keep order and to prevent any
                    understanding growing up between the Irish and foreign powers. With this object
                    in view he resolved on pouring English colonists into Connaught as James had
                    poured them into Ulster. To do this he had taken upon himself to set at naught
                    Charles’s promise that no colonists should be forced into Connaught, and in 1635
                    he proceeded to that province, where, raking up an obsolete title, he insisted
                    upon the grand juries in all the counties finding verdicts for the king. One
                    only, that of Galway, resisted, and the confiscation of Galway was effected by
                    the Court of Exchequer, whilst he fined the sheriff £1000 for summoning such a
                    jury, and cited the jurymen to the castle chamber to answer for their offence.
                    He had succeeded in setting all Ireland against him.</p>
                <p>High-handed as Wentworth was by nature, his rule in Ireland made him more
                    high-handed than <hi rend="italic">ever. As yet</hi> he had never been consulted
                    on English affairs, and it was only in February 1637 that Charles asked his
                    opinion on a proposed interference in the affairs of the Continent. In reply, he
                    assured Charles that it would be unwise to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n609/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0609-0586"/> undertake even naval operations till he had
                    secured absolute power at home. The opinion of the judges had given the king the
                    right to levy ship-money, but, unless his Majesty had “the like power declared
                    to raise a land army, the crown” seemed “to stand upon one leg at home, to be
                    considerable but by halves to foreign princes abroad.” The power so gained
                    indeed must be shown to be beneficent by the maintenance of good government, but
                    it ought to exist. A beneficent despotism supported by popular gratitude was now
                    Wentworth’s ideal.</p>
                <p>In his own case Wentworth had cause to discover that Charles’s absolutism was
                    marred by human imperfections. Charles gave ear to courtiers far too often, and
                    frequently wanted to do them a good turn by promoting incompetent persons to
                    Irish offices. To a request from Wentworth to strengthen the position of the
                    deputy by raising him to an earldom he turned a deaf ear. Yet to make Charles
                    more absolute continued to be the dominant note of his policy, and, when the
                    Scottish Puritans rebelled, he advocated the most decided measures of
                    repression, and in February 1639 he offered the king £2000 as his contribution
                    to the expenses of the coming war. He was, however, too clear-sighted to do
                    otherwise than deprecate an invasion of Scotland before the English army was
                    trained.</p>
                <p>In September 1639, after Charles’s failure in the first Bishops’ War, Wentworth
                    arrived in England to conduct in the star-chamber a case in which the Irish
                    chancellor was being prosecuted for resisting the deputy. From that moment he
                    stepped into the place of Charles’s principal adviser. Ignorant of the extent to
                    which opposition had developed in England during his absence, he recommended the
                    calling of a parliament to support a renewal of the war, hoping that by the
                    offer of a loan from the privy councillors, to which he himself contributed
                    «£20,000, he would place Charles above the necessity of submitting to the new
                    parliament if it should prove restive. In January 1640 he was created earl of
                    Strafford, and in March he went to Ireland to hold a parliament, where the
                    Catholic vote secured a grant of subsidies to be used against the Presbyterian
                    Scots, An Irish army was to be levied to assist in the coming war. When in April
                    Strafford returned to England he found the Commons holding back from a grant of
                    supply, and tried to enlist the peers on the side of resistance. On the other
                    hand, he attempted to induce Charles to be content with a smaller grant than he
                    had originally asked for. The Commons, however, insisted on peace with the
                    Scots, and on May 9, at the privy council, Strafford, though reluctantly, voted
                    for a dissolution.</p>
                <p>After this Strafford supported the harshest measures. He urged the king to invade
                    Scotland, and, in meeting the objection that England might resist, he uttered
                    the words which cost him dear, “You have an army in Ireland,”—the army which, in
                    the regular course of affairs, was to have been employed to operate in the west
                    of Scotland,—“you may employ here to reduce this kingdom.” He tried to force the
                    citizens of London to lend money. He supported a project for debasing the
                    coinage and for seizing bullion in the Tower, the property of foreign merchants.
                    He also advocated the purchasing a loan from Spain by the offer of a future
                    alliance. He was ultimately appointed to command the English army, but he was
                    seized with illness, and the rout of Newburn made the position hopeless. In the
                    great council at York he showed his hope that if Charles maintained the
                    defensive the country would still rally round him, whilst he proposed, in order
                    to secure Ireland, that the Scots of Ulster should be ruthlessly driven from
                    their homes.</p>
                <p>When the Long Parliament met it was preparing to impeach Strafford, when tidings
                    reached its leaders that Strafford, now lord-lieutenant of Ireland, had come
                    to</p>
                <p>London and had advised the king to take the initiative by accusing his chief
                    opponents of treason. On this the impeachment was hurried on, and the Lords
                    committed Strafford to the Tower. At his trial in Westminster Hall he stood on
                    the ground that each charge against him, even if true, did not amount to
                    treason, whilst Pym urged that, taken as a whole, they showed an intention to
                    change the Government, which in itself was treason. Undoubtedly the project of
                    bringing over the Irish army, probably never seriously entertained, did the
                    prisoner most damage, and when the Lords showed reluctance to condemn him the
                    Commons dropped the impeachment and brought in a bill of attainder. The Lords
                    would probably have refused to pass it if they could have relied on Charles’s
                    assurance to relegate Strafford to private life if the bill were rejected.
                    Charles unwisely took part in projects for effecting Strafford’s, escape and
                    even for raising a military force to accomplish that end. The Lords took alarm
                    and passed the bill. On May 9, 1641, the king, frightened by popular tumults,
                    reluctantly signed a commission for the purpose of giving to it the royal
                    assent, and on the 12th Strafford was executed on Tower Hill. (S. R. G.)</p>
