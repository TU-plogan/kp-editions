                    the scion of a noble family of Provence, who came to Paris in 1502, and soon
                    afterwards set up a printing establishment at the top of the Rue St Jean de
                    Beauvais, on the hill of Sainte-Geneviève opposite the law school. He died in
                    1520, and, his three sons being minors, the business was carried on by his
                    foreman Simon de Colines, who in 1521 married his widow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">. Robert Estienne</hi> (1503-1559) was Henri’s second son.
                    After his father’s death he acted as assistant to his stepfather, and in this
                    capacity superintended the printing of a Latin edition of the New Testament in
                    16mo (1523). Some slight alterations which he had introduced into the text
                    brought upon him the censures of the faculty of theology. It was the first of a
                    long series of disputes between him and that body. It appears that he had
                    intimate relations with the new Evangelical preachers almost from the beginning
                    of the movement, and that soon after this time he definitely joined the Reformed
                    Church. In 1526 he entered into possession of his father’s printing
                    establishment, and adopted as his device the celebrated olive-tree (a
                    reminiscence doubtless of his grandmother’s family of Montolivet), with the
                    motto from the epistle to the Romans (xi. 20), <hi rend="italic">Noli altum
                    sapere,</hi> sometimes with the addition <hi rend="italic">sed time.</hi> In
                    1528 he married Perrette, a daughter of the scholar and printer Josse Bade
                    (Jodocus Badius), and in the same year he published his first Latin Bible, an
                    edition in folio, upon which he had been at work for the last four years. In
                    1532 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Linguae Latinae,</hi> a dictionary
                    of Latin words and phrases, upon which for two years he had toiled incessantly,
                    with no other assistance than that of Thierry of Beauvais. A second edition,
                    greatly enlarged and improved, appeared in 1536, and a third, still further
                    improved, in 3 vols, folio, in 1543. Though the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi>
                    is now superseded, its merits must not be forgotten. It was vastly superior to
                    anything of the kind that had appeared before; it formed the basis of future
                    labours, and even as late as 1734 was considered worthy of being re-edited. In
                    1539 Robert was appointed king’s printer for Hebrew and Latin, an office to
                    which, after the death of Conrad Neobar in 1540, he united that of king’s
                    printer for Greek. In 1541 he was entrusted by Francis I. with the task of
                    procuring from Claude Garamond, the engraver and type-founder, three sets of
                    Greek type for the royal press. The middle size were the first ready, and with
                    these Robert printed the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclesiasticae Historiae</hi> of Eusebius and others (1544). The
                    smallest size were first used for the 16mo edition of the New Testament known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">O mirificam</hi> (1546), while with the largest size was
                    printed the magnificent folio of 1550. This edition involved the printer in
                    fresh disputes with the faculty of theology, and towards the end of the
                    following year he left his native town for ever, and took refuge at Geneva,
                    where he published in 1552 a caustic and effective answer to his persecutors,
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Ad Censuras Theologorum Parisiensium, quibus
                    Biblia a R. Stephano, Typographo Regio, excusa calumniose notarunt, eiusdem R.
                    S. Responsio.</hi> A French translation, which is remarkable for the excellence
                    of its style, was published by him in the same year (printed in Rénouard’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales de l'Imprimerie des Estienne).</hi> At Geneva Robert
                    proved himself an ardent partisan of Calvin, several of whose works he
                    published. He died there September 7, 1559.</p>
                <p>It is by his work in connexion with the Bible, and especially as an editor of the
                    New Testament, that he is on the whole best known. The text of his New Testament
                    of 1550, either in its original form or in such slightly modified form as it
                    assumed in the Elzevir text of 1634, remains to this day the traditional text.
                    But, as modern<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n558/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0558-0535"/> scholars have pointed out, this is due rather to
                    its typographical beauty than to any critical merit. The readings of the fifteen
                    MSS. which Robert’s son Henri had collated for the purpose were merely
                    introduced into the margin. The text was still almost exactly that of Erasmus.
                    It was, however, the first edition ever published with a critical apparatus of
                    any sort. Of the whole Bible Robert printed eleven editions,—eight in Latin, two
                    in Hebrew, and one in French; while of the New Testament alone he printed
                    twelve, —five in Greek, five in Latin, and two in French. In the Greek New
                    Testament of 1551 (printed at Geneva) the present division into verses was
                    introduced for the first time. The <hi rend="italic">editiones principes</hi>
                    which issued from Robert’s press were eight in number, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eusebius,</hi> including the <hi rend="italic">Praeparatio Evangelien</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Demonstratio Evangelica</hi> as well as tho <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica</hi> already mentioned (1544-46), <hi
                    rend="italic">Moschopulus</hi> (1545), <hi rend="italic">Dionysius of
                    Halicarnassus</hi> (February 1547), <hi rend="italic">Alexander Trallianus</hi>
                    (January 1548), <hi rend="italic">Dio Cassius</hi> (January 1548), <hi
                    rend="italic">Justin Martyr</hi> (1551), <hi rend="italic">Xiphilinus</hi>
                    (1551), <hi rend="italic">Appian</hi> (1551), the last being completed, after
                    Robert’s departure from Paris, by his brother Charles, and appearing under his
                    name. These editions, all in folio, except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moschopulus,</hi> which is in 4to, are unrivalled for beauty. Robert also
                    printed numerous editions of Latin classics, of which perhaps the folio <hi
                    rend="italic">Virgil</hi> of 1532 is the most noteworthy, and a large quantity
                    of Latin grammars and other educational works (many of them written by his
                    friend Maturin Cordier) in the interests of that cause of which he proved
                    himself so stout a champion,—the new learning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Estienne</hi> (1504 or 1505-1564), the third son of
                    Henri, was, like his brother Robert, a man of considerable learning. After the
                    usual humanistic training he studied medicine, and became a doctor of that
                    faculty in the university of Paris. In 1540 he accompanied the French ambassador
                    Lazare Baif to Italy in the capacity of tutor to his natural son Antoine, the
                    future poet. In 1551, when Robert Estienne left Paris for Geneva, Charles, who
                    had remained a Catholic, took charge of his printing establishment, and in the
                    same year was appointed king’s printer. He died in 1564, according to some
                    accounts in prison, having been thrown there for debt.</p>
                <p>His principal works are <hi rend="italic">Praedium Rusticum,</hi> a collection of
                    tracts which he had compiled from ancient writers on various branches of
                    agriculture, and which continued to be a favourite book down to the end of the
                    17th century; <hi rend="italic">Dictionarium Historicum ac Poeticum</hi> (1553),
                    the first French encyclopaedia; <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Ciceronianus·,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Paradoxes,</hi> a free version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradossi</hi> of Ortensio Laudi, with the omission of a few of the paradoxes
                    and of the impious and indecent passages (Paris, 1553; Poitiers, 1553). He was
                    also the author of a treatise on anatomy and of several small educational
                    works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Henri Estienne</hi> (1528-1598), sometimes called “Henri
                    II.,” was the eldest son of Robert. In the preface to his edition of Aulus
                    Gellius (1585), addressed to his son Paul, he gives an interesting account of
                    his father’s household, in which, owing to the various nationalities of those
                    who were employed on the press, Latin was used as a common language, being
                    understood and spoken more or less by every member of it, down to the
                    maid-servants. Henri thus picked up Latin as a child, but at his special request
                    he was allowed to learn Greek as a serious study before Latin. At the age of
                    fifteen he became a pupil of Pierre Danès, at that time the first Greek scholar
                    in France. Two years later he began to attend the lectures of Jacques Toussain,
                    one of the royal professors of Greek, and in the same year (1545) was employed
                    by his father to collate a MS. of Dionysius of Halicarnassus. In 1547, after
                    attending for a time the lectures of Turnèbe, Toussain’s successor, he went to
                    Italy, where he spent two years in hunting for and collating MSS. and in
                    intercourse with learned men. In 1550 he was in England, where he was favourably
                    received by Edward VI. Thence he went to Flanders, where he learnt Spanish. In
                    1551 he joined his father at Geneva, which henceforth became his home. In 1554
                    he gave to the world, as the firstfruits of his researches, two first editions,
                    viz., a tract of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and <hi rend="italic">Anacreon,</hi>
                    both printed by his uncle Charles. In 1556 Henri was again in Italy, where he
                    discovered at Rome ten new books (xi.-xx.) of Diodorus Siculus. In 1557 he
                    issued from the press which in the previous year he had set up on his own
                    account at Geneva three first editions, viz., <hi rend="italic">Athenagoras,
                    Maximus Tyrius,</hi> and some fragments of Greek historians, including Appian’s
                    'A <hi rend="italic">vvιβαλικη</hi> and 'I <hi rend="italic">βηρική,</hi> and an
                    edition of Aeschylus, in which for the first time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agamemnon</hi> was printed in entirety and as a separate play. In 1558 he was
                    appointed printer to Huldrich Fugger, one of the celebrated family of Augsburg
                    bankers, a post which he held for ten years. In 1559 he printed a Latin
                    translation from his own pen of Sextus Empiricus, and an edition of Diodorus
                    Siculus with the new books. In 1566 he published his best known French work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Apologie pour Herodote,</hi> or, as he himself called it, <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Introduction au Traite de la Conformité des Merveilles Anciennes
                    avec les Modernes ou Traite preparatif a l'Apologie pour Hérodote.</hi> Some
                    passages in the original edition being considered objectionable by the Geneva
                    consistory, he was compelled to cancel the pages containing them. The book
                    became highly popular. Within sixteen years twelve editions were printed. In
                    1572 Henri published the great work upon which he had been labouring for many
                    years, the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Graecae Linguae,</hi> in 5 vols. folio.
                    The publication in 1578 of his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues du nouveau François
                    Italianize</hi> brought him into a fresh dispute with the consistory. To avoid
                    their censure he went to Paris, and resided at the French court for the whole of
                    1579. On his return to Geneva in the spring of 1580 he was summoned before the
                    consistory, and, proving contumacious, was imprisoned for a week. From this time
                    his life became more and more of a nomad one. He is to be found at Basel,
                    Heidelberg, Vienna, Pesth, everywhere but at Geneva, these journeys being
                    undertaken partly in the hope of procuring patrons and purchasers for his books
                    (for the large sums which he had spent on such publications as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> of 1578 had
                    almost ruined him), partly from the increasing restlessness of his disposition.
                    But the result of these long absences was that his press stood nearly at a
                    standstill. A few editions of classical authors were brought out, but each
                    successive one showed a falling off. Such value as the later ones had was
                    chiefly due to the notes furnished by Casaubon, who in 1586 had married Henri’s
                    daughter Florence. Henri’s last years were marked by ever-increasing infirmity
                    of mind and temper. In 1597 he left Geneva for the last time. After visiting
                    Montpellier, where Casaubon was now professor, he made for Paris, but was seized
                    with sudden illness at Lyons, and died there in his seventieth year, at the end
                    of January 1598.</p>
                <p>Few men have ever served the cause of learning more devotedly. For over thirty
                    years the amount which he produced, whether as printer, editor, or original
                    writer, was enormous. The productions of his press, though printed with the same
                    beautiful type as his father’s books, are, owing to the poorness of the paper
                    and ink, inferior to them in general beauty. The best, perhaps, from a
                    typographical point of view, are the <hi rend="italic">Poetae Graeci
                    Principes</hi> (folio, 1566), the <hi rend="italic">Plutarch</hi> (13 vols. 8vo,
                    1572), and the <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> (3 vols, folio, 1573). It was rather
                    Henri Estienne’s scholarship which gave value to his editions. He was not only
                    his own press-corrector but his own editor. Though by the latter half of the
                    16th century nearly all the important Greek and Latin authors that we now
                    possess had been published, his untiring activity still found some gleanings.
                    Eighteen first editions of Greek authors and one of a Latin author are due to
                    his press. The most important have been already mentioned. Henri s reputation as
                    a scholar and editor has increased of late years. His familiarity with the Greek
                    language has always been admitted to have been quite exceptional; but he has
                    been accused of want of taste and judgment, of carelessness and rashness.
                    Special censure has been passed on his <hi rend="italic">Plutarch,</hi> in which
                    he is said to have introduced conjectures of his own into the text, while
                    pretending to have derived them from MS. authority. But a recent editor,
                    Sintenis, has shown that, though like all the other editors of his day he did
                    not give references to his authorities, every one of his supposed conjectures
                    can be traced to some MS. Whatever may be said as to his taste or his judgment,
                    it seems that he was both careful and scrupulous, and that he only resorted to
                    conjecture when authority failed him. And, whatever the merit of his
                    conjectures,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0559-0536"/> he was at any rate the first to show what
                    conjecture could do towards restoring a hopelessly corrupt passage. The work,
                    however, on which his fame as a scholar is most surely based is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus Graecae Linguae.</hi> After making due allowance for the
                    fact that considerable materials for the work had been already collected by his
                    father, and that he received considerable assistance from the German scholar
                    Sylburg, he is still entitled to the very highest praise as the producer of a
                    work which was of the greatest service to scholarship and which in those early
                    days of Greek learning could have been produced by no one but a giant. Two
                    editions of the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi> have been published in this
                    century—at London by Valpy (1815-25) and at Paris by Didot (1831-63). It was one
                    of Henri Estienne’s great merits that, unlike nearly all the French scholars who
                    preceded him, he did not neglect his own language. While Budé wrote French with
                    difficulty and considered it hardly a fit language for a scholar to use, Henri
                    Estienne was loud in its praises and gave practical proof of its capabilities.
                    Of his French writings three were devoted to this theme :—(1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conformité du Langage François avec le Grec</hi> (published in 1575, but
                    without date; ed. L. Feugère, 1850), in which French is shown to have, among
                    modern languages, the most affinity with Greek, the first of all languages; (2)
                    <hi rend="italic">Deux Dialogues du nouveau François Italianizé</hi> (Geneva,
                    1578; reprinted, 2 vols., 1883), directed against the fashion prevailing in the
                    court of Catherine de’ Medici of using Italian words and forms; (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Project du Livre Intitulé de la Precellence du Langage
                    François</hi> (Paris, 1579; ed. Feugère, 1853), which treats of the superiority
                    of French to Italian. An interesting feature of this tract is the account of
                    French proverbs, aud, Henry III. having expressed some doubts as to the
                    genuineness of some of them, Henri Estienne published, in 1594, (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Premices ou le I. livre des Proverbes Epigrammatizez</hi>
                    (never reprinted and very rare). Finally, there remains (5) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apologie pour Hérodote,</hi> the work by virtue of which Henri
                    Estienne belongs to literature. The ostensible object of the book is to show
                    that the strange stories in Herodotus may be paralleled by equally strange ones
                    of modern times. Virtually it is a bitter satire on the writer’s age, especially
                    on the Roman Church. Put together without any method, its extreme desultoriness
                    makes it difficult to read continuously, but the numerous stories, collected
                    partly from various literary sources, notably from the preachers Menot and
                    Maillard, partly from the writer’s own multifarious experience, with which it is
                    packed, make it an interesting commentary on the manners and fashions of the
                    time. But satire, to be effective, should be either humorous or righteously
                    indignant, and, while such humour as there is in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologie</hi> is decidedly heavy, the writer’s indignation is generally
                    forgotten in his evident relish for scandal. The style is, after all, its chief
                    merit. Though it bears evident traces of hurry, it is, like that of all Henri
                    Estienne’s French writings, clear, easy, and vigorous, uniting the directness
                    and sensuousness of the older writers with a suppleness and logical precision
                    which at this time were almost new elements in French prose. An edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi> has recently been published by Liseux (ed.
                    Ristelhuber, 2 vols., 1879), after one of the only two copies of the original
                    uncancelled edition that are known to exist. The very remarkable political
                    pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Discours Merveilleux de la Vie et des
                    Déportements de Catherine de Médicis,</hi> which appeared in 1574, has been
                    ascribed to Henri Estienne, but the evidence both internal and external is
                    conclusive against his being the author of it. Of his Latin writings the most
                    worthy of notice are the <hi rend="italic">De Latinitate falso suspecta</hi>
                    (1576), the <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Cicero</hi> (1577), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nizoliodidascalus</hi> (1578), all three written against the
                    Ciceronians, and the <hi rend="italic">Francofordiense Emporium</hi> (1574), a
                    panegyric on the Frankfort fair (reprinted with a French translation by Liseux,
                    1875). He also wrote a large quantity of indifferent Latin verses, including a
                    long poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Musa Monitrix Principum</hi> (Basel,
                    1590).</p>
                <p>The primary authorities for an account of the Estiennes are their own works. In
                    the garrulous and egotistical prefaces which Henri was in the habit of prefixing
                    to his editions will be found many scatιered biographical details. Twentyseven
                    letters from Henri to John of Crafftheim (Crato) (ed. F. Passow, 1830) have been
                    printed, and there is one of Robert’s in Herminjard’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Correspondance des Reformateurs dans les Pays de Langue Française</hi> (7 vols.
                    published), while a few other contemporary references to him will be found in
                    the same work. The secondary authorities are Janssen van Almeloveen, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Vitis Stephanorum</hi> (Amst., 1683); Maittaire, <hi
                    rend="italic">Stephanorum Historia</hi> (Lond., 1709); A. A. Rénouard, <hi
                    rend="italic">Annates de l'Imprimerie des Estienne</hi> (2d ed., Paris, 1813);
                    the article on Estienne by A. F. Didot in the <hi rend="italic">Nouv. Biog.
                    Gén.;</hi> and an article by Mark Pattison in the <hi rend="italic">Quart. Rev.
                    for</hi> April 1865. There is a good account of Henri's <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thesaurus</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Quart. Rev. for</hi> January 1820,
                    written by Bishop Blomfield. (A. A. T.)</p>
