                    the Fourth Gospel describes a second appearance to His disciples as having
                    occurred eight days afterwards (John XX. 26). Apart from this central fact of
                    the Christian faith, the Pentecostal outpouring of the Spirit, seven weeks
                    later, described in Acts ii., cannot have failed to give an additional
                    sacredness to the day in the eyes of the earliest converts.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From an expression in the Epistle of Barnabas
                    (c. 15), it would almost seem as if the ascension also was believed by some to
                    have taken place on a Sunday.</p></note> Whether the primitive church in
                    Jerusalem had any special mode of observing it in its daily meetings held in the
                    temple (Acts ii. 46) we cannot tell; but as there is no doubt that in these
                    gatherings the recurrence of the Sabbath was marked by appropriate Jewish
                    observances, so it is not improbable that the worship on the first day of the
                    week had also some distinguishing feature. Afterwards, at all events, when
                    Christianity had been carried to other places where from the nature of the case
                    daily meetings for worship were impossible, the first day of the week was
                    everywhere set apart for this purpose. Thus Acts XX. 7 shows that the disciples
                    in Troas met weekly on the first day of the week for exhortation and the
                    breaking of bread; 1 Cor. xvi. 2 implies at least some observance of the day;
                    and the solemn commemorative character it had very early acquired is strikingly
                    indicated by an incidental expression of the writer of the Apocalypse (i. 10),
                    who for the first time gives it that name (“the Lord’s day ”) by which it is
                    almost invariably referred to by all writers of the century immediately

                    all the days.” The writer finds a reference to the Lord’s day in the titles to
                    Pss. vi. and xii., which are “set to the eighth.”</p></note> Eusebius <hi
                    rend="italic">(H.E.,</hi> iv. 23) has preserved a letter of Dionysius of Corinth
                    (175 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> to Soter, bishop of Rome, in which he says:
                    “To-day we have passed the Lord’s holy day, in which we have read your epistle”;
                    and the same historian <hi rend="italic">(H.E.,</hi> iv. 26) mentions that
                    Melito of Sardis (170 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> had written a treatise on
                    the Lord’s day. Pliny’s letter to Trajan in which he speaks of the meetings of
                    the Christians “on a stated day” need only be alluded to. The first writer who
                    mentions the name of Sunday as applicable to the Lord’s day is Justin Martyr;
                    this designation of the first day of the week, which is of heathen origin (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabbath,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 126), had come into general use
                    in the Roman world shortly before Justin wrote. The passage is too well known to
                    need quotation <hi rend="italic">(Apol.</hi> i., 67) in which he describes how
                    “on the day called Sunday” town and country Christians alike gathered together
                    in one place for instruction and prayer and charitable offerings and the
                    distribution of bread and wine; they thus meet together on that day, he says,
                    because it is the first day in which God made the world, and because Jesus
                    Christ on the same day rose from the dead.</p>
                <p>As long as the Jewish Christian element continued to have any prominence or
                    influence in the church, a tendency more or less strong to observe Sabbath as
                    well as Sunday would of course persist. Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H.E.,</hi>
                    iii. 27) mentions that the Ebionites continued to keep both days, and there is
                    abundant evidence from Tertullian onwards that so far as public worship and
                    abstention from fasting are concerned the practice was widely spread among the
                    Gentile churches. Thus we learn from Socrates <hi rend="italic">(H.E.,</hi> vi.
                    c. 8) that in his time public worship was held in the churches of Constantinople
                    on both days; the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Canons</hi> (can. 66 [65]) sternly
                    prohibit fasting on Sunday or Saturday (except Holy Saturday); and the
                    injunction of the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> (</hi> v. 20; cp. ii. 59, vii. 23) is to “hold your solemn
                    assemblies and rejoice every Sabbath day (excepting one), and every Lord’s day.”
                    In the primitive church the social conditions were such as hardly to admit of
                    the question being raised, in Gentile circles at any rate, as to the manner in
                    which either the Lord’s day or the Sabbath ought further to be kept after the
                    duty of congregational worship (usually early in the morning or late in the
                    evening) had been discharged; but the whole matter was placed on an entirely new
                    footing when the civil power, by the constitution of Constantine mentioned
                    below, began to legislate as to the Sunday rest. The fourth commandment, holding
                    as it does a conspicuous place in the decalogue, the precepts of which could not
                    for the most part be regarded as of merely transitory obligation, had never of
                    course escaped the attention of the fathers of the church; but, remembering the
                    liberty given in the Pauline writings</p>
                <p>“in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath” (Col. ii. 16; cf. Rom.
                    xiv. 5, Gal. iv. 10, 11), they usually explained the “Sabbath day” of the
                    commandment as meaning the new era that had been introduced by the advent of
                    Christ, and interpreted the rest enjoined as meaning cessation from sin.<note

                    >Ad Μagn., ut supra,</hi> and Ep. of Barnabas (c. 15): “Your present Sabbaths
                    are not acceptable unto me, but that is which I have made when, giving rest to
                    all things, I shall make a beginning of the eighth day.” So practically
                    Tertullian <hi rend="italic">(Resp. ad Jud.,</hi> c. 4) and Clement of
                    Alexandria. According to Augustine also <hi rend="italic">(De Sp. et Lit.,</hi>
                    14), the observance of the Sabbath is to be taken in a spiritual
                    sense.</p></note> But, when a series of imperial decrees had enjoined with
                    increasing stringency an abstinence from labour on Sunday, it was inevitable
                    that the Christian conscience should be roused on the subject of the Sabbath
                    rest also, and in many minds the tendency would be such as finds expression in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi> (viii. 33): “Let the slaves
                    work five days; but on the Sabbath day and the Lord’s day let them have leisure
                    to go to church for instruction in piety.” There is evidence of the same
                    tendency in the opposite canon (29) of the council of Laodicea (363), which
                    forbids Christians from Judaizing and resting on the Sabbath day, and actually
                    enjoins them to work on that day, preferring the Lord’s day and so far as
                    possible resting as Christians. About this time accordingly we find traces of a
                    disposition in Christian thinkers to try to distinguish between a temporary and
                    a permanent element in the Sabbath day precept; thus Chrysostom (10th homily on
                    Genesis) discerns the fundamental principle of that precept to be that we should
                    dedicate one whole day in the circle of the week and set it apart for exercise
                    in spiritual things. The view that the Christian Lord’s day or Sunday is but the
                    Christian Sabbath deliberately transferred from the seventh to the first day of
                    the week does not indeed find categorical expression till a much later period,
                    Alcuin being apparently the first to allege of the Jewish Sabbath that “ejus
                    observationem mos Christianus ad diem dominicam competentius transtulit”
                    (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Decalogue,</hi> vol. vii. p. 17). But the
                    subjoined sketch will incidentally show how soon and to how large an extent this
                    idea has influenced the course of civil legislation on the subject.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Law relating to Sunday.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest recognition of the observance of Sunday as a legal duty is a
                    constitution of Constantine in 321 A.D., enacting that all courts of justice,
                    inhabitants of towns, and workshops were to be at rest on Sunday <hi
                    rend="italic">(venerabili die Solis'),</hi> with an exception in favour of those
                    engaged in agricultural labour. This was the first of a long series of imperial
                    constitutions, most of which are incorporated in the Code of Justinian, bk. iii.
                    tit. 12 <hi rend="italic">(De Feriis).</hi> The constitutions comprised in this
                    title of the code begin with that of Constantine, and further provide that
                    emancipation and manumission were the only legal proceedings permissible on the
                    Lord’s day <hi rend="italic">(die dominico),</hi> though contracts and
                    compromises might be made between the parties where no intervention of the court
                    was necessary. Pleasure was forbidden as well as business. No spectacle was to
                    be exhibited in a theatre or circus. If the emperor’s birthday fell on a Sunday,
                    its celebration was to be postponed. The seven days before and after Easter were
                    to be kept as Sundays. In Cod. i. 4, 9, appears the humane regulation that
                    prisoners were to be brought up for examination and interrogation on Sunday. On
                    the other hand, Cod. iii. 12, 10, distinctly directs the torture of robbers and
                    pirates, even on Easter Sunday, the divine pardon (says the law) being hoped for
                    where the safety of society was thus assured. After the time of Justinian the
                    observance of Sunday appears to have become stricter. In the West Charlemagne
                    forbade labour of any kind. A century later in the Eastern empire No. liv. of
                    the Leonine constitutions abolished the exemption of agricultural labour
                    contained in the constitution of Constantine. It is worthy of notice that this
                    exemption was specially preserved in England by a constitution of Archbishop
                    Meopham. The canon law followed the lines of Roman law. The decrees of
                    ecclesiastical councils on the subject have been very numerous. Much of the law
                    is contained in the Decretals of Gregory, bk. ii. tit. 9 <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Feriis),</hi> c. 1 of which (translated) runs thus: “We decree that all Sundays
                    be observed from vespers to vespers <hi rend="italic">(a vespera ad
                    vesperam),</hi> and that all unlaw-<pb break="no"

                    trading or legal proceedings be not carried on, or any one condemned to death or
                    punishment, or any oaths be administered, except for peace or other necessary
                    reason.” Works of necessity (especially in the case of perishable materials or
                    where time was important, as in fishing) were allowed, on condition that a due
                    proportion of the gain made by work so done was given to the church and the
                    poor. The consent of parties was insufficient to give jurisdiction to a court of
                    law to proceed on Sunday, though it was sufficient in the case of a day
                    sanctified by the ecclesiastical authority for a temporary purpose, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a thanksgiving for vintage or harvest.</p>
                <p>In England legislation on the subject began early and continues down to the most
                    modern times. As early as the 7th century the laws of Ina, king of the West
                    Saxons, provided that, if a “theowman” worked on Sunday by his lord’s command,
                    he was to be free and the lord to be fined 30s.; if a freeman worked without his
                    lord’s command, the penalty was forfeiture of freedom or a fine of 60s., and
                    twice as much in the case of a priest. The laws of Aethelstan forbade marketing,
                    of Aethelred folkmoots and hunting, on the Sunday. In almost all the
                    pre-Conquest compilations there are admonitions to keep the day holy. The first
                    allusion to Sunday in statute law proper is the Act of 28 Edw. III. c. 14 (now
                    repealed), forbidding the sale of wool at the staple on Sunday. The mass of
                    legislation from that date downwards may be divided, if not with strict
                    accuracy, at least for purposes of convenience, into five classes,
                    —ecclesiastical, constitutional, judicial, social, and commercial. The following
                    sketch of the legislation can scarcely presume to be exhaustive, but it will
                    probably be found not to omit any statute of importance. It should be noticed
                    that the terms “Sunday” and “Lord’s day" are used in statutes. The term
                    “Sabbath” occurs only in ordinances of the Long Parliament. “Sabbath-breaking”
                    is sometimes used as a popular expression for a violation of the Acts for Sunday
                    observance, but it is objected to by Blackstone as being legally incorrect. Good
                    Friday and Christinas Day are as a rule in the same legal position as Sunday. In
                    English law Sunday is reckoned from midnight to midnight, not as in canon law
                    <hi rend="italic">a vespera ad vesperam.</hi> The Acts mentioned below are still
                    law unless repeal of any of them is specially mentioned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical.—</hi> Before the Reformation there appears to
                    be little or no statutory recognition of Sunday, except as a day on which trade
                    was interdicted or national sports directed to be held. Thus the repealed Acts
                    12 Ric. II. c. 6 and 11 Hen. IV. c. 4 enjoined the practice of archery on
                    Sunday. The church itself by provincial constitutions and other means declared
                    the sanctity of the day, and was strong enough to visit with its own censures
                    those who failed to observe Sunday. With the Reformation, however, it became
                    necessary to enforce the observance of Sunday by the state in face of the
                    question mooted at the time as to the divine or merely human institution of the
                    day as a holy day. Sunday observance was directed by injunctions of both Edward
                    VI. and Elizabeth, as well as by Acts of Parliament in their reigns. 5 and 6
                    Edw. VI. c. 1 (the second Act of Uniformity) enacted that all inhabitants of the
                    realm were to endeavour themselves to resort to their parish church or chapel
                    accustomed, or upon reasonable let thereof to some usual place where common
                    prayer is used every Sunday, upon pain of punishment by the censures of the
                    church. This is still law except as to Dissenters (see 9 and 10 Vict. c. 59).
                    The same principle was re-enacted in the Act of Uniformity of Elizabeth (1 Eliz.
                    c. 2), with the addition of a temporal punishment, viz., a fine of twelve pence
                    for each offence. This section of the Act is, however, no longer law, and it
                    appears that the only penalty now incurred by non-attendance at church is the
                    shadowy one of ecclesiastical censure. 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 3 directed the
                    keeping of all Sundays as holy days, with an exception in favour of husbandmen,
                    labourers, fishermen, and other persons in harvest or other time of necessity.
                    At the end of the reign of Elizabeth canon 13 of the canons of 1603 (which are
                    certainly binding upon the clergy, and probably upon the laity as far as they
                    are not contrary to the law, statutes, and customs of the realm, or the royal
                    prerogative) provided that “all manner of persons within the Church of England
                    shall celebrate and keep the Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday, according to
                    God’s holy will and pleasure and the orders of the Church of England prescribed
                    in that behalf, that is, in hearing the word of God read and taught, in private
                    and public prayers, in acknowledging their offences to God and amendment of the
                    same, in reconciling themselves charitably to their neighbours where displeasure
                    hath been, in oftentimes receiving the communion of the body and blood of
                    Christ, in visiting the poor and sick, using all godly and sober conversation.”
                    The Long Parliament, as might be expected, occupied itself with the Sunday
                    question. An ordinance of 1644, c. 51, directed the Lord’s day to be celebrated
                    as holy, as being the Christian Sabbath. Ordinances of 1650, c. 9, and 1656, c.
                    15, contained various minute descriptions of crimes against the sanctity of the
                    Lord’s day, including travelling and “vainly and profanely walking.” The Act of
                    Uniformity of Charles II. (13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4) enforced the reading on
                    every Lord’s day of the morning and evening prayer according to the form in the
                    Book of Common Prayer,—a duty which had been pre viously enjoined by canon 14.
                    By the first of the Church Building Acts (58 Geo. III. c. 45, s. 65) the bishop
                    may direct a third service, morning or evening, where necessary, in any church
                    built under the Act. By 1 and 2 Vict. c. 106, s. 80, he may order the
                    performance of two full services, each if he so direct to include a sermon. The
                    Burial Laws Amendment Act, 1880, forbids any burial under the Act taking place
                    on Sunday.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitutional.—</hi> Parliament has occasionally sat on Sunday
                    in cases of great emergency, as on the demise of the crown. In one or two cases
                    in recent years divisions in the House of Commons have taken place early on
                    Sunday morning. The Ballot Act, 1872, enacts that in reckoning time for election
                    proceedings Sundays are to be excluded. A similar provision is contained in the
                    Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, as to proceedings under that Act.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial.—As</hi> a general rule Sunday l'or the purpose of
                    judicial proceedings is a <hi rend="italic">dies non.</hi> Legal process cannot
                    be served or executed on Sunday, except in cases of treason, felony, or breach
                    of the peace (29 Car. II. c. 7, s. 6). Proceedings which do not need the
                    intervention of the court are good, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> service of a
                    citation or notice to quit or claim to vote. By 11 and 12 Vict. c. 42, s. 4, a
                    justice may issue a warrant of apprehension or a search warrant on Sunday. The
                    Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, provide that the offices of the Supreme Court
                    shall be closed on Sundays, that Sunday is not to be reckoned in the computation
                    of any limited time less than six days allowed for doing any act or taking any
                    proceeding, and that, where the time for doing any act or taking any proceeding
                    expires on Sunday, such act or proceeding is good if done or taken on the next
                    day. By the County Court Rules, 1886, the only county court process which can be
                    executed on Sunday is a warrant of arrest in an Admiralty action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Social.—</hi> Under this head may be grouped the enactments
                    having for their object the regulation of Sunday travelling and amusements. The
                    earliest example of non-ecclesiastical interference with recreation appears to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">Book of Sports</hi> issued by James I. in 1618. Royal
                    authority was given to all but recusants to exercise themselves after evening
                    service in dancing, archery, leaping, vaulting, May-games, Whitsun-ales,
                    morris-dances, and setting up of Maypoles; but bear and bull baiting,
                    interludes, and bowling by the meaner sort were prohibited. In 1625 the first
                    Act of the reign of Charles I. (1 Car. I. c. 1), following the lines of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Sports,</hi> inhibited meetings, assemblies, or concourse
                    of people out of their own parishes on the Lord’s day for any sports and
                    pastimes whatsoever, and any bear-baiting, bull - baiting, interludes, common
                    plays, or other unlawful exercises and pastimes used by any person or persons
                    within their own parishes, under a penalty of 3s. 4d. for every offence. The
                    Act, it will be noticed, impliedly allows sports other than the excepted ones as
                    long as only parishioners take part in them. An Act which has had more important
                    consequences in recent years is 21 Geo. III. c. 49 (drawn by Dr Porteus, bishop
                    of London). It enacts that any place opened or used for public entertainment and
                    amusement or for public debate upon any part of the Lord’s day called Sunday, to
                    which persons are admitted by payment of money or by tickets sold for money, is
                    to be deemed a disorderly house. The keeper is to forfeit £200 for every day on
                    which it is opened or used as aforesaid on the Lord’s day, tho manager or master
                    of the ceremonies £100, and every doorkeeper or servant £50. The advertising or
                    publishing any advertisement of such an entertainment is made subject to a
                    penalty of £50. It has been held that a meeting the object of which was not
                    pecuniary gain (though there was a charge for admission), but an honest
                    intention to introduce religious worship, though not according to any
                    established or usual form, was not within the Act. On this principle forms of
                    worship most directly opposed to the prevailing feeling of the country, such as
                    Mormonism or Mohammedanism, are protected. In 1875 actions were brought in the
                    Courts of Queen’s Bench and Exchequer against the Brighton Aquarium Company, and
                    penalties recovered under the Act. The penalties were remitted by the crown;
                    but, as doubts were felt as to the power of the crown to remit in such a case,
                    38 and 39 Vict. c. 80 was passed to remove such doubts and to enable the
                    sovereign to remit in whole or in part penalties recovered for offences against
                    the Act of Geo. III. The rules made by justices and the bye-laws made by local
                    authorities for the government of theatres and places of public entertainment
                    usually provide for closing on Sunday. The Sunday opening of museums and art
                    galleries is governed by local regulations; there is no general law on the
                    subject, though attempts have been made in that direction. The House of Lords
                    recently passed a resolution in favour of the principle. A public billiard table
                    must not be used on Sunday (8 and 9 Vict. c. 109). The Game Act (1 and 2 Will.
                    IV. c. 32, s. 3) makes it punishable with a fine of £5 to kill game or use a dog
                    or net for sporting purposes on Sunday. Provisions for the regulation of street
                    traffic on Sundays during divine service in the metropolis and provincial towns
                    may be made by the local authorities under the powers of the Metropolis
                    Management Acts, the Town Police Clauses Act, and the Public Health Act. Hackney
                    carriages may ply for hire in London (1 and 2 Will. IV. c. 22). Where a railway
                    company<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n683/mode/1up"

                    to be provided (7 and 8 Vict. c. 85, s. 10). Most of the railway companies’ own
                    Acts also provide for the running of Sunday trains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commercial.—</hi> At common law a contract made on Sunday is
                    not void, nor is Sunday trading or labour unlawful. At an early period, however,
                    the legislature began to impose restrictions, at first by making Sunday trade
                    impossible by closing the places of ordinary business, later by declaring
                    certain kinds of trade and labour illegal, still later by attempting to prohibit
                    all trade and labour. 28 Edw. III. c. 14 (referred to above) closed the wool
                    market on Sunday. 27 Hen. VI. c. 5 (the earliest Sunday Act still in force)
                    prohibited fairs and markets on Sunday (necessary victual only excepted), unless
                    on the four Sundays in harvest,—an exemption since repealed by 13 and 14 Vict.
                    c. 23. 4 Edw. IV. c. 7 (now repealed) restrained the shoemakers of London from
                    carrying on their business on Sunday. 3 Car. I. c. 1 inflicted a penalty of 20s.
                    on any carrier or drover travelling on the Lord’s day, and a penalty of 6s. 8d.
                    on any butcher killing or selling on that day. Both this and the previous Act of
                    1625 were originally passed only for a limited period, but by subsequent
                    legislation they have become perpetual. Next in order is the most comprehensive
                    Act on the subject, 29 Car. II. c. 7, “An Act for the better observance of the
                    Lord’s day, commonly called Sunday.” After an exhortation to the observation of
                    the Lord’s day by exercises in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly
                    and privately, the Act provides as follows :—No tradesman, artificer, workman,
                    labourer, or other person whatsoever shall do or exercise any worldly labour,
                    business, or work of their ordinary callings upon the Lord’s day or any part
                    thereof (works of necessity and charity only excepted); and every person being
                    of the age of fourteen years or upwards offending in the premises shall for
                    every such offence forfeit the sum of 5s.; and no person or persons whatsoever
                    shall publicly cry, show forth, or expose to sale any wares, merchandises,
                    fruit, herbs, goods, or chattels whatsoever upon the Lord’s day or any part
                    thereof upon pain that every person so offending shall forfeit the same goods so
                    cried, or showed forth, or exposed to sale (s. 1). No drover, horse-courser,
                    waggoner, butcher, higgler, their or any of their servants, shall travel or come
                    into his or their lodging upon the Lord’s day or any part thereof, upon pain
                    that each and every such offender shall forfeit 20s. for every such offence; and
                    no person or persons shall use, employ, or travel upon the Lord’s day with any
                    boat, wherry, lighter, or barge, except it be upon extraordinary occasion to be
                    allowed by some justice of the peace, &amp;c., upon pain that every person so
                    offending shall forfeit and lose the sum of 5s. for every such offence. In
                    default of distress or non-payment of forfeiture or penalty the offender may be
                    set publicly in the stocks for two hours (s. 2). Nothing in the Act is to extend
                    to the prohibiting of dressing of meat in families, or dressing or selling of
                    meat in inns, cooks’ shops, or victualling houses for such as cannot be
                    otherwise provided, nor to the crying or selling of milk before nine in the
                    morning or after four in the afternoon (s. 3). Prosecutions must be within ten
                    days after the offence (s. 4). The hundred is not responsible for robbery of
                    persons travelling upon the Lord’s day (s. 5). Service of process on the Lord’s
                    day is void; see above (s. 6). This Act has frequently received judicial
                    construction. The use of the word “ordinary” in section 1 has led to the
                    establishment by a series of decisions of the principle that work done out of
                    the course of the ordinary calling of the person doing it is not within the Act.
                    Thus the sale of a horse on Sunday by a horse-dealer would not be enforcible by
                    him and he would be liable to the penalty, but these results would not follow in
                    the case of a sale by a person not a horse-dealer. Certain acts were held to
                    fall within the exception as to works of necessity and charity, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> baking provisions for customers, running stage-coaches,
                    hiring farm-labourers. The legislature also intervened to obviate some of the
                    inconveniences caused by the Act. By 10 and 11 Will. III. c. 24 mackerel was
                    allowed to be sold before and after service. By 11 and 12 Will. III. c. 21 forty
                    watermen were allowed to ply on the Thames on Sunday. By 9 Anne c. 23 licensed
                    coachmen or chairmen might be hired on Sunday. By 34 Geo. III. bakers were
                    allowed to bake and sell bread at certain hours. These Acts are all repealed.
                    Still law are 2 Geo. III. c. 15 s. 7, allowing fish carriages to travel on
                    Sunday in London and Westminster; 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 75, repealing section 2 of
                    the Act of Charles II. as far as regards Thames boatmen; and 6 and 7 Will. IV.
                    c. 37, permitting bakers out of London to carry on their trade up to 1.30 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> The penalty of the stocks denounced by sect. 2 is
                    practically obsolete (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Stocks).</hi> The prosecution of
                    offences under the Act of Charles II. is now subject to 34 and 35 Vict. c. 87
                    (an Act which was passed for a year, but has since been annually continued by
                    the Expiring Laws Continuance Act of each session), by which no prosecution or
                    proceeding for penalties under that Act can be instituted except with the
                    consent in writing of the chief officer of a police district or the consent of
                    two justices or a stipendiary magistrate. This is surely a more reasonable means
                    of providing against any hardship caused by the Act than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex post facto</hi> power of remission of penalties incurred under 21 Geo. III.
                    c. 49. Besides the general</p>
                <p>Act of Charles II., there are various Acts dealing with special trades; of these
                    the Licensing Acts and the Factory and Workshop Act are the most important. By
                    the Licensing Act, 1874, premises licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquors
                    by retail are to be open on Sunday only at certain hours, varying according as
                    the premises are situate in the metropolitan district, a town or populous place,
                    or elsewhere. An exception is made in favour of a person lodging in the house or
                    a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> traveller, who may be served with refreshment
                    during prohibited hours, unless in a house with a six-day licence. Attempts have
                    often been made, but hitherto without success, to induce the legislature to
                    adopt the principle of complete Sunday closing in England as a whole, or in
                    particular counties.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Act 1 James I. c. 9 (now repealed) appears, however, to have provided for
                    closing ale-houses in most cases, except on usual working days.</p></note> In
                    the session of 1886 a Bill for Sunday closing in Durham was passed by the
                    Commons, but rejected by the Lords. The advocates of Sunday closing in Ireland
                    and Wales have been more successful. The Sale of Liquors on Sunday (Ireland)
                    Act, 1878, prohibits the opening of licensed premises on Sunday, except in
                    Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Belfast. In these towns such premises may
                    be opened from 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> to 7 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p.m.</hi> Exemptions are also made in favour of lodgers and travellers, of
                    packet-boats and railway stations. The Sunday Closing (Wales) Act, 1881,
                    contains no exceptions of towns, like the Irish Act, and the only exemption is
                    the sale of intoxicating liquors at railway stations. The Factory and Workshop
                    Act, 1878, forbids the employment of a child, young person, or woman on Sunday
                    in a factory or workshop. But a young person or woman of the Jewish religion may
                    be employed on Sunday by a Jewish manufacturer, provided that the factory or
                    workshop be not open for traffic on Sunday. There are a few other legislative
                    provisions of less importance which may be noticed. Fishing for salmon on Sunday
                    by any means other than a rod and line is an offence under the Salmon Fishery
                    Act, 1861. By the same Act a free passage for the salmon through all cribs,
                    &amp;c., used for fishery is to be left during the whole of Sunday. Carrying on
                    the business of a pawnbroker on Sunday is an offence within the Pawnbrokers Act,
                    1872. Distilling and rectifying spirits on Sunday is forbidden by the Spirits
                    Act, 1880. The effect of Sunday upon bills of exchange is declared by the Bills
                    of Exchange Act, 1882. A bill is not invalid by reason only of its bearing date
                    on a Sunday (s. 13). Where the last day of grace falls on a Sunday, the bill is
                    payable on the preceding business day (s. 14). Sunday is a “nonbusiness day” for
                    the purposes of the Act (s. 92). This review of Sunday legislation pretty
                    clearly shows that its tendency at present is opposed to extending facilities to
                    trade on Sunday, but that as to recreation the tendency is rather in the other
                    direction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, in

                    >Scotland.—</hi> The two earliest Acts dealing with Sunday are somewhat out of
                    harmony with the general legislation on the subject. 1457, c. 6, ordered the
                    practice of archery on Sunday; 1526, c. 3, allowed markets for the sale of flesh
                    to be held on Sunday at Edinburgh. Then came a long series of Acts forbidding
                    the profanation of the day, especially by salmon-fishing, holding fairs and
                    markets, and working in mills and salt-pans. 1579, c. 70, aud 1661, c. 18,
                    prohibited all work and trading on the Sabbath. The later legislation introduced
                    an exception in favour of duties of necessity and mercy, in accordance with ch.
                    21 of the Confession of Faith. In more modern times the exigencies of travelling
                    have led to a still further extension of the exception. The Sabbath Observance
                    Acts were frequently confirmed, the last time in 1696. These Acts were held by
                    the High Court of Justiciary in 1870 to be still subsisting, as far as they
                    declare the keeping open shop on Sunday to be an offence by the law of Scotland
                    (Bute’s Case, 1 Couper’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 495). The forms of
                    certificate in the schedule to the Public Houses Acts Amendment Act, 1862
                    (superseding those in the Forbes Mackenzie Act of 1853), provide for the closing
                    on Sunday of public-houses and of premises licensed for the sale of excisable
                    liquors, and of inns and hotels, except for the accommodation of lodgers and
                    travellers. Scots law is stricter than English in the matter of Sunday fishing.
                    By 55 Geo. III. c. 94 the setting or hauling of a herring-net on Sunday renders
                    the net liable to forfeiture. By the Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act, 1862,
                    fishing for salmon on Sunday, even with a rod and line, is an offence. As to
                    contracts and legal process, the law is in general accordance with that of
                    England. Contracts are not void, apart from statute, simply because they are
                    made on Sunday. Diligence cannot be executed, but a warrant of imprisonment or
                    <hi rend="italic">meditatio fiugae</hi> is exercisable. It should be noticed
                    that, contrary to the English custom, the term “Sabbath” was generally used in
                    the legislation of the Scottish parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Some of the early colonial ordinances
                    enforced the obligation of attendance at church, as in England. In most States
                    there is legislation on the subject of Sunday, following, as a general rule, the
                    lines of the English Act of Charles II. In<pb break="no"

                    or charity, is punishable with a fine of ten dollars. Provision is sometimes
                    made, as in the Massachusetts laws, for the benefit of persons observing
                    Saturday as the Sabbath, on condition that they disturb no other person. The
                    number of Sunday trains is often limited by State legislation. In some of the
                    New England States Sunday is from sunset to sunset. In most States, however, it
                    is reckoned, as in England, from midnight to midnight. By the constitution of
                    the United States, art. I. s. 7, Sundays are to be excluded from the ten days
                    allowed the president to return a Bill. A similar provision is often contained
                    in State constitutions as to the return of a Bill by the governor. The United
                    States legislation on the subject of Sunday is not important. It directs that
                    naval and military studies are not to be pursued, and that the day is not to be
                    reckoned in bankruptcy proceedings. (J. W+.)</p>
