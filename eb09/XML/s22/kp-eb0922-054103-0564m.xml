                    fought as a militia captain at Vinegar Hill, afterwards volunteered with his
                    company into the line. On the breaking up of his regiment he went to Scotland,
                    and took to farming at Karnes Castle in Bute, where John, the second son, was
                    born 20th July 1806. In 1810 the family removed to Llanblethian, Glamorganshire,
                    and during his residence there Edward Sterling, under the signature of “Vetus,”
                    contributed a number of letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> which were
                    reprinted in 1812, and a second series in 1814. In the latter year he removed to
                    Paris, but, the escape of Napoleon from Elba in 1815 compelling him to return to
                    England, he took up his permanent residence in London, obtaining a connexion
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper, and ultimately being promoted
                    editor. Carlyle, who allows him the dubious credit of being one of the best of
                    newspaper editors, represents him as manifesting “a thoroughly Irish form of
                    character, fire and fervour, vitality of all kinds in genial abundance, but in a
                    much more loquacious, ostentatious, much <hi rend="italic">louder</hi> style
                    than is freely patronized on this side of the Channel.” His fiery, emphatic, and
                    oracular mode of writing conferred those characteristics on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Times</hi> which were recognized in the sobriquet of the
                    “Thunderer.” The frequent changes of the family residence during the early years
                    of young Sterling rendered his education somewhat desultory, but on the
                    settlement in London it became more systematic. After studying for one year at
                    the university of Glasgow, he in 1824 entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where
                    he had for tutor Julius Charles Hare. At Cambridge he did not distinguish
                    himself except in the debates of the union, where, “none,” it was related, “ever
                    came near him except the late Charles Buller.” He removed to Trinity Hall with
                    the intention of graduating in law, but left the university without taking a
                    degree. During the next four years he resided chiefly in London, employing
                    himself actively in literature. Along with Frederick Maurice he purchased the
                    <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> from J. Silk Buckingham, but the enterprise was
                    not a pecuniary success. Through Maurice he became an “assiduous pilgrim” to the
                    shrine of Coleridge at Hampstead. He also formed an intimacy with the Spanish
                    revolutionist General Torrijos, in whose unfortunate expedition he took an
                    active interest. Shortly after his marriage in 1830, symptoms of pulmonary
                    disease induced him to take up his residence in the island of St Vincent, where
                    he had inherited some property, but after fifteen months he returned to England.
                    After spending some time on the Continent he found his health so much
                    re-established that in June 1834 he accepted a curacy at Hurstmonceaux, where
                    his old tutor Julius Hare was vicar. Acting on the advice of his physician he
                    resigned his clerical duties in the following February, but according to Carlyle
                    ill-health was only the external occasion of his resignation, the primary cause
                    being a partly unconscious divergence from the opinions of the church. Be this
                    as it may, the threatening progress of the insidious disease under which he
                    laboured soon rendered “public life in any professional form” quite impossible.
                    There remained to him the “resource of the pen,” but, having to “live all the
                    rest of his days as in continual flight for his very existence,” his literary
                    achievements were necessarily fragmentary, and cannot be regarded as a criterion
                    of his capabilities. He published in 1833 <hi rend="italic">Arthur
                    Coningsby,</hi> a novel, which attracted little attention, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1839), the <hi rend="italic">Election, a Poem</hi>
                    (1841), and <hi rend="italic">Strafford,</hi> a tragedy, were not more
                    successful. He had, however, established a connexion with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blackwood’s Magazine,</hi> to which he contributed a variety of papers and
                    several tales, which gave promise that under more favourable conditions he might
                    have “achieved greatness.” He died at Ventnor 18th September 1844. His father
                    survived him till 1847.</p>
                <p>Sterling’s papers were entrusted to the joint care of Thomas Carlyle and
                    Archdeacon Hare, and it was agreed that the selection of his writings for
                    publication and the preparation of a memoir should be undertaken by the latter.
                    <hi rend="italic">Essays and Tales,</hi> by John Sterling, collected and edited,
                    with a memoir of his life, by Julius Charles Hare, appeared therefore in 1848 in
                    two volumes. So dissatisfied was Carlyle with the memoir, chiefly because it
                    unduly magnified the ecclesiastical side of Sterling’s life, that he resolved to
                    give his own “testimony” about his friend, and “record clearly” what his
                    “knowledge of him was.” His vivid portraiture of Sterling in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life</hi> which appeared in 1851 has perpetuated the memory of
                    Sterling after his writings have ceased to be of interest on their own
                    account.</p>
