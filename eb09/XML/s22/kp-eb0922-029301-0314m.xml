                <p><label type="entry">SPAIN</label>, a country rather more than twice the size of
                    Great Britain including the adjacent small islands, constitutes in its mainland
                    portion about eleven-thirteenths of the Iberian Peninsula, and has in addition
                    an insular area (in the Balearic and Canary Islands) of nearly 5000 square
                    miles. On all sides except that of Portugal the boundaries are natural, the
                    Peninsula being separated from France by the Pyrenees and on every other side
                    being surrounded by the sea. On the side of Portugal a tract of inhospitable
                    country led originally to the separation between the two kingdoms, inasmuch as
                    it caused the reconquest of the comparatively populous maritime tracts from the
                    Moors to be carried out independently of that of the eastern kingdoms, which
                    were also well peopled. The absence of any such means of intercommunication as
                    navigable rivers afford has favoured the continuance of this isolation. The
                    precise line of this western frontier is formed for a considerable length by
                    portions of the chief rivers or by small tributaries, and on the north (between
                    Portugal and Galicia) it is determined to a large extent by small mountain
                    ranges. The British rock of Gibraltar, in the extreme south of the peninsula, is
                    separated from Spain by a low isthmus known as the Neutral Ground. The
                    coast-line on the north and northwest is everywhere steep and cliffy. On the
                    north there are numerous small indentations, many of which form more or less
                    convenient harbours, but the current flowing along the coast from the west often
                    leaves in the stiller water at their mouths obstructive bars. The best harbours
                    are to be found on the <hi rend="italic">rias</hi> or fiord-like indentations in
                    the west of Galicia, where high tides keep the inlets well scoured; here occur
                    the fine natural harbours of Pontevedra and Vigo, Coruna and Ferrol, the last
                    one of the chief stations of the Spanish fleet. Less varied in outline but more
                    varied in character are the Spanish coasts on the south and east. Flat coasts
                    prevail from the frontier of Portugal to the Straits of Gibraltar. Between the
                    mouth of the Rio Tinto and that of the Guadalquivir they are sandy and lined by
                    a series of sand-dunes (the tract known as the Arenas Gordas). Next follows a
                    marshy tract at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, after which the coast-line
                    becomes more varied, and includes the fine Bay of Cadiz. From the Straits of
                    Gibraltar a bold and rocky coast is continued almost right round to Cape Palos,
                    a little beyond the fine natural harbour of Cartagena. North of Cape Palos a
                    line of flat coast, beginning with the narrow strip which cuts off the lagoon
                    called the Mar Menor from the Mediterranean, bounds half of the province of
                    Alicante, but in its northern half this province, becoming mountainous, runs out
                    to the lofty headland of Cape Nao. The whole coast of the Bay of Valencia is low
                    and ill-provided with harbours; and along the east of Catalonia stretches of
                    steep and rocky coast alternate with others of an opposite character.</p>
                <p>The surface of Spain is remarkable at once for its striking contrasts and its
                    vast expanses of dreary uniformity. There are mountains rising with Alpine
                    grandeur above the snow-line, but often sheltering rich and magnificent valleys
                    at their base. Naked walls of white limestone tower above dark woods of cork,
                    oak, and olive. In other parts, as in the Basque country, in Galicia, in the
                    Serrania de Cuenca (between the head waters of the Tagus and those of the
                    Jucar), in the Albarracin (between the head waters of the Tagus and those of the
                    Guadalaviar), there are extensive tracts of undulating forest-clad hill country,
                    and almost contiguous to these there are apparently boundless plains, or tracts
                    of level tableland, some almost uninhabitable, and some streaked with canals and
                    richly cultivated—like the Requena of Valencia. While, again, continuous
                    mountain ranges and broad plains and tablelands give the prevailing character to
                    the scenery, there are here and there, on the one hand, lofty isolated peaks,
                    landmarks for a wide distance round, such as Monseny, Monserrat, and Mont Sant
                    in Catalonia, the Pena Golosa in Valencia, Moncayo on the borders of Aragon and
                    Old Castile, and, on the other hand, small secluded valleys, such as those of
                    Vich and Olot among the Catalonian Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the interior of Spain is composed of a tableland bounded by
                    the Cantabrian Mountains in the north and the Sierra Morena in the south, and
                    divided into two by a series of mountain ranges stretching on the whole from
                    east to west. The northern half of the tableland, made up of the provinces of
                    Leon and Old Castile, has an average elevation estimated at about 2700 feet,
                    while the southern half, made up of Estremadura and New Castile, is slightly
                    lower—about 2600 feet. On all sides the tableland as a whole is remarkably
                    isolated, and hence the passes on its boundary and the river valleys that lead
                    up to it from the surrounding plains are geographical features of peculiar
                    importance. The isolation on the side of Portugal, where the tableland gradually
                    sinks to the sea in a succession of terraces, has already been referred to. On
                    the north-west the valley of the Sil and a series of valleys further south,
                    along both of which military roads have been carried from an early period, open
                    up communication between Leon and the hill country of Galicia, which explains
                    why this province was united to Leon even before the conquest of Portugal from
                    the Moors. The passes across the Cantabrian Mountains in the north are tolerably
                    numerous, and four of them are already crossed by railways. The two most
                    remarkable are the Pass of Pájares, across which winds the railway from Leon to
                    Oviedo and the seaport of Gijon, and that of Reinosa leading down to the deep
                    valley of the Besaya, and now crossed by the railway from Valladolid to
                    Santander. In its eastern section the chain is crossed by the railways from
                    Burgos to Bilbao and San Sebastian, the latter of which winds through the wild
                    and romantic gorge of Pancorbo (in the north-east of the province of Burgos)
                    before it traverses the Cantabrian chain at Idiazabal.</p>
                <p>On the north-east and east, where the edge of the tableland sweeps round in a
                    wide curve, the surface sinks on the whole in broad terraces to the valley of
                    the Ebro and the Bay of Valencia, and is crowned here and there by more or less
                    isolated mountains, some of which have been already mentioned. On the north-east
                    by far the most important communication with the Ebro valley is formed by the
                    valley of the Jalon, which has thus always formed a military route of the
                    highest consequence, and which is now traversed by the railway from Madrid to
                    Saragossa. Further south the mountains clustered on the east of the tableland
                    (Albarracin, Serrania de Cuenca) render direct communication between Valencia
                    and Madrid extremely difficult, and the principal communications with the east
                    and south-east are effected where the southern tableland of La Mancha merges in
                    the hill country which connects the interior of Spain with the Sierra
                    Nevada.</p>
                <p>In the south the descent from the tableland to the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n315/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0315-0294"/> valley of the Guadalquivir is again comparatively
                    gradual, but even here in the eastern half of the Sierra Morena the passes are
                    few, the most important being the Puerto de Despeñaperros, where the Rio Magana
                    has cut for itself a deep gorge through which the railway now ascends from
                    Andalusia to Madrid. Between Andalusia and Estremadura farther west the
                    communication is freer, the Sierra Morena being there broken up into series of
                    small chains.</p>
                <p>Of the mountains belonging to the tableland the most continuous are those of the
                    Cantabrian chain, which stretches for the most part from east to west, parallel
                    to the Bay of Biscay, but ultimately bends round towards the south between Leon
                    and Galicia. Almost everywhere it consists of two parallel ranges, the higher of
                    which, the more southerly, is the immediate continuation of the Pyrenees. The
                    highest summits of the chain belong to the Jura limestones of the Penas de
                    Europa, on the borders of the provinces of Santander, Oviedo, Leon, and
                    Palencia. The highest of all is the Torre de Ceredo, which attains the height of
                    at least 8750 feet, and next is the Pena Prieta (8300 feet). At the sources of
                    the Sil the main chain divides into two branches, enclosing the fertile and
                    thickly-populated district known as El Vierzo, once the bed of a lake, now
                    watered by the stream just mentioned and its tributaries. The whole chain is
                    remarkable for its intricate ramifications and its wild grandeur, but, as
                    already indicated, is not so much of a barrier to communication as might be
                    expected from its general aspect. Besides the railways above mentioned it is
                    crossed at many points by bridle-paths and roads.</p>
                <p>A peculiar feature of the chain and the neighbouring parts of the tableland is
                    formed by the <hi rend="italic">parameras</hi> or isolated plateaus, surrounded
                    by steep rocky mountains, sometimes even by walls of naked rock. Among the
                    larger of these are the bleak districts of Siguenza and Soria, round the
                    headwaters of the Duero,—districts which separate the mountains of the so-called
                    Iberian system on the north-east of the tableland from the eastern portion of
                    the central mountain chains of the peninsula. Of these chains, to which Spanish
                    geographers give the name Carpetano-Vetonica, the most easterly is the Sierra de
                    Guadarrama, the general trend of which is from southwest to north-east. It is
                    the Montes Carpetani of the ancients, and a portion of it (due north of Madrid)
                    still bears the name of Carpetanos. Composed almost entirely of granite, it has
                    an aspect when seen from a distance highly characteristic of the mountains of
                    the Iberian Peninsula in general, presenting the appearance of a sawlike ridge
                    <hi rend="italic">(sierra)</hi> broken up into numerous sections. Its mean
                    height is about 5250 feet, and near its centre it has three summits (the highest
                    named the Pico de Penalara) rising to the height of nearly 8000 feet.</p>
                <p>A region with a highly irregular surface, filled with hills and parameras,
                    separates this sierra from the Sierra de Gredos farther west. This is the
                    loftiest and grandest sierra in the whole series. Its culminating point, the
                    Plaza de Almanzor, attains the height of 8725 feet, not far short of that of the
                    highest Cantabrian summits. Its general trend is east and west; towards the
                    south it sinks precipitously, and on the north it descends with a somewhat more
                    gentle slope towards the longitudinal valleys of the Tormes and Alberche which
                    separate it from another rugged mountain range, forming the southern boundary of
                    the paramera of Avila. On the west another rough and hilly tract, similar to
                    that which divides it from the Sierra de Guadarrama in the east, separates it
                    from the Sierra de Gata, the westernmost and the lowest of the Spanish sierras
                    belonging to the series. These hilly intervals between the more continuous
                    sierras greatly facilitate the communica tion between the northern and southern
                    halves of the Spanish tableland. The Guadarrama is indeed crossed by three good
                    pass-roads, and even the Sierra de Gredos has a road across it connecting Avila
                    with Talavera de la Reina by the Puerto del Pico; but for the most part there
                    are only bridle-paths across the sierras, and up to the present date not a
                    single railway crosses any one of the sierras directly. The only railway
                    crossing the central system of mountains is that from Madrid to Avila, which
                    traverses the interval between the Sierras de Gredos and Guadarrama, passing
                    through numerous tunnels on the way. A railway from Madrid to Segovia to cross
                    the latter sierra at the Puerto de Navacerrada (5830 feet),<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">About 3700 feet above the
                    level of Madrid, 2700 feet above that of Segovia.</hi></p></note> the pass at
                    present crossed by the principal high road across these mountains, is now (1886)
                    in course of construction.</p>
                <p>On the southern half of the tableland a shorter series of sierras, consisting of
                    the Montes de Toledo in the east (highest elevation 4600 feet) and the Sierra de
                    Guadalupe in the west (highest elevation 5100 feet), separates the basins of the
                    Tagus and Guadiana. The southern system of mountains bounding the Iberian
                    tableland—the Sierra Morena—is even less of a continuous chain than the two
                    systems last described. As already intimated, its least continuous portion is in
                    the west. In the east and middle portion it is composed of a countless number of
                    irregularly-disposed undulating mountains all nearly equal in height.</p>
                <p>Even more important than the mountains bounding or crossing the tableland are
                    those in the north-east and in the south, which are connected with the tableland
                    only at their extremities. The former are the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pyrenees</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the latter are the Sierra Nevada,
                    and the coast ranges still farther south. The Sierra Nevada, or “snowy sierra,”
                    is a well-defined chain, between 50 and 60 miles in length, and about 25 miles
                    in breadth, situated to the south of the valley of the Guadalquivir, and
                    stretching from the upper part of the valley of the Jenil in the west to the
                    deep valley of the Almeria in the east. It is composed chiefly of soft micaceous
                    schists, sinking precipitously down on the north, but sloping more gently to the
                    south and south-east. Its culminating summit, the Cerro de Mulahacen (11,660
                    feet), is the highest in Spain, and the range contains several other peaks
                    upwards of 10,000 feet in height, and above the limit of perpetual snow. On both
                    sides deep transverse valleys <hi rend="italic">(barrancas)</hi> follow one
                    another in close succession, in many cases with round basin-shaped heads, like
                    the <hi rend="italic">cirques</hi> of the Pyrenees. In many of these cirques
                    repose alpine lakes, and in one of them, the Corral de Veleta, there is even a
                    small glacier, the most southerly in Europe. On the south the transverse valleys
                    of the Sierra Nevada open into the mountainous longitudinal valley of the
                    Alpujarras, into which open also on the other side the transverse valleys from
                    the most easterly of the coast sierras, the Sierra Contraviesa and the Sierra de
                    Almijara. The latter are continued farther west by the Sierra de Alhama and
                    Sierra de Abdalajiz. Immediately to the west of the latter sierra lies the gorge
                    of the Guadalhorce, which now affords a passage for the railway from Malaga to
                    Cordova; and beyond that gorge, to the west and south-west, the Serrania de
                    Ronda, a mountain group difficult of access, stretches out its sierras in all
                    directions. To Spanish geographers the coast ranges just mentioned are known
                    collectively as the Sierra Penibetica. Northeast of the Sierra Nevada two small
                    ranges, Alcaraz and La Sagra, rise with remarkable abruptness from the plateau
                    of Murcia, where it merges in that of the interior.</p>
                <p>The only two important lowland valleys of Spain are those of the Ebro and the
                    Guadalquivir. The former occupies the angle in the north-east between the
                    Pyrenees<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n316/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0316-0295"/> and the central tableland, and is divided by
                    ranges of heights proceeding on the one side from the Pyrenees, on the other
                    from the base of the Moncayo, into two portions. The uppermost of these, a
                    plateau of between 1000 and 1300 feet above sea-level, is only about one-fourth
                    of the size of the remaining portion, which is chiefly lowland, but is cut off
                    from the coast by a highland tract connecting the interior tableland with spurs
                    from the Pyrenees. The Guadalquivir basin is likewise divided by the
                    configuration of the ground into a small upper portion of considerable elevation
                    and a much larger lower portion mainly lowland, the latter composed from Seville
                    downwards of a perfectly level and to a large extent unhealthy alluvium <hi
                    rend="italic">(las marismas).</hi> The division between these two sections is
                    indicated by the change in the course of the main stream from a due westerly to
                    a more south-westerly direction.</p>
                <p>The main water-parting of the peninsula is everywhere near the edge of the
                    tableland on the north, east, and south, and hence describes a semicircle with
                    the convexity to the east. The Ebro alone of the great rivers flows into the
                    Mediterranean. The following table gives the length of the principal Iberian
                    rivers, with the area of their basins,—the length according to different
                    authorities, the area of the basins according to Strelbitsky, whose measurements
                    of area appear to be more trustworthy than those made by him of the length of
                    rivers :—</p>

                <p>With the exception of the Guadalquivir, none of the Iberian rivers is of great
                    service for inland navigation, so far as they lie within the Spanish frontier.
                    On the other hand, those of the east and south are of great value for
                    irrigation, and the Jucar and Segura in the south-east are employed in floating
                    timber from the Serrania de Cuenca.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Ebro</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Tagus</hi> are
                    described in separate articles <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>The Mino (Portug. <hi rend="italic">Minho,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Minius</hi>
                    of the Romans) is formed by the union of two small streams in the north of the
                    province of Lugo, and flows first southwards, then on the whole south-westwards
                    to the Atlantic, forming in the lower part of its course the boundary between
                    Spain and Portugal. It becomes navigable for small vessels at Salvaterra, 25
                    miles above its mouth. Large vessels cannot cross the bar at its mouth. Its only
                    important tributary is the Sil (left), which at the confluence is the larger
                    river of the two.</p>
                <p>The Duero (Portug. <hi rend="italic">Douro,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Durius</hi> of the Romans) emerges from the rock as a small stream among the
                    mountains of Urbion on the borders of the provinces of Logrono and Soria, and,
                    after describing a wide sweep to the east, flows westwards across the northern
                    half of the Spanish tableland and across Portugal. For a distance of nearly 60
                    miles it forms the boundary between the two countries. It begins to be navigable
                    80 miles above its mouth, but sea-going vessels ascend only to Oporto, and even
                    so far, on account of a bar at the mouth, only at high tide. The principal
                    tributaries on the right are the Pisuerga and Esla, on the left the Adaja,
                    Tormes, and Coa (the last in Portugal).</p>
                <p>The Guadiana (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Wádi Ana,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anas</hi> of the ancients) was long believed to take its rise
                    in the district known as the Campo de Montiel, where a string of small lakes
                    known as the Lagunas de Ruidera (partly in Ciudad Real, partly in Albacete) are
                    connected by a stream which, on leaving the last of them, flows north-westwards
                    towards the Zancara and then disappears within two or three miles of that river.
                    About 22 miles to the south-west of the point of disappearance the stream was
                    believed to re-emerge in the form of several large springs which form a number
                    of lakes at no great distance from the Zancara, and these lakes are hence known
                    as the “eyes of the Guadiana” (<hi rend="italic">los ojos de Guadiana).</hi> The
                    small stream issuing from them is known as the Guadiana and soon joins the
                    Zancara. It has now been ascertained, however, that the stream which disappears
                    higher up can have no such course, but that in fact its waters flow or trickle
                    underground to the Zancara itself, which is therefore entitled to be regarded as
                    the upper Guadiana. It has its source not far from that of the Jucar in the east
                    of the plateau of La Mancha, and flows westwards till, under the name of the
                    Guadiana, it turns south-south-west on the Portuguese frontier. In piercing the
                    Sierra Morena it forms a series of foaming rapids, and it begins to be navigable
                    only at Mertola, about 42 miles above its mouth.</p>
                <p>The Guadalquivir (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wádi-el-Kebir,</hi> “the great river,” the <hi rend="italic">Baetis</hi> of the
                    ancients), though the shortest of the great rivers of the Peninsula, is the only
                    one that at all seasons of the year is a full-bodied stream, being fed in winter
                    by the rains, in summer by the melting of the snows on the Sierra Nevada. What
                    is regarded as the main stream rises in the Sierra de Cazorla in the east of the
                    province of Jaen, but it does not become a considerable river till after it is
                    joined by the Guadiana Menor (from the Sierra Nevada), on the left bank and the
                    Guadalimar on the right. Lower down the principal tributary which it receives is
                    the Jenil (left). In the days of the Moors the Guadalquivir was navigable for
                    large vessels to Cordova, but, having been allowed to become silted up in the
                    lower part of its course, it has only recently again been made navigable for
                    vessels of 1200 tons burden to Seville.</p>
                <p>The only considerable lakes in Spain are three coast lagoons,—that of Albufera in
                    the province of Valencia, the Mar Menor in Murcia, and the Laguna de la Janda in
                    Cadiz behind Cape Trafalgar. Small alpine and other lakes are numerous, and
                    small salt lakes are to be found in every steppe region.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of the Spanish Peninsula is comparatively simple. Upon a
                    fundamental platform of ancient crystalline rocks, which had previously been
                    upraised into detached ridges, a series of sedimentary formations was laid down,
                    among which occur representatives of most of the geological systems from the
                    older Palaeozoic rocks up to those of Quaternary date. Arranged in order of age,
                    with their respective areas, these various groups of rock are shown in the

                <p>Archaean rocks are exposed in the northern half of the Peninsula, particularly
                    along the great Pyrenean axis, in Galicia, Estremadura, the Sierra Morena, the
                    Sierra Nevada, and Serrania de Ronda. They consist of granites, gneisses, and
                    mica-schists, with talc-schists, amphibolites, and crystalline limestones. The
                    oldest Palaeozoic strata are referred, from their included fossils, to the
                    Cambrian and Silurian divisions. They range through a vast region of Andalusia,
                    Estremadura, Castile, Salamanca, Leon, and Asturias, and along the flanks of the
                    Pyrenean and Cantabrian chain. They consist of slates, greywackes, quartzites,
                    and diabases. Grits, quartzites, and shales referable to the Devonian system
                    occur in a few scattered areas, the largest and most fossiliferous of these
                    occurring in the Asturias. The Carboniferous rocks of Spain are divisible into
                    three groups, the lowest consisting of limestones with sandstones and shales,
                    the middle of conglomerates and sandstones, and the upper of sandstones,
                    conglomerates, shales, and coals. They lie in detached basins, and have not yet
                    been well explored. One of these areas covers a considerable space in the
                    Asturias, whence it stretches more or less continuously through the provinces of
                    Leon, Palencia, and Santander, covering altogether an area of 6500 square
                    kilometres. Another tract occurs at San Juan de las Abadesas in Catalonia, where
                    it occupies about 200 square kilometres; while a third, about 500 square
                    kilometres in extent, runs from the province of Cordova into that of Badajoz.
                    There are other smaller areas containing little or no coal, but showing by the
                    included plant-remains that the strata undoubtedly belong to the Carboniferous
                    system.</p>
                <p>The Triassic system is well developed in the north of the Peninsula along the
                    Cantabrian chain and eastwards to the Mediterranean. It is composed of red and
                    variegated sandstones, dolomites, and marls, traversed in some places by ophitic
                    rocks, and containing deposits of gypsum, aragonite, and rock-salt. These strata
                    are overlain by members of the Jurassic series, which are especially conspicuous
                    in the eastern part of the Peninsula<pb break="no"

                    Mediterranean border, in Andalusia, and likewise along the flanks of the
                    Pyrenees. The Lias is best represented. The Cretaceous system is distributed in
                    four great districts: the largest of these extends through the kingdoms of
                    Murcia and Valencia; a second stretches between the two Castiles; a third is
                    found in the Basque Provinces and the Asturias; and a fourth spreads out along
                    the southern slopes of the Pyrenees from Navarre to the Mediterranean. The lower
                    members of the Cretaceous series include an important freshwater formation
                    (sandstones and clays), which extends from the Cantabrian coast through the
                    provinces of Santander, Burgos, Soria, and Logrono, and is supposed to represent
                    the English Wealden series. The higher members comprise massive hippurite
                    limestones, and in the Pyrenean district representatives of the upper
                    subdivisions of the system, including the Danian.</p>
                <p>Deposits of Tertiary age cover rather more than a third of Spain. They are
                    divisible into two great series, according to their mode of origin in the sea or
                    in fresh water. The marine Tertiary accumulations commence with those that are
                    referable to the Eocene series, consisting of nummulitic limestones, marls, and
                    siliceous sandstones. These strata are developed in the basin of the Ebro, and
                    in a belt which extends from Valencia through Murcia and Andalusia to Cadiz.
                    Marine Miocene deposits occupy some small tracts, especially on the coast of
                    Valencia. But most of the sandy Tertiary rocks of that district are Pliocene.
                    The Tertiary masses of Andalusia have coarse conglomerates (Middle Miocene) at
                    their base, followed by thick beds of Bryozoan molasse and younger (Pliocene)
                    beds. These strata are specially noteworthy for containing an important
                    metalliferous deposit, that of the native silver of Herrerias, which is found in
                    a Pliocene bed in the form of flakes, needles, and crystals. But the most
                    extensive and interesting Tertiary accumulations are those of the great lakes
                    which in Oligocene and Miocene time spread over so large an expanse of the
                    tableland. These sheets of fresh water covered the centre of the country,
                    including the basins of the Ebro, Jucar, Guadalaviar, Guadalquivir, and Tagus.
                    They have left behind them thick deposits of clays, marls, gypsum, and
                    limestone, in which numerous remains of the land-animals of the time have been
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>Quaternary deposits spread over about a tenth of the area of the country. The
                    largest tract of them is to be seen to the south of the Cantabrian chain; but
                    another, of hardly inferior extent, flanks the Sierra de Guadarrama, and spreads
                    out over the great plain from Madrid to Caceres. Some of these alluvial
                    accumulations indicate a former greater extension of the snowfields that are now
                    so restricted in the Spanish sierras. Remains of the reindeer are found in caves
                    in the Pyrenees.</p>
                <p>Eruptive rocks of many different ages occur in different parts of Spain. The most
                    important tract covered by them is that which stretches from Cape Ortegal to
                    Coria in Estremadura and spreads over a large area of Portugal. They likewise
                    appear in Castile, forming the sierras of Gredos and Guadarrama; farther south
                    they rise in the mountains of Toledo, in the Sierra Morena, and across the
                    provinces of Cordova, Seville, Huelva, and Badajoz as far as Evora in Portugal.
                    Among the minor areas occupied by them may be especially mentioned those which
                    occur in the Triassic districts. Of rocks included in the eruptive series the
                    most abundant is granite. There occur also quartz-porphyry (Sierra Morena,
                    Pyrenees, &amp;c. ), diorite, porphyrite, diabase (well developed in the north
                    of Andalusia, where it plays a great part in the structure of the Sierra
                    Morena), ophite (Pyrenees, Cadiz), serpentine (forming an enormous mass in the
                    Serrania de Ronda), trachyte, liparite, andesite, basalt. The last four rocks
                    occur as a volcanic series distributed in three chief districts—that of Cape
                    Gata, including the south-east of Andalusia and the south of Murcia, that of
                    Catalonia, and that of La Mancha.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> In accordance with its southerly position, its
                    differences of elevation, and the variety in its superficial configuration in
                    other respects, Spain presents within its borders examples of every kind of
                    climate to be found on the northern hemisphere, with the sole exception of that
                    of the torrid zone. As regards temperature, the heart of the tableland is
                    characterized by extremes as great as are to be met with in almost any part of
                    central Europe. The northern and north-western maritime provinces, on the other
                    hand, have a climate as equable, and, it may be added, as moist, as that of the
                    west of England or Scotland.</p>
                <p>Four zones of climate are distinguished. The first zone may be called that of the
                    tableland, although to it also the greater part of the Ebro basin may be
                    referred. This is the zone of the greatest extremes of temperature. Even in
                    summer the nights are often decidedly cold, and on the high parameras it is not
                    a rare thing to see hoar-frost in the morning. In spring cold wetting mists
                    occasionally envelop the land for entire days, while in summer the sky is often
                    perfectly clear for weeks together. At all seasons of the year sudden changes of
                    temperature, to the extent of from 30° to 50° F., are not infrequent. The air is
                    extremely dry, which is all the more keenly felt from the fact that it is almost
                    constantly in motion. At Madrid (2150 feet above sea-level) it regularly freezes
                    so hard in December and January that skating is carried on on the sheet of water
                    in the Buen Retiro; and, as winter throughout Spain, except in the maritime
                    provinces of the north and north-west, is the season of greatest atmospheric
                    precipitation, snowfalls are frequent, though the snow seldom lies long except
                    at high elevations. The summers, on the other hand, are not only extremely warm
                    but almost rainless, the sea-winds being deprived of their moisture on the edge
                    of the plateau. In July and August the plains of New Castile and Estremadura are
                    sunburnt wastes; the roads are several inches deep with dust; the leaves of the
                    few trees are withered and discoloured; the atmosphere is filled with a fine
                    dust, producing a haze known as <hi rend="italic">calina,</hi> which converts
                    the blue of the sky into a dull grey. In the greater part of the Ebro basin the
                    heat of summer is even more intense. The treeless mostly steppe-like valley with
                    a bright-coloured soil acts like a concave mirror in reflecting the sun’s rays,
                    and, moreover, the mountains and highlands by which the valley is enclosed
                    prevent to a large extent the access of winds, and thus hinder the renewal of
                    the air, which in the lowest parts is little disturbed.</p>
                <p>The second zone is that of the Mediterranean provinces, exclusive of those of the
                    extreme south. In this zone the extremes of temperature are less, though the
                    summers here also are warm, and the winters decidedly cool, especially in the
                    north-east.</p>
                <p>The southern zone, to which the name of African has been given, embraces the
                    whole of Andalusia as far as the Sierra Morena, the southern half of Murcia, and
                    the province of Alicante. In this zone there prevails a genuine subtropical
                    climate, with extremely warm and almost rainless summers and mild winters, the
                    temperature hardly ever sinking below freezing-point. The hottest part of the
                    region is not the most southerly district but the bright-coloured steppes of the
                    coast of Granada, and the plains and hill terraces of the south-east coast from
                    Almeria to Alicante. Snow and frost are here hardly known. It is said that at
                    Malaga snow falls only about once in twenty-five years. The winter, in fact, is
                    the season of the brightest vegetation: after the long drought of summer the
                    surface gets covered once more in late autumn with a fresh green varied with
                    bright-coloured flowers, and so it remains the whole winter through. On the
                    other hand, the eastern part of this zone is the part of Spain which is liable
                    to be visited from time to time by the scorching and blasting <hi rend="italic"
                    >leveche,</hi> the name given in Spain to the sirocco, as well as by the <hi
                    rend="italic">solano,</hi> a moist and less noxious east wind.</p>
                <p>The fourth zone, that of the north and north-west maritime provinces, presents a
                    marked contrast to all the others. The temperature is mild and equable; the
                    rains are abundant all the year round, but fall chiefly in autumn, as in the
                    west of Europe generally. Monthly roses bloom in the gardens at Christmas as
                    beautifully and as plentifully as in summer. The chief drawback of the climate
                    is an excess of rain in some parts, especially in the west. Santiago de
                    Compostella, for example, has one of the highest rainfalls on the mainland of
                    Europe (see table below).</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The vegetation of Spain exhibits a variety in
                    keeping with the differences of climate just described. The number of endemic
                    species is exceptionally large, the number of monotypic genera in the Peninsula
                    greater than in any other part of the Mediterranean domain. The endemic species
                    are naturally most numerous in the mountains, aud above all in the loftiest
                    ranges, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada; but it is a peculiarity of the
                    Spanish tableland, as compared with the plains and tablelands of central Europe,
                    that it also possesses a considerable number of endemic plants and plants of
                    extremely restricted range. This fact, however, is also in harmony with the
                    physical conditions above described, being explained by the local varieties, not
                    only of climate, but also of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0318-0297"/> soil. Altogether no other country in Europe of
                    equal extent has so great a wealth of species as Spain. According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus Florae Hispanicae</hi> of Willkomm and Lange (completed
                    in 1880), the number of species of vascular plants then ascertained to exist in
                    the country was 5096.</p>
                <p>Spain may be divided botanically into four provinces, corresponding to the four
                    climatic zones.</p>
                <p>In the tableland province (including the greater part of the Ebro valley) the
                    flora is composed chiefly of species characteristic of the Mediterranean region,
                    generally of species confined to the Peninsula. A peculiar character is imparted
                    to the vegetation of this province by the growth over large tracts of evergreen
                    shrubs and large herbaceous plants belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cistineae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Labiatae.</hi> Areas covered by plants of
                    the former group are known to the Spaniards as <hi rend="italic">jarales,</hi>
                    and are particularly extensive in the Mancha Alta and on the slopes of the
                    Sierra Morena, where the ladanum bush <hi rend="italic">(Cistus
                    ladaniferus)</hi> is specially abundant; those covered by plants of the latter
                    group are known as <hi rend="italic">tomillares</hi> (from <hi rend="italic"
                    >tomillo,</hi> thyme), and occur chiefly in the south, south-west, and east of
                    the tableland of New Castile. In the central parts of the same tableland huge
                    thistles (such as the <hi rend="italic">Onopordum nervosum),</hi> centaureas,
                    artemisias, and other <hi rend="italic">Composilae</hi> are scattered in great
                    profusion. From the level parts of these tablelands trees are almost entirely
                    absent. On the lofty parameras of Soria and other parts of Old Castile the
                    vegetation has an almost alpine character.</p>
                <p>The southern or African province is distinguished chiefly by the abundance of
                    plants which have their true home in North Africa (a fact easily understood when
                    we consider the geologically recent land connexion of Spain with that
                    continent), but is also remarkable for the occurrence within it of numerous
                    Eastern plants (natives of Syria and Asia Minor), and plants belonging to South
                    Africa and the Canaries, as well as natives of tropical America which have
                    become naturalized here (see below under <hi rend="italic">Agriculture).</hi> In
                    this province the maritime parts of Malaga and Granada present scenes of almost
                    tropical richness and beauty, while, on the other hand, in Murcia, Alicante, and
                    Almeria the aspect is truly African, fertile oases appearing in the midst of
                    rocky deserts or barren steppes. A peculiar vegetation, consisting mainly of low
                    shrubs with fleshy glaucous leaves <hi rend="italic">(Inula crithmoides,</hi>
                    &amp;c. ), covers the marismas of the Guadalquivir and various parts of the
                    south-west coast where salt-marshes prevail. Everywhere on moist sandy ground
                    are to be seen tall thickets of <hi rend="italic">Arunolo Donax.</hi></p>
                <p>The Mediterranean province is that in which the general aspect of the vegetation
                    agrees most closely with that of southern France and the lowlands of the
                    Mediterranean region generally. On the lower slopes of the mountains and on all
                    the parts left uncultivated the prevailing form of vegetation consists of a
                    dense growth of shrubs with thick leathery leaves, such as are known to the
                    French as <hi rend="italic">maquis,</hi> to the Italians as <hi rend="italic"
                    >macchie,</hi> and are called in Spanish <hi rend="italic">monte bajo,</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">As
                    distinguished from</hi> monte alto, <hi rend="italic">the collective name for
                    forest trees.</hi></p></note> shrubs which, however much they resemble each
                    other in external appearance, belong botanically to a great variety of
                    families.</p>
                <p>The northern maritime province, in accordance with its climate, has a vegetation
                    resembling that of central Europe. Here only are to be found rich grassy meadows
                    adorned with flowers such as are seen in English fields, and here only do
                    forests of oak, beech, and chestnut cover a large proportion of the area. The
                    extraordinary abundance of ferns (as in western France) is likewise
                    characteristic.</p>
                <p>The forest area of Spain generally is relatively small. Tho whole extent of
                    forests is estimated at little more than 3 millions of hectares (7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> million acres), or
                    less than 6 per cent. of the area of the kingdom. Evergreen oaks, chestnuts, and
                    conifers are the prevailing trees. The cork oaks of the southern provinces and
                    of Catalonia are of immense value, but the groves containing this tree have
                    suffered greatly from the reckless way in which the product is collected. Among
                    other characteristic trees are the Spanish pine <hi rend="italic">(Pinus
                    hispanica),</hi> the Corsican pine <hi rend="italic">(P. Laricio),</hi> the
                    Pinsapo fir <hi rend="italic">(Abies Pinsapo),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quercus Tozza,</hi> the last belonging to the slopes of the Sierra Nevada.
                    Besides the date-palm the dwarf-palm grows spontaneously in some parts of the
                    south, but it nowhere makes up a large element of the vegetation.</p>
                <p>The Spanish steppes deserve a special notice, since they are not confined to one
                    of the four botanical provinces, but are found in all of them except the last.
                    Six considerable steppe regions are counted:—(1) that of Old Castile, situated
                    to the south of Valladolid, and composed chiefly of hills of gypsum; (2) that of
                    New Castile, in the south-east (the district of La Mancha); (3) the Aragonese,
                    occupying the upper part of the basin of the Ebro; (4) the littoral, stretching
                    along the south-east coast from Alicante to the neighbourhood of Almeria; (5)
                    the Granadine, in the east of Upper Andalusia (the former kingdom of Granada);
                    and (6) the Baetic, in Lower Andalusia, on both sides of the valley of the
                    Jenil. All of these are originally salt-steppes, and, where the soil is still
                    highly impregnated with salt, have only a sparse covering of shrubs, mostly
                    members of the <hi rend="italic">Salsolaceae,</hi> with thick, greyish green,
                    often downy leaves. A different aspect is presented by the grass steppes of
                    Murcia, La Mancha, the plateaus of Guadix and Huescar in the province of
                    Granada, &amp;c., all of which are covered chiefly with the valuable esparto
                    grass <hi rend="italic">(Macrochloa tenacissima).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fauna.—</hi> The Iberian Peninsula belongs to the Mediterranean subregion of
                    the Palaearctic region of the animal kingdom, a division which includes also the
                    north of Africa. The forms that betray African affinities are naturally to be
                    found chiefly in the south. Among the mammals that fall under this head are the
                    common genet <hi rend="italic">(Genetta vulgaris),</hi> which extends, however,
                    pretty far north, and is found also in the south of France, the fallow-deer, the
                    porcupine (very rare), and a species of ichneumon <hi rend="italic">(Herpestes
                    widdringtonii),</hi> which is confined to the Peninsula, and is the only
                    European species of this characteristically African genus. The magot or Barbary
                    ape <hi rend="italic">(Inuus ecaudatus),</hi> the only species of monkey still
                    found wild in Europe, is also a native of Spain, but the only flock still
                    surviving, on the rock of Gibraltar, has often been on the point of extinction,
                    and has to be renewed from time to time by importations from the north of
                    Africa. Of the mammals in which Spain shows more affinity to the fauna of
                    central and northern Europe, some of the most characteristic are the Spanish
                    lynx <hi rend="italic">(Lynx pardinus),</hi> a species confined to the
                    Peninsula, the Spanish hare <hi rend="italic">(Lepus madritensis),</hi> and the
                    species mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrenees.</hi> The birds
                    of Spain are very numerous, partly no doubt in consequence of the fact that the
                    Peninsula lies in the route of those birds of passage which cross from Africa to
                    Europe or Europe to Africa by way of the Straits of Gibraltar. Many species
                    belonging to central Europe pass the winter in Spain, especially on the
                    south-eastern coasts and in the valley of the Guadalquivir. Innumerable, for
                    example, are the snipes which in that season are killed in the latter district
                    and brought to tho market of Seville. Among the birds of prey may be mentioned,
                    besides the cinereous and bearded vultures, the Spanish vulture <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gyps occidentalis),</hi> the African or Egyptian vulture <hi
                    rend="italic">(Neophron percnopterus),</hi> which is found among all the
                    mountains of the Peninsula, the Spanish imperial eagle <hi rend="italic">(Aguila
                    adalberti),</hi> the short-toed eagle <hi rend="italic">(Circactus
                    gallicus),</hi> the southern eagle-owl <hi rend="italic">(Bubo
                    atheniensis),</hi> besides various kites and falcons. Among gallinaceous birds,
                    besides the red-legged partridge, which is met with everywhere on the steppes,
                    there are found also the <hi rend="italic">Pterocles alchita</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">P. arenarius</hi>; and from among the birds of other orders
                    thesouthern shrike <hi rend="italic">(Lanius meridionalis),</hi> the Spanish
                    sparrow <hi rend="italic">(Passer cyaneus),</hi> and the blue magpie <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cyanopica cooki)</hi> may be singled out as worthy of mention.
                    The last is highly remarkable on account of its distribution, it being confined
                    to Spain while the species most closely allied to it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cyanopica cyanea)</hi> belongs to the east of Asia. The flamingo is found
                    native in the Balearic Islands and on the southern coasts, and occasionally a
                    stray specimen is to be seen on the tableland of New Castile. Other birds
                    peculiar to the south are two species of quails, the Andalusian hemipode <hi
                    rend="italic">(Turnix sylvatica),</hi> confined to the plains of Andalusia, the
                    southern shearwater <hi rend="italic">(Puffinus cinereuts),</hi> and other
                    water-birds. Amphibians and reptiles are particularly numerous in the southern
                    provinces, and among these the most remarkable are the large southern or eyed
                    lizard <hi rend="italic">(Lacerta ocellata),</hi> which sometimes attains 3 feet
                    in length and is very abundant, the <hi rend="italic">Platydactylus
                    saccicularis,</hi> the. grey amphisbaena <hi rend="italic">(Blanus
                    cinereus),</hi> the European pond-tortoise <hi rend="italic">(Emys
                    europaea),</hi> aud another species, <hi rend="italic">Ernys siegrizii.</hi>
                    Insect life is remarkably abundant and varied. More than 350 species of
                    butterflies, many of them endemic, have been counted in the province of Madrid
                    alone. Besides the ordinary European scorpion, which is generally distributed in
                    southern Europe, there is another species, the sting of which is said to be
                    still more severe, found chiefly in the basin of the Ebro. Trout abound in the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Extent.—</hi> The total area of the mainland of Spain,
                    according to the calculations of Strelbitsky, is 495,612 square kilometres or
                    191,365 square miles, that of the Balearic Islands 4982 square kilometres or
                    1923 square miles, and that of the Canary Islands, which, though belonging
                    geographically to Africa, are administratively associated with the kingdom of
                    Spain, 7611 square kilometres or 2939 square miles; so that the total area of
                    the kingdom is 508,205 square kilometres or 196,225 square miles. This total
                    agrees pretty closely with that in Justus Perthes’s table given below (Table
                    II.), although considerable differences will be observed in the areas assigned
                    to the mainland provinces and the two island groups respectively. The length of
                    the coast-line of the mainland, according to Strelbitsky, is 2662 miles, which
                    is equivalent to 1 mile of coast for every 72 square miles of area, about the
                    same proportion as in France. The greatest length from north-east to south-west
                    is 420 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Territorial Divisions and Population.—</hi> For administrative
                    purposes the kingdom of Spain has since 1833 been divided into forty-nine
                    provinces, forty-seven of which belong to the mainland.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n319/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0319-0298"/> Before 1833 the mainland was divided into
                    thirteen provinces, also enumerated below, which took their names from the
                    ancient kingdoms and principalities out of which the modern kingdom was
                    gradually built up. The present provinces are subdivided into judicial districts
                    (<hi rend="italic">partidos judiciales)</hi> and communes (<hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is probable that the population of Spain attained its highest development
                    during the period of the early Roman empire, when it has been estimated, though
                    of course on imperfect data, to have numbered forty or fifty millions. The best
                    evidence of a dense population in those days is that afforded by the specific
                    estimates of ancient writers for some of the larger cities. The population of
                    Tarraco (Tarragona) was estimated at 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> millions, and that of Nova Carthago (Cartagena),
                    Italica (Sevilla la Vieja), and others at several hundreds of thousands. Emerita
                    Augusta (Merida) had a Roman garrison of 90,000 men, which also implies a large
                    population.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>16,634,345</p>
                <p>The first Spanish census was made in 1594, but some of the provinces now included
                    in the kingdom were for one reason or another not embraced in the enumeration,
                    so that the total population assigned to Spain within its present limits for
                    that date is obtained by adding the results of enumerations at different dates
                    in the provinces then excluded. The total thus arrived at is 8,206,791. No other
                    census took place till 1787, when the total was found to be 10,268,150; and this
                    census was followed by another in 1797, when the population was returned as
                    10,541,221. Various estimates were made within the next sixty years, but the
                    census of 1857 proved that some of these estimates must have been greatly below
                    the truth. The total population then ascertained to exist in Spain was
                    15,464,340, an increase of not much less than 50 per cent. since the census of
                    1797. The last census took place on December 31, 1877, and the total population
                    then ascertained, 16,631,869, shows an increase of only 7 ½ per cent., equal to
                    an annual increase at the rate of 0·35 per cent.—lower than in any other country
                    in Europe except France.</p>
                <p>As Table II. shows, the density of population in Spain as a whole is little more
                    than that of the most thinly peopled county of England in 1881 (Westmoreland, 82
                    to the square mile). Looking at the old provinces, we find that the most thickly
                    peopled are all maritime, and that all the maritime provinces except Andalusia
                    and Murcia have a density exceeding 100 to the square mile. The most densely
                    peopled province of all is not Catalonia, in which manufacturing industries are
                    so highly developed, nor the Basque Provinces with their great iron industry,
                    but Galicia, where there are neither manufactures nor minerals to speak of, but
                    where tillage occupies a relatively larger area than anywhere else in Spain. Of
                    the modern provinces the most thinly peopled are Cuenca and Ciudad Real, in the
                    barren region of the east and south of New Castile, and Albacete in the Murcian
                    steppe, in each case the density being less than half of that of the most thinly
                    peopled English county. The column indicating the increase (or decrease) per
                    cent. of the population between 1857 and 1877 shows that, outside of the
                    province in which the capital is situated, the increase points chiefly to the
                    recent development of manufactures and mining,—to the development of copper
                    mines in Huelva, lead mines in Jaen, iron mines in Vizcaya, cotton manufactures
                    in Barcelona. In Murcia it points no doubt to the great development of the trade
                    in esparto as well as in southern fruits. On the other hand the decrease in
                    Lerida and Gerona indicates how the attraction of higher wages in the
                    manufacturing districts of Catalonia tends to deplete the neighbouring country
                    districts.</p>
                <p>As regards the distribution of population between town and country, Spain
                    contrasts in a marked manner with Italy, Spain having but few large towns and a
                    relatively large country population. In 1877 there were only five towns with
                    more than 100,000 inhabitants:—Madrid (397,816), Barcelona (248,943), Valencia
                    (143,861), Seville (134,318), and Malaga (115,882). Only nine had a population
                    between 50,000 and 100,000, and besides these only 171 had a population above
                    10,000.</p>
                <p>The birth-rate in Spain is 33·9 per thousand as against 35·1 in England and
                    Wales, the death-rate 29·1 (21·4 in England and Wales); the number of marriages
                    per thousand inhabitants was 7·32<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">In all these cases the figures for Spain

                    in England and Wales). The percentage of illegitimacy is 5·6. The number of
                    males born for every 100 females averages 107, a higher proportion than in any
                    other country of Europe for which statistics are obtainable except Greece (112)
                    and Roumania (111).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Possessions.—</hi> The population of the principal
                    foreign possessions of Spain in 1877 numbered 7,822,123, made up as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p>Cuba 1,521,684 ∣ Philippine Islands 5,567,685</p>
                <p>Porto Rico 731,648 ∣ Fernando Po 1,106</p>
                <p>Besides the Philippine Islands in the Eastern Archipelago, Spain possesses the
                    greater part of the Sulu Archipelago, and, in the Pacific, the Marianne, Pelew,
                    and Caroline Islands. Off the Guinea coast she possesses the Island of Annobon
                    as well as that of Fernando Po, and on the coast itself the district round
                    Corisco Bay. She has likewise declared a protectorate over the West African
                    coast between Capes Bojador and Blanco (desert of Sahara). The presidios, whose
                    population is given in Table II., are Peñon de Velez, Alhucemas, and Melila
                    (besides Ceuta).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Agriculture is by far the most important
                    Spanish industry, nearly 73 per cent. of those whose occupations were classified
                    at the census of 1877 being entered under that head. In general it is in a
                    backward condition, and is now much less productive than in the time of the
                    Romans and again under the Moors. The expulsion of the latter people in many
                    places inflicted upon agriculture a blow from which it has not recovered to this
                    day. Aragon and Estremadura, the two most thinly peopled of all the old
                    provinces, and the eastern half of Andalusia (above Seville),<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0320-0299"/> have all suffered particularly in this manner,
                    later occupiers never having been able to rival the Moors in overcoming the
                    sterility of nature, as in Aragon, or in taking advantage of its fertility, as
                    in Andalusia and the Tierra de Barros. The implements in general use are of the
                    rudest description. The plough is merely a pointed stick shod with iron, crossed
                    by another stick which serves as a share, scratching the ground to the depth of
                    a few inches. But the regular import now of agricultural implements (chiefly
                    from England and France) betokens an improvement in this respect. In general
                    there has been considerable improvement in the condition of agriculture since
                    the introduction of railways, and in every province there is a royal
                    commissioner entrusted with the duty of supervising and encouraging this branch
                    of industry. Among other institutions for the promotion of agriculture the royal
                    central school at Aranjuez, to which is attached a model farm, is of special
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The provinces in which agriculture is most advanced are those of Valencia and
                    Catalonia, in both of which the river valleys are thickly seamed with irrigation
                    canals and the hill-slopes carefully terraced for cultivation. In neither
                    province is the soil naturally fertile, and nothing but the untiring industry of
                    the inhabitants, favoured in the one case by the rivers which traverse the
                    province from the tableland of New Castile and the numerous small streams <hi
                    rend="italic">(nacimientos)</hi> that issue from the base of the limestone
                    mountains of which the province is largely composed, and in the other case by
                    the numerous torrents from the Pyrenees, has converted them into two of the most
                    productive regions in Spain. In the Basque Provinces and in Galicia the
                    cultivable area is quite as fully utilized, but in these the difficulties that
                    have to be contended with are not so great. The least productive tracts, apart
                    from Aragon and Estremadura, are situated in the south and east of New Castile,
                    in Murcia, and in Lower Andalusia—the marshes or <hi rend="italic">marismas</hi>
                    of the lower Guadalquivir and the <hi rend="italic">arenas gardas</hi> between
                    that river and the Rio Tinto. By far the greater part of the tableland, however,
                    is anything but fertile, the principal exceptions being the Tierra de Campos,
                    said to be the chief corn-growing district in Spain, occupying the greater part
                    of Palencia in the north-west of Old Castile, and the Tierra de Barros, in the
                    portion of Badajoz lying to the south of the Guadiana in Estremadura, another
                    district noted for its corn.</p>
                <p>Except in Leon and the provinces bordering on the Bay of Biscay and the Atlantic
                    irrigation is almost everywhere necessary for cultivation, at least in the case
                    of certain crops. Almost all kinds of vegetables and garden-fruits, oranges,
                    rice, hemp, and other products are generally grown solely or mainly on irrigated
                    land, whereas most kinds of grain, vines, and olives are cultivated chiefly on
                    dry soil. The water used for irrigation is sometimes derived from springs and
                    rivers in mountain valleys, whence it is conveyed by long canals <hi
                    rend="italic">(acequias)</hi> along the mountain sides and sometimes by lofty
                    aqueducts to the fields on which it is to be used. Sometimes the water of entire
                    rivers or vast artificial reservoirs <hi rend="italic">(pánlanos)</hi> is used
                    in feeding a dense network of canals distributed over plains many square miles
                    in extent. Such plains in Valencia and Murcia are known by the Spanish name of
                    <hi rend="italic">huertas</hi> (gardens), in Andalusia by the Arabic name of <hi
                    rend="italic">vegas,</hi> which has the same meaning. Many of the old irrigation
                    works,—such, for example, as those of the plain of Tarragona,—date from the time
                    of the Romans, and many others from the Moorish period, while new ones are still
                    being laid out at the present day. Where no running water is available for
                    irrigation, water is often obtained from wells by means of waterwheels <hi
                    rend="italic">(glorias)</hi> of simple construction. In most cases such wheels
                    merely have earthenware pitchers attached to their circumference by means of
                    wisps of esparto, and are turned by a horse harnessed to a long arm fitted to a
                    revolving shaft. In recent years many artesian wells have been sunk for
                    irrigation. According to Higgin (see Bibliography), the total area of irrigated
                    land in Spain amounts to 4439 square miles. The effect of irrigation is shown by
                    the fact that the irrigated portion of Murcia has a population of 1681 to the
                    square mile as against 101 for the whole province, and Orihuela a population of
                    767 to the square mile as against 194 for the whole province of Alicante to
                    which it belongs.</p>
                <p>Cereals constitute the principal object of cultivation, and among these wheat
                    ranks first, the next in importance being barley, the chief fodder of horses and
                    mules. Both of these grains are cultivated in all parts—on the plains as well as
                    among the mountains, but chiefly on the more level parts of the two Castiles and
                    Leon, and on the plains of the basin of the Guadalquivir. Oats and rye are
                    cultivated only in the higher parts of the mountains, the former as a substitute
                    for barley in feeding horses and mules, the latter as a breadstuff. Maize also
                    is cultivated in all the provinces; nevertheless the total extent of its
                    cultivation is limited, since, being a summer crop, it requires irrigation
                    except in the Atlantic provinces, and other products generally yield a more
                    profitable return where irrigation is pursued. Rice is cultivated on a large
                    scale only in Valencia. Among cereals of less importance are buckwheat (in the
                    mountainous regions of the north), millets, including both the common millet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Panicum miliaceum)</hi> and the so-called Indian millet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sorghum vulgare,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">joári</hi> of India,
                    the <hi rend="italic">durrah</hi> of Africa), and even (in La Mancha)
                    guinea-corn <hi rend="italic">(Penicillaria spicata).</hi> As to the quantity of
                    cereals produced in the country we are without official information, and the
                    estimates of the average annual production of cereals of all kinds are very
                    discrepant, varying from 250 to 430 million bushels. The average production of
                    wheat alone has been estimated<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">In an article by M. P. A. Delboy in
                    the</hi> Journal of the Statistical Society for <hi rend="italic">March 1S84,

                    rend="italic">September 1883.</hi></p></note> at 177 million bushels, and the
                    average produce of that crop per acre at 11·13 bushels (that of England being
                    about 29 bushels). If these figures can be taken as approximately correct, it
                    follows that the average acreage under wheat in Spain is nearly 16 million
                    acres, or between five and six times the average in Great Britain, which has
                    less than half the area of Spain. The produce per acre just indicated places
                    Spain among those countries of Europe in which the return is least, which is
                    probably fully accounted for by the backward state of cultivation generally and
                    in particular by the small expenditure on manure. As a rule, in fact, the straw
                    left on the ground is the only manure which the land receives.</p>
                <p>The cereal and especially the wheat production of the country regularly furnishes
                    a considerable export. During the five years 1879-83 the value of the export of
                    cereals and pod-fruits of all kinds was nearly 3 per cent. of the total value of
                    the exports; but this export is balanced by a large import, especially of wheat
                    flour. In bad years, indeed, the value of the import under this head greatly
                    exceeds that of the export.</p>
                <p>In the production of pod-fruits and kitchen vegetables Spain is ahead of all
                    other countries in Europe. The chick pea forms part of the daily food of all
                    classes of the inhabitants; and among other pod-fruits largely cultivated are
                    various kinds of beans and pease, lentils <hi rend="italic">(Ervum lens),</hi>
                    Spanish lentils <hi rend="italic">(Lathyrus sativus)</hi> and other species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Lathyrus,</hi> lupines, &amp;c. The principal fodder-crops are
                    lucerne <hi rend="italic">(Medicago saliva)</hi> and esparcette (a variety of
                    sainfoin). Clover, particularly crimson clover (<hi rend="italic">Trifolium
                    incarnatum),</hi> is grown in the northern provinces. Among vegetables garlic
                    and onions take the chief place, and form an indispensable part of the diet of
                    all Spaniards; besides these, tomatoes and Spanish pepper are the principal
                    garden crops. It is upon such crops that the Spanish peasant in general bestows
                    his chief care.</p>
                <p>As regards the quantity of the product wine comes next after cereals among the
                    objects of cultivation in Spain. Here again we are dependent only upon vague
                    estimates of the average amount produced, but usually the average annual Spanish
                    production of wine is estimated at between 440 and 500 million gallons, an
                    estimate which places Spain third (next after France and Italy) among the
                    wine-producing countries of Europe. So far as quantity is concerned the
                    principal wine-producing districts are in the northeast, but the only wines of
                    Spain which have a world-wide reputation are those of the south, and more
                    particularly those which take the name of “sherry,” from the town of Jerez, in
                    the neighbourhood of which they are grown. The total area under the vine is
                    estimated at about 3,480,000 acres (or about 2·8 per cent. of the entire
                    surface), and of this total about 772,700 acres belong to the Catalonian
                    provinces, chiefly Barcelona. The provinces which produce most wine are
                    Barcelona, Saragossa, Cadiz, and Malaga, the annual amount of the production
                    being in the order in which the provinces are mentioned.</p>
                <p>The official tables distinguish the wines exported from Spain as common wines,
                    sherry aud similar wines, and other full-bodied wines <hi rend="italic">(vino
                    generoso).</hi> The returns of recent years, as will be seen from Table III.
                    given below, show that of late an enormous increase has taken place in this
                    export both as regards quantity and value, this increase being chiefly due to

                <p>There is also a large export of grapes and raisins, especially from the southern
                    provinces (Malaga and Almeria). The average quantity of the two together
                    exported in each of the five years<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0321-0300"/> 1879-83 was about 50 millions of kilogrammes (110
                    million lb), the average value about £1,560,000. The vines whose fruit is
                    intended, for table use as grapes or raisins are trained on espaliers or on
                    trees, especially the nettle-tree <hi rend="italic">(Celtis australis).</hi></p>
                <p>Among fruit-trees the first place belongs to the olive, which is estimated to
                    cover about 3 per cent. of the surface, and accordingly about an equal area to
                    that occupied by the vine. Its range in Spain embraces the whole of the southern
                    half of the tableland, the greater part of the Ebro valley, and a small strip on
                    the west coast of Galicia. Along the base of the Sierra Morena from Andujar to
                    the vicinity of Cordova there run regular forests of olives, embracing hundreds
                    of square miles. The annual production of oil is estimated at 55 millions of
                    gallons, and might be greatly increased in quantity and improved in quality if
                    more attention were bestowed upon the cultivation of the trees and the
                    preparation of the oil. Oranges, excluded from the plateau by the severity of
                    the winter cold, are grown in great quantity on the plains of Andalusia and all
                    round the Mediterranean coast; and figs, almonds, pomegranates, carobs, and
                    other southern fruits are also grown abundantly in all the warmer parts, the
                    first two even in central Spain and the more sheltered parts of the northern
                    maritime provinces. In these last, however, the prevailing fruit-trees are those
                    of central Europe, and above all the apple, which is very extensively cultivated
                    in Asturias, the Basque Provinces, and Navarre. The date-palm is very general in
                    the south-eastern half of the kingdom, but is cultivated for its fruit only in
                    the province of Alicante, in which lies the celebrated date-grove of Elche. In
                    the southern provinces flourish also various subtropical exotics, such as the
                    banana, the West Indian cherimoya, and the prickly pear or Indian fig <hi
                    rend="italic">(Opuntia vulgaris),</hi> the last frequently grown as a
                    hedge-plant, as in other Mediterranean countries, and extending even to tho
                    southern part of the tableland. It is specially abundant on the Balearic
                    Islands. The agave or American aloe is cultivated in a similar manner throughout
                    Andalusia. Cotton is now cultivated only here and there in the south; but, on
                    the other hand, sugar-cane, the cultivation of which was introduced by the Arabs
                    in the 12th century or later, and was of great importance in the kingdom of
                    Granada at the time of the expulsion of the Moors at the close of the 15th
                    century, but has since undergone great vicissitudes, first in consequence of the
                    introduction of the cane into America, and afterwards because of the great
                    development of beet-sugar in central Europe, is now becoming every year more and
                    more of a staple in the provinces of Granada, Malaga, and Almeria. The annual
                    production on the Spanish mainland is estimated at about 75,000,000 lb. Such
                    prosperity as this branch of agriculture at present enjoys is largely due to the
                    protection which it receives at the hands of the Spanish Government. A duty
                    imposed on all imported sugars in 1876, while inflicting a severe blow on the
                    Spanish colony of Cuba, has had the desired effect of stimulating the native
                    production, but according to the law at present in force (passed on June 30,
                    1882) the amount of this duty, as far as regards the produce of the Spanish
                    colonies, is being gradually reduced, and the duty will be entirely abolished on
                    July 1, 1892.</p>
                <p>Among the vegetable products not yet mentioned the most important are the
                    mulberry, grown in almost all provinces, but principally in those bordering on
                    the Mediterranean, and above all in Valencia, the chief seat of the Spanish silk
                    production and manufacture; hemp and flax, grown chiefly in Galicia and other
                    northern provinces; among dye-plants, madder, saffron, woad <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Isatis tinctoria),</hi> and wild woad or dyer’s weed <hi rend="italic">(Reseda
                    luteola);</hi> ground-nuts <hi rend="italic">(Arachis hypogaea),</hi> grown for
                    their oil, for the preparation of which the nuts are exported in considerable
                    quantity to France; liquorice, cummin, colocynth, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The rearing of animals has likewise been receiving in recent years increased
                    attention at the hands of both Government and people, though here also we are
                    without recent official statistics to show the consequent advance. The middle of
                    the present century appears to have been the time when this industry was at its
                    lowest point, and the following table (IV.) shows the increase in numbers that
                    has taken place at certain subsequent dates for which official returns or
                    estimates are obtainable :—</p>

                <p>In 1865 horses were reared chiefly in the provinces of Seville, Coruña, and
                    Cadiz, mules in Toledo, Cuenca, Teruel, Saragossa, and Badajoz, asses in
                    Badajoz, Toledo, Murcia, Seville, and Granada, cattle in Oviedo, Coruna, Leon,
                    and Pontevedra, sheep in Badajoz, Leon, Teruel, Soria, and Saragossa, goats in
                    Caceres and Badajoz, camels mainly on the Canary Islands, the total number on
                    the Spanish mainland at the date of the enumeration being less than a hundred.
                    Badajoz was the richest of the provinces in live-stock of all kinds, containing
                    about one-fourteenth of the total number of domestic animals in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>The only animals belonging to Spain still noted for their excellence are mules
                    and asses, which are recognized as the best to be found anywhere. The quality of
                    the horses has been greatly improved, however, since the establishment of
                    Government studs more than forty years ago. Besides the cattle reared throughout
                    the kingdom for field-labour and (in the northern provinces) for regular dairy
                    farming, bulls for the great national pastime of bullfighting are specially
                    reared in many parts of the country, particularly in the forests of Navarre, the
                    mountains separating the two Castiles, the Sierra Morena, and the Serrania de
                    Ronda in Granada, and also in separate enclosures on the islands of the
                    Guadalquivir. Spanish sheep, which in former times enjoyed so high a reputation
                    and formed so important a part of the national wealth, are far from having the
                    same relative importance at the present day, though sheep-rearing also is
                    sharing in the general rise of agricultural and other industries. The most
                    famous breeds of Spanish sheep are the merinos or migrating sheep, which once
                    brought immense revenues to the state as well as to the large proprietors to
                    whom they mostly belonged. These sheep, which are distinguished by their long
                    slim legs and still more by their long wool, are pastured in different districts
                    in summer and winter. Their winter quarters are in the lower parts of Leon and
                    Estremadura, La Mancha, and the lowlands of Andalusia, their summer quarters the
                    more mountainous districts to the east and north (Plasencia in the province of
                    Caceres, Avila, Segovia, Cuenca, Valencia), which are not so much affected by
                    the summer droughts of the Peninsula. The mode of the migration and the routes
                    to be followed are prescribed by law. Each herd consists of about 10,000
                    individuals, under the command of a <hi rend="italic">mayoral,</hi> and is
                    divided into sections containing about 1000 each, each section under the charge
                    of an overseer <hi rend="italic">(capataz),</hi> who is assisted by a number of
                    shepherds <hi rend="italic">(pastores)</hi> attended by dogs. The shepherds,
                    rudely clad in a sleeveless sheepskin jacket, the wool outside, and leather
                    breeches, and loosely wrapped in a woollen mantle or blanket, are one of the
                    most striking and characteristic objects in a Spanish landscape, especially on
                    the tableland. The migration to the summer quarters takes place at the beginning
                    of April, the return at the end of September. At one time the owners of merino
                    herds enjoyed the right of pasturing their herds during their migrations on a
                    strip of ground about 100 yards in breadth bordering the routes along which the
                    migrations took place, a strip which had accordingly to be left uncultivated;
                    but this right (the <hi rend="italic">mesta,</hi> as it was called) was
                    abolished in 1836 as prejudicial to cultivation. Since that date the migrating
                    sheep have been compelled to keep the roads. The average quantity of wool
                    exported in the five years 1879-83 was about 9,000,000 lb. Even in the best of
                    the years (1883-84) the total export of Spanish wool to all countries was only
                    about one-thirtieth of the total average import of that commodity into the
                    United Kingdom during the corresponding period.</p>
                <p>Bees are reared chiefly on the cistus heaths and the districts abounding in <hi
                    rend="italic">tomillares</hi> (see p. 297). The rearing of the silkworm on the
                    mulberry trees of the Mediterranean provinces has already been referred to; the
                    total annual production of raw silk in Valencia is estimated at 1,500,000 lb, in
                    Murcia at 500,000 lb, and in Catalonia at 200,000 lb. The rearing of the
                    cochineal-insect, which was introduced into southern Spain in 1820, is being
                    carried on with more and more success, especially round Malaga, Velez-Malaga,
                    and Motril.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> The catching of tunnies, sardines, anchovies,
                    and salmon on the coasts employs large numbers of fishermen, and the salting,
                    smoking, and packing of the first three give employment to many others. Spanish
                    fishermen likewise dive for coral on the coasts of Andalusia and the north of
                    Africa. The fishermen of Catalonia and Valencia have the greatest reputation for
                    their skill. The centre of the principal tunny fisheries of Spain is a small
                    rocky islet called Cristina about three leagues from the mouth of the Guadiana.
                    The fishing lasts from May to August, that of sardines from August to the end of
                    January. The average value of the export of fish in 1879-83 was nearly
                    £120,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The mineral resources of Spain are vast and
                    varied, but are as yet far from being adequately turned to account. No European
                    country produces so great a variety of minerals in large amount, and in the
                    production of copper ore, lead ore, and quicksilver Spain heads the list. In the
                    production of salt and silver it is excelled only by Austria-Hungary, and, as
                    regards silver, not always even by it. The following table (V.) gives
                    particulars regarding the production of some of the principal minerals in the

                <p>Mercury</p>
                <p>Of the minerals mentioned in the preceding table it will be seen that iron and
                    copper ores are those which show the greatest advance as compared with 1863. The
                    production of these two ores advanced with rapid strides during the ten years
                    1874-1883. In the former year the production of both stood at about 500,000
                    tons. The iron ore is chiefly obtained in Vizcaya and Murcia, the former
                    yielding by far the greatest quantity (in 1883 four-fifths of the total
                    production of Spain), but the latter yielding the best quality (average value of
                    Murcian iron in 1883, 5 pesetas=4s. per ton at the mine, as against 2·25
                    pesetas, or 1s. 9 ½ d., the average for the Vizcayan ore). All except a small
                    fraction of the copper ore is obtained from the province of Huelva, in which lie
                    the well-known mines of Rio Tinto. The lead ore is obtained chiefly in Murcia
                    and Jaen. The famous mines of Linares belong to the latter province.
                    Argentiferous lead is chiefly produced in Almeria, which also produces most of
                    the silver ore of other kinds except argentiferous copper ore, which is entirely
                    obtained from Ciudad Real. The still more celebrated cinnabar (mercury) mines of
                    Almaden, the richest in the world till the discovery of the Californian mines of
                    New Almaden, belong to Ciudad Real, and this province, together with that of
                    Oviedo, furnishes the whole of the Spanish production of this mineral. Spanish
                    salt is partly marine, partly derived from brine-springs and partly from
                    rock-salt, of which last there is an entire mountain at Cardona in Barcelona.
                    Coal is chiefly obtained in Oviedo, Palencia, and Cordova. The production is
                    quite insignificant compared with the extent of the coal-bearing beds, which are
                    estimated to cover an area of about 3500 square miles, of which nearly a third
                    belongs to Oviedo, between one-eighth and one-seventh to Burgos and Soria, and
                    about one-tenth to Teruel and Cordova. Among the less important Spanish minerals
                    are manganese (chiefly in Ciudad Real), antimony, gold, cobalt, sodic sulphate,
                    sulphate of barium (barytes), phosphorite (a valuable manure, a variety of
                    apatite found in Caceres), alum, sulphur, kaolin, lignite, asphalt, besides a
                    variety of building and ornamental stones.</p>
                <p>The total number of mines (including springs for the production of mineral
                    waters) in operation in Spain in 1883 was 2620, and the total number of
                    labourers employed in them in that year was 57,626. The working of the mines is
                    carried on under state supervision. For this purpose the whole kingdom,
                    including the Balearic and Canary Islands, is divided into three sections, and
                    each of these into four districts. Each section is under the charge of an
                    inspector-general of the first class, and each of the districts under an
                    inspector of the second class. By the law of July 6, 1859, a large number of
                    important mines, including all the salt-works and rock-salt mines, were reserved
                    as state property, but financial necessities have compelled the Government to
                    surrender one mine after another, so that at present the state possesses only
                    the cinnabar mines and some salt-works. Many of the mines have been granted to
                    foreign (principally English) companies.</p>
                <p>Of the metallic ores produced in Spain, those of lead and mercury are the only
                    ones which are chiefly reduced in the country. Though the working of iron is an
                    industry of old standing in Spain, and a primitive kind of forge takes its name
                    from Catalonia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Iron),</hi> the total production of
                    iron, refined and unrefined, in Spain in 1883 was only 200,000 tons, and by far
                    the greater part of the Spanish ore is exported, as will be seen by comparing
                    Tables V. and VI. The production of iron in Spain is, however, rapidly and
                    steadily increasing, the total amount in the first year of the decade ending in
                    1883 having been less than 60,000 tons. During the same decade the amount of
                    copper produced in the kingdom increased from about 5000 to 32,000 tons. The
                    amount of steel produced in the kingdom is quite insignificant (little more than
                    400 tons in 1883). The following table (VI.) gives particulars regarding the
                    export of the chief mineral products of Spain in 1883 :—</p>

                <p>The average import per head of population during the same period was as
                    follows:—United Kingdom, 41·7 lb; Holland, 23·6; Switzerland, 18·7; Belgium,
                    9·9; France, 8·2; Germany, 8·2; Spain, 6·0; Austria-Hungary, 4·6; Sweden, 4·6;
                    Italy, 4·0; Russia, 2·9. It thus appears that Spain occupies the seventh place
                    in the consumption of raw cotton, both in absolute amount and relatively to
                    population. In the five years 1874-78 the average import of raw cotton into
                    Spain was 79,690,000 lb, so that the increase of the average in the succeeding
                    period of five years amounted to 25·8 per cent. Nevertheless the products of
                    this branch of industry in the country do not yet suffice to meet the wants of
                    the population. There is every year a considerable import of cotton
                    manufactures, while the export of this commodity is too trifling to be included
                    in the list of chief exports. The maritime provinces, being those most
                    favourably situated for the import of coal, and, where necessary, of raw
                    material, are the chief seats of Spanish manufactures, and the cotton industry
                    is principally centred in Catalonia and, above all, in Barcelona and the
                    surrounding district. This region is indeed the only distinctively manufacturing
                    portion of Spain, and in it also the manufactures of linen and woollen goods and
                    of lace are mainly carried on. Flaxspinning and the manufacture of linen goods
                    are pursued to a considerable extent in Galicia and Asturias. The silk industry,
                    which is likewise of high importance, but inadequate to meet the home demand for
                    silk fabrics, is chiefly centred in Valencia, next to which come Murcia and
                    Seville. Metal industries are chiefly carried on in the Basque Provinces, where
                    various articles in iron and copper are made. A royal factory for the making of
                    artillery and other weapons of war exists at La Trubia, in Asturias. Toledo is
                    still noted, as it has been from the earliest times, for the excellence of its
                    sword-blades. The manufacture of leather, another Spanish industry of old
                    renown, is still extensively carried on in Catalonia and elsewhere, but the
                    making of <hi rend="italic">cordwain</hi> has long ceased to be a specialty of
                    Cordova, from which it takes its name. Boots and shoes and other articles in
                    leather form the only considerable export of manufactured goods. Gloves are made
                    in great quantity in Madrid, shoes in the Balearic Islands. The paper industry
                    is very flourishing, especially in Catalonia and Valencia. Esparto is twisted
                    into cords and ropes, and plaited into a variety of other articles, in Murcia
                    and Alicante and elsewhere. The refining of cane-sugar is largely carried on in
                    Barcelona, Malaga, Almeria, and Granada, and<pb break="no"

                    also is the making of charcoal, which in most parts of Spain takes the place of
                    coal for all ordinary heating purposes, and even in some cases in mechanical
                    industries. The large furnaces for the distillation of mercury at Almaden were
                    at one time, if they are not still, heated solely with charcoal obtained from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cistus ladaniferus.</hi> Among manufacturing industries of
                    less importance are the making of porcelain; (at tho royal factory of Moncloa,
                    near Madrid), glass and earthenware, soap, chocolate, and cork-stoppers. The
                    manufacture of tobacco, which is a royal monopoly, is carried on at seven
                    factories—at Seville, Madrid, Santander, Gijon, Coruna, Valencia, and Alicante,
                    —that of Seville being the largest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Commerce.—</hi> Possessing such varied resources as it
                    does, and being peculiarly favourably situated for commerce, Spain might be
                    expected to take a leading place among the trading communities of Europe. This
                    it did at one time hold, when the treasure acquired by the discovery of America
                    and the conquest of Mexico and Peru was squandered in the purchase of various
                    commodities from England, the Netherlands, and other countries. This period of
                    outward prosperity, however, was also that in which the seeds of decline were
                    planted. The expulsion of the Moors from Granada was contemporaneous with the
                    discovery of the New World. Hundreds of thousands of Moors were driven out from
                    the country on subsequent occasions, and in the act Spain lost the best of her
                    agriculturists and handicraftsmen. For the stay-athome industry by which the
                    resources of the land could be developed as they had been by the Moors the
                    Spaniards of that day had no taste. Excited by the hope of rapidly-acquired
                    wealth and the love of adventure, the more enterprising spirits embarked upon a
                    career of discovery, and agriculture and manufacturing industry fell into
                    contempt. The mercantile supremacy of the country was thus short-lived.
                    Political causes supervened to hasten the country’s decline, and it is only
                    within recent times, since the introduction of railways, that the commerce of
                    the country has begun to revive. The average value of the imports and exports
                    combined during the period of ten years from 1875 to 1884 was equal to rather
                    less than £2 per head,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    head during the same period in the United Kingdom; but even this state of
                    matters shows a considerable advance compared with 1859, when the total value of
                    the exports and imports was equal to only about £1, 12s. per head. The following

                <p>On the average of the five years 1879-83 the principal exports, in the order of
                    their importance, were wine, metals and mineral ores, fruit, oil, and cork,—wine
                    being by far the most valuable; the principal imports, in the order of their
                    importance, raw cotton, brandy and spirits, sugar, machinery, tobacco, coal and
                    coke, timber, cod-fish, iron (wrought and unwrought), hides and skins, chemical
                    products, cocoa, cotton manufactures, and mineral oils. The large imports of
                    cod-fish (from Norway and British North America) are due to the large
                    consumption of fish, especially during Lent; the great demand for mineral oil as
                    a source of light is a consequence of the dearness of coal. It is interesting to
                    note the high place which cocoa takes among the imports. The average import of
                    that commodity is nearly double that of coffee, and that of tea is quite
                    insignificant (in 1884 only 155,777 lbs.).</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of Spain is chiefly carried on with the United Kingdom,
                    France, Cuba, and the United States. In the ten years 1873-82 France, the United
                    Kingdom, and the United States together (in the order named) furnished on an
                    average rather more than 67 per cent. of the imports, and the United Kingdom,
                    France, and Cuba (also in the order named) received on an average during the
                    same period 75 per cent. of the exports. Next to the three countries mentioned,
                    those which had the largest share in the import trade during the same period
                    were Cuba, Portugal, and the Argentine Confederation, and in the export trade
                    Portugal, the United States, and the Argentine Confederation. From the United.
                    Kingdom Spain received in 1884 chiefly coal and coke, iron and articles in iron
                    (articles in wrought-iron and steel, however, in rather greater amount from
                    Belgium), locomotives</p>
                <p>(also from Belgium), jute and jute yarn, hemp and flax yarn, sulphur (for use in
                    the vineyards), and alkaline carbonates; from France, chiefly wool and woollen
                    goods, silk and silk goods, and wheat flour; from the United States, petroleum,
                    raw cotton, and tobacco (also from the Philippine Islands); from Cuba chiefly
                    sugar and fine woods; from the Argentine Confederation chiefly untanned hides
                    and skins and animal fats. Wheat was received chiefly from Russia, and spirits
                    from Germany, which also supplied a large proportion of the sugar consumed in
                    the country.</p>
                <p>Of the principal export of Spain—wine—by far the greater proportion goes to
                    France. In 1884 that country received four-fifths of the common wine, and the
                    quantity is rapidly increasing. The wine classed as full-bodied also went
                    chiefly to France, but that entered under the head of sherry and similar wines
                    was imported chiefly by the United Kingdom. The destination of the minerals is
                    shown above (Table VI.). Oranges were sent mainly to the United Kingdom, France,
                    the United States, and Germany; raisins chiefly to the United States and the
                    United Kingdom; olive oil chiefly to Cuba, Denmark, and France, but in
                    considerable quantity also to other countries; esparto grass almost entirely to
                    England; cork and wool chiefly to Portugal and France; cattle chiefly to
                    Portugal and England; raw silk mainly to France; and wheat flour and chickpease
                    chiefly to the Spanish West Indies.</p>
                <p>The foreign trade of the country is of course carried on mainly by sea. In 1884
                    more than 80 per cent. both of the imports and exports were transmarine, and of
                    the land commerce by far the largest proportion is with or through France. The
                    smallness of the trade with Portugal, which on an average furnished less than 1
                    ½ per cent. of the imports and received less than 5 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> per cent. of the exports during 1873-82,
                    is partly due no doubt to the similarity of the chief products of the two
                    countries, but also to the defectiveness of the communications between the two
                    countries, a circumstance largely accounted for by the physical conditions
                    already alluded to. The introduction of railways has as yet only partially
                    served to bring the countries into more intimate relations. On the first of
                    January 1885 not a single line connected with the general system of Spanish
                    railways entered Portugal north of the Tagus, though Lisbon was connected by
                    rail both with Madrid by way of Caceres and with Valencia by way of Ciudad Real
                    and Albacete. At the date mentioned, however, a railway intended to connect
                    Salamanca with the mouth of the Mondego was in course of construction, and a
                    branch from the Portuguese coast-line in the north was in process of being
                    connected with the Spanish railway to Coruna, aud by way of Leon with other
                    northern seaports.</p>
                <p>The foreign commerce of Spain is greatly hampered by the number and amount of the
                    custom duties, which are imposed on all the principal articles both of export
                    and import. On imports the duties vary from 6 to 28·33 per cent. of the value of
                    the commodities, the highest duties being upon cotton yarn, sugar, and cocoa (to
                    protect home or colonial industries). For protective reasons high import duties
                    are levied also on iron manufactures, woollen manufactures, live animals,
                    coffee, and wine. Export duties are levied mostly in proportion to quantity. In
                    the case of sherry it amounts to 200 pesetas (£8) per hectolitre (22 gallons);
                    full-bodied wines pay 112 pesetas per hectolitre, and ordinary wines 33 pesetas
                    per hectolitre. In the case of “the most favoured” nations slight reductions are
                    made in the amount of the duties, and under a treaty which came into operation
                    on the 15th of August 1886 Great Britain enjoys the benefit of the most favoured
                    nation treatment in consideration of a reduction in the import duties levied at
                    British ports on Spanish wines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shipping and Navigation.—</hi> Relatively to the extent of its
                    coastline and the number and excellence of its seaports (of which there are
                    sixty on the Mediterranean coast, fifty-six on the Atlantic), the amount of
                    shipping belonging to Spain is small. In 1884 the total register· tonnage was
                    524,000 tons, not much more than that of Sweden at the same date, and only about
                    half that of Italy. The number of vessels was 1803, including 301 steamers.
                    Nearly half the transmarine imports (reckoned by value) and 58 per cent. of the
                    transmarine exports were carried under a foreign flag. The following table (IX.)
                    gives further particulars as to the shipping of 1884 :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The communications in Spain have been
                    greatly improved since the beginning of the present century. In 1808 there were
                    little more than 500 miles of carriage roads, but now there are over 28,000. At
                    the end of 1882 14,600 miles were state roads, all well built and well
                    maintained, and 3027 miles of state roads were in course of construction. The
                    aggregate length of the provincial roads then completed was 2714 miles, and that
                    of the communal roads 10,760 miles. In the mountainous districts, where there
                    are only narrow paths, frequently rather steep, it is still not uncommon to meet
                    long trains of mules.</p>
                <p>•Railways have made great advance since the middle of the century. The oldest
                    line is that from Barcelona to Mataro, 17 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles, which was opened on the 28th of October 1848. Of
                    late years railway construction has been going on pretty rapidly. In 1880 the
                    number of miles open for traffic was 4645, and in the four succeeding years it
                    was 4800, 4867, 5118, and 5386. All the Spanish railways belong to private
                    companies, but most of them have obtained subventions from the Government, to
                    which most of the Spanish railways will revert at the end of a term of
                    ninety-nine years. In granting a concession for a new railway the regular
                    practice is to give it to whatever company offers to construct it with the
                    lowest subvention. The total amount of the subventions for railway construction
                    up to the end of 1884 was £25,676,690. For strategical reasons the Spanish gauge
                    was made different from that of France.</p>
                <p>The postal and telegraphic systems have been placed on the same footing as in
                    other civilized countries. The total number of 'letters, post-cards, and samples
                    (including official and international letters, &amp;c.) that passed through the
                    post office in 1882-83 was 111 millions. The length of state telegraphic lines
                    on January 1, 1883 was 10,664 miles, and of wires 25,989 miles. The number of
                    messages in 1883 was 3,020,000, nearly 80,000 being transit messages and 654,000
                    from or to foreign countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Army and Navy.—</hi> Military (or naval) service is obligatory
                    on all Spaniards, but in certain cases recruits are allowed to buy themselves
                    off. According to the law of January 8, 1882, the period of service for all arms
                    is twelve years, of which three years must be passed with the colours, three
                    years in the active reserve, and six years in the second reserve. The minister
                    of war is empowered, however, on financial grounds to transfer troops serving
                    with the colours to the active reserve before the period of three years’ service
                    has been fulfilled. Liability to service begins with the first day of the
                    calendar year in which the twentieth year is completed. Persons holding a civil
                    appointment or pursuing any handicraft independently are allowed to buy
                    themselves off for 1500 pesetas (£60), and brothers are allowed to take each
                    others’ place in service, or to exchange the numbers that have fallen to them by
                    lot in the raising of the recruits for the year. For carrying out the law Spain
                    is divided into fourteen military districts, the boundaries of which do not at
                    all coincide with those of provinces.</p>
                <p>The actual strength of the regular army is fixed at about 94,000 men for the
                    kingdom (including the Balearic and Canary Islands), but this number may be
                    brought up to 400,000 in time of war. The strength of the regular army in Cuba
                    is about 22,500 men, in Porto Rico about 3200, and on the Philippine Islands
                    about 8200. The active army is divided into 140 battalions, besides the same
                    number of depôt and reserve battalions; 24 cavalry regiments, and the same
                    number of depot squadrons and reserve cavalry regiments;</p>
                <p>9 regiments of field artillery, and 3 of mounted artillery, besides 6 reserve
                    regiments of artillery, and 10 battalions of engineers. There are also 13
                    battalions of fortress artillery.</p>
                <p>The following statement shows the strength of the navy in 1885 :— <hi
                    rend="italic">First Class—</hi> 4 ironclad frigates (55 guns), 4 screw frigates
                    (97 guns), 6 cruisers (48 guns); <hi rend="italic">Second Class—</hi> 5 frigates
                    (104 guns),</p>
                <p>3 cruisers, 12 corvettes and troopships (39 guns); <hi rend="italic">Third
                    Class—</hi> 1 ironclad monitor (3 guns), 1 floating battery, 79 gunboats,
                    transports, &amp;c. (124 guns).</p>
                <p>There were at the same time building one ironclad of the first class, five
                    cruisers of the second class, besides torpedo boats, tugs, and other vessels.
                    For the defence of the colonies, and more particularly those of the West Indies,
                    there are thirty-five screw gunboats, all of the same size (about 5 feet
                    draught), and each carrying a 100-pounder pivot-gun at the bow.</p>
                <p>The navy is manned by conscription in the maritime districts. In 1885 the number
                    of seamen was about 14,000, that of marines about 7000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> Roman Catholicism is the established religion,
                    and the church and clergy are maintained by the state. The immense majority of
                    the people (in 1877 16,603,959 out of a total of 16,634,345) are professed
                    adherents of this faith, so that, so far as numbers go, Spain is still the most
                    “Catholic” country in the world, as it has long been styled. According to
                    Willkomm, however, religious indifferentism is now very general, not only among
                    the educated but also among the lower classes; and of the bigotry and fanaticism
                    which in former times led to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of victims
                    at the hands of the Inquisition the only traces at the present day are to be
                    found, says the same authority, in the provinces of Aragon, Navarre, and
                    Estremadura, where the clergy still exercise a considerable influence over the
                    lower orders. By the constitution of 1876 non-Catholics are permitted to
                    exercise their own forms of worship, but they must do so in private and without
                    making any public announcement of their services. At the census of 1877 the
                    total number of Protestants was 6654, a number below that of those entered as
                    rationalists (9645). There are nine archbishoprics (Toledo, Madrid, Burgos,
                    Granada, Santiago, Saragossa, Seville, Tarragona, Valencia, and Valladolid) and
                    forty-five bishoprics. The archbishop of Toledo is primate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> By the law of July 17, 1857, primary education
                    was declared compulsory on all children of school age (originally fixed at six
                    to nine) and made free to the poor, but the results of the census of 1877,
                    though showing an advance in elementary education as compared with previous
                    years, makes it clear that this law is far from being efficiently carried out.
                    At that date the total number who could both read and write was 4,071,823, equal
                    to 24·48 per cent. of the population, as against 19·97 per cent. in 1860. The
                    provinces in which the percentage of those able to read and write was greatest
                    were Alava, Burgos, Pontevedra, Madrid, Santander; those in which it was least
                    were the Canary Islands, Granada, Malaga, Almeria, Alicante, Castellon.</p>
                <p>There are ten universities—those of Madrid (founded in 1836 to replace the
                    long-celebrated university of Alcala), Barcelona, Granada, Salamanca, Seville,
                    Valencia, Santiago, Saragossa, Valladolid, and Oviedo; that of Madrid is now the
                    most celebrated and the best attended, while that of Salamanca, so renowned in
                    the Middle Ages, is now in least repute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Administration.—</hi> Spain is an hereditary
                    monarchy, the constitution of which rests on the fundamental law of June 30,
                    1876. The sovereign becomes of age on completing his or her sixteenth year. The
                    sovereign is grand-master of the eight Spanish orders of knighthood, the
                    principal of which is that of the Golden Fleece (Toison de Oro), founded in 1431
                    by Philip of Burgundy. The chain of this order surrounds the royal arms, in
                    which are included, besides the arms of Castile, Leon, Granada, and the lilies
                    of the royal house of Bourbon, the arms of Austria, Sicily, Savoy, Brabant, and
                    others. The national colours are red and yellow. The flag is divided into three
                    horizontal stripes—two red stripes, with a yellow one between bearing the royal
                    arms.</p>
                <p>The legislative authority is exercised by the sovereign in conjunction with the
                    <hi rend="italic">cortes,</hi> a body composed of two houses—a senate<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0325-0304"/> and a chamber of deputies. The senate is composed
                    of members of three classes:—(1) members by right of birth or office—princes,
                    the wealthier nobles holding the rank of grandee <hi rend="italic"
                    >{grande),</hi> a dignity conferred by the king either for life or as an
                    hereditary honour, and the highest state officials; (2) members nominated by the
                    king for life; and (3) members elected by the state corporations and by the most
                    highly taxed subjects of the state for a period of five years. The members
                    belonging to the first two classes must not exceed 180 in number, and there may
                    be the same number of members of the third class. The chamber of deputies
                    consists of members elected for five years, in the proportion of one deputy for
                    every 50,000 of the population. The electors must be twenty-five years of age
                    and must have paid land-tax of twenty-five pesetas (£1) for one year, or an
                    industrial tax of fifty pesetas for two years.</p>
                <p>The executive administration is entrusted to a responsible ministry <hi
                    rend="italic">{consejo de ministros),</hi> in which the presidency belongs
                    either to one of the ministers or to a president without portfolio. There are
                    eight ministerial departments—the first secretaryship of state, to which belongs
                    the management of foreign affairs, the secretaryships of grace and justice,
                    finance, and the interior, the department for the promotion of material and
                    intellectual interests <hi rend="italic">{secretaria de fomento),</hi> and the
                    secretaryships of war, marine, and the colonies.</p>
                <p>The civil administration is under the secretary for the interior. In each
                    province is a civil governor nominated by the crown, and the governor presides
                    over a council, the members of which are elected by the representatives of each
                    commune <hi rend="italic">{ayuntamiento).</hi><hi rend="italic">Law and
                    Justice.—</hi> Spanish law is founded on the Roman law, the Gothic common law,
                    and the national code proclaimed at the meeting of the cortes at Toro in 1501
                    (the leyes <hi rend="italic">de Toro).</hi> There is a court of first instance
                    in each of the 501 <hi rend="italic">partidos judiciales</hi> into which the
                    kingdom is divided; and a court of second instance in each of 15 <hi

                    >partidos judiciales</hi> are grouped; aud there sits at Madrid a supreme court
                    modelled on the French <hi rend="italic">cour de cassation,.</hi> The
                    administration of justice is public. Except in commercial cases the parties to a
                    suit must always be represented by sworn counsel (<hi rend="italic">abogados

                    XI.) shows the equivalent in English money of the budget estimates for the years
                    noted; it should be explained, however, that these estimates have only a limited
                    value, inasmuch as the public accounts of Spain have not been audited since
                    1870, and have not been passed by the cortes since 1867 :—</p>

                    but, as it was by that time manifest that Spain was unable to meet the
                    obligations thus incurred, an arrangement was come to by which the capital and
                    interest of the debt were reduced. The bulk of the debt now bears interest at
                    the rate of 4 per cent., and on the 1st of October 1884 the capital stood at
                    6356 million pesetas, or £254,250,000, and the total annual charge was 238
                    million pesetas, or £9,522,857. The principal items are the perpetual foreign
                    debt, amounting in October 1884 to £78,840,000, a perpetual internal debt,
                    amounting in October 1884 to £77,840,000, aud a redeemable debt (internal and
                    external) amounting to £70,480,000.</p>

                <p>To the Greeks Spain, or rather its coast-line on the Mediterranean, was known
                    vaguely as Iberia, a name we meet with in Herodotus (i. 163) in connexion with
                    the Phoenician Tartessus, which is generally understood to have been the country
                    about the mouth of the Guadalquivir and to be the Tarshish of Scripture. It was
                    the Phocaeans, a branch of the Ionian Greeks settled in Asia Minor, who
                    according to Herodotus first opened up to the</p>
                <p>Greek world this remote region of the extreme West, which had hitherto been a
                    land of mystery and enchantment, imagined to be the home of the setting sun, and
                    known only by the reports of adventurous Phoenician mariners. The hero-god
                    Hercules, it was fabled, had left traces of his presence and mighty working
                    here, and the twin rocks at the entrance of the Mediterranean were called by his
                    name, “the Pillars of Hercules,”—the “world’s end” to the Greeks, nothing but
                    the all-encircling ocean-river lying beyond. The Greeks seem to have planted no
                    colonies in Spain, with the exception of Emporium, on the coast just under the
                    eastern spur of the Pyrenees, founded probably from Massilia (Marseilles) by the
                    Phocaeans, and perhaps of Saguntum. In fact they had but very hazy notions about
                    the country, and Iberia, as they called it, was to them little more than a name
                    for an indefinite extent of territory in the Far West, in the occupation of<pb

                    Phoenician settlements for the purposes of trade on its southern coasts. Several
                    of these places were just known to them by name; but even of Gades, rich and
                    populous as it seems to have been in quite early days, nothing but vague hearsay
                    had reached them, and Herodotus, who mentions it as Gadeira (iv. 8), merely
                    defines its position as “on the ocean outside of (beyond) the Pillars of
                    Hercules.” Tarraco, one of the oldest and most important of the cities of Spain,
                    and one of which we hear continually in the subsequent history of the country,
                    was also in all probability a Phoenician colony. There are still here remains of
                    very ancient walls, possibly Phoenician work. Gades, Tartessus, Tarraco, all
                    seem to have been of Phoenician origin<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Greeks first made a slight acquaintance with them,—an acquaintance, however,
                    which they did not follow up. The result is that we really know nothing about
                    Spain till the first war between Rome and Carthage (264-241 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>). There was indeed, in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> an embassy to Alexander the Great from the remote West, of Gauls and
                    Iberians, and from that time learned Greeks began to discuss the geography of
                    Spain. But again the country drops out of sight till the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when we find a close connexion established between
                    it and Carthage, which, being itself a Phoenician colony, would feel itself
                    almost at home on the southern shores of Spain. According to Polybius, Carthage
                    (before the First Punic War) had acquired at least something like a protectorate
                    over the Iberian tribes as far as the Pyrenees, the then recognized boundary
                    between the Iberians and Celts,—between, in fact, Spain and Gaul. Spanish troops
                    served as volunteers in Carthaginian armies. There must have been a good deal of
                    Phoenician blood in the south of Spain for many centuries, and this no doubt
                    prepared the way for Carthaginian ascendency in the country. Not, however, till
                    after the First Punic War and the loss of Sicily was there anything that could
                    be called a Carthaginian empire in Spain. It was in 237 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> that Hamilcar Barca, the father of Hannibal, crossed the Straits of
                    Gibraltar and set foot in Spain, not, however, with any commission from the home
                    Government at Carthage, but with the deliberately formed design of making the
                    country, with its warlike population and great mineral wealth, into a
                    Carthaginian province, and ultimately into a basis of operations in a future war
                    with Rome (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilcar, Hasdrubal, Hannibal).</hi> There
                    were rich mines in the mountains, which had drawn the Phoenicians some way into
                    the interior, and among the native tribes there were the elements of a brave and
                    hardy soldiery. A good army might very well be organized and paid out of the
                    resources of Spain. All this Hamilcar clearly saw, and in the true spirit of a
                    statesman he set himself to the work, not merely of subjugating the country, but
                    of making the Spaniards into loyal subjects of Carthage. He encouraged marriages
                    between his officers and soldiers and the native women: his own son Hannibal
                    married a Spanish woman. He showed them how to work their gold and silver mines
                    to the best advantage; in every way, in short, he made them feel that he was
                    their friend. The great work of which he had laid the foundation was carried on
                    after his death in 228 by his son-in-law Hasdrubal, under whom New Carthage,
                    with its fine harbour, founded probably by Hamilcar, became the capital of the
                    country. It would seem that by this time the Carthaginian empire in Spain was as
                    firmly established over the southern half of the country as the fickle and
                    uncertain temper of the native tribes would admit. The</p>
                <p>Spaniard of that day, as indeed more or less throughout his whole history, was
                    particularly amenable to personal influence, and an Hamilcar or a Hannibal could
                    sway him as he pleased. From 228 to 221 Hasdrubal was extending and
                    strengthening the Carthaginian rule in Spain, while the Romans were fighting in
                    Cisalpine Gaul. One precaution, indeed, they had taken, an understanding with
                    Hasdrubal, which might be regarded as a treaty, that the Carthaginian conquests
                    were not to be pushed east of the Ebro. West of that river there was one town,
                    Saguntum, a Greek colony, in alliance with Rome; this Hasdrubal had spared. His
                    successor, Hannibal, after two years’ continuous fighting, which resulted in the
                    submission of hitherto unconquered tribes and the undisputed supremacy of
                    Carthage throughout almost all Spain, attacked and took the place in 218.</p>
                <p>This was the beginning of the Second Punic War. Spain was now for the first time
                    entered by Roman armies, under the command of the two Scipios,—the brothers
                    Cneius and Publius. Six years of hard fighting ended in the defeat and death of
                    these two brave men, but in 210 the son of Publius, the elder Africanus, struck
                    a decisive blow at the Carthaginian power in Spain by the sudden capture of New
                    Carthage. The war, however, still dragged on till 205, in which year it may be
                    said that Spain, or at least that part of it which had been under Carthage, was
                    fairly conquered by the arms of Rome. Andalusia, Granada, Murcia, Valencia,
                    Catalonia, Aragon, may be said to have become Roman territory. Rome had now to
                    deal simply with the native Spaniards, without the fear of any foreign
                    interference. Hence from 205 the reduction of the country into a Roman province
                    was only a matter of time. It proved, however, to be a tedious and troublesome
                    work, and more than once Rome’s hold on Spain was seriously imperilled. An
                    oppressive governor, or a governor without tact and sympathy, was sure to
                    unsettle the restless and impressionable tribes, and to stir up all manner of
                    dangerous jealousies and heart-burnings. The Scipios, the elder Africanus
                    especially, knew how to manage the people, and yet even in 205, the year of
                    those brilliant successes of Africanus, there was a great rising of several of
                    the tribes, headed by a local chieftain, against the dominion of Rome. It was
                    quelled after a sharp engagement; there was a general submission on the part of
                    the Spaniards, and many of them became Roman tributaries. It was some time,
                    however, before the country, or even the southern half of it, was really subdued
                    into complete peace and order. The mountains and the forests were a formidable
                    obstacle to the Roman legions, and favoured that guerilla warfare which makes
                    conquest slow and laborious. For a long period many of the tribes were rather
                    the allies and dependants of Rome than her subjects, and might at any moment be
                    roused into war. In fact, Rome’s dominion west of the Ebro—Further Spain
                    (Hispania Ulterior), as the province was called—must for very many years have
                    been little more than nominal. Rome’s policy was to keep the native tribes
                    disunited, and to have as many of them as possible under a friendly
                    protectorate. There seem to have been wide differences between these
                    tribes,—some, especially those in the interior and in the north, being fierce
                    and utterly barbarous, and others in the south and south-west comparatively mild
                    and civilized. The Celtiberi, in the interior, were a group of warlike tribes,
                    and were always uncertain and intractable. At one time they would fight for
                    Rome; at another they would serve as mercenaries for Rome’s bitter foe, the
                    Carthaginian. Continually were they breaking out into revolt and defying the
                    arms of Rome. The “Celtiberian War” often figures in the pages of Roman
                    histories, and it generally meant a war<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0329-0306"/> involving the greater part of Spain. In 195 the
                    elder Cato had to put down a rising in the country, in which the Celtiberi took
                    the lead, but he offered them favourable terms, and showed himself particularly
                    anxious to conciliate them. His Spanish campaigns were so far a success as to
                    establish the Roman power east of the Ebro, and along with peace and order came
                    better administration and a development of the resources of the district now
                    known as Hither Spain (Hispania Citerior). Cato is said to have disarmed the
                    inhabitants of this part of Spain, and to have even compelled the Spaniards,
                    from the Pyrenees to the Guadalquivir, to pull down their fortifications, but
                    still the smouldering fires of rebellion were not trampled out. Some few years
                    afterwards, in 179 and 178, we find the father of the famous Gracchi governor of
                    Hither</p>
                <p>Spain, and fighting with the troublesome Celtiberi, winning victories over them,
                    capturing one hundred and three of their towns, and then securing his conquests
                    by showing himself as great in peace as he had been in war. He seems to have
                    anticipated in Spain the work attempted by his sons in Italy, making grants of
                    land on favourable conditions to the poorer natives. Much must have been
                    accomplished by Gracchus towards producing contentment with the Roman rule, but
                    in the west, in the valleys of the Douro and the Tagus, and in the region known
                    as Lusitania, answering to Portugal, there seems to have been almost incessant
                    fighting, and what one general won another general often lost. Under Mummius, a
                    governor of Further Spain (154),—the Mummius who in 146 took and sacked
                    Corinth,—the Romans suffered a disastrous defeat from the Lusitanians, of which
                    the Celtiberi took prompt advantage, and there was another Roman defeat, with a
                    massacre of Roman citizens in one of the towns of the interior. These losses
                    were avenged in 152 by Claudius Marcellus, grandson of Hannibal’s illustrious
                    antagonist, during whose command in Spain Corduba is said to have been
                    established as a Roman colony. Marcellus was too humane and considerate to the
                    Spaniards to suit the ideas of the Roman senate, which we may well suppose to
                    have been greatly provoked by the trouble which Spain had given them. The new
                    governors, Lucius Lucullus and Servius Galba, by a combination of perfidy and
                    extortion, drove the country into a most formidable revolt, with which the
                    Romans, whose hands were tied by the Third Punic War, could not for some time
                    effectually deal. A guerilla chief of Lusitania (which had been specially
                    ill-treated by the Romans), Viriathus, headed the revolt, and from 147 to 140
                    army after army of the Romans was cut to pieces; the formidable Celtiberi had
                    joined his standard, and Spain seemed well-nigh lost to Rome. A treaty was even
                    extorted by Viriathus from one of the Roman commanders, declaring the
                    independence of the Lusitanians, and it is said to have been acknowledged and
                    accepted by the senate. The brave man, however, could not hold together his
                    fickle Spanish levies, and he fell at last by native treachery, encouraged by or
                    at least connived at by the Romans. The Celtiberi, however, were still in arms;
                    the strong city of Numantia, the capital of the Arevaci, the most powerful
                    Celtiberian tribe, witnessed more than once the defeat of a Roman consul before
                    its walls (141 to 140). The besieging army became despondent and demoralized,
                    and its commander, supplies failing him, had to retire, leaving his sick and
                    wounded behind him. It was humiliation indeed for Rome to be thus baffled by a
                    half-barbarous country-town of no great size, in the interior of Spain. She now
                    sent her best general, the younger Scipio, into the country, and in 133 the
                    capture and destruction of Numantia gave Rome a hold over the inland district of
                    Spain which she had never before had (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Scipio).</hi> The
                    province of Hither Spain was rendered safe from Celtiberian incursions. Shortly
                    afterwards Lusitania and its towns, after some obstinate fighting, were reduced
                    to submission by the consul Junius Brutus, and thus Spain, with the exception of
                    its northern coasts, the home of its most barbarous tribes, was nominally Roman
                    territory. There must have been by this time a considerable mixture of Roman
                    blood with the native population; there were several towns—Carteia, Valentia,
                    Tarraco especially among them—with a Latin municipal constitution and with a
                    number of Latinspeaking people. The growth of Roman civilization had fairly
                    begun, and it was promoted by a commission sent out by the senate after Scipio’s
                    victories. Piracy in the Mediterranean was checked in the interest of native
                    Spanish commerce, and the Roman administration generally favoured the
                    development of the country’s prosperity. The extensive mountain districts were
                    still the shelter of banditti, but, on the whole, order was well maintained, and
                    Spain from this time flourished under Roman rule. It abounded in flocks and
                    herds, and had a number of thriving populous towns, particularly on its
                    Mediterranean shores. It seems, too, that it was never oppressed and
                    impoverished by some of those forms of tribute,—such as the exaction of a tenth
                    of the produce,·—under which many of Rome’s provincials smarted. Fixed money
                    payments, and military service in the Roman armies, were the chief burdens which
                    the conquered Spaniards had to bear. Rome on the whole, by comparison, dealt
                    tenderly with them. Several of their towns had the privilege of coining the
                    silver money of Rome; and the flourishing cities along the Mediterranean coast,
                    which were so many centres of civilization to the adjacent districts, were
                    treated rather as allies than as subjects. In these parts the Romanizing process
                    went on rapidly and under favourable conditions, while the west and the north
                    and a great portion of the interior remained barbarous, and Roman merely in
                    name. In 105 it seemed possible that the Romans might be utterly swept out of
                    the country; in that year a great wave of invasion passed over the inland
                    regions from the Cimbri, who had destroyed two Roman consular armies on the
                    Rhone. Spain to a great extent was cruelly ravaged, and Rome was too seriously
                    menaced by the barbarians nearer home to be able to protect her. The country was
                    saved by the brave Celtiberi, whose determined resistance forced the Cimbri back
                    upon GauL</p>
                <p>Again in 97 and 96 we hear of a rising of these same Celtiberians against Rome,
                    and of campaigns in the interior, in which for the first time we meet the name
                    of the famous Sertorius, a name almost as conspicuous in ancient Spanish history
                    as that of Hamilcar or Hannibal. For the remarkable episode of the eight years’
                    wars of Sertorius in Spain' against the generals of Sulla and against the great
                    Pompey, and his almost successful attempt to render the country independent of
                    the home Government at Rome, we must refer the reader to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sertorius.</hi> It was to his skill in winning the hearts of
                    the Spaniards, more even than to his very considerable military ability, that he
                    owed his successes. Rome was financially most grievously embarrassed by this
                    tedious and difficult war, and Spain, with its Roman civilization and its
                    Latinized towns on the Mediterranean, suffered severely. By the year 71 the
                    country had been reconquered by Pompey for Rome, and the two provinces of Hither
                    and Further Spain were reorganized under a somewhat more stringent rule, the
                    tribute in some districts of the latter province being raised, and some of the
                    towns in both losing their municipal independence. In 61 the great Caesar was
                    governor of Further Spain, and carried the arms of Rome into the<pb break="no"

                    north-west, the country of the Lusitanians and of the Gallaeci, and with a fleet
                    from Gades is said to have occupied a point in the north-west answering to
                    Coruna. But he was too short a time in Spain to reduce these barbarous regions
                    to permanent subjection, and the work still remained to be accomplished. In the
                    civil war with Pompey in 49 he was in Hither Spain, winning decisive victories
                    over Pompey’s generals, Afranius and Petreius. Once more, in 45, he had to enter
                    Further Spain at the head of an army, and to defeat his rival’s sons at Munda,
                    somewhere probably in the neighbourhood of Cordova, a victory which made him
                    undisputed master of the Roman world. Spain, however, the northern part at
                    least, was not thoroughly subdued—“pacified,” in Roman phrase, —till the reign
                    of Augustus, whose ambition it was to advance the boundaries of empire to the
                    ocean. In the north was a wild and warlike highland population, a collection of
                    tribes known as the Astures in the northwest, and their neighbours the Cantabri
                    to the east, between a mountain range and the coast, “the last,” as Gibbon says
                    <hi rend="italic">(Decline and Fall,</hi> ch. i.), “to submit to the arms of
                    Rome and the first to throw off the yoke of the Arabs.” Caesar’s flying visit in
                    61 had done something to cow these tribes, but ever and again they would assert
                    their independence. In 27 the emperor Augustus himself penetrated their
                    strongholds, and he passed two years in Spain; decisive victories were won over
                    the northern tribes, and their towns and villages were converted into military
                    posts in the occupation of the legionary veterans. Such was the origin of
                    Saragossa, a modern survival of the name of Caesar Augusta then given to an old
                    town on the Ebro, henceforth an important Roman centre in Spain. The successes
                    of Augustus were commemorated by the same title bestowed on other ancient
                    Spanish towns, Bracara Augusta (Braga) in the north-west, Asturica Augusta
                    (Astorga) still further north, Emerita<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    city of the first class,—“the Rome of Spain,” as it has been called,—and Pax
                    Augusta, perhaps the modern Badajoz. The work of consolidating the Roman
                    dominion in Spain was completed in 19 by his friend and minister, Marcus
                    Agrippa, and now at last the “Cantaber non ante domabilis,” as Horace has it,
                    acknowledged Rome’s supremacy. Spain was fairly conquered; the warlike peoples
                    of the north were cowed and broken; the south was thoroughly Romanized, the
                    population having adopted Latin manners and the Latin tongue. Some of the best
                    specimens of Roman architecture, some of the finest Roman coins, have been
                    discovered in the cities of Spain, which from the time of Augustus became
                    rapidly prosperous, and were famous for their schools and their scholars. Spain,
                    in fact, was more completely Roman than any province beyond the limits of Italy.
                    The country which had hitherto harassed Rome with incessant risings and
                    insurrections was at last peaceful and contented, a happy land which for the
                    next 400 years may be said to have had at least no military history.</p>
                <p>Under Augustus the old political constitution into two provinces, Further and
                    Hither Spain, of which the Ebro had been the boundary, was set aside, and
                    exchanged for a division into the three provinces of Lusitania, Baetica, and
                    Tarraconensis, sometimes spoken of as the “Three Spains.” Of these Baetica, so
                    called from the Baetis (the Guadalquivir), and answering nearly to Andalusia
                    inclusive of Granada, was the smallest; Tarraconensis, which embraced Hither
                    Spain and the interior and all the north, was much the largest. Lusitania
                    corresponds to modern</p>
                <p>Portugal. The centres of administration were—for Tarraconensis, Tarraco; for
                    Baetica, Corduba; for Lusitania, Emerita Augusta. We may see, in part, on what
                    principles this division of the country was adopted. Lusitania and Baetica had
                    tolerably distinct features, the latter having been from the earliest times the
                    most civilized and the most tractable district of Spain. North of the Tagus came
                    a much wilder region, the home of excitable and warlike tribes; this in great
                    part, so as to include the country of the Celtiberi, was thrown into
                    Tarraconensis, which, and also Lusitania, were under the empire “Caesaris
                    provinciae,” the governors of them being nominated by the emperor. The smaller
                    and quieter province of Baetica was a “senate’s province ”; and its finances
                    were under the charge of the old republican official known as a “quaestor.” The
                    governor of Tarraconensis seems to have held decidedly the first position in the
                    country; he had as a matter of course the greater part of the army under his
                    command, and he was usually, it may be presumed, an ex-consul. The governorship,
                    indeed, of this province must have been one of the best appointments in the
                    emperors’ gift.</p>
                <p>Under the empire Spain was divided for the general purposes included under the
                    head of local administration into fourteen “conventus,” that is, provincial
                    parliaments or assemblies made up of a union or combination of so many
                    communities or townships. The town or city which was the centre of each
                    “conventus” was the place where justice was administered to the inhabitants of
                    the district, and would, so far, answer to our assize-town. In Tarraconensis
                    there were seven of these “conventus,”—Tarraco, New Carthage, and Caesar Augusta
                    being the chief; in Baetica, four,—Gades and Corduba being of the number; in
                    Lusitania, the least populous and civilized district, three —Emerita Augusta the
                    principal, Pax Julia, perhaps the modern Beja, and Scalabis not far from the
                    mouth of the Tagus. Pliny (the elder), to whom we are indebted for these
                    details, enumerates 360 cities in Spain in the time of Vespasian. These included
                    every variety of township,— the “colonia” which originated in a camp or a
                    settlement granted to old soldiers, the town whose inhabitants had all been made
                    Roman citizens in the fullest sense (“municipium” in Roman phrase, under the
                    empire), the town that had the inferior franchise (“jus Latii”), the “free
                    town,” which might at any time have its freedom taken from it, and the
                    “tributary” town (“civitas stipendiaria”). Spain presented types of all these
                    various communities till Vespasian, it is said, gave them all the “jus Latii,”
                    which opened an easy door for the provincials to the full privileges of
                    citizenship. A native-born Spaniard might now rise to the imperial dignity, as
                    Trajan did; and the Spaniards generally must have felt themselves to all intents
                    and purposes Romans.</p>
                <p>The provincial constitution of Spain was revised and modified to some extent in
                    the 2d century in the time, it would seem, of the Antonines and Hadrian. The
                    vast and unwieldy province of Tarraconensis was subdivided, and the divisions
                    distinguished as Gallaecia (the north-west), Carthaginiensis with New Carthage
                    for its capital, Tarraconensis (the old name being then still retained for one
                    division) with Caesar Augusta for its capital, and the Balearic Isles, which had
                    always been regarded as Spanish territory. Constantine accepted this
                    arrangement, including, however, in it a strip of the western coast of Africa,
                    part of the old Mauritania, which, from an ancient Moorish town, Tinge
                    (Tangier), took the name of Tingitana among the later Roman provinces.</p>

                    in fact, to the peace and prosperity of the country during 400 years. With the
                    departure of the Franks Spain soon recovered herself, and when we next hear of
                    her early in the 5th century we find commerce and civilization well established,
                    and cities ranking among the finest and richest in the Roman world. In 409,
                    however, the year of the sack of Rome under Alaric, a tide of barbarism swept
                    over the country; Suevi, Alani, Vandals “ravaged," says a writer of the time,
                    quoted by Gibbon (ch. 31), “with equal fury the cities and the open country.”
                    Spain, long so quiet and prosperous, was brought down to the lowest depth of
                    misery. At this point the precise order of events is not quite clearly
                    ascertainable. It seems that in 414 or 415 a Visigothic host entered Spain under
                    their king, Ataulphus, Alaric’s successor by election, who had married Placidia,
                    the sister of Honorius, emperor of the West, son of the great Theodosius.
                    Ataulphus was now Rome’s ally, and fought as her champion in Spain against Suevi
                    and Vandals. A new era seemed to have opened, and we may see in this alliance a
                    prophecy of the ultimate fusion of Latin and German peoples,—the beginnings, in
                    fact, of the modern world. To Ataulphus, who was murdered at his new capital
                    Barcelona, succeeded after a brief interval in 415 Walia, a warlike and
                    ambitious chief, who may be said to have established the Visigothic or
                    West-Gothic kingdom in Spain on the ruins of the old Roman province. Walia
                    concluded a treaty with the emperor Honorius, and, putting himself at the head
                    of his brave Goths, in a three years’ war he destroyed or drove into remote
                    corners the barbarous hordes of Vandals, Alani, and Suevi that had settled down
                    in the country. Spain, thus reconquered, was nominally subject to Rome, but soon
                    became really independent and began to be the seat of a Christian
                    civilization.</p>

                    West-Goths.</hi></p>
                <p>The West-Gothic or Visigothic kingdom in Spain, founded by Walia, lasted for
                    nearly three centuries, from 418 to 711, when it fell before the Arab or Saracen
                    invasion. Toulouse was its headquarters; here was held the court of the
                    West-Gothic kings, while Toledo became the centre of administration for Spain.
                    The relations of the West-Goths with Rome varied from time to time: sometimes
                    they were her friendly allies, sometimes, nominally at least, her dependants;
                    sometimes they rose in revolt and were her open enemies. Walia, after his
                    victories in Spain, professed to restore the country as once more a Roman
                    province to the rule of the emperor Honorius, and again we hear of the
                    oppressions of imperial officers and functionaries, which seem to have been even
                    more intolerable to the Spaniards than the strifes and wars of Vandals, Alani,
                    and Suevi. Nor were these troubles finally ended; Walia had by no means
                    thoroughly consolidated his conquests; and the West-Gothic kingdom in Spain
                    cannot be said to have been firmly established till the 6th century. In northern
                    Spain, in Galicia more especially, the Vandals and Suevi still had settlements,
                    and were quarrelsome neighbours. In 428 they routed an allied army of Romans and
                    Goths, and overran the southern districts, plundering some of the chief cities
                    on the coast before they quitted the country for Africa under their king, the
                    famous and savage Genseric. The Suevi yet remained, but at the solicitation of
                    the Romanized Spanish provincials of the southern cities, who felt themselves
                    threatened with utter extinction by these barbarians, Rome offered its
                    intervention, which was effectually carried out by the king of the West-Goths,
                    Theodoric II., grandson of Alaric. Crossing the Pyrenees in 456, as Rome’s
                    representative and ally, Theodoric crushed the Suevi by a decisive victory in
                    the north-west of Spain, near Astorga. It would seem that from this time the
                    Suevic power was confined within the limits of Galicia, which became in fact a
                    mere dependency of the West-Gothic kingdom. Theodoric’s victories, so far from
                    strengthening Rome’s hold on Spain, greatly weakened it; and this was what he
                    himself really intended. He did not even make a pretence of restoring the
                    country to the imperial rule. His brother and successor Euric<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Euric is
                    said to have assassinated his brother Theodoric.</hi></p></note> (466-485)
                    persistently defied the empire, completing Theodoric’s work, and establishing by
                    further successes in Spain, carried into its remotest western districts, the
                    West-Gothic kingdom in that country in full and avowed independence. Euric was
                    something more than a successful warrior: he aspired to be a legislator, and he
                    had the “customs of the Goths” recorded in writing and embodied in a code. The
                    work was continued by his successor Alaric II. in the beginning of the 6th
                    century, under the superintendence of civil and ecclesiastical lawyers, and it
                    was based mainly on what was known as the Theodosian code (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Breviarium Alaricanum).</hi> The result was that a thoroughly
                    Roman character was impressed on the West-Gothic legislation, and that Roman
                    institutions, ideas, and manners long survived in Spain. With the conversion of
                    the West-Goths from Arianism to the orthodox faith in the latter part of the 6th
                    century, under their king Recared (586- 589), came in new influences and a great
                    accession of power to the ecclesiastics. Recared was the first Catholic king of
                    Spain. With the zeal of a convert he set himself to root out Arianism, burning
                    Arian books of theology and frightening his Arian bishops into the profession of
                    the Catholic belief. He seems to have been thoroughly successful, and richly
                    endowed churches and monasteries grew up in every part of Spain. Pope Gregory
                    the Great acknowledged the good work of Recared by a gift of sacred relics.
                    Unhappily the seeds of bigotry and religious intolerance had been sown, and with
                    the beginning of the 7th century came a savage persecution of the Jews,
                    multitudes of whom had long been settled in Spain and had thriven, as elsewhere,
                    by trade and industry. The Jew up to this time seems to have found in Spain a
                    particularly safe and comfortable home. Now, at the instance of a West-Gothic
                    king, he was so cruelly<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    oppressed and persecuted that even the Catholic clergy interposed to some extent
                    on his behalf. A decree for the expulsion of the entire Jewish community was
                    promulgated on one occasion with the sanction of the council of Toledo; but the
                    Jew still held his ground in Spain and prospered and grew rich, and his presence
                    in the country contributed to the rapid spread of Arab conquest in the next
                    century.</p>

                    the great and indeed overshadowing power of the church, an aristocracy which had
                    in its hands a very large part of the administration, a uniform code of laws for
                    all Spaniards, with both a distinctly Roman and ecclesiastical impress on it.
                    The church on the whole seems to have been the guiding spirit, and the Spanish
                    bishops and clergy were held in high esteem for their learning and virtue. It
                    was they who mainly inspired the legislation of the great national councils of
                    Toledo, which to the West-Goths of Spain were what the Witenagemot was to our
                    Saxon ancestors. The church was the centre round which the whole of society
                    moved. In this fact we see foreshadowed much of the future of Spanish history,
                    the supremacy of ecclesiastics, the extraordinary powers of the Inquisition. It
                    had from the first its evil<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0332-0309"/> side in tendencies to bigotry and persecution,
                    but it was it the same time the means of giving Spain laws very far above the
                    average ideas of a barbarous people,—laws indeed which in many respects were
                    rational, humane, enlightened, often combining the wisdom of old Rome with the
                    kindly spirit of Christianity. The West-Gothic code recognized the equality of
                    all men in the eye of the law; such barbarisms as the assessment of a man’s
                    value according to his rank and position, or judicial combat or trial by ordeal,
                    find no place in it. It had certainly great merits; its weakness seems to have
                    been in leaving too much scope on one side to the king, on the other to the
                    clergy. Between the royal and the ecclesiastical powers individual freedom was
                    liable to disappear. There was a danger, too, of human thought and speculation
                    being wholly absorbed into theology. In anything like general literature Spain
                    seems to have been decidedly poor during this period, while among her neighbours
                    in the south of Gaul Greek philosophy was a fashionable study, testifying to the
                    presence of considerable intellectual activity. Spain under its West-Gothic
                    kings and its Catholic clergy may have been a fairly well governed country, but
                    long before the end came there must have been languor and decay amongst its
                    people. After the conquest of Africa by Belisarius for the emperor Justinian, it
                    seemed possible that the country might be once again annexed to the empire as a
                    province; and an unsuccessful candidate for the throne,—which, it will be
                    remembered, was elective,— went so far as to conclude a treaty of alliance, and
                    actually to cede to the troops of the empire several towns on the Mediterranean
                    coast. That a Gothic king should condescend to ask support from such a quarter,
                    and allow himself to be spoken of as in any sense the empire’s vassal, marks a
                    very decided decline in the old independent spirit of the nation. We may
                    certainly assume that repeated disputes as to the royal succession had
                    undermined its power for resistance, and the numerous and not very well affected
                    Jewish colony in their midst must have been a permanent source of danger. By the
                    end of the 7th century northern Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar had passed
                    wholly under Saracenic dominion. The struggle had been long and hard, and the
                    West-Gothic kings, who had recovered the towns on the southern coasts, and even
                    made some small conquests on the African shores, had done something to prolong
                    it; but in 710 a little band of Saracens landed unopposed at Gibraltar, returned
                    in safety, and urged their brethren at once to cross the straits and take
                    possession of the country. In the following year (711) Ṭáriḳ, at the head of
                    about 5000 Saracen volunteers, entered Spain. A great Gothic army under
                    Roderick, “the last of the Goths,” was routed in the neighbourhood of Xeres on
                    the Guadalete, and the Arab or Saracenic conquest of Spain, with the exception
                    of the mountainous districts of the north, was accomplished with amazing ease
                    and rapidity. Anything like a vigorous national resistance seems to have been
                    too much for the Spaniards, enervated as they were by long familiarity with
                    Roman civilization.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The Arab invasion of Spain had been intended by Másá, the governor of Africa, to
                    be merely a plundering raid (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohammedanism,</hi>
                    vol. xvi. p. 573). A single unexpected success turned it into a conquest. Ṭáriḳ
                    had already made himself master of Cordova and Toledo when Másá arrived from
                    Africa and rewarded his too successful lieutenant by consigning him to prison.
                    But his military ability was too valuable to be dispensed with, and he was
                    speedily released to aid in completing the conquest. Within four years the whole
                    Peninsula, except the mountainous districts in the north, had submitted to the
                    invaders. It was now Músá’s turn to suffer from the jealousy of his superior.
                    Recalled to Damascus by Walíd, he arrived just after the caliph’s death, and at
                    once fell under the displeasure of his successor Suleimán. His sons, who had
                    been left to rule in Spain, were involved in his disgrace, and the father died
                    broken-hearted on a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
                <p>Few things in history are more remarkable than the ease with which Spain, a
                    country naturally fitted for defence, was subdued by a mere handful of invaders.
                    The usual causes assigned are the misgovernment of the Visigoths, the excessive
                    influence enjoyed by the clerical caste, internal factions and jealousies, and
                    the discontent of numerous classes, and especially of the Jews. All of these
                    doubtless co-operated to facilitate the conquest and to weaken the power of
                    resistance, but the real cause is to be sought in the fact that the Visigoths
                    had never really amalgamated with the conquered population. The mass of the
                    inhabitants regarded their rulers as aliens, and had no reason to resent a
                    change of masters. This feeling was strengthened by the conduct of their new
                    conquerors. The Arab invasion undoubtedly brought with it considerable bloodshed
                    and destruction of property, but it was merciful when compared with the previous
                    inroads of the German tribes, and in the end it proved a blessing rather than a
                    curse to the country. To all who submitted the Arabs left their laws and
                    customs, and allowed them to be administered by their own officials. The
                    cultivation of the fields was left to the natives, and the overthrow of the
                    privileged classes gave rise to a system of small holdings or properties, which
                    was one of the causes of the flourishing condition of agriculture under Arab
                    rule. The slaves found their lot much improved under a religion which taught
                    that the enfranchisement of a slave was a meritorious action. The Jews, as they
                    had suffered most under the Visigoths, were the chief gainers from a conquest
                    which they had greatly contributed to bring about. But nothing was so
                    influential in securing ready submission to the Arabs as their tolerance in
                    religious matters. Even the most bigoted adherents of Islam found a practical
                    check to their zeal for proselytism in the loss that would accrue to the
                    exchequer. The Christians had to pay a poll-tax, which varied according to the
                    class to which they belonged. All property was subject to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kharáj,</hi> a tax proportioned to the produce of the soil, but converts to
                    Mohammedanism were excused from the poll-tax. A clerical chronicler of the 8th
                    century, while bewailing the subjection of Spain to an alien race, says nothing
                    against the conquerors as the professors of a hostile religion. His silence is
                    an eloquent testimony to the haughty tolerance of the Arabs.</p>
                <p>As time went on, and the Arabs felt more secure in their position, their rule
                    became not unnaturally harsher. Many of the treaties which had secured
                    favourable terms to the conquered were broken, and the Christians were provoked
                    to resistance by persecution. A notable instance of this was the edict making
                    circumcision compulsory for Christians as well as Moslems. Greater hardships

                    death. At the same time their social position was intolerable, and they were
                    excluded from all lucrative offices and from all share in the government. Their
                    discontent led to numerous and stubborn rebellions, but they belong to a later
                    period, and in the 8th century the chroniclers record only a single rising, that
                    of the Christians of Beja, and they seem to have been merely the tools of an
                    ambitious Arab chieftain.</p>
                <p>It was fortunate for the Arabs that they succeeded at first in conciliating the
                    natives, as otherwise their rule in the Peninsula would have been short-lived.
                    Internal discord offered the Christians an easy opportunity for successful
                    revolt if they had chosen to avail themselves of it. The conquerors were united
                    by religion but not by race. When the task of conquest was achieved, and the
                    need for unity was removed by the submission of the vast majority of the
                    natives, quarrels arose between the various races which had taken part in the
                    invasion. Besides the Arabs proper, who regarded themselves as the true
                    conquering race, there were Berbers or Moors, Egyptians, and Syrians. So
                    difficult was it to prevent their quarrels that it was found necessary to
                    subdivide the conquered territory and to allot separate settlements to the
                    different tribes, a measure which only tended to perpetuate their differences.
                    Matters were made worse by the constant efforts of ambitious chieftains to raise
                    themselves to power or to ruin their more successful equals. The first forty
                    years of Arab rule in Spain are a period of woeful confusion, and it is
                    difficult even to enumerate the names of the emirs who followed each other in
                    rapid succession. The great empire of the Arabs began to fall to pieces as soon
                    as it had reached its greatest extent. A movement whose end was conquest began
                    to fail directly it ceased to conquer. The overthrow of the Omayyad dynasty by
                    the Abbasids was a proof that disorder prevailed at the centre. The extremities
                    inevitably displayed the same symptoms. Each new caliph sent a fresh emir to
                    Spain; the governor of Africa claimed to interfere in the affairs of a province
                    which had been conquered by one of his predecessors; and the native chiefs were
                    often unwilling to submit to a new ruler whose arrival was the result of a
                    revolution in which they had no share and which they would have prevented if
                    they could. A capable and energetic governor, confronted with internal
                    dissension and always dreading the arrival of a successor to supersede him,
                    could only devise one way of solving the problem. The Arabs were unable to live
                    at peace, and the one means of preventing them from warring with each other was
                    to find them new lands to conquer. Hence came the frequent invasions of Gaul,
                    now ruled by the degenerate Merwings, which resulted in the conquest of the
                    provinces of Septimania and Narbonne, and at one time threatened to subject the
                    whole of western Europe to the successor of Mohammed. But the battles of
                    Toulouse (721) and of Tours (732) checked the advance of the Moslems, and by 759
                    they had been compelled to retire from all possessions beyond the Pyrenees. Thus
                    thrown back upon the peninsula, it seemed probable that their empire in Spain
                    would speedily succumb to the disruptive forces which had no longer any external
                    outlet.</p>
                <p>From this fate the Arab power was saved by ‘Abd al-Raḥmân (Abderame), the one
                    survivor of the Omayyad dynasty, who succeeded after a long series of romantic
                    adventures in escaping from the general massacre of his family (see vol. xvi. p.
                    578). His arrival in the Peninsula was welcomed by those Arab chieftains who had
                    ends of their own to gain or who saw how impossible it was for Spain to be ruled
                    from a distant centre like Damascus or Baghdad. The resistance of the Abbasid
                    emirs, Yúsuf and 'All b. Moghíth, was overcome and 'Abd al-Raḥmán was enabled to
                    found a new Omayyad dynasty at Cordova. He and his immediate successors seem to
                    have contented themselves with the title of emir, but all connexion with the
                    eastern caliphate was cut off, and Spain became independent under its new
                    rulers. The reign of 'Abd al-Raḥmán I. was spent in almost constant warfare. No
                    sooner had he reduced the southern provinces than a revolt broke out in
                    Saragossa under Ḥosein b. Yaḥya. Driven from Spain, where he had raised the
                    black standard of the Abbasid caliph, Ḥosein fled to the court of Charlemagne
                    and implored his assistance. The Frankish army restored Ḥosein to power, but on
                    its return was almost destroyed by the Basque mountaineers in the famous valley
                    of Roncesvalles (778). After a siege of two years Saragossa was taken, Ḥosein
                    was put to death as a rebel, and the whole country up to the Pyrenees was
                    compelled to submit to the Omayyad. A formidable rising of the sons of Yúsuf was
                    put down in 786, and 'Abd al-Raḥmán was enabled to devote the last two years of
                    his life to the arts of peace and to the construction of his famous mosque at
                    Cordova. Before his death he settled the succession on his third son, Hishám,
                    who had been born in Spain, and compelled his followers and his elder sons to
                    swear fealty.</p>
                <p>Hishám’s reign, which lasted only eight years (788— 796), was comparatively
                    uneventful. He was successful in foiling the attempt of his elder brothers to
                    seize the throne, but a projected invasion of Gaul was repulsed by the courage
                    of the count of Toulouse. Hishám was a devotee,—strict in the performance of
                    religious duties and absorbed in works of charity. He completed the mosque which
                    his father had begun, and endeavoured to make Cordova the educational centre of
                    Islam. His son and successor, Al-Ḥakam, was of a very different temperament.
                    With a keen enjoyment of the pleasures of life, Al-Ḥakam disregarded the
                    precepts of the Koran which forbade the use of wine, and his lax practices
                    irritated the <hi rend="italic">faḳíhs,</hi> the “scribes” of Mohammedanism. The
                    inability of the Arabs to adapt themselves to a life of peace found expression
                    in a number of isolated risings, of which the most notable took place in Toledo
                    and Cordova. The inhabitants of Toledo had never forgotten that their city had
                    once been the capital of Spain, and most of them belonged to the class of
                    “renegades,” who had no real attachment to the dominant faith. Al-Ḥakam
                    determined to suppress their discontent by a notable act of cruel treachery.
                    Feigning the most complete goodwill, he invited the chief citizens to a banquet
                    in honour of the presence of his son in Toledo. As they entered the door they
                    were conducted to an inner chamber and massacred by a band of assassins. More
                    than seven hundred are said to have perished on this “day of the fosse” (807),
                    and the citizens, deprived of their leaders, submitted with the torpor of
                    despair. The fate of Toledo terrified the Cordovans, and postponed their rising
                    for seven years. But in 814 the murder of a blacksmith by one of Al-Ḥakam’s
                    bodyguard provoked a terrible outbreak. Besieged in his palace by the infuriated
                    mob, Al-Ḥakam only escaped death by his own coolness and presence of mind. A
                    detachment of his guard was sent to fire the houses of the citizens; the mob
                    hurried off to save their families and goods; and a sudden charge of the emir
                    and his soldiers threw them into complete disorder. With politic severity
                    Al-Ḥakam destroyed a whole quarter of the city and condemned all the inhabitants
                    to exile. Part of them found a new home in Africa, but others, after a temporary
                    sojourn in Alexandria, conquered Crete, where they founded a dynasty, which
                    lasted till 961, when the island was recovered by the Greeks. The <hi
                    rend="italic">faḳíhs,</hi> the real instigators of the rebellion, were treated
                    with conspicuous leniency, and their leader, Ṭalúit, was even admitted to
                    Al-Ḥakam’s favour.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0334-0311"/> By the end of the 8th century it had become
                    evident that the Arabs had committed a great error in not reducing the whole
                    Peninsula, and that the contemptuous indifference with which they had left the
                    northern mountains to a handful of refugees was destined to bring its own
                    punishment. The early history of the Christian states of Spain is wrapped in a
                    mist of fable and legend, but it is not hard to discern the main outlines. A
                    scanty band of warriors, headed by Pelayo, probably a member of the Visigothic
                    royal family, found refuge in the cave of Covadonga, among the inaccessible
                    mountains of Asturias. Their own bravery and the difficulties of the country
                    enabled them to hold their own, and they became the rallying point for all who
                    preferred a life of hardship to slavish submission. The formation of a Christian
                    kingdom was the work of Pelayo’s grandson, Alfonso I., who seized the
                    opportunity when the Arabs were occupied in the disputes attending the accession
                    of 'Abd al-Raḥmán I. After driving the Berbers from Galicia, Alfonso advanced
                    with his victorious troops as far as the Douro. But he had not followers enough
                    to colonize the conquered territory, and contented himself with the northern
                    districts, leaving a desert to form a natural boundary between himself and the
                    Moors. Alfonso’s son and successor, Fruela I. (765-775). fixed his capital at
                    Oviedo, but the greater part of his reign was occupied with the suppression of
                    internal disorders, and he ultimately fell a victim to assassination. His throne
                    was successfully usurped by his cousin Aurelia and his nephew Silo, both of whom
                    sought security against domestic enemies in an alliance with 'Abd al-Raḥmán. On
                    the death of Silo (784) a party among the nobles elected Fruela’s son, Alfonso
                    II., but for six years the western half of the kingdom obeyed a bastard son of
                    Alfonso I. by a Moorish captive, nicknamed from his origin El Maurecato. Under
                    Alfonso the Chaste, whose long reign lasted till 842, the Christian kingdom of
                    Oviedo was firmly established. It is impossible to find any accurate account of
                    his achievements. The monkish chroniclers are hardly trustworthy authorities for
                    military history, and they prefer to confine themselves to the more congenial
                    subject of the founding and endowment of churches. The discovery of the
                    pretended tomb of St James at Compostella is in their eyes the greatest event of
                    the reign, and it undoubtedly aided to give a religious character to the war
                    which was destined to be the great crusade of the west.</p>
                <p>Alfonso II.’s reign witnessed the establishment of another Christian state in
                    Spain. Charles the Great had been too much occupied elsewhere to avenge the
                    great disaster at Roncesvalles, but he was only waiting for his opportunity.
                    This was offered in 800 by the treachery of another governor of Saragossa, who
                    had revolted against Al-Ḥakam and sought assistance from the Franks. Charles
                    himself was on his way to Italy to assume the imperial crown, but he sent his
                    son Louis across the Pyrenees. In his first campaign Louis reached the Ebro, but
                    he had to return in 801 to vanquish the obstinate resistance of Barcelona. The
                    administration of the “Spanish mark” was entrusted to Bera, a man of Gothic
                    descent, who proved fully capable of the task imposed upon him. The attacks of
                    the Arabs were repulsed, and their last possessions beyond the Ebro were lost in
                    811, when Tortosa, after a siege of two years, succumbed to the forces which
                    Louis the Pious had again led over the mountains. Henceforth the province was
                    ruled by the counts of Barcelona, as representatives of the Frankish kings.</p>
                <p>To avoid the difficulty of frequent transitions, it will be best to sketch in
                    advance the main outlines of the history of the Christian states down to the
                    formation of the three kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Navarre, leaving their
                    relations with the Moors to be narrated in connexion with the caliphate of
                    Cordova. It is impossible to do much more than trace the dynastic and
                    geographical changes, as their mutual quarrels are intricate and wearisome, and
                    of little importance except as prolonging the rule of the Arabs in the
                    Peninsula. The county of Barcelona may be dismissed with a few words. It
                    continued for some time to be subject to Frankish suzerainty, and it suffered
                    from the disorders that followed the break-up of Charles the Great’s empire.
                    Bera, its first count, was exiled, and his successor, Bernhard, played a
                    prominent part in the intrigues of that troubled period. At one moment he added
                    Septimania to the Spanish mark, at another he was disgraced and exiled; and
                    finally he was treacherously murdered. In the later part of the 9th century all
                    connexion with Septimania was cut off, and Wilfrid the Hairy (d. 907) was able
                    to make the county hereditary in his family. With its mixed population and its
                    long line of coast the county of Barcelona, or Catalonia as it came to be
                    called, was more involved in the affairs of Gaul than of Spain. Berengar I.
                    annexed the county of Carcassonne and other districts north of the Pyrenees
                    (about 1050-1076), and Berengar III. (1092-1131) obtained Provence by marriage.
                    On the latter’s death Catalonia and the transmontane territories were divided
                    between his two sons, and in 1150 Berengar IV., by marriage with Queen
                    Petronilla, obtained the kingdom of Aragon, with which Catalonia was henceforth
                    united.</p>
                <p>The history of Oviedo is more important and more complicated. Alfonso II.’s
                    successors, Ramiro I. (842- 850) and Ordoño I. (850-866), had to contend both
                    with the great nobles, who aimed at independence, and with the Basques, who had
                    never learnt to submit to orderly rule. Alfonso III., in a long reign of nearly
                    fifty years (866-910), won the title of “The Great’’from the success which
                    attended his arms. While his plundering raids extended as far as Coimbra and
                    Lisbon, he really advanced his frontiers to the Douro, and in order to defend
                    these more exposed territories he transferred his capital from Oviedo to Leon,
                    on the further side of the mountains. In accordance with the universal custom of
                    the Germans, Alfonso divided his territories among his three sons, Garcia
                    receiving the southern districts with Leon as a capital, Ordoño II. western
                    Galicia, and Fruela II. the original district round Oviedo. In 931, however, the
                    kingdom was again united under Ramiro II., a son of Ordoño II., and henceforth
                    called after the new capital, Leon. Under Ramiro, a great warrior against the
                    Arabs, we first hear of a district that was destined to become the most
                    important in Spain. The border territory, a march to the south-east of Leon,
                    previously Bardulia, was now known as Castile, from the number of castles that
                    had been raised to hold it against the infidels. Its count, Fernan Gonzales, was
                    the most powerful noble in the kingdom of Leon, and sought to make himself
                    independent. Ramiro reduced him to submission and then bound him to his side by
                    marrying his eldest son to the count’s daughter. Ordoño III. (950-957) sought to
                    emulate his father’s achievements against the Arabs, but was hampered by the
                    revolt of his brother Sancho and his father-in-law Fernan Gonzales. Sancho I.
                    (957-966) found an enemy in his recent ally, who attempted to place a rival king
                    upon the throne, and he could only procure restoration to his kingdom by an
                    alliance with the caliph of Cordova. This alliance lasted during the minority of
                    his son, Ramiro III. (966-982), who was deposed by the malcontent nobles in
                    favour of his uncle, Bermudo II. (982-999). The latter, too mild a ruler for
                    such troubled times, had a hard struggle against domestic<pb break="no"

                <p>Meanwhile a new kingdom had sprung up to the east of Leon, which for a time
                    seemed likely to become the chief state of Christian Spain. The district in the
                    western Pyrenees bordering on the Bay of Biscay was the most defensible position
                    in the Peninsula. It was there that the Basques had held out against the German
                    invaders, and that the Suevi had found a refuge from the Visigoths. The
                    sovereignty of the Moslems and of the Franks had been in turn acknowledged, but
                    had never been more than nominal. About the beginning of the 10th century Sancho
                    founded here the kingdom of Navarre, and he succeeded in extending his rule as
                    far as the lower Ebro. His means of defence were primitive but efficient. When
                    attacked by the infidels in overwhelming numbers he retired to the inaccessible
                    mountains, and recovered the lost ground as soon as the enemy had turned his
                    back. His grandson, Sancho the Great (970-1035), profited by the disasters which
                    befel Leon. He married the sister of Garcia, count of Castile, and when his
                    brother-in-law fell a victim to a conspiracy he seized the opportunity to avenge
                    his death by annexing the northern portion of his country. In 1034 he picked a
                    quarrel with Bermudo III. (1028-1037), the son and successor of Alfonso V., and
                    conquered eastern Leon as far as the river Cea. More important still were his
                    acquisitions in the south-east of Navarre. Partly by marriage connexions, and
                    partly by the sword, he obtained possession of the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe,
                    and Ribagorça, which had for years been struggling to maintain their
                    independence against the Mussulman governor of Saragossa. These considerable
                    territories Sancho divided on his death (1035) among his four sons, and the
                    division is an important event in the history of Spain. Garcia, the eldest,
                    received Navarre, with a small district on the right bank of the Ebro;
                    Ferdinand, the second son, obtained Castile, with the addition of the district
                    of Palencia, which had been wrested from Leon; the counties of Ribagorça and
                    Sobrarbe passed to Gonzalo, and that of Aragon to</p>
                <p>Ramiro, a bastard.</p>
                <p>The death of Sancho the Great seemed to offer Bermudo III. an opportunity for
                    recovering his lost territories, and he at once collected his forces to attack
                    Ferdinand. In a pitched battle near the river Carrion, Bermudo was defeated and
                    killed, and the conqueror at once annexed Leon with its dependencies—Galicia and
                    Asturias—to his new kingdom of Castile (1037). The eldest brother, Garcia,
                    resented a change which threatened to deprive Navarre of the pre-eminence which
                    it had enjoyed under his father. To gratify his jealousy he did not scruple to
                    ally himself with the emirs of Saragossa and Tudela. But in the battle of
                    Atapuerca (1054) the unnatural coalition was defeated, Garcia lost his life on
                    the field, and Ferdinand added to Castile the district on the right of the Ebro,
                    leaving the rest of Navarre to his nephew, Sancho IV. Meanwhile Ramiro, equally
                    ambitious and successful, got rid of his brother Gonzales, and seized upon
                    Sobrarbe and Ribagorça to form, with his own inheritance, the kingdom of Aragon.
                    Henceforth the history of Christian Spain centres round the two great states of
                    Castile and Aragon. Leon, much to the disgust of its inhabitants, becomes a
                    province of the former, and Navarre is soon afterwards deprived of independence
                    by its more powerful neighbour.</p>
                <p>We must now return to the history of the Arabs. Under 'Abd al-Raḥmán II.
                    (822-852), one of the mildest and most cultivated of the Omayyad dynasty, began
                    a period of disorder and anarchy which might have ruined his power if the
                    northern states had been prepared to take advantage of it. Toledo, which had
                    recovered its independence soon after the “day of the fosse,” was not reduced
                    until after a desperate struggle of eight years, and then its fall was mainly
                    due to internal quarrels. More serious was the growing spirit of insubordination
                    among the Christian population of the south. In spite of the tolerance with
                    which they were treated, the priests persisted in preaching against the rule of
                    the infidel. Under the leadership of Eulogius and his friend Alvaro, a fanatical
                    sect was formed which sought to emulate the glory of the early martyrs. So
                    averse was the Government to resort to persecution that it was only by publicly
                    blaspheming Mohammed that they could bring themselves under the penalties of the
                    law. Eleven persons were put to death for such conduct, who are celebrated in
                    Spanish history as the “martyrs of Cordova.” It was in vain that the moderate
                    party denounced their conduct as wanton suicide; the enthusiasts persisted in
                    their defiant conduct. Mohammed (852-866), sterner and more narrow-minded than
                    his predecessor, was not unwilling to take repressive measures, and the
                    execution of Eulogius, who had been chosen archbishop of Toledo, seems to have
                    checked for a time the thirst for martyrdom. But the movement had succeeded in
                    provoking a feeling of distrust between the two religions, and it was difficult
                    to return to the old attitude of easy tolerance. The “renegades” found their
                    position altered for the worse, and under Mohammed they were jealously excluded
                    from all the higher offices of state.</p>
                <p>A series of revolts showed how prevalent was the feeling of discontent. The
                    Gothic family of Bení-Casí, which had embraced Mohammedanism in order to advance
                    itself, had become extremely powerful in Aragon. Músá, the head of this family,
                    made himself master of Saragossa, Tudela, and Huesca, concluded a close alliance
                    with Toledo, which had again recovered its independence, and claimed to be the
                    “third king in Spain.” Músá’s death in 862, in a war with Ordono I. of Oviedo,
                    enabled Mohammed to regain Tudela and Saragossa, but his troops were soon
                    expelled by Músá’s sons, and the Bení-Casí, with the help of Alfonso III., were
                    for a long time able to bid defiance to the authority of the emir. About the
                    same time an independent state was formed in the west by Ibn-Merwán, a renegade
                    of Merida. But by far the most formidable of these risings was that of Omar b.
                    Ḥafṣún, who began as a brigand in the mountains of Andalusia, but whose castle
                    at Bobastro became the centre of all the dissatisfied Christians and renegades
                    of the south. Neither Mohammed nor his son and successor Mondhir (886-888) could
                    reduce this impregnable fortress, and for years 'Omar was the real ruler of
                    Andalusia. His authority was far greater than that of the emirs had ever been;
                    his administration of justice was rude but efficient; and the Arab historians
                    maintain that a girl laden with treasure could in his time cross the mountains
                    in safety.</p>
                <p>The premature death of Mondhir, a brave and chivalrous prince, gave the
                    succession to his brother 'Abdallah (888- 902), who ascended the throne at a
                    very critical moment. Not only had the rising of the Christians and renegades
                    assumed an almost national character, but the Arab nobles had taken advantage of
                    the general disorder to assume the independence that was so congenial to them.
                    'Abdallah, considering the latter danger the more formidable, sought to gain
                    over the Spaniards, and even offered Ibn Ḥafṣún the government of Regio, on
                    condition that he would acknowledge himself as sovereign. But the negotiation
                    came to nothing, and the only result was to<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0336-0313"/> provoke the indignation of his own race against
                    the emir. Luckily for him the Spaniards had an old debt to pay off against the
                    Arabs, who had long treated them with insufferable contempt. In various
                    districts a desperate civil war broke out, which was destructive of all law and
                    order, but was not directly aimed against the central Government. The most
                    violent struggle was in the province of Elvira, where for a time the natives got
                    the upper hand, and it was only after a desperate conflict that the Arab
                    domination was maintained by the heroism of two successive leaders, Sauwár and
                    Sa'íd. In Seville a similar contest arose, and 'Abdallah, after attempting in
                    vain to hold the balance between the two parties, was at last compelled to
                    espouse the cause of the Arabs. An insurrection, in which the life of Mohammed,
                    the emir’s eldest son, was in imminent danger, was punished with ruthless
                    severity; but it was the Arab nobles who profited by the success to make
                    themselves absolute masters of the province. The central authority was almost
                    powerless. Most of the provincial governors had thrown off all connexion with
                    Cordova, and the others only rendered obedience when it was convenient to
                    themselves. But at the moment when matters seemed at their worst the tide
                    turned. In 890 'Abdallah won his first victory over Ibn-Ḥafṣún, and during the
                    remainder of his reign he gradually recovered power in the revolted provinces.
                    The work was continued by his son and successor, 'Abd al-Raḥmán (or Abderame)
                    III. (912-961), the greatest of the rulers of Cordova. Under this prince, who at
                    last assumed the title of caliph, the unity of Mussulman Spain was for the time
                    restored.</p>
                <p>No sooner had 'Abd al-Raḥmán completed the first part of his task by the
                    reduction of the family of Ibn-Ḥafṣún than he found himself confronted by two
                    dangers. In Africa the Fatimites were establishing a great empire, and it was
                    almost certain that they would turn their attention to Spain as soon as their
                    power was secure in the southern continent. In the north the Christian states
                    had profited by the long anarchy among their old foes and were assuming a very
                    threatening attitude. Alfonso III. had moved his capital across the mountains to
                    Leon, and Sancho had recently created the kingdom of Navarre. As regards Africa,
                    'Abd al-Raḥmán contented himself with encouraging and subsidizing the princes
                    that still held out against the Fatimites, and with obtaining possession of
                    Ceuta, so as to have complete command of the straits. The northern danger was
                    the more pressing. In 914 Ordono II. made a successful raid into the territory
                    of Merida, and two years later he defeated the army which had been sent to
                    avenge the insult. Although Merida had not yet returned to submission, 'Abd
                    al-Raḥmán was determined to conciliate his subjects by proving his ability to
                    defend them. He spared no pains to collect a magnificent army, and his efforts
                    were rewarded in 918 by a great victory over the combined forces of Leon and
                    Navarre. This was the first of a series of successful campaigns, in the course
                    of which he penetrated as far as Sancho’s capital, Pamplona. But his victories
                    brought him little beyond glory and revenge. As soon as his troops were
                    withdrawn, the enemy showed himself to be really unconquered. In 921 Ordono is
                    said to have advanced within a day’s journey of Cordova, and in 923 Sancho
                    excited a panic in Mussulman Spain by the capture of Viguera. But the disorders
                    in Leon that followed Ordono II.’s death were a great blow to the Christians,
                    and enabled 'Abd al-Raḥmán to complete his work of internal reorganization and
                    to turn his attention to resisting the Fatimite conquest of Mauretania. On the
                    death of Sancho, his widow Tota recognized the caliph as suzerain of
                    Navarre.</p>
                <p>In his later years 'Abd al-Raḥmán was less uniformly successful. The Arabs were
                    disgusted by his policy of excluding the nobles from all share in the government
                    and of filling the chief offices with “Slavs,” the generic title for all foreign
                    servants of the court. Ramiro II. had succeeded in restoring unity to Leon, and
                    resumed the warlike policy of his predecessors. In 939 he inflicted a serious
                    defeat upon the army of the caliph at Alhandega, and was only prevented from
                    following up his victory by a quarrel with the famous count of Castile, Fernan
                    Gonzales. The divisions which followed Ramiro’s death were an additional
                    advantage to 'Abd al-Raḥmán; and in 960 he gained the most conspicuous success
                    of his reign when his troops restored the deposed Sancho I. to the throne of
                    Leon. This was almost his last act, as he died in October 961.</p>
                <p>“Among the Omayyad princes of Spain 'Abd al-Raḥmán III. incontestably holds the
                    first place. His achievements bordered on the fabulous. He had found the empire
                    in a state of anarchy and civil war, divided amongst a crowd of chiefs of
                    different race, exposed to constant raids from the Christians of the north, and
                    on the verge of being absorbed either by Leon or by the Fatimites. In spite of
                    innumerable obstacles he had saved Andalusia both from itself and from foreign
                    rule. He had given to it internal order and prosperity and the consideration and
                    respect of foreigners. He found the treasury in disorder; he left it in the most
                    flourishing condition. A third of the annual revenues, which amounted to
                    6,245,000 pieces of gold, sufficed for the ordinary expenditure; another third
                    was kept as a reserve; the rest was devoted to buildings. The condition of the
                    country was equally prosperous. Agriculture, industry, commerce, the arts and
                    sciences, flourished together. The foreigner was lost in wonder at the
                    scientific system of irrigation, which gave fertility to lands that appeared
                    most unpromising. He was struck by the perfect order which, thanks to a vigilant
                    police, reigned in the most inaccessible districts. Commerce had developed to
                    such an extent that, according to the report of the superintendent of the
                    customs, the duties on imports and exports constituted the most considerable
                    part of the revenue. A superb navy enabled 'Abd al-Raḥmán to dispute with the
                    Fatimites the empire of the Mediterranean, and secured him in the possession of
                    Ceuta, the key of Mauretania. A numerous and well-disciplined army, perhaps the
                    best in the world, gave him a preponderance over the Christians of the north.
                    The most haughty sovereigns were eager for his alliance. Ambassadors were sent
                    to him by the emperor of Constantinople and by the sovereigns of Germany, Italy,
                    and France.”—Dozy, iii. 90.</p>
                <p>The new caliph, Al-Ḥakam II. (961—976), was distinguished as a patron of
                    literature and a collector of books. The number of volumes in his library was
                    reckoned at 400,000, and he is said to have read and annotated them all. For
                    politics he had comparatively little taste. Naturally averse to war, he was only
                    forced into hostilities by the obstinate refusal of Sancho I. to fulfil the
                    treaty which he had signed on his restoration, and he hastened to conclude peace
                    on an empty renewal of the treaty. The disorders which arose during the minority
                    of Ramiro III. put an end to all danger on the side of Leon, and the death of
                    Fernan Gonzales in 970 removed a ruler who had always been a thorn in the side
                    of the infidel. The most notable event of Al-Ḥakam’s reign is the rise to
                    influence of a man who was destined to play a more prominent part in the history
                    of Spain than any of the caliphs, not excluding 'Abd al-Raḥmán III. Mohammed
                    Ibn-abí-'Ámir was the descendant of a family which had long been distinguished
                    in the civil administration, but had never been admitted to the higher nobility
                    of the sword. From his<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0337-0314"/> earliest youth he was inspired with the thought
                    that he was destined to rule. His ability and the favour of Al-Ḥakam’s favourite
                    wife, Sobh, combined to bring about his speedy advance, and by the time of the
                    caliph’s death he held a high office in the court. Al-Ḥakam had done all in his
                    power to secure the succession of his son by Sobh, Hishám, a boy of ten years of
                    age. But the chief eunuchs, dreading the influence which a minority would give
                    to Moṣhafí, the <hi rend="italic">ḥájib</hi> or chief minister, sought to give
                    the crown to Moghíra, a brother of Al-Ḥakam. With the help of Ibn-abí-'Ámir,
                    Moṣhafí defeated the plot; Moghíra was put to death, and Hishám succeeded to his
                    father’s throne. But he never really ruled. Ibn-abi-'Ámir, still aided by Sobh,
                    whose lover he was popularly supposed to be, gradually rose to absolute power.
                    Moṣhafí, a man of little real ability, was charged with peculation and deposed,
                    and his younger rival was appointed <hi rend="italic">ḥájib</hi> in his place.
                    To free himself from all danger from the mob at Cordova, the all-powerful
                    minister transferred the government and the court to Zahrá, which he built for
                    the purpose. There the young caliph was immured in a magnificent palace, and was
                    carefully secluded from all contact with public affairs. His education was
                    purposely neglected, and he never made the slightest effort to free himself from
                    his gilded imprisonment. To remove all obstacles to his authority, Ibn-abí-'Ámir
                    reorganized the army. He filled the ranks with Moors from Africa and with
                    Spaniards from Leon, Castile, and Navarre, whom he bound to his cause by lavish
                    generosity. The old tribal distinctions among the Arabs, so long the source of
                    jealousy and quarrels, he completely disregarded in the forming of regiments,
                    and thus completed the work of assimilation which 'Abd al-Raḥmán III. had
                    commenced. Though trained to the study of the law and experienced only in civil
                    affairs, he speedily mastered the art of war and conciliated the popular favour
                    by victories such as no caliph had ever won. In 981 he defeated Ramiro III. and
                    his allies in a pitched battle, took Zamora and Simancas, and was only prevented
                    by a storm from capturing Leon. On his return he assumed the name of Almanṣór
                    (victorious by the help of God), by which he is usually known in history.
                    Bermudo II., whom the nobles of Leon raised to the throne in place of the
                    defeated Ramiro, could only secure himself by paying tribute to the ruler of
                    Cordova. In 985 Almanṣór invaded Catalonia, which had hitherto been respected as
                    a Frankish fief, drove the count Borrel into exile, and took and sacked
                    Barcelona. When Bermudo II. sought to free himself from the harsh conditions
                    that had been imposed upon him and drove the Moslem troops from his kingdom,
                    Almanṣór took a terrible revenge. In 987 he stormed Coimbra and razed it to the
                    ground. In the next year he advanced into the heart of the kingdom. Leaving
                    Zamora, where Bermudo awaited him, on one side, he marched against the city of
                    Leon, and took it after an obstinate resistance. The fortifications were utterly
                    destroyed, with the exception of one gate, which was left to commemorate the
                    victor’s triumph. Zamora was then attacked, and Bermudo fled to his northern
                    territories, which were all that were left to him.</p>
                <p>In spite of these successes Almanṣór had to face more than one conspiracy on the
                    part of those who were jealous of his pre-eminence. The most formidable of these
                    was fomented by his former patroness, Sobh, who found herself more and more
                    thrust into the background. She succeeded in gaining over her son, but Almanṣór
                    soon recovered his ascendency over the feeble caliph, from whom he extorted a
                    document transferring all powers to himself. A refusal of Bermudo II. to
                    continue the payment of tribute led to the last and most famous of his
                    campaigns, in which he took Compostella and carried off the gates and bells from
                    the shrine of St James, the patron saint of the Christians. At the same time his
                    generals were gaining victories in Mauretania, and his power was almost equally
                    dreaded on both sides of the straits. His death in 1002 deprived the Spanish
                    Moslems of the greatest ruler and warrior, considering his origin, that their
                    race had produced. His campaigns against the Christians, which are reckoned by
                    the Arab historians as more than fifty, were almost uniformly successful. Three
                    capitals—Leon, Pamplona, and Barcelona—had been conquered by him. His home
                    administration was as successful as his generalship, and much of his attention
                    was devoted to the construction of roads and bridges, so as to facilitate
                    communication between all parts of Spain. He was a zealous, if not an
                    intelligent, patron of literature, but his real interests were always practical.
                    Finding that he was suspected by the people of a laxness in religious belief, he
                    did not hesitate to prove his orthodoxy by an act of politic vandalism. Taking
                    the chief ' <hi rend="italic">ulemá</hi> into the library of Al-Ḥakam II., he
                    begged them to collect all the books on philosophy, astronomy, and other
                    prohibited sciences; and when they had completed their task he ordered the
                    condemned books to be burnt on a vast pile.</p>
                <p>Almanṣór had been absolute in everything but name. He had desired at one time to
                    take the final step and to supersede the incapable Hishám II. in the caliphate,
                    but he dreaded the inveterate attachment of the people to the Omayyad dynasty.
                    He had, however, taken steps to secure the continuance of his family in power.
                    His son, 'Abd al-Melik Możaffar succeeded to the office of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ḥájib,</hi> and ruled with the same authority and success as his father. But
                    the position was really untenable. An hereditary monarchy is intelligible, but
                    an hereditary line of chief ministers is not. The early death of 'Abd al-Melik
                    (1008) gave the government to the weaker hands of his brother 'Abd al-Raḥmán.
                    The latter was hated by the Mohammedan clergy, partly because he indulged in the
                    use of wine, and partly because his mother had been born a Christian. She was
                    the daughter of a Sancho, either the king of Navarre or the count of Castile,
                    and her son was nicknamed Sanchol, or the little Sancho. The Amirids were not
                    popular. Their exaltation irritated, not only the families that claimed a higher
                    rank by birth, but also those who thought themselves their equals. Without
                    having any actual grievance to complain of, the people vaguely desired a change
                    of rulers. It was easy under the circumstances to effect a revolution. When
                    Sanchol returned from a campaign against Leon in 1009 he found that his power
                    had been completely overthrown. Mohammed, a great-grandson of 'Abd al-Raḥmán
                    III., had headed an insurrection in the capital and had gained possession of the
                    caliph’s person. Sanchol was put to death, and the magnificent palace which his
                    father had erected at Zahrá was razed to the ground. The Amirids fell, and with
                    them ended the grand period in the history of Moslem Spain.</p>
                <p>Mohammed was not long content with the office of <hi rend="italic">ḥájib.</hi>
                    Scrupling to kill the unfortunate Hishám, who had never made any opposition to
                    the acts that had been committed in his name, he closely imprisoned him, and
                    buried the corpse of a Christian who bore a strong personal resemblance to the
                    caliph. Mohammed was now raised to the caliphate, and assumed the title of
                    Al-Mahdí (guided by God). But his reign was not destined to be long or
                    untroubled. He had been raised to power by a combination of orthodox Moslems, of
                    the so-called “Slavs” (foreign slaves serving in the royal harem and in the army
                    of the caliph) and of Berbers, and he alienated each in turn. The Berbers, who
                    formed an important part of the army, were the first to revolt. Raising the
                    standard of Solei<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0338-0315"/> mán, a member of the Omayyad family, they
                    obtained assistance from Count Sancho of Castile, marched upon Cordova, and
                    inflicted a serious defeat upon the troops which Mohammed imprudently led out to
                    meet them. Mohammed endeavoured to strengthen his position by producing Hishám
                    II., whom he had given out as dead. But the Berbers refused to be turned from
                    their purpose, and occupied Cordova in November 1009. The wretched Hishám was
                    compelled to abdicate in favour of Soleimán, and returned to his prison.
                    Mohammed, who had escaped to Toledo, now turned for assistance to the
                    Christians, who, by a sudden change of circumstances, had become the arbiters of
                    Mohammedan affairs. With the help of troops from Catalonia he recovered Cordova,
                    which had to pay in constant sieges a terrible penalty for the levity with which
                    it had welcomed the fall of the Amirids. In pursuing the Berbers, however,
                    Mohammed was again defeated. The Slavs, who had hitherto supported him for their
                    own ends, determined to desert the unsuccessful caliph. Hishám II. was again
                    dragged from prison to assume the throne, and Mohammed was murdered in his
                    presence. Wáḍiḥ, the leader of the Slavs, was now <hi rend="italic">ḥájib,</hi>
                    and aspired to play the part of Almanṣór. But his resources were at an end. An
                    attempt to increase the taxes roused general indignation, and he was put to
                    death by his own followers (1011). Two years later the nominal reign of Hishám
                    II. came to an end. Cordova was taken by Soleimán and the Berbers, and the
                    caliph disappeared (1013). His fate remains one of the unsolved secrets of
                    history.</p>
                <p>Soleimán was now formally proclaimed caliph, but his power was more nominal than
                    real. The provincial governors had taken advantage of the civil war to make
                    themselves independent, and Soleimán's authority was only recognized by five
                    towns—Cordova, Seville, Niebla, Oksonoba, and Beja. Even within this district he
                    soon found an opponent. The Slavs were unwilling to submit to the domination of
                    the Berbers, whose excesses the caliph was unable to check. Their most powerful
                    leader, Khairán, had been badly wounded in the late struggle, but on his
                    recovery he determined to avenge his defeat. He found a capable ally in 'Ali b.
                    Ḥammúd, a descendant of the famous son-in-law of the Prophet, but whose family
                    had almost ceased to be Arab in their long residence in Africa. 'Alí relied not
                    only upon the Slavs but also upon the Berbers, who regarded Soleimán with
                    contempt, and looked upon 'All as a fellow-countryman. Soleimán’s government was
                    easily overthrown (1016), but Khairán’s attempt to discover Hishám II. was
                    unsuccessful, and he had to acknowledge 'Ali as caliph and to content himself
                    with the office of <hi rend="italic">hajib.</hi> The Ḥammúdite dynasty, thus
                    established in Cordova, was not destined to enjoy a long tenure of power.
                    Khairán revolted against a sovereign who was too able aud spirited for the part
                    of a Hishám II., and set up an anti-caliph in the person of another Omayyad,
                    'Abd al-Raḥmán IV., a great-grandson of 'Abd al-Raḥmán III., who took the name
                    of Mortaḍá. 'Alí was murdered in his bath (1017), but his supporters rallied
                    round his brother Ḳásim. For five years a confused civil war raged which was
                    complicated by the hostility to Ḳásim of 'Alí’s son, Yaḥyá. In 1023 Mortaḍá was
                    slain in battle, and the Omayyad party gave the crown to another 'Abd al-Raḥmán,
                    a brother of the detestable Mahdi. Two months later the young prince was
                    murdered, but his successful rival, Mohammed b. 'Abd al-Raḥmán was driven from
                    Cordova in 1025. The Ḥammúdite caliph, Yaḥyá, now occupied the capital, but was
                    slain in attempting to reduce the rebellious wá <hi rend="italic">li</hi> of
                    Seville to obedience. Hishám III., a brother of 'Abd al-Raḥmán Mortaḍá, was now
                    raised to the throne. But all central government was by this time at an end; no
                    revenues could be Hishám from the rebellious provinces; and in 1031 Hishám
                    abdicated a title which had ceased to have any meaning, and sought peace and
                    retirement in the neighbourhood of Saragossa. His death five years later was
                    almost unnoticed even in Cordova. With him ended the Omayyad dynasty, which had
                    ruled in Spain for nearly three centuries, and which had produced princes worthy
                    to be ranked with the greatest of their contemporaries. Its decline dates from
                    the time when it allowed power to slip from its hands and to be wielded by
                    ambitious ministers.</p>
                <p>Ever since the death of Almanṣór Moslem Spain had been gradually splitting up
                    into a number of independent principalities. With the extinction of the Omayyads
                    the last semblance of unity disappeared. “The Berber generals shared the south;
                    the Slavs ruled in the east; the rest was divided either among successful
                    adventurers or among the small number of noble families who had been fortunate
                    enough to escape the blows which 'Abd al-Raḥmán and Almanṣór had struck at the
                    aristocracy. Finally, the two most considerable towns, Cordova and Seville, were
                    organized as republics” (Dozy). Into the history of the numerous dynasties which
                    were established during this period it is impossible to enter here, but the
                    reader will find the subject not only fully but attractively treated in the
                    fourth volume of Dozy’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Musulmans d’Espagne.</hi>
                    See also Plate VII.</p>
                <p>It was of additional moment that this disruption of the Mussulman power was
                    contemporary with the formation of the great Christian states of Aragon and
                    Castile. They were not slow to profit by the opportunity held out to them. It
                    was in this century that the Christian cause found a champion in the famous Ruy
                    Diaz Campeador, who under the name of “The Cid” became the traditional hero of
                    Spanish mediaeval history. Ferdinand I. of Castile (1037-1067) captured the
                    strong places of Viseu, Lamego, and Coimbra, and was only diverted from the
                    conquest of Toledo by the humble submission of the emir, who undertook to pay
                    tribute to the Christian king. The unfortunate division of his territories
                    between his three sons gave occasion to civil wars, which were only terminated
                    in 1072 by the reunion of the whole kingdom under Alfonso VI. Following up his
                    father’s successes, Alfonso made himself master of Toledo, which once more
                    became the capital of a Christian state. Meanwhile Ramiro I. of Aragon
                    (1035-1063) drove the Moors from their last possessions in the counties of
                    Aragon and Sobrarbe. His son, Sancho Ramirez (1063-1094), joined Alfonso VI. in
                    an attack on Navarre which resulted in the partition of that state between the
                    two kings, and commenced a Avar against the emir of Saragossa which ended, under
                    his successors Pedro (1094-1104) and Alfonso I. (1104-1136), in the conquest of
                    Huesca and Saragossa. The latter town became henceforth the recognized capital
                    of Aragon.</p>
                <p>This period is also important in another aspect. Hitherto the Christian kingdoms
                    of Spain had been naturally isolated from the rest of Europe. But the papacy,
                    under the guiding hand of Hildebrand (Gregory VII.), was now making its
                    ecclesiastical supremacy a reality, and was not likely to tolerate independence
                    even in the most distant members of the church. Aragon, which lay nearest to the
                    other states of Western Christendom, made little difficulty about complying with
                    the papal demands. Ramiro not only agreed to adopt the Roman ritual in his
                    kingdom, but even sent tribute to Alexander II. Castile, lying farther distant,
                    was more inclined to resent dictation. At a council at Burgos (1077) it was
                    formally decided to retain the Gothic ritual. But Alfonso VI. realized the
                    danger of isolating his state from the rest<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0339-0316"/> of Europe, and of his own accord conceded the
                    demands of Gregory VII. From this time Christian Spain was directly connected
                    with Rome, and became the most faithful, if not the most servile, of Roman
                    Catholic countries.</p>
                <p>The Christian victories of the 11th century seemed likely at one time to
                    annihilate the Mohammedan power in Spain. From this fate, however, it was saved,
                    not by any internal strength, but by the arrival of assistance from Africa. The
                    emir of Seville, Al-Mo'tamid, the most powerful of the Moslem princes, watched
                    with profound misgiving the progress of the Castilian arms. When Toledo fell
                    before Alfonso VI. he determined to appeal to Yúsuf b. Táshufin, the king of the
                    Almoravids,—a confederation of Berber sectaries that had recently established a
                    vast empire reaching from the Senegal to Algiers. Yúsuf, who had established his
                    capital at Morocco in 1069, was at this time eighty years of age, but he did not
                    hesitate to accept the prospect of a new field of conquest and adventure. In
                    1086 he sailed from Ceuta to Algesiras, the cession of which he had demanded as
                    the price of his aid, and was at once joined by the forces of the emirs of
                    Andalusia. Alfonso VI. hastened to obtain assistance from the king of Aragon and
                    the count of Barcelona, and with a larger force than had ever before been
                    assembled in the Christian cause he met the Moors in the battle of Zalláḳa
                    (Sacralias), a few miles from Badajoz (October 1086). After an obstinate
                    struggle victory declared for the infidels, and Alfonso had great difficulty in
                    escaping with his life. Luckily for the Castilians, Yúsuf was recalled to Africa
                    by the death of his eldest son, whom he had left at Ceuta, and his victory,
                    which might have been as decisive as that of Ṭáriḳ, was not followed up. Alfonso
                    even ventured to resume his aggressions, and laid siege to the important towns
                    of Murcia and Almeria. Mo'tamid, seeing that the danger was as great as ever,
                    proceeded to Africa in person in order to urge the return of Yúsuf. The
                    Almoravid prince, on whom the attractions of Andalusia had made a profound
                    impression, crossed again to Algesiras (1090), and this time the predictions of
                    the princes who had foreseen the risk of calling in so powerful an ally were
                    fully verified. Postponing the task of resisting Alfonso, Yúsuf set to work to
                    make himself master of Andalusia. Mo'tamid himself had to fly from his
                    territories, after a futile appeal for aid to the king of Castile. Captured by
                    the Africans, the emir of Seville was condemned to end his life in close
                    imprisonment. In the course of a few years the whole of Moslem Spain was
                    reunited under the king of Morocco, and the death of the Cid in 1099 enabled the
                    Moors to recover Valencia, which he had taken in 1094. This was the last event
                    of the reign of Yúsuf, who in 1103 handed over the government to his son 'Alí
                    and returned to Africa, where he died three years later at the ripe age of a
                    hundred years.</p>
                <p>Alfonso VI. of Castile had raised his kingdom to such pre-eminence in the
                    Peninsula that he had assumed the title of “emperor of Spain.” But a great
                    disaster clouded his later years. In 1108 his only son Sancho perished with the
                    flower of the Castilian chivalry on the fatal field of Ucles, and most of
                    Alfonso’s conquests passed into the hands of the victorious 'Alí. In 1109 the
                    emperor died, leaving the succession to his daughter Urraca, the widow of Count
                    Raymond of Burgundy. In order to secure the unity of the Christian kingdoms,
                    Urraca was married to Alfonso I. of Aragon (1104-1134), who imitated his
                    father-in-law in assuming the imperial title. But the marriage failed to produce
                    the desired result. Urraca induced the Castilian nobles to revolt against the
                    Aragonese rule and to set up Alfonso VII., her son by her first marriage. A
                    civil war ensued, which was only ended in 1127 by the separation of the
                    kingdoms. Alfonso I. retained Aragon and Navarre, while Castile, with Leon and
                    Galicia, passed to Alfonso VII. Alfonso of Aragon renewed the war against the
                    Moors which he had so gloriously begun by the capture of Tudela and Saragossa,
                    but in 1134 he was completely defeated in the battle of Fraga, a disaster which
                    hastened his death. As he had no children, he bequeathed his territories to the
                    great crusading order of the Templars. The Aragonese, however, refused to
                    recognize this testament, and gave the crown to his brother, Ramiro II.
                    (1134-1137), who was brought out of a monastery to continue the dynasty. Ramiro
                    fulfilled his duties by marrying a sister of the duke of Aquitaine, who bore him
                    a daughter, Petronilla. At the age of two the child was betrothed to Raymond
                    Berengar IV. of Barcelona, and Ramiro, leaving the administration of the kingdom
                    to his son-in-law, hastened to return to his cloister. Thus a permanent union
                    was effected between Aragon and Catalonia, both of which passed in 1162 to
                    Petronilla’s son, Alfonso II. But, if Catalonia was gained, another province,
                    Navarre, was lost. The Navarrese had long desired to recover their independence,
                    and on the death of Alfonso I. they refused to acknowledge Ramiro, and chose a
                    ruler of their own, Garcia Ramirez. Ramiro, who needed Garcia’s generalship
                    against a threatened attack from Castile, recognized him, first as a vassal of
                    Aragon and afterwards as an independent king. Thus Navarre regained its place
                    among the kingdoms of Spain, though it never enjoyed its old importance.</p>
                <p>The main interest of Spanish history in the 13th century centres round the war
                    against the Moors, which was beginning to attract the interest and assistance of
                    the other European states. It was the age of the great crusades, and Christendom
                    was absorbed in the struggle against the infidel, both in the East and West.
                    Spain, like Palestine, had its crusading orders, which vied with the Templars
                    and Hospitallers both in wealth and military distinction. The order of Calatrava
                    was founded in 1158, that of St James of Compostella in 1175, and the order of
                    Alcantara in 1176. The kingdom of Portugal, which had risen with great rapidity
                    in the 12th century, had a no less distinguished order, that of Evora. These
                    military priests, debarred by their profession from the ordinary interests of
                    humanity, gave a firmness and consistency to the Christian cause which had too
                    often been sacrificed to the dynastic quarrels of the temporal princes.</p>
                <p>The empire of the Almoravids, like so many of its predecessors, had soon begun to
                    fall to pieces. It was too large and unwieldy for permanence. Its real centre
                    was at Morocco, and the attention of the caliphs was absorbed in the affairs of
                    Africa, while the extortion and misgovernment of their viceroys excited
                    discontent among the Mohammedans of Spain. This state of things gave a great
                    advantage to Alfonso VII. of Castile, who revived the title of emperor of Spain,
                    allied himself with Raymond Berengar of Barcelona and Aragon, and sought to
                    emulate the achievements of his grandfather. For the second time the Moorish
                    power in Spain was only saved from dissolution by the arrival of reinforcements
                    from Africa. As happened so often in Mussulman history, a movement which began
                    with religious reform ended with the formation of an empire. Mohammed b.
                    'Abdallah, an Arab from Mount Atlas, gave himself out as the expected Mahdi, and
                    formed a sect known as the Almohades (Unitarians). His disciple, 'Abd al-Mu’min,
                    was chosen as his successor, and soon overthrew the power of the Almoravids.
                    Táshufín, 'Alt’s son, made a vigorous but ineffectual resistance, and the
                    conqueror crossed the sea to complete his work by the reduction of Spain (1146).
                    The success of 'Abd al-Mu’min, if less rapid than that of Yúsuf,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n340/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0340-0317"/> was quite as complete. The Almoravids appealed to
                    the Christians, and both Castile and Aragon came to their aid. Alfonso VII.,
                    with the help of the Genoese and Pisan fleets, besieged and took Almeria, while
                    Raymond Berengar captured Tortosa. But these successes were only temporary. In
                    ten years the Almoravids had been driven from the mainland, and only a small
                    remnant found refuge in the Balearic Islands. Almeria was again wrested from the
                    Castilians, and in 1157 Alfonso VII. died, the last of the series of “emperors
                    of Spain.” His territories were divided between his two sons, the elder, Sancho,
                    succeeding to Castile, while Leon went to his brother Ferdinand. The quarrels
                    which resulted from this partition would probably have been fatal to the
                    Christian cause but for the exertions of the great knightly orders. The
                    successors of 'Abd al-Mu’min (d. 1163), Yúsuf and Ya'ḳúb Almanṣór, continued to
                    advance the power of the Almohades, and the latter inflicted a crushing defeat
                    at Alarcos (1195) upon Alfonso VIII. of Castile, who had succeeded his father
                    Sancho in 1158. Castile was at this time distracted by the feuds of the great
                    families of Lara and Castro, and the count of Castro, who had been worsted by
                    his rival, rendered conspicuous service to the infidels in the battle. Even
                    Sancho of Navarre, out of jealousy of the rival kings, concluded an alliance
                    with the Almohades.</p>
                <p>Luckily for the Christians Ya'ḳúb, the most formidable opponent they had had to
                    face since the great Almanṣór, died in 1199, and his death was followed by a
                    rising of the Almoravids which took five years to suppress. Meanwhile successful
                    efforts had been made by the pope and clergy to arrange the differences among
                    the Christian states, and a confederation was formed between the five kings of
                    Castile, Aragon, Leon, Navarre, and Portugal. When Ya'ḳúb's successor, Mohammed
                    al-Náṣir, had succeeded in restoring order in Andalusia and prepared to march
                    against the Christians, he was confronted by the allies in the famous battle of
                    Las Navas de Tolosa, in the Sierra Morena (July 16, 1212). After an obstinate
                    struggle the Christians gained a decisive victory, and their success decided the
                    fate of Spain. The religious impulse which had constituted the original strength
                    of the Almohades had come to an end; they were regarded as infidels by the
                    orthodox Moslems, and the first failure necessarily led to their downfall. The
                    cruelties with which they sought to repress the rising discontent only excited
                    popular feeling against them, and when Al-Motawakkil, a descendant of the family
                    of Ibn Húd which had once ruled in Saragossa, raised the standard of revolt in
                    Andalusia, the bulk of the population joined him, and Al-Ma’mún, the last of the
                    Almohades who held any power in Spain, fled to Africa in 1232. The chief result
                    of their rule was to depress the Arab element in the Mussulman population of
                    Spain. Hitherto the Arabs, though numerically in a minority, had retained the
                    preponderance due to their original prestige. Henceforth the infidels of Spain
                    can only be considered and spoken of as Moors.</p>
                <p>After the fall of the Almohades the triumphs of the Christian arms were rapid and
                    decisive. The separation of Castile and Leon, which had been productive of so
                    much disaster, was finally terminated in 1230 by the accession of Ferdinand
                    III., the son of Alfonso IX. of Leon and Berengaria of Castile. The province of
                    Estremadura had been annexed to Leon by Alfonso IX., and now formed part of the
                    united kingdom which under Ferdinand III. rapidly extended itself southwards. In
                    1233 the Castilian army won a great victory over the Moors under Al-Motawakkil,
                    and three years later Ferdinand himself captured Cordova, so long the capital of
                    the Mohammedan rulers and one of the most wealthy and beautiful cities of
                    Europe. In 1237 Al-Motawakkil was assassinated, and with him perished the last
                    semblance of Moorish unity. The numerous emirs became independent rulers, and
                    the most powerful of them, Mohammed Ibn al-Aḥmar of Granada, became a tributary
                    of Castile and ceded the strong town of Jaen (1246). In 1248 Seville, the second
                    of the Mohammedan cities, submitted to Ferdinand, who within a few years annexed
                    Xerez de la Frontera, Medina Sidonia, and Cadiz. By these acquisitions the
                    frontier of Castile was extended to the southern coast before Ferdinand III.’s
                    death in 1252. A considerable number of Moors submitted to the rule of Castile,
                    but the Christians had become intolerant during the long war, and most of the
                    conquered population sought a new home either in Granada or in Africa.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Aragon had taken a no less important part in the struggle. Pedro I.
                    (1196-1213), the successor of Alfonso II., had excited the discontent of his
                    subjects, partly by seeking coronation from Pope Innocent III., and partly by
                    his excessive taxation. The “union” of nobles and towns compelled the king to
                    diminish his exactions. Pedro took part in the battle of Navas de Tolosa, but
                    his attention was diverted from Spanish affairs by his relationship with Raymond
                    of Toulouse, which involved him in the Albigensian crusade, where he met his
                    death. His son James I. (1213-1276), however, resumed the war against the
                    infidels, and won in it the title of “The Conqueror.” With the help of his
                    Catalonian subjects, at that time perhaps the most accomplished sailors in the
                    world, he conquered the Balearic Islands (1229-1233), which had long been a
                    stronghold of the Moslem and a centre for piratical attacks upon the Christian
                    states. Still more important was his reduction of Valencia (1238), which had
                    once before been conquered by Ruy Diaz. The last achievement of the great king
                    was the conquest of the province of Murcia (1266), the last of the Moorish
                    territories in Spain except Granada. Murcia, though reduced by Aragon, was
                    handed over to Castile. By the acquisition of Algarve Portugal had already
                    acquired frontiers which correspond roughly to those which it has at the present
                    day.</p>
                <p>From the latter half of the 13th century the crusading energy of the Spaniards
                    came to a sudden standstill, and the Moors were allowed to retain possession of
                    Granada for more than two centuries. The causes of this abrupt termination of
                    the war before it had reached what seemed to be its natural and legitimate end
                    have often been discussed. In the first place Castile was henceforth the only
                    state which was directly interested in the war. By the acquisition of Seville
                    and Murcia it had separated Granada both from Portugal and Aragon, neither of
                    which states had henceforth any conterminous frontier with the Moors. The state
                    of Granada, though small when compared with Castile, was by nature easily
                    defensible, as was made amply apparent in the last campaigns under Ferdinand and
                    Isabella. The attention of Castile was often distracted by foreign interests or
                    by internal dissensions. Again, the Moors were more concentrated and homogeneous
                    in Granada than they had been when their rule was more extensive. The large
                    subject population, many of whom were Christians or renegades, had been a great
                    source of weakness, and this no longer existed. They, like their opponents, had
                    given up the tolerance that had once distinguished them, and hardly any but true
                    Mohammedans can have remained in Granada. Something, too, must be attributed to
                    the wily policy and well-timed submission of Mohammed Ibn al-Aḥmar, who even
                    gave assistance to Ferdinand III. against the other Moorish emirs.</p>
                <p>With the termination of the crusade Spanish history loses what little unity it
                    had possessed for the last two<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0341-0318"/> centuries, and it becomes necessary to follow the
                    fortunes of each state separately. Into the history of Granada it is as
                    impossible as it would be tedious to enter within the limits of this article. It
                    is a long record of revolution and civil war, in which nothing above the most
                    petty personal interests are concerned. There is no change of dynasty, but one
                    perpetual struggle between members of the same family. It would not be easy to
                    enumerate even the names of the successive rulers, many of whom were several
                    times deposed and restored to power. Even during the final struggle, when the
                    existence of the kingdom was at stake and the one hope of resistance lay in
                    unity, the national cause was sacrificed to the jealous rivalry of three
                    claimants of the throne. The history of Castile and Aragon, on the other hand,
                    assumes a new character and interest when the attention of kings and people
                    ceased to be absorbed in the overwhelming excitement of a great religious
                    war.</p>
                <p>The constitution of Castile traced its origin back to the institutions of the
                    Visigoths, which had been carried by the original refugees into the mountains of
                    Asturias, but it had been profoundly modified by the circumstances under which
                    the kingdom had risen to greatness. The war with the infidel, while it had given
                    strength and unity to the monarchy, had at the same time compelled the granting
                    of considerable independence to the nobles and the great towns. The religious
                    character of the war had enabled the clergy to retain greater powers than they
                    possessed in any other European country, though they had lost that omnipotence
                    which they had enjoyed under the Visigoths. Their councils and synods, which had
                    once formed the sole constitutional machinery of the country, had been
                    superseded by the secular assembly of the cortes. The early history of the
                    cortes is wrapped in great obscurity, but its main outlines are fairly
                    discernible. Originally a meeting of the great nobles and royal household, it
                    had attained the position of a national assembly in 1162, when the deputies of
                    the chief towns were admitted to membership. Its powers and procedure developed
                    gradually, and naturally varied according to the character of the different
                    kings. Its first functions were the approval of legislation and the granting of
                    extraordinary taxation, though it is difficult to say when its sanction of such
                    measures was regarded as essential. The assembly consisted of the three
                    estates—clergy, nobles, and citizens —who deliberated sometimes separately and
                    sometimes together. Representation existed only in the case of the third estate,
                    whose members were elected at first by all free citizens and afterwards by the
                    municipal magistrates. The number of cities which sent deputies varied very much
                    at different times. As to what constituted the right of attendance in the case
                    of the nobles and clergy there is great obscurity, but it probably depended
                    partly upon tenancy-in-chief and partly upon royal summons. As both classes were
                    exempt from taxation, their functions were less important than those of the
                    third estate, and on more than one occasion we find meetings of the cortes in
                    which the upper orders took no part. The weakness of the assembly, as contrasted
                    with the English parliament, lay mainly in the absence of any class like the
                    knights of the shire to form a link between the burgesses and the great nobles.
                    In early times, probably the most effective check upon the royal power lay in
                    the independent privileges claimed and exercised by the chief feudatories. Their
                    tenants were bound to feudal service; and the right of private war made them
                    petty sovereigns on their own estates. The long feud of the families of Castro
                    and Lara is only a notable example of the difficulties which the central power
                    had to contend with. For the protection of their privileges, both nobles and
                    towns claimed the right of forming an armed union or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hermandad,</hi> which resembled the right of “confederation” exercised in later
                    times by the nobles of Poland. The ordinary administration, except when war was
                    going on, was local rather than central. The nobles had judicial powers within
                    their domains, though it appears that these were granted by the crown rather
                    than derived from their territorial position. The bishops and higher clergy
                    administered ecclesiastical jurisdiction as in other countries, and at the same
                    time exercised the same powers as the secular lords over the large estates which
                    the piety or superstition of generations of benefactors had conferred upon them.
                    The connexion with Rome, though established in the 11th century, had not become
                    very close before the middle of the 12th century; the appointment to most of the
                    benefices was in the hands of the crown, and the church of Castile was more
                    independent even than that of England. In the cities and great towns, most of
                    which included a considerable extent of adjacent territory, the administration
                    both of justice and of local affairs was in the hands of elected corporations,
                    which had received grants of liberties at the time when they had served as
                    important outposts against the attacks of the infidel. In theory, probably,
                    there existed in all cases a right of appeal to the crown, but this was a right
                    which, in the nature of things, was rarely exercised. The attempt of subsequent
                    kings to control or supersede the local administration of justice by the
                    appointment of <hi rend="italic">corregidores</hi> was always resisted as an
                    encroachment upon traditional liberties. Even the taxes, though granted by a
                    central assembly, were assessed and collected by the local officials, and
                    jealous care was taken to secure that they should only be applied to the purpose
                    for which the grant had been made.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand III., “The Saint,” was succeeded in 1252 by his son, Alfonso X., “The
                    Wise.” The new king gave up the military policy of his father, and the only
                    territorial acquisition of his reign, the province of Murcia, was won for him by
                    the arms of Aragon. On the other hand, he was a great student and patron both of
                    literature and science, especially of astronomy. He invited to his court the
                    most distinguished scholars not only in Christian but also in Arabic lore, and
                    he raised the university of Salamanca to rank with the great schools of Paris
                    and Oxford. He also turned his attention to legislation, and his code, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siete Partidas,</hi> is one of the great legislative monuments of
                    an age which produced the <hi rend="italic">Établissements</hi> of St Louis and
                    the great statutes of Edward I. Compiled under the influence of the civil and
                    canon laws, the <hi rend="italic">Siete Partidas</hi> was in some respects
                    disadvantageous, especially as admitting papal encroachments upon the
                    ecclesiastical power of the crown. Though drawn up under Alfonso X., it did not
                    finally supersede the ancient <hi rend="italic">fueros</hi> until 1348, when it
                    was formally approved by the cortes. But Alfonso’s reign, though distinguished
                    in the history of literature and law, was not on the whole a prosperous period
                    for Castile, and it was to a great extent his fault that the opportunity of
                    driving the Moors from the Peninsula was allowed to slip. On the fall of the
                    Hohenstaufen he came forward as a candidate for the imperial dignity, and
                    through the period known as the “great interregnum” he and Richard of Cornwall,
                    chosen by rival parties among the electors, bore the empty title of king of the
                    Romans. The expense of bribing the electors and of maintaining a magnificent
                    court involved Alfonso in pecuniary difficulties and compelled him to alienate
                    his subjects by imposing heavy taxes and by debasing the coinage. But the
                    hardships inflicted on the country by the king’s futile ambition were as nothing
                    compared with those which arose from a disputed succession to the crown. By the
                    old custom of Castile nearness<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n342/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0342-0319"/> of blood gave a superior claim to priority of
                    descent, so that the second son of a king would be preferred to the children of
                    the eldest son. The <hi rend="italic">Siete Partidas</hi> recognized the more
                    modern rule of succession; but, as that code had not yet been accepted by the
                    cortes, its ruling had no binding force. The question arose in 1275, when
                    Alfonso’s eldest son, Ferdinand de la Cerda, perished in a campaign against the
                    Moors, leaving two sons, Ferdinand and Alfonso. The king’s second son, Sancho,
                    was at once declared heir to the crown, but the widow, Blanche, announced her
                    intention to uphold the rights of her children, and she received support both
                    from Pedro III. of Aragon and from her brother, Philip III. of France. A long
                    war followed, which was further complicated when Alfonso X., having quarrelled
                    with his son, proposed a partition between the rival claimants. So far did the
                    dispute go that the Moors, instead of being attacked in Granada, were called
                    upon to give their assistance to the factions among their enemies.</p>
                <p>The result of these internal quarrels was to increase the already excessive power
                    of the noble families, and this was productive of further disturbances in the
                    reign of Sancho IV. (1284-1295). The family of Castro seems to have sunk into
                    comparative insignificance, but the Laras had found a new rival in the house of
                    Haro. The whole state was divided by their feuds, and the king found himself
                    degraded from the position of arbiter to that of a partisan. The condition of
                    affairs became even worse when the death of Sancho gave the crown to his infant
                    son Ferdinand IV. (1295-1312). In an early stage of society a minority is always
                    an evil, and Castile at this period had more than a fair share of such
                    misfortunes. The crown was contested, not only by the late king’s brother John,
                    but also by Alfonso de la Cerda, who returned from France to maintain a claim
                    which had already been negatived by the accession of Sancho. The king of Aragon
                    supported Alfonso, while the rulers of Portugal and Granada mixed themselves up
                    in the quarrel to obtain advantages for themselves. The regency had been
                    bequeathed by Sancho to his widow, Maria de Molina, but her marriage had been
                    declared uncanonical by the pope, so that a slur was cast upon the legitimacy of
                    her son. Nothing but the great skill and capacity displayed by the regent could
                    have secured victory under such discouraging circumstances. By mingled
                    submission and defiance she disarmed one opponent after another, induced the
                    pope to ratify her marriage, and finally succeeded in transferring the
                    government to her son on his coming of age. Ferdinand’s harshness provoked a
                    renewal of the conflict; but ultimately the treaty of Camillo (1305) put an end
                    to the struggle, and compensated the princes of La Cerda with lavish cessions of
                    territory. Alfonso preferred to remain an exile rather than to abandon his
                    claims, but his son accepted the proffered conditions and became the founder of
                    the great house of Medina Sidonia. But the treaty made little difference to the
                    country. Disorder and civil war had become a chronic disease in Castile, and
                    Ferdinand IV. was himself too deeply imbued with the spirit of the age to
                    maintain peace with a strong hand. The story that is told about his death
                    illustrates his character. In spite of a solemn promise made twice during his
                    reign that every accused person should have a fair trial, he ordered two
                    brothers of the name of Carvajal to be put to death without the pretence of
                    judicial forms. They summoned him to appear before the supreme tribunal within
                    thirty days, and on one morning within that period he was found dead in his bed.
                    The cause of his death was never ascertained, but the people regarded the event
                    as a judgment, and he has received from this story the name of “The Summoned”
                    <hi rend="italic">(El Emplazado).</hi></p>
                <p>Ferdinand IV.’s death was followed by another and still longer minority, as his
                    son, Alfonso XI. (1312-1350), was only two years old at the time. The regency
                    was claimed by the late king’s brother Don Pedro and by his uncle Don John, and
                    from this dispute arose a civil war fiercer and more destructive than any of its
                    predecessors. The central authority ceased to exist; both nobles and towns had
                    to protect themselves as best they could; the royal domains were seized upon by
                    rapacious neighbours, and the person of the young king was only saved by his
                    being concealed in the cathedral of Avila. At last the mediation of the pope and
                    of Maria de Molina brought about a compromise, and the administration was
                    divided between the two regents,—Pedro taking the south-eastern and John the
                    north-western provinces (1315). But a few years later they were both killed in a
                    joint campaign against the emir of Granada, and the disorders broke out with
                    worse violence than ever (1319). Four “infants,” as the members of the royal
                    family were called, contended for the government, and the assumption of power by
                    the king himself at the age of fifteen failed to put a stop to their feuds. The
                    character of Alfonso XI. was as harsh and brutal as was to be expected in a man
                    who had been educated in such troubled times. He invited his cousin, a younger
                    Don John, to a banquet in the royal palace, and treacherously murdered him. His
                    treatment of his first wife, whom he divorced in order to marry a daughter of
                    the king of Portugal, provoked her father, Don John Emanuel, a nephew of Alfonso
                    X., to head a rising which took years to suppress. The Portuguese princess was
                    also repudiated by her husband, who had been inspired with a passion for the
                    beautiful Eleanor de Guzman, and the forces of Portugal were added to those of
                    the Castilian rebels. After a long struggle (1335-1337) Alfonso XI. succeeded in
                    reducing his opponents to submission, while he conciliated Alfonso IV. of
                    Portugal by restoring his daughter to her position as queen. The restoration of
                    unity was extremely opportune, as Spain was threatened at this moment by a new
                    invasion from Africa. Abu 'l Ḥakam, the head of the Merinids and emir of Fez,
                    crossed over to Gibraltar with a huge army in 1339, and was acknowledged as
                    suzerain by the ruler of Granada. Assistance was obtained both from Aragon and
                    Portugal, and in 1340 Alfonso XI. marched to the relief of Tarifa, which was
                    besieged by the Moors. On the banks of the Salado the Christians won a great
                    victory, which destroyed the last chance of a revival of the Mohammedan power in
                    Spain. Abu Ί Ḥakam fled to Africa, and in 1344 Alfonso concluded a glorious war
                    by the reduction of Algesiras. In the hope of cutting off all connexion between
                    Granada and Africa, Alfonso laid siege to Gibraltar in 1350, but before he could
                    accomplish his design he was carried off by the Black Death. His victories over
                    the infidel have led the Spanish historians to gloss over the acts of cruelty
                    and treachery which have left an ineffaceable stain upon his character. His
                    reign, troubled as it was, constitutes an important epoch in the history of
                    Castilian liberties. In 1328 he issued two laws which formed the firmest basis
                    of the powers of the cortes. He recognized the right of that assembly to be
                    consulted in all important matters of state, and he solemnly pledged himself and
                    his successors not to impose any new tax without its approval and consent. These
                    concessions were to some extent counterbalanced by his restriction of the right
                    of electing deputies to the <hi rend="italic">regidores</hi> or magistrates of
                    each city. This narrowing of the franchise was a great blow to the popular
                    rights, and it gave the crown facilities for tampering with the elections which
                    were frequently abused in later days. But at the time the municipal magistrates
                    enjoyed considerable independence, and for several generations the cortes showed
                    no signs of subservience. In fact<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0343-0320"/> Alfonso’s position made him dependent upon the
                    support of the citizens against the great lords, so that he was not likely to
                    aim at diminishing the power of the former class. Another important event of the
                    reign was the granting by the cortes, for the expenses of the Moorish war, of
                    the <hi rend="italic">alcavala,</hi> a tax of a twentieth upon every sale of
                    real or personal property. This tax, one of the most ruinous that can be
                    conceived, illustrates the want of economical insight in the 14th century, and
                    was destined in later times to seriously impede the industrial and commercial
                    development of Spain.</p>
                <p>The atrocities of Alfonso XI.’s reign sink into insignificance when compared with
                    those committed by his son and successor, Pedro I. (1350-1369). The story of the
                    latter’s rule is mainly derived from the narrative of his avowed enemies, but
                    there is no reason to doubt the substantial accuracy of the charges which have
                    given him the name of “The Cruel.” Some of his actions may perhaps be attributed
                    to a politic desire to destroy the ascendency of the great nobles, whom the
                    princes of the royal house had often headed against the crown; but most of them
                    can only be explained by a thirst for bloodshed which almost amounted to mania.
                    He ascended the throne at the age of sixteen, and was at once urged by his
                    mother Maria of Portugal to avenge the wrongs which she had endured at the hands
                    of her rival, Eleanor de Guzman. The unfortunate Eleanor was strangled in
                    prison, and her sons could only secure safety by flight. The eldest, Henry of
                    Trastamara, found a refuge first in Portugal and afterwards in France. A wife
                    was now found for the young king in Blanche, daughter of the duke of Bourbon, in
                    the hope of strengthening his throne by a French alliance. But Pedro had formed
                    a connexion with Maria de Padilla; and, when he was at last induced to go
                    through the marriage ceremony with Blanche, he quitted her immediately to return
                    to his mistress, whose brothers he advanced to the chief offices of state. A
                    conspiracy of nobles, headed by Alfonso of Albuquerque, lately the king’s
                    favourite, was suppressed with ruthless severity. Pedro now concluded a second
                    marriage with Juana de Castro, although Blanche was still living, but he again
                    returned to Maria de Padilla. Another conspiracy, backed up by the pope and the
                    French king, was more successful. After standing a long siege in Tordesillas,
                    Pedro was compelled to concede the demands of the coalition and to acknowledge
                    Blanche as his lawful queen. But his submission was only feigned. Seizing the
                    opportunity of a hunting-party to escape from the imprisonment in which he was
                    kept at Toro, he rallied a mercenary army round him and took terrible vengeance
                    upon his opponents (1355-56). Henry of Trastamara, who had joined in the rising,
                    escaped to France, where he took part in the war against the English. It would
                    be wearisome to catalogue the long list of cruelties, beginning with the murder
                    of the unfortunate Blanche of Bourbon, of which Pedro was guilty during the next
                    ten years. It seems almost incredible that such a monster should have been
                    allowed to reign in a country which had already shown so much independence as
                    Castile. But several causes combined to secure him against deposition. In the
                    first place, it was upon the nobles and the Jews that his hand fell with such
                    severity, while to the citizen class he was on the whole a lenient ruler. This
                    explains why it was that the cortes made little or no opposition when he
                    endeavoured to secure the succession to his own children. In 1362 he solemnly
                    swore that he had been lawfully married to Maria de Padilla, and his four
                    children by her were recognized as heirs to the crown. His son Alfonso, however,
                    died in the same year, and only two daughters, Constance and Isabella, survived
                    their father. Another point in Pedro’s favour was the outbreak in 1356 of a war
                    with Aragon, which lasted almost without intermission for the rest of the reign,
                    and in the course of which the Aragonese king was joined by Henry of Trastamara.
                    Much as the Castilian nobles hated Pedro, they hated Aragon still more, and they
                    were unwilling to accept a king who might seem to be forced upon them by the
                    neighbouring kingdom. This war was in a way harmful to the interests of both
                    kings. They were both eager to depress the powerful nobles in their territories,
                    but their continued hostilities only enabled these nobles to extend their power.
                    On more than one occasion this community of interest was on the verge of leading
                    to an agreement which would probably have excluded the house of Trastamara for
                    ever from Castile, but each time national and personal enmity combined to revive
                    the quarrel. Though Castile was larger and possessed of more resources than its
                    rival, the presence of a large number of Castilian exiles in Aragon made the
                    combat fairly even. But in 1365 Henry of Trastamara obtained new and more
                    formidable auxiliaries. Charles V. of France, who was now beginning to
                    reorganize that country after the English wars, was only too glad to allow the
                    disorderly bodies of disbanded soldiers to seek employment in Spain under the
                    leadership of Bertrand du Guesclin. To these formidable enemies Pedro did not
                    venture to offer resistance, and fled to Bayonne, while his half-brother Henry
                    was everywhere acknowledged as king (1366). But Pedro succeeded in convincing
                    the Black Prince of the justice of his cause and of the impolicy of allowing the
                    French king to gain overwhelming influence in the Peninsula. Before the end of
                    the year Edward’s army had crossed the Pyrenees, a number of English mercenaries
                    in Du Guesclin’s service deserted to the banner of their old leader, and in
                    April 1367 was fought the great battle of Najera or Navarrete, near Logrono. Du
                    Guesclin was taken prisoner; Henry of Trastamara fled to France; and Pedro was
                    restored to his throne. But the Castilian king had learnt no wisdom from
                    adversity. His barbarity disgusted his allies, who were further alienated by his
                    failure to furnish his promised supplies. The fever had already begun to
                    decimate his troops and to weaken his own health when the Black Prince quitted
                    Castile. His departure gave another opportunity to Henry of Trastamara, who had
                    obtained fresh reinforcements from Charles V. In 1369 the battle of Montiel was
                    decided in Henry’s favour. Pedro was taken prisoner, and was killed in a
                    personal struggle with his rival, into whose tent he was brought. His two
                    surviving daughters had been left as hostages at Bordeaux, and were married to
                    two brothers of the Black Prince, —John of Gaunt, and Edmund Langley, duke of
                    York.</p>
                <p>Henry II. (1369-1379) was of illegitimate birth, and his marriage with the
                    heiress of the La Cerdas was hardly sufficient to remove all doubts as to his
                    claim to the succession. But within his kingdom he met with little opposition.
                    The Castilians were glad to settle down under an orderly government after the
                    late reign, and the few malcontents exiled themselves to join the foreign
                    claimants of the throne. The most important of these was Pedro I. of Portugal,
                    whose grandmother belonged to the legitimate line of Castile, and John of Gaunt,
                    who came to Spain to vindicate the rights of his wife Constance. Pedro I. proved
                    for a time a formidable enemy. He allied himself with the Moors, who seized the
                    opportunity to recover Algesiras, and with the king of Aragon, who annexed the
                    border districts of Castile. But Pedro was an incapable warrior, and soon
                    abandoned his own claim to obtain the English support by acknowledging John of
                    Gaunt. But this enabled Henry to renew his alliance with France, and with the
                    help of French troops he invaded Portugal, besieged Lisbon, and compelled Pedro
                    to make peace.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0344-0321"/> Two years later a treaty was concluded with the
                    king of Aragon, by which his conquests were restored. For the remainder of his
                    reign Henry’s throne was secure, and he left the kingdom in peace to his son
                    John I. (1379-1390). The chief interest of the new reign centres round the
                    relations with Portugal. The first renewal of the war was the work of the
                    Portuguese king Ferdinand, who again supported the English claims upon Castile.
                    But the alliance with England was not popular in Portugal, and in 1383 a treaty
                    was concluded, which, however, proved productive rather of evil than of good.
                    Beatrix, the only daughter of Ferdinand, was married to the Castilian king; and
                    it was agreed that her children, whether male or female, should succeed to the
                    throne of Portugal. A few months later Ferdinand died. Beatrix was at once
                    proclaimed queen, and her mother undertook the regency. But the idea of union
                    with Castile, which would involve the subordination of the smaller kingdom, was
                    intensely unpopular at Lisbon. A rising overthrew the authority of the
                    queen-mother, and the administration was entrusted to John, a brother of the
                    late king. John of Castile at once entered Portugal to enforce what he
                    considered to be the rights of his wife. But his high-handed measures only added
                    strength to the opposition, and made the new regent the leader of a national
                    movement. In 1384 the Castilian forces laid siege to Lisbon, which held out with
                    obstinate resolution for five months, when the besiegers retired. Exulting in
                    their success, the Portuguese determined to have nothing more to do with
                    Beatrix; and an assembly of the cortes gave the crown to the regent John. The
                    Castilian king now made a determined effort to uphold his failing cause, but at
                    the great battle of Aljubarrota (August 1385) his army suffered a crushing
                    defeat. It was now the turn of the Portuguese to take the aggressive, and the
                    arrival of John of Gaunt enabled them once more to take up his cause. It was
                    only the aid of France and the dislike of the Castilians for the foreign-bred
                    Constance and her husband that enabled John to make head against his numerous
                    enemies. In 1387 he succeeded in terminating the English part of the quarrel.
                    His eldest son Henry, the first heir to the crown who received the title of
                    prince of Asturias, was betrothed to Catherine, daughter of Constance, in whose
                    favour John of Gaunt renounced all claims on behalf of his wife (1387). The war
                    with Portugal now sunk into a chronic struggle on the frontier, but was still
                    going on when John I. died in 1390.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Henry III. (1390-1406), a boy of eleven, Castile was again
                    face to face with the difficulties of a minority, and these were the more
                    formidable on account of the absence of any prince of the blood-royal to assume
                    the regency. By the will of the late king the administration was entrusted to a
                    council to be formed by joint representation of the three estates. But the
                    composition of this body was altered so as to give more power to the great
                    nobles and prelates, and their quarrels soon involved the kingdom in the
                    troubles of a civil war, from which it had been comparatively free in the last
                    two reigns. Luckily for Castile, the young king, who assumed the government in
                    1393, showed himself to be a man of equal insight and resolution. By throwing
                    himself boldly upon the support of the third estate, and by giving them the
                    predominance in the cortes, he succeeded in taking efficient measures against
                    the nobles. All domain-lands which had been alienated during his minority had to
                    be restored, and all confederations among the barons were declared illegal and
                    dissolved. The discontent which these measures provoked was promptly suppressed
                    before it could develop into insurrection. At the same time the country enjoyed
                    the blessings of external peace. Henry’s marriage with Catherine of Lancaster
                    secured him against hostilities not only from England but also from Portugal,
                    whose queen was Catherine’s sister. Unfortunately for the kingdom which he ruled
                    with such wisdom and success, Henry III. died in 1406 at the early age of
                    twenty-seven, leaving an infant son to succeed him.</p>
                <p>The minority of John II. was the most orderly period of his reign (1406-1454).
                    The government was wielded by the able hands of his uncle Ferdinand, to whom the
                    Castilians would have given the crown if he had been willing to supplant his
                    nephew. Even after his accession to the throne of Aragon in 1412 he continued to
                    give his advice to the queen-mother. The administration during these years was
                    strong and orderly. The fortress of Antequera was taken from the Moors, and the
                    Castilian nobles were kept in the same subjection as in the late reign. A new
                    and disastrous period commenced in 1417, when the death of his mother
                    transferred the reins of government to John II. at the age of fourteen. Averse
                    to the cares of business and absorbed in personal pleasures, the young king was
                    only too ready to allow himself to be guided by any one who would take the
                    responsibility of rule upon his own shoulders. Before many years had elapsed he
                    had fallen completely under the influence of Alvaro de Luna, grandmaster of the
                    order of St James and constable of Castile. The minister, possessed of all the
                    qualities which would have endowed a great monarch, set himself to increase the
                    royal power. Not only were the nobles depressed to a condition of impotence
                    which they had never yet experienced, but steps were also taken to diminish the
                    powers of the third estate. Many of the lesser towns in Castile, as in England
                    at the same period, found that the right of representation involved pecuniary
                    burdens which they were eager to get rid of. This made it easy for the minister
                    to reduce the number of towns sending deputies to the cortes to some seventeen
                    or eighteen of the larger cities. This diminution of the third estate, though
                    not resented, was an insidious blow at its real interests, and made it easy for
                    Charles V. and his successor to reduce the cortes to impotence. The arbitrary
                    government of John II., which might have been endured if it had been really
                    directed by the king himself, was intolerable to the nobles when it was known to
                    be inspired by his minister. The reign is filled by a series of conspiracies, in
                    which the domestic malcontents found powerful allies in John II.’s cousins, John
                    and Henry of Aragon. But Alvaro de Luna was a warrior as well as a politician,
                    and succeeded in foiling all direct attempts to effect his overthrow. His
                    ultimate fall was due to the ingratitude of the king whom he had served too
                    well. John’s second wife, Isabella of Portugal, disgusted at the small amount of
                    influence which the minister allowed her to exercise, set herself to effect his
                    overthrow. Once deprived of the royal favour, Alvaro de Luna had no further
                    support to rest upon. The very absolutism which he himself had built up was
                    turned against him, and he was executed after a trial which was notoriously
                    unfair. A year later John II. followed him to the grave, and the crown passed to
                    his son, Henry IV., the feeblest sovereign that ruled in Castile before the 17th
                    century. His mind was as feeble as his body, and the contempt of his subjects
                    has fixed upon him the title of “The Impotent.” His first favourite, the marquis
                    of Villena, was supplanted, after Henry’s marriage with Joanna of Portugal, by
                    Beltran de la Cueva, whom scandal declared to be the queen’s paramour. The birth
                    of a daughter did nothing to check these rumours, and the unfortunate infanta
                    was only known as “la Beltraneja.” The government was not exactly oppressive,
                    but it failed to command respect, and personal jealousies and ill-feeling were
                    sufficient to produce a revolt. The leaders were the marquis of Villena<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0345-0322"/> and Carillo, archbishop of Toledo, both of whom
                    had objects of their own to serve. In 1465 the rebellion broke out, and its
                    first act was the formal deposition of Henry at Avila, after an absurd ceremony
                    in which the king was represented by a puppet. The conspirators denounced the
                    infanta Joanna as illegitimate, and offered the crown to Henry’s brother
                    Alfonso. In the course of the civil war which followed, Alfonso died (1468), and
                    his partisans at once put forward the claims of his sister Isabella. But the
                    infanta, who already displayed a wisdom and moderation beyond her years, refused
                    to be involved in hostilities with her elder brother, and she succeeded in
                    arranging a treaty by which she was recognized as Henry IV.'s heiress. The king
                    himself struggled hard to evade these conditions, and after his death in 1474
                    Joanna’s cause was espoused by her uncle, Alfonso V. of Portugal. But Isabella
                    succeeded in securing her accession to the throne, and her marriage with
                    Ferdinand of Aragon, by paving the way for the union of the two kingdoms, begins
                    a new period in which for the first time there is a real history of united
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Aragon which we left in the reign of James the Conqueror
                    (1213-1276), consisted of the three provinces of Aragon, Catalonia, and
                    Valencia. Each province retained its own laws and institutions, and Valencia and
                    Catalonia regarded with the keenest jealousy any attempt to govern them on the
                    principles which prevailed in Aragon. The powers of the crown were far more
                    limited than in the neighbouring kingdom of Castile. The great nobles, or <hi
                    rend="italic">ricos hombres,</hi> formed a small and exclusive class, whose
                    privileges made them almost the equals of the monarch. All conquests had to be
                    divided between them, and the king was forbidden to confer a fief or honour upon
                    any person outside their ranks. They possessed and exercised the right of
                    private war, and were entitled at will to renounce their allegiance to their
                    sovereign. The smallness of their numbers made them much more united than the
                    nobles of Castile, and proportionately more formidable. The difference between
                    the two kingdoms was recognized by Ferdinand the Catholic with his usual
                    acuteness when he said that “it was as difficult to divide the nobles of Aragon
                    as it was to unite those of Castile.” But the privileges of the nobles, great as
                    they were, were not the only check upon the royal power. Each province had its
                    own cortes, which possessed from a very early date the right of granting taxes
                    and approving legislation. In Valencia and Catalonia the cortes consisted, as in
                    Castile, of the ordinary three estates; but in Catalonia, where a maritime life
                    had inspired the inhabitants with a passionate love of freedom, the commons
                    enjoyed a predominance which was hardly to be paralleled in any other country in
                    the Middle Ages. The cortes of Aragon, which were more important, and whose
                    history has been more carefully elucidated, consisted of four estates or arms
                    <hi rend="italic">(brazos).</hi> Besides the great prelates and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ricos hombres,</hi> both of whom had the right of appearing by
                    proxy, there was a separate chamber of smaller landholders. This contained the
                    <hi rend="italic">infanzones,</hi> or lesser tenants-in-chief, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caballeros</hi> or knights, who were tenants of the greater barons
                    but whose military rank gave them the right of personal attendance. The fourth
                    chamber alone was representative, and consisted of the deputies of the towns.
                    Their presence is first mentioned in 1133, thirty years before anything is heard
                    of popular representation in Castile. Their numbers were naturally small, as the
                    kingdom was of very limited extent, but it seems to have been early established
                    that a town which had once sent deputies was permanently entitled to the
                    privilege, and this preserved them from having their rights tampered with by the
                    crown as was done in Castile. Besides their legislative and taxative functions,
                    the Aragonese cortes were also a supreme court of justice, and in this capacity
                    were presided over by the <hi rend="italic">justiciar,</hi> an official whose
                    unique powers have attracted the attention of all writers on Spanish history. In
                    its origin the office had nothing very remarkable about it, and it is only the
                    peculiar circumstances of the kingdom which forced it into such prominence. The
                    justiciar was not at first entrusted with any political functions, but the
                    difficulty of adjusting the relations between the king and the barons led to his
                    being called in as mediator. By the 14th century he had become almost the
                    supreme arbiter in all constitutional questions. To him the people could appeal
                    against any infraction of their liberties, while the king regarded him as his
                    chief councillor and as the most efficient barrier against armed rebellion,
                    which was the only alternative method of settling disputes between his subjects
                    and himself. As the justiciar thus became the pivot of the constitution, it was
                    of great importance to secure that he should exercise his functions with
                    firmness and impartiality. As the <hi rend="italic">ricos hombres</hi> were
                    exempted from corporal punishment, he was always chosen from the lesser nobles
                    or knights, and was made responsible to the cortes under penalty of death. The
                    dignity of the office was enhanced by the character of its successive holders;
                    and the mediaeval history of Aragon abounds with instances of their fearless
                    opposition to the crown and of their resolute resistance to despotism on the one
                    hand and to anarchy on the other.</p>
                <p>The glorious reign of James (I.) the Conqueror was disturbed towards its close by
                    quarrels which arose from his scheme of partitioning his conquests among his
                    children. The death, however, of his youngest and favourite son put an end to
                    these projects, and the most important of the provinces passed into the hands of
                    Pedro III. (1276-1285). Under Pedro and his son and successor Alfonso III.
                    (1285-1291), attention was almost wholly diverted from internal affairs to the
                    conquest of Sicily. By his marriage with Constance, the daughter of Manfred,
                    Pedro could put forward a claim to succeed to the Hohenstaufen in Naples and
                    Sicily, but it is not probable that he would have been able to make any use of
                    the claim if the Sicilian Vespers (1283) had not thrown that island into his
                    hands. The result was a long series of wars with the Angevin rulers of Naples,
                    but the hold upon Sicily was steadily retained. These wars had a notable
                    influence upon Aragonese history, as they compelled the kings to purchase the
                    support of their subjects by concessions which could only with great difficulty
                    have been extorted from them. Thus in 1283 Pedro III. granted the famous
                    “General Privilege,” the Magna Carta of Aragon. By this the crown formally laid
                    down a number of rules to secure all classes against oppression. The General
                    Privilege is quite as important a document as the English charter; it is even
                    more full and precise, and its numerous confirmations show that it was as highly
                    prized. It had the additional advantage of being issued to a people already
                    possessed of institutions sufficiently developed to employ and defend the
                    national liberties. But if Pedro’s concessions were for the advantage of his
                    country, his successor went to an extreme which was equally harmful. In 1287
                    Alfonso III. signed the famous “Privilege of Union,” by which his subjects were
                    formally authorized to take up arms against their sovereign if he attempted to
                    infringe their liberties. The right of revolt, while it is and must be the
                    ultimate safeguard against oppression, becomes at once liable to abuse when it
                    is formulated and discussed. The act of 1287 gave an unlimited licence to
                    disorder, which could always disguise itself under the pretence of defending
                    liberty. Until it was repealed<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0346-0323"/> there was always a danger that the constitution
                    would succumb, not to the tyrannical usurpations of the crown, but to the
                    selfish interests of the nobles.</p>
                <p>On the death of Alfonso III. the crown passed to his brother James II.
                    (1291-1327). The new king handed over Sicily to his younger brother Frederick,
                    thus creating a separate dynasty in that island. In the hope of depressing the
                    greater barons, James II. strengthened the hands of the justiciar and sought to
                    conciliate the clergy and citizens to the crown. By these steps he succeeded in
                    avoiding any open conflict during his reign, and at the same time he sought to
                    secure external unity by an edict which declared the three provinces of Aragon,
                    Catalonia, and Valencia to be for ever indivisible (1319). But his successor,
                    Alfonso IV. (1327-1336), did not hesitate to break this edict, in spirit if not
                    in letter, by carving out great fiefs for his second wife, Eleanor of Castile,
                    and her children. By this measure he gave rise to the difficulties, aud
                    indirectly to the triumphs, of his son, Pedro IV. (1336-1387). Pedro’s reign is
                    a great epoch in Aragonese history, as to him is due the arrest of the
                    tendencies which threatened to divide and destroy the kingdom. He began by
                    recalling his father’s excessive grants to his stepmother and his half-brothers.
                    The intervention of Alfonso XI. of Castile on behalf of his sister failed to
                    make any impression upon the king, and it was only the pressing danger from the
                    Moors, which was removed in 1340 by the Castilian victory on the Salado, that
                    induced him at last to consent to a compromise. The same desire to unite all the
                    possessions of the Aragonese crown is apparent in his treatment of the king of
                    Majorca, James II., the descendant of James I.’s younger son, who had received
                    from his father the Balearic Islands with Roussillon and Cerdagne as a vassal
                    kingdom. As James II. showed inclination to evade his legal duties towards his
                    suzerain, Pedro seized the first opportunity to pick a quarrel with him. In 1344
                    all the territories of the king of Majorca were declared to be united to Aragon;
                    and, though James II. made an obstinate resistance, he met with little support
                    from his former subjects, and the hopeless struggle was ended by his death in
                    1348.</p>
                <p>These high-handed measures not unnaturally excited the misgivings of the nobles
                    of Aragon, whose privileges were not likely to be very scrupulously respected by
                    a prince with such an obvious sense of his own rights and duties. In 1347 chance
                    gave them an eminent and capable leader. There was no law against female
                    succession in Aragon, and there was the precedent of Queen Petronilla in its
                    favour. On the other hand, there was a strong prejudice against it, and as a
                    rule preference had been given to males, although further removed from the
                    direct line. Pedro IV. had an only daughter, Constance, and he was eager to
                    secure the succession to her in preference to his brother James, who was
                    popularly regarded as the heir to the throne. This unconcealed intention excited
                    the indignation of James, who was already discontented at the harsh treatment of
                    the king of Majorca. He had no difficulty in inducing most of the chief nobles,
                    including his half-brothers, to form a “Union," which was also joined by several
                    of the towns in their discontent at the projected settlement of the succession
                    (1347). Pedro was taken by surprise and could only gain time by concessions. He
                    promised to convoke annual meetings of the cortes, to choose his councillors
                    with the approval of the estates, to revoke his will in favour of his daughter,
                    and to recognize his brother as his heir. Soon after this agreement, which left
                    the Union master of the situation, James died; and men were not slow in
                    attributing his death to the machinations of the king. This event was of the
                    greatest advantage to Pedro, as it deprived his opponents of their leader, and
                    from this moment the rebellion began to be split up by personal rivalries. The
                    king and his advisers were not slow to avail themselves of the opportunity thus
                    offered. The opposition was strongest in Aragon and Valencia, and Pedro
                    succeeded in gaining over the Catalonians, who were always prone to act in
                    isolation from the other provinces. With the troops thus acquired he met the
                    army of the Union at Epila (1348) and won a complete victory. He followed up his
                    success by destroying all the charters which gave any sanction to armed
                    resistance to the crown, and especially the Privilege of Union of 1287. His
                    elder half-brother Ferdinand, who had succeeded James as leader of the revolt
                    and as heir-apparent to the throne, fled to Castile, but the chief nobles were
                    severely punished, and the power of the crown was raised to a height which it
                    had never before attained.</p>
                <p>Thus Aragon, following the tendencies of the age, became centralized under a
                    powerful monarchy, and the forces of feudal disunion received a final check. But
                    Pedro IV. was far from establishing anything like a despotism. While destroying
                    the Privilege of Union, he took a solemn oath to respect the political and
                    personal liberties of his subjects, and enjoined the same oath upon his
                    successors. At the same time he strengthened the powers of the justiciar, whose
                    pre-eminence dates from this reign. The position of the king was immensely
                    strengthened by the birth of a son, which destroyed the claims of his
                    half-brothers. The later part of his reign was occupied with a war against Henry
                    II. of Castile, which has been referred to above, and with resistance to James
                    III. of Majorca, who made an unsuccessful effort to recover the territories of
                    his father. Pedro concluded a second marriage with Sibilla, daughter of a
                    Catalonian knight, and her influence involved him in a quarrel with his eldest
                    son, whom he attempted to deprive of the office of lieutenant-general, which
                    custom assigned to the heir to the throne. But he found that the authority of
                    the justiciar was now strong enough to restrain the crown as well as the nobles.
                    Dominic de Cerda, who now held the office, pronounced that the infant was
                    legally entitled to the dignity from which he had been ousted, and compelled the
                    king to restore him. The brief reign of John I. (1387-1395) was mainly occupied
                    with wars in Sicily and Sardinia. The expense which these involved, which was
                    increased by the luxury of a magnificent court, excited the most lively
                    discontent on the part of the cortes. The remonstrances of his subjects were
                    resented by the king, but they were backed up by the authority of the justiciar,
                    and John I. gave way so far as to banish the unpopular favourites from the
                    court. On the king’s death his daughters were passed over, and the crown was
                    transferred to his brother Martin, who was occupied in restoring the Aragonese
                    supremacy in Sicily. Under Martin a private war between the great families of
                    Urrea and Luna was put down, and the dependence of the great nobles was more
                    firmly secured. But the death in 1409 of the king’s only son, Martin the
                    younger, brought the kingdom face to face with the difficulty of a disputed
                    succession. There were two male claimants,—the count of Urgel, a great-grandson
                    of Alfonso IV., and the duke of Gandia, a grandson of James II. The former was
                    the undoubted heir if the succession was absolutely limited to males, while the
                    latter was advanced in years and could only bring forward the old contention of
                    nearness to the royal stock. But, although precedent was in favour of the
                    exclusion of females, there was no definite rule to prevent the succession of
                    their male descendants. Of such claimants there were two,—Louis of Calabria, the
                    son of John I.’s daughter Violante, and Ferdinand, infant of Castile, the son of
                    Martin’s sister Eleanor. Moreover,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0347-0324"/> Martin the younger had left an illegitimate son,
                    Frederick, count of Luna, and if the question had arisen a century earlier,
                    before tho clergy had obtained so much power, it is probable that his claims
                    would have been preferred. The question was still unsettled on the death of the
                    elder Martin in 1410, with whom ended the male line of the counts of Barcelona.
                    A prolonged civil war seemed inevitable, and for two years the kingdom endured
                    the evils of an interregnum. If the dispute was to be settled by force of arms,
                    the count of Urgel seemed likely to carry all before him, as he had the pretty
                    unanimous support both of the Catalans and of the powerful family of Luna. But
                    his followers, confident in their superiority, allowed themselves to indulge in
                    acts of violence which alienated the more orderly part of the population. The
                    justiciar, Juan de Cerda, who had acted with such impartial firmness in the
                    reign of John I., succeeded in forming a patriotic party which determined to
                    settle the dispute by a legal decision. Jealousy of the De Lunas gave to this
                    party the support of the rival house of Urrea. They succeeded in procuring the
                    appointment of a joint commission of nine members,—three from the cortes of each
                    province. After a careful examination of all the claims, the commissioners
                    decided, on what principle it is difficult to determine, in favour of the infant
                    Ferdinand, who was then acting as regent of Castile for his nephew John II.
                    (1412). As far as ability and merit went, the choice was probably the best that
                    could have been made. By mingled firmness and concession Ferdinand succeeded in
                    restoring order and unity to the kingdom and its dependencies. A revolt headed
                    by the disappointed count of Urgel in the next year was suppressed, and its
                    leader was punished with the confiscation of his territories and perpetual
                    imprisonment.</p>
                <p>Thus the house of Trastamara succeeded in obtaining the crown of Aragon as well
                    as that of Castile. Ferdinand I., the first king of the new dynasty, did not
                    live long to wield the sceptre which he had so fortunately acquired. On his
                    death in 1416 the crown passed to his son Alfonso V. (1416-1458). The new prince
                    played little part in Aragonese history, as his attention was almost wholly
                    absorbed in the affairs of Italy. To his inherited possessions of Sicily and
                    Sardinia he added the kingdom of Naples after a seven years’ contest with the
                    Angevin claimant, René le Bon of Provence (1435-1442). From this time he never
                    quitted his new kingdom, where his politic rule and his patronage of literature
                    acquired for him the name of “The Magnanimous.” During his absence the
                    government of Aragon was entrusted to his brother John, as lieutenant-general.
                    The arbitrary character of this prince, which is so clearly visible in his
                    subsequent history, seems to have been foreseen by his subjects. In order to
                    secure the justiciar from undue influence on the part of the crown, a law was
                    made in 1442 that the office should be held for life, and that its occupant
                    could only be dismissed by the king with the express approval of the cortes. In
                    1461 this provision was followed up by another law which directed that all
                    complaints against the justiciar should be heard before a commission regularly
                    chosen from the four estates.</p>
                <p>The history of John, both as regent for his brother and later as king in his own
                    right, centres round the family quarrels which finally led to a formidable
                    rebellion against him. His first wife was Blanche, widow of Martin of Sicily and
                    heiress of Navarre. This little kingdom, which comprised territory on both sides
                    of the Pyrenees, had been more closely connected with France than with Spain
                    since its separation from Aragon on the death of Alfonso I. (1134). In the 13th
                    century it was united to the French crown by the marriage of Jeanne of Navarre
                    with the French king, Philip IV., but it again became independent on the death
                    of Louis X. in 1315. His daughter Jeanne was the undoubted heiress of Navarre,
                    and, though she was kept out of her rights by her uncles, Philip V. and Charles
                    IV., she was allowed to succeed after their death. In 1329 she was crowned at
                    Pamplona with her husband, Philip of Evreux. Her son, Charles the Bad
                    (1349-1387), obtained an unenviable notoriety for the part which he played in
                    French history during the troublous period of the English wars. His son, Charles
                    III. (1387-1425), was a peace-loving prince, who devoted more attention to art
                    and literature than to politics. The marriage of his daughter Blanche with John
                    of Aragon brought the mountain-kingdom once more into close connexion with the
                    western peninsula. By her marriage contract, Navarre was to pass on her death to
                    her children and not to her husband, but a later agreement enjoined her son,
                    before assuming the sovereignty, to obtain “the goodwill and approbation of his
                    father.” When Blanche died in 1442, John seems to have considered that this
                    later stipulation justified him in retaining the title of king of Navarre,
                    though he entrusted the administration of the kingdom to his son, Charles of
                    Viana. For some time no difficulty was made about this arrangement. But in 1447
                    John married a second wife, Joanna Henriquez, a descendant of the royal family
                    of Castile, and a few years later he sent Joanna to share the government of
                    Navarre with his son. This appointment, coupled with the arrogant conduct of his
                    stepmother, was regarded as an insult by Charles of Viana, who was not slow to
                    remember that by right he was entitled to the crown. The old parties of Navarre,
                    the Beaumonts and Agramonts, seized the opportunity to renew their feuds,—the
                    former espousing the cause of the prince, the latter that of the queen. Before
                    long the dispute developed into civil war, and John marched into Navarre to
                    assist his wife, who was besieged in Estella by her stepson. At Aybar the
                    hostile forces met in open conflict, but the superior discipline of the royal
                    troops gave them a complete victory, and Charles fell a prisoner into his
                    father’s hands (1452). The prince was released after a short imprisonment, but
                    the reconciliation was only a hollow one. The birth of a son to Joanna Henriquez
                    (1452), afterwards famous as Ferdinand the Catholic, was a serious blow to the
                    interests of the elder son. The queen scarcely concealed her desire to secure
                    the succession to her own child, and her influence over her husband was
                    unbounded. Charles found that his defeat had given the supremacy in Navarre to
                    the hostile party, and after a vain attempt to recover his power he went to
                    Naples to appeal to his uncle Alfonso V. But his hopes in this quarter were
                    destroyed by Alfonso’s death in 1458. Of his possessions, Aragon, Sicily, and
                    Sardinia passed to his brother John II., while Naples, as a private acquisition
                    of his own, was bequeathed to his natural son Ferdinand. The Neapolitan barons,
                    dreading the gloomy and tyrannical character of their new ruler, offered to
                    support Charles of Viana as a candidate for the throne, but he refused to oppose
                    his cousin, and retired to Sicily, where he spent the next two years in
                    seclusion. In 1460 he was induced to return by the solicitations of his father,
                    who seems to have been disquieted by the popularity which the prince had
                    obtained among the Sicilians. The intrigues of Joanna were not long in exciting
                    the old mistrust between father and son, and her hostility towards Charles was
                    increased by his attempts to obtain the hand of Isabella of Castile, whom she
                    had already fixed upon as a suitable bride for her own son Ferdinand. In 1461
                    Charles was induced to meet his father at Lerida, and was at once imprisoned.
                    When asked about the cause of this arbitrary proceeding, John<pb break="no"

                    But his subjects were not prepared to acquiesce in this unnatural treatment of a
                    prince whom they had learned to love and whom they regarded as their future
                    ruler. The Catalans, always easily moved, rose in arms and marched upon Lerida,
                    and it was only by a hasty retreat that John was able to escape with his court
                    to Saragossa. But the revolt speedily spread from Catalonia to the other
                    provinces, and even to Sicily and Sardinia, while it found supporters in the
                    king of Castile and in the faction of the Beaumonts in Navarre. Surrounded by
                    enemies, John II. found it necessary to yield. He not only released his son,
                    professing that he did so at his wife’s request, but appointed him
                    lieutenant-general of Catalonia and promised not to enter that province without
                    the permission of the cortes. But no sooner had Charles of Viana regained his
                    liberty than he died, on September 23, 1461; and the circumstances led ready
                    credence to be given to the suspicion that he had been poisoned during his
                    captivity.</p>
                <p>The crown of Navarre now devolved by right upon Charles’s elder sister Blanche,
                    who had been married to and afterwards repudiated by Henry IV. of Castile. But
                    she had incurred her father’s enmity by the support which she had given to her
                    brother; and John II. was not unwilling to curry favour with France by securing
                    Navarre to his second daughter Eleanor of Foix, whose son Gaston had married a
                    sister of Louis XI. The unfortunate Blanche was committed to the guardianship of
                    her younger sister, and after two years of imprisonment in the castle of Orthez
                    she died of poison. But Eleanor reaped little advantage from the crime which all
                    historians impute to her. Her father retained the crown of Navarre till his
                    death, and she only survived him a few weeks. She was succeeded by her grandson
                    Francis Phoebus, but he only lived for four years, and his sister and heiress
                    Catherine brought the crown of Navarre by her marriage to the French house of
                    D’Albret, from which it was wrested by Ferdinand the Catholic in 1512. This
                    third union with Aragon proved permanent, although the district north of the
                    Pyrenees was subsequently annexed to France.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the troubles of John II. were by no means removed by his son’s death.
                    In Aragon the young Ferdinand was acknowledged as heir, and was then sent with
                    his mother to Catalonia to receive the oath of allegiance from that province.
                    But the Catalans rose again in rebellion, and besieged Joanna and her son in the
                    fortress of Gerona. As John II. was unable to advance through the revolted
                    province to his wife’s relief, he purchased the assistance of Louis XI. by a
                    promise of 200,000 gold crowns, as security for which he pledged the counties of
                    Roussillon and Cerdagne (1462). The Catalans replied to this alliance by
                    throwing off their allegiance to John and proclaiming a republic. As, however,
                    Gerona was relieved by the French, and the royal troops succeeded in reducing
                    several of the chief towns, they determined to appeal for foreign aid. The crown
                    was offered first to Henry IV. of Castile and then to the constable of Portugal,
                    who was descended from the old counts of Barcelona. On the death of the latter
                    in 1466 the rebels turned to the traditional rivals of the house of Aragon, and
                    offered the crown to René le Bon, the head of the Angevin house. René, whose
                    life had been spent in putting forward claims which he had never been able to
                    enforce, accepted the offer and sent his chivalrous son John of Calabria to
                    assist the Catalans (1467). John II.’s fortunes were now at their nadir. He had
                    lost his eyesight, and the death of his wife in 1468 deprived him of the
                    companion and adviser who had for years directed and inspired his policy. John
                    of Calabria, whose enterprise was secretly encouraged by the treacherous king of
                    France, was steadily regaining much of the ground which had been lost by the
                    Catalans before his arrival. But the old king, whose sight was restored by a
                    surgical operation, fought on with a dogged obstinacy worthy of a better cause.
                    The death of the duke of Calabria in 1469 deprived his opponents of their
                    leader, and from this moment their ultimate defeat was inevitable. The fall of
                    Barcelona (1472) completed the reduction of Catalonia. But John did not venture
                    to abuse the victory which he had so hardly won. He granted a general amnesty,
                    and took a solemn oath to respect the constitution and liberties of the
                    conquered province. The only notable event of the remaining years of John II.’s
                    reign was an attempt to recover Roussillon and Cerdagne. But Louis XI. kept a
                    firm hold by arms upon the provinces which his diplomacy had won, and they were
                    only restored to Aragon in 1493 when Charles VIII. ceded them to Ferdinand the
                    Catholic. In 1479 the death of John II., at the ripe age of eighty-two,
                    transferred the crown to his son Ferdinand, λvho ten years before had concluded
                    his marriage with Isabella of Castile.</p>

                <p>The history of Spain as a united state dates from the union of Castile and Aragon
                    by the marriage of Isabella and Ferdinand. The marriage took place in 1469,
                    before the accession of either sovereign. In 1474 the crown of Castile was
                    claimed by Isabella on the death of her brother Henry IV., whose daughter Joanna
                    was universally believed to be illegitimate. It was contended by the partisans
                    of Ferdinand that female succession was prohibited in Castile, and that he was
                    entitled to the crown as the nearest male heir after his father. Ultimately the
                    question was settled in Isabella’s favour, and she obtained the most important
                    rights of sovereignty, though the government was carried on in their joint
                    names. It is possible that Ferdinand would have refused to accept this
                    arrangement, if concerted action had not been necessary to oppose the party
                    which espoused the cause of Joanna. A number of the Castilian nobles, headed by
                    the marquis of Villena, dreaded the danger to the privileges of their order that
                    might arise from the establishment of a strong government. They found an ally in
                    Alfonso V. of Portugal, who was Joanna’s uncle by the mother’s side, and who
                    cherished the design of obtaining the Castilian throne by a marriage with his
                    niece. In 1476 the confederates were routed in the battle of Toro, and Alfonso
                    departed to France with the chimerical plan of seeking assistance from Louis XI.
                    The treaty of St Jean de Luz between France and Castile in 1478 ruined these
                    hopes, and in the next year Alfonso was compelled, by the treaty of Lisbon, to
                    abandon the cause of his niece. This terminated the war of succession in
                    Castile; and Joanna, known from her reputed father as La Beltraneja, retired
                    into a convent. A few months before the treaty of Lisbon the death of John II.
                    (January 20, 1479) gave to Ferdinand the succession to Aragon, Sicily, and
                    Sardinia. Navarre, which had been brought<pb break="no"

                    daughter by that marriage, Eleanor, countess of Foix. Two provinces of the
                    Aragonese crown, Roussillon and Cerdagne, had been pledged by John to Louis XI.
                    of France, and were still retained by that monarch. The union of Castile and
                    Aragon effected in 1479 was merely a personal union. Each province retained its
                    own institutions and its own laws, and each would have resented the idea of
                    absorption in the other.</p>
                <p>The first care of the two sovereigns was to reform the system of government,
                    especially in Castile, where the recent civil wars had given rise to serious
                    disorders. One of their chief objects was to depress the nobles, whose
                    privileges, acquired during the long struggle against the Moors, were
                    inconsistent with a strong centralized government. In accordance with true
                    policy and with the spirit of the age Ferdinand and Isabella sought to
                    counterbalance the nobles by relying upon the burgher class. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Santa Hermandad,</hi> or Holy Brotherhood, which was organized in
                    1476, was a popular confederation of the whole kingdom for police and judicial
                    purposes. Its affairs were managed by local courts,—from which appeals could be
                    made to a supreme tribunal,—and by a general junta composed of deputies from all
                    cities, which was convened once a year. A body of 2000 cavalry was at the
                    disposal of the association, and a special code of laws for its guidance was
                    compiled in 1485. The institution was completely successful in maintaining order
                    and in diminishing the independence of the local jurisdiction of the great
                    nobles. About the same time the lavish grants from the royal domain, which had
                    enriched the nobles at the expense of the crown, were revoked, the central
                    judicial courts were made more efficient by the introduction of trained lawyers,
                    and steps were taken to codify the numerous laws that had been made since the
                    <hi rend="italic">Siete Partidas</hi> of Alfonso X. The grandmasterships of the
                    great orders of St Iago, Calatrava, and Alcantara, which conferred powers too
                    great to be entrusted to a subject, were on successive vacancies secured to the
                    crown. Trade was encouraged by protective measures, by the breaking down of the
                    barriers between Castile and Aragon, by a strict reform of the currency, and by
                    the commutation for a fixed impost of the detested <hi rend="italic"
                    >alcavala,</hi> a tax of one-tenth upon all sales and transfers of property.</p>
                <p>The increased prosperity of the country is well illustrated by the steady rise of
                    the revenue. “In 1474, the year of Isabella’s accession, the ordinary rents of
                    the Castilian crown amounted to 885,000 reals; in 1477 to 2,390,078; in 1482,
                    after the resumption of the royal grants, to 12,711,591; and finally, in 1504,
                    when the acquisition of Granada and the domestic tranquillity of the kingdom had
                    encouraged the free expansion of all its resources, to 26,283,334, or thirty
                    times the amount received at her accession. All this was derived from the
                    customary established taxes, without the imposition of a single new one”
                    (Prescott, ii. 575). No attack was made upon the liberties of the subjects; the
                    cortes of Castile were frequently convened; the same towns were called upon to
                    send deputies; and the only innovation was the frequent neglect to summon the
                    nobles. The numerous <hi rend="italic">pragmaticas,</hi> or royal ordinances,
                    were mostly limited to administrative matters or to the interpretation of the
                    law. The credit for the domestic administration rests mainly with Isabella.
                    Ferdinand busied himself more with military and diplomatic affairs, and
                    comparatively few innovations were made in Aragon. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermandad</hi> was introduced, and in some other points the example of Castile
                    was followed. But the advanced constitutional liberties of Aragon were
                    uncongenial to Ferdinand. He summoned the cortes as rarely as possible; and when
                    that assembly met he spared no pains to influence its composition and its
                    decisions. The centralizing tendencies of the reign were carried still further
                    in both provinces in the later period when Ximenes, who became archbishop of
                    Toledo in 1495, exercised the chief influence. Five councils were entrusted with
                    the administration of affairs :—the “royal council,” the chief court of justice;
                    the “council of the supreme” for ecclesiastical business; the “council of the
                    orders” for the great military fraternities; the “council of Aragon” for the
                    management of that kingdom and of Naples; and the “council of the Indies” for
                    the great discoveries of Columbus and his companions.</p>
                <p>The political unity of Spain was to be based upon its religious unity. Both
                    Ferdinand and Isabella were imbued with that stern spirit of orthodoxy with
                    which the Spaniards were inspired by their long crusade against the infidel. No
                    institution of their reign was so important as the Inquisition, which was
                    authorized by a bull of Sixtus IV. in 1478, and constituted for the two kingdoms
                    in 1483 under the presidency of Torquemada. Its extension to Aragon was bitterly
                    protested against by the liberty-loving people, but was forced upon them by the
                    iron will of Ferdinand. The activity of the Holy Office was at first directed
                    against the Jews, whose obstinate adherence to their faith in spite of
                    persecution was punished by an edict for their expulsion in 1492. Their
                    departure deprived Spain of many industrious inhabitants; but its importance has
                    been much exaggerated by authors who have failed to notice that it was followed,
                    not by the decline of Spain, but by the period of its greatest prosperity. In
                    spite of their orthodoxy, however, Ferdinand and Isabella were by no means
                    slavish adherents of the papacy. The claim of the popes to appoint to important
                    benefices was strenuously resisted, and the chief control of ecclesiastical
                    affairs was successfully vindicated for the crown.</p>
                <p>The steady extension of the royal power in Spain was due in no small degree, as
                    Machiavelli has pointed out, to the constant succession of enterprises in which
                    the attention of the nobles was absorbed. These enterprises may be summarized
                    under three heads :—(1) the union of the Peninsula; (2) the extension of
                    colonial empire; and (3) the acquisition of foreign territories.</p>
                <p>(1) Under the first head the most important achievement was the final extinction
                    of the Moorish power in Spain. The war which began in 1481 was carried on in a
                    desultory manner for ten years, and was completed in 1492 by the conquest of
                    Granada. The Moors, who had fought with the courage of despair, received very
                    lenient terms from their conquerors. They were secured in the free exercise of
                    their religion, and were allowed to retain their own laws, customs, and
                    language. In some points, such as the trade with Africa, they obtained
                    privileges which were not even shared by the Castilians. But the spirit of
                    proselytism was too strong in Spain to allow this treaty to be observed. The
                    measures taken by Ximenes to bring about the conversion of the Moors provoked a
                    revolt in 1500, which was put down with great severity. They were compelled to
                    choose between conversion or banishment, and, although most of them accepted the
                    former alternative, the Moriscoes, as they were now called, found themselves
                    henceforward in the hopeless position of a proscribed and hated minority. In
                    1493 Ferdinand extorted from the fears and hopes of Charles VIII. of France the
                    restoration of Roussillon and Cerdagne by the treaty of Barcelona. In 1512,
                    after Isabella’s death, he annexed Navarre. The whole Peninsula was now united,
                    with the exception of Portugal, and steps had been taken for the acquisition of
                    that kingdom by marriage. Isabella, Ferdinand’s eldest daughter, was married to
                    Alfonso, the son and heir of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0350-0327"/> John II. of Portugal. After the death of that
                    prince his widow married Emanuel, who succeeded to the Portuguese crown in 1495.
                    Isabella herself died in giving birth to a son, but the connexion was still
                    maintained by the marriage of Emanuel to her younger sister Mary. The fruits of
                    this persistent policy were not reaped, however, till the reign of Philip
                    II.</p>
                <p>(2) Maritime discovery was the task of the age, a task forced upon it by the
                    Turkish occupation of the Levant, which had closed the old commercial routes to
                    the East. The foremost pioneers in the work were the Portuguese and Spaniards,
                    whose efforts brought them into rivalry with each other. The treaty of Lisbon in
                    1479 secured the western coast of Africa to Portugal, but enabled Spain to
                    complete the annexation of the Canaries. The Spaniards now turned further
                    westwards, and a wholly new problem was created by Columbus’s discovery of the
                    West Indies in 1492. His voyage had been undertaken under the patronage of
                    Isabella, and the new territories were regarded as pertaining to Castile. To
                    solve any difficulties that might arise, a bull was obtained from Alexander VI.
                    in 1493, which granted to Spain all discoveries west of an imaginary line drawn
                    100 leagues to the west of the Azores and the Cape Verd Islands. As this
                    arrangement excited Portuguese discontent, it was modified by a treaty at
                    Tordesillas in 1494, which removed the boundary line to 370 leagues west of the
                    Cape Verd Islands. This modification had important results for the Portuguese,
                    as giving them their subsequent claim to Brazil. In the meanwhile Spain
                    redoubled its exertions. In 1498 Columbus landed on the continent of South
                    America, and in a few years the whole western coast was explored by subsequent
                    adventurers. In 1512 Ponce de Leon discovered Florida, and in the next year
                    Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien and gazed for the first time upon the
                    Pacific. No exertions were spared by the Government to encourage settlement in
                    its new territories; but the regulations of colonial trade, and especially the
                    provision that it should pass through the single port of Seville, were conceived
                    in a narrow and selfish spirit which prevented the full development of their
                    resources.</p>
                <p>(3) The foreign affairs of the reign, which were almost wholly connected with
                    Italy, were conducted by Ferdinand on behalf of Aragon, just as the extension of
                    the colonies was directed for the benefit of Castile. Charles VIII.’s invasion
                    of Naples, which was ruled by an illegitimate branch of the house of Aragon, was
                    undertaken in the full belief that the support or at least the neutrality of
                    Spain was secured by the treaty of Barcelona. But Ferdinand, jealous of the
                    rapid success of the French, seized the first pretext to disregard the treaty,
                    and became a member of the league which was formed at Venice in 1495 against
                    Charles. His troops, under the famous Gonsalvo de Cordova, took a prominent part
                    in restoring Ferdinand II. to the Neapolitan throne. With the accession of Louis
                    XII. came a great change in Ferdinand’s policy, and he determined to advance the
                    claim to Naples which he himself possessed as the legitimate head of the
                    Aragonese house. By the treaty of Granada in 1500 Naples was to be divided
                    between France and Spain, and the reigning king Frederick could make no
                    resistance to such overwhelming forces. But a quarrel naturally arose about the
                    terms of the partition, and by 1504 Gonsalvo de Cordova succeeded in expelling
                    the French from Naples, which was henceforth annexed to the crown of Aragon.</p>
                <p>In 1504 the unity of Spain was interrupted for a time by the death of Isabella.
                    The successive deaths of the infant John (1497), of Isabella of Portugal (1498),
                    and of her infant son Miguel (1500) had left the succession in Castile to the
                    second daughter, Joanna; she was married to the archduke Philip, son of
                    Maximilian I., and ruler, through his mother Mary of Burgundy, of the
                    Netherlands and Franche-Comté. Unfortunately Joanna, who was the mother of two
                    sons, Charles and Ferdinand, had already given signs of that insanity which was
                    to cloud the whole of her subsequent career. Philip, who had visited Spain in
                    1502, had then excited the distrust of his wife’s parents, and Isabella by her
                    will left the regency in Castile to her husband until the majority of their
                    grandson Charles. But Ferdinand, in spite of his brilliant successes, was not
                    popular among the Castilian nobles, who seized the opportunity to support the
                    more natural claims of Philip to govern on behalf of his wife. Ferdinand showed
                    his disgust by actions which threatened to undo all the previous objects of his
                    policy. He concluded a treaty with Louis XII. in 1505, by which he undertook to
                    marry the French king’s niece, Germaine de Foix. To her Louis resigned his
                    claims upon Naples, but in case of her death without issue his share in the
                    kingdom by the treaty of Granada was to revert to France. Thus Ferdinand was
                    willing to gratify his spite and to perpetuate the division between Aragon and
                    Castile, under the penalty of forfeiting his recent conquests in Italy. His
                    second marriage was concluded in March 1506, and two months later he resigned
                    the regency in Castile to Philip, and soon afterwards sailed to Naples.</p>
                <p>But the division of the Peninsula was not destined to last long. On September 25
                    Philip died at the age of twenty-eight, and the devotion of Ximenes secured the
                    restoration of the regency to Ferdinand. Joanna, who had been devotedly attached
                    to her husband, lost all semblance of reason after his death, and made no
                    attempt to exercise any influence over the conduct of affairs. The remaining
                    part of Ferdinand’s reign is uneventful in the history of Spain. The government
                    was carried on on the same system, but with more avowed absolutism, as during
                    the lifetime of Isabella. Ximenes, whose energies found insufficient occupation
                    in the compilation of his Polyglott Bible and in the foundation of the
                    university of Alcala de Henares, fitted out and headed an expedition to Oran in
                    1509, which resulted in extensive but short-lived conquests in northern Africa.
                    Ferdinand threw himself with more energy than ever into the current of European
                    politics. By joining the league of Cambray he wrested from Venice five important
                    towns in Apulia which had been pawned to the republic by Ferdinand II. As a
                    member of the Holy League against France he succeeded in conquering Navarre in
                    1512. Navarre had passed to the French family of Albret by the marriage of
                    Catharine de Foix with Jean d’Albret, and it was the close connexion with France
                    which gave Ferdinand a pretext for its invasion. In 1515 his new conquest was
                    formally incorporated with the kingdom of Castile. This was Ferdinand’s last
                    success; and he died on January 23, 1516. His will recognized Joanna as his
                    heiress in Aragon, and his grandson Charles as the regent in both kingdoms.
                    Until his arrival, the administration of Castile was entrusted to Cardinal
                    Ximenes and that of Aragon to his own natural son, the archbishop of
                    Saragossa.</p>
                <p>With the death of Ferdinand begins the period of uninterrupted Hapsburg rule in
                    Spain, which lasted for nearly two centuries. In the course of this period the
                    monarchy obtained absolute authority, and Spain, after rising for a time to be
                    the foremost state in Europe, sank to the position of a second-rate power, from
                    which it has never since emerged. At first the condition of affairs was by no
                    means promising for the crown. The unity of Spain, which had advanced with such
                    rapid strides after the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, had been seriously
                    shaken by the selfish policy pursued by the king since his<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n351/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0351-0328"/> wife’s death. Aragon and Castile were distinct
                    kingdoms, and the former was again divided into the three provinces of Aragon,
                    Catalonia, and Valencia, each of which had its own cortes, its own privileges,
                    and the most warmly-cherished traditions of independence. Classes were
                    everywhere divided against each other, and within each class jealousies and
                    quarrels were frequent. The foreign possessions of the two crowns were a source
                    of weakness rather than of strength. France stood ready at the earliest
                    opportunity to contest the possession of Navarre with Castile, and that of
                    Naples with Aragon.</p>
                <p>The difficulties of domestic government were increased by the fact that the
                    prospective ruler was a youthful foreigner, who had never visited Spain, and who
                    was completely ignorant of the customs and even of the language of the country.
                    Charles had been born and educated in the Netherlands, of which he had been
                    nominal ruler ever since the death of his father in 1506. All his friends and
                    advisers were Flemings, who cared nothing for Spanish interests and had already
                    acquired an evil reputation for selfish greed. The first symptom of discontent
                    in Spain was excited by Charles’s demand to be recognized as king, in utter
                    disregard of his unfortunate mother. In Aragon the demand was unhesitatingly
                    refused, but in Castile the vigorous measures of Ximenes secured Charles’s
                    proclamation. The regent, however, had great difficulties to face. The nobles,
                    delighted to be rid of the strong government of Ferdinand, wished to utilize the
                    opportunity to regain the privileges and independence they had lost. In this
                    crisis the loyal devotion of Ximenes saved the monarchy. Throwing himself upon
                    the support of the citizen class, he organized a militia which overawed the
                    nobles and maintained order. A French invasion of Navarre was repulsed, and to
                    avoid any danger from the discontent of the inhabitants all the fortresses of
                    the province, with the single exception of Pamplona, were dismantled. These
                    distinguished services were rewarded with more than royal ingratitude by
                    Charles, who came to Spain in 1517, and who allowed the aged cardinal to die on
                    November 8 without even granting him an interview.</p>
                <p>The young king soon felt the loss of so able and experienced an adviser. His
                    Flemish ministers, with Chièvres at their head, regarded Spain as a rich booty
                    to be plundered at will. The Castilians, the proudest nation in Europe, found
                    all the places of honour and profit seized by greedy foreigners. The cortes had
                    shown their loyalty by acknowledging Charles as joint-king with his mother and
                    by granting him an unprecedented service of 600,000 ducats. But they had
                    accompanied their grants with eighty-eight significant demands, which the young
                    king accepted but made no pretence of fulfilling. In Aragon and Catalonia more
                    difficulty was experienced. Nearly two years were wasted in obtaining the
                    recognition of the royal title, and no supplies were forthcoming. Valencia was
                    not visited at all, and the attempt to induce the people to do homage to a
                    viceroy was a failure. A civil war broke out in the province between the
                    privileged nobles and a <hi rend="italic">germandada,</hi> or brotherhood, of
                    the burgher class. The Government exasperated parties by supporting each in
                    turn, but ultimately threw in its lot with the nobles.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the death of Maximilian had given Charles the succession to the
                    considerable Hapsburg territories in Germany, and in 1519 the German electors
                    had chosen him to be king of the Romans. He was now the first prince in Europe;
                    and it was necessary for him to leave Spain to look after his interests in
                    Germany and to cement there alliances which he needed against the inevitable
                    hostility of France. But his elevation by no means increased his popularity in
                    Castile. The Castilians had already plenty of grounds for complaint in the
                    rapacity of the Flemings and in Charles’s failure to perform his promises to the
                    cortes. But these were as nothing compared with the prospect that Castile might
                    no longer be the primary state of their king, and that their revenues might be
                    employed in the attainment of objects in which they had not the slightest
                    interest. While opinions were thus excited, Charles, who had been reduced to
                    great straits by his military preparations and his promises to the German
                    electors, summoned the cortes to meet at Santiago (Compostella) in Galicia, and
                    thence transferred them to Coruna in order to embark as soon as he had obtained
                    the supplies he needed. The place of meeting was carefully chosen so as to
                    isolate the assembly and to expose it to royal influence or intimidation. The
                    lead of the opposition was taken by Toledo, which refused to send its two
                    deputies, as being too favourable to the crown, but sent other representatives
                    to remonstrate with Charles and to encourage the other cities. They were driven
                    from Coruna, and the deputies of Salamanca were excluded from the cortes. By
                    these and similar means the desired grant was extorted. Charles hastened to quit
                    Spain with the first favourable wind, leaving Adrian of Utrecht as regent in
                    Castile, and two native nobles in Aragon and Catalonia. His departure was really
                    necessary for his other interests; but it must have seemed reckless to the
                    Spaniards at a time when Valencia was in the flames of civil war and Castile was
                    on the verge of rebellion. Before starting he had ordered the removal of the
                    magistrates of Toledo, and had sent a new governor to reduce the city to
                    obedience. The citizens, headed by a young noble, Juan de Padilla, resisted this
                    order and raised the standard of insurrection. Other cities hastened to join the
                    movement, and a central committee, known as the “Holy Junta,” established itself
                    at Avila. The unfortunate regent, a churchman of distinguished piety and gentle
                    character, found himself face to face with difficulties that would have taxed
                    all the resources of Ximenes. His attempt to reduce Segovia by arms was a
                    lamentable failure, and he had to confess his utter defeat by disbanding his
                    forces. The nobles, alienated by the appointment of a foreigner to the regency,
                    made no attempt to check a movement against a Government they detested. The
                    insurgents had matters their own way, and Padilla, advancing to Tordesillas,
                    made himself master of the person of Joanna, in whose name it was intended to
                    conduct the government. But this move was less advantageous than it at first
                    appeared. Joanna refused to transact any business or to sign any document, and
                    this public proof of her incapacity served to justify Charles’s contention that
                    he was the only possible ruler. The Castilians were not prepared to get rid of
                    the monarchy, so that it was necessary for the rebels to consider the
                    possibility of coming to terms with Charles. The “Holy Junta,” which had moved
                    from Avila to Tordesillas, drew up a series of demands, which, if acceded to,
                    would have established a constitutional monarchy in Spain. But their envoys to
                    Germany found it impossible even to secure an audience from the king, and
                    meanwhile the failure of the insurrection was decided. The very ease with which
                    the rebels had triumphed proved an evil, because it encouraged internal
                    dissensions which opposition might have healed. Especially Burgos showed its
                    jealousy of the leading position which had been assumed by Toledo. Class
                    differences, the bane of every country in the Middle Ages, supplied the final
                    stumbling-block. Many of the demands of the communes were diametrically opposed
                    to the interests of the nobles, whose eyes were at last opened to the danger of
                    their attitude of neutrality. Their chief grievance had been removed by
                    Charles’s appointment of<pb break="no"

                    joint-regents with Adrian. An army was raised, and on the field of Villalar the
                    forces of the communes were utterly defeated (April 23, 1522). Padilla, who had
                    shown more enthusiasm than ability, was executed, and one city after another was
                    reduced to submission. A portion of the victorious army was sent to the
                    assistance of the nobles in Valencia, where the <hi rend="italic"
                    >germandada</hi> was at last crushed. The return of Charles to Spain in June
                    1522 completed the triumph of the monarchy. In 1523 he convened the Castilian
                    cortes, and compelled them to grant supplies before presenting their petitions
                    for redress, thus establishing a precedent which was conclusive for the
                    future.</p>
                <p>Charles’s reign belongs to the history of Europe rather than to that of Spain,
                    and has been sufficiently treated elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Charles</hi> V.). His enormous inheritance was increased by the successes of
                    Cortes in Mexico and of Pizarro in Peru, by his own annexation of the Milanese,
                    and by his conquests in northern Africa. In the government of this vast empire
                    Spain played an important but on the whole a subordinate part. Its soldiers and
                    its subsidies were Charles’s most effective weapons, and to render them more
                    readily available it was necessary to depress still further the liberties of the
                    country. The independence of the towns had been crushed at Villalar, but only by
                    the intervention of the nobles; and these had now to pay the penalty of their
                    selfish loyalty. In 1538, after Charles had for a time concluded his struggle
                    with France by the truce of Nice, he proposed to raise supplies in Castile by an
                    excise upon commodities. The nobles objected on the ground of their exemption
                    from taxation, and the emperor had to give way. But he took his revenge by
                    excluding them altogether from the cortes, which henceforth consisted only of
                    thirty-six deputies from eighteen towns, a body that was powerless to oppose the
                    wishes of the crown.</p>
                <p>The vast enterprises in which Charles was involved exhausted his energies, and
                    the failure of his policy in Germany reduced him to despair. In 1555-5G he
                    resigned all his dignities, and ended his life in 1558 in retirement at Yuste.
                    From this time the house of Hapsburg is divided into the two branches of Spain
                    and Austria. Charles’s brother Ferdinand became king of the Romans and obtained
                    the German territories of the family, to which he had added the crowns of
                    Bohemia and Hungary. Philip IL, Charles’s only legitimate son, succeeded to the
                    Spanish and Burgundian inheritance, with the addition of Milan. Philip II., like
                    his father, played a great part in European history (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philip</hi> IL), but with this important difference that Castile was definitely
                    the central point of his monarchy, and that his policy was absolutely directed
                    by Spanish interests. In character and education he was a Spaniard of the
                    Spaniards, and after 1559 he never quitted Spain. He gave the country a capital,
                    which it had never yet possessed, by fixing his residence at Madrid. Castile,
                    under the direct supervision of the king, was subjected to the most crushing
                    despotism. Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia were governed as mere provinces, in
                    the same manner as Milan, Naples, and Sicily. The continuance of the old
                    divisions of the country, while it lessened its strength, was an immense
                    advantage to the royal power. It was easy for the king to employ the forces of
                    one province to crush the liberties of the others. And Philip possessed a
                    formidable weapon in the Inquisition, which he did not scruple to use for
                    secular purposes. Political independence was crushed with the same relentless
                    severity as religious dissent. Hitherto Aragon had preserved its mediaeval
                    privileges almost intact. The king was not entitled to the allegiance of the
                    province until he had solemnly sworn to observe its “fueros.” For the decisions
                    of the cortes unanimity was required, so that each deputy had a practical right
                    of veto. The authority of the justiciar rivalled that of the crown. It was
                    natural that Philip should seize the first opportunity of attacking institutions
                    which could thwart his will. In 1590 Antonio Perez (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Perez),</hi> a minister who had incurred the king’s displeasure, fled to Aragon
                    and appealed to its fueros for protection. Philip had him brought before the
                    Inquisition, and when the people rose in defence of their liberties they were
                    crushed by troops from Castile. The justiciar was put to death, and his
                    successors became nominees of the crown. The cortes were assembled in 1591 at
                    Tarragona, and compelled to abolish the most obnoxious fueros. Their control
                    over the judicial administration was abrogated, and the necessity of unanimity
                    was only retained in certain specified cases, notably the granting of supplies.
                    To avoid any danger from the few privileges that were left, a citadel was built
                    in Saragossa for the reception of a royal garrison. The creation of a regular
                    standing army completed the edifice of absolutism, while the militia which had
                    been established by Ximenes was retained and extended for the suppression of
                    local disorders.</p>
                <p>Philip’s internal administration was everywhere successful in obtaining the
                    objects which he set before himself. A rising of the Moors in the Alpujarras was
                    crushed by the military ability of his famous half-brother, Don John of Austria.
                    In 1580 a claim to the crown of Portugal, which Philip derived from his mother,
                    was successfully asserted. Thus the unity of the Peninsula was at last
                    completed, while the colonial territories of Spain were immensely extended.
                    Unfortunately, no attempt was made to conciliate the Portuguese to their new
                    ruler. The kingdom was treated as a conquered province; all who had resisted the
                    Spanish invasion were punished as traitors; the native nobles were excluded from
                    all share in the government, which was entrusted solely to Spaniards; the
                    commerce of the country was ruined by provisions which conferred a practical
                    monopoly upon Spain. The result of this short-sighted policy was that the
                    Portuguese stifled their discontent, and eagerly awaited the first opening for
                    the recovery of their independence.</p>
                <p>Outside Spain Philip’s policy proved a complete failure. His religious
                    intolerance excited the revolt of the Netherlands, which ended in the loss of
                    the seven northern provinces. His grand schemes against England were utterly
                    ruined by the destruction of the Spanish Armada. And, finally, his endeavour to
                    establish a preponderant Spanish influence over France was foiled by the
                    accession and triumph of Henry IV. The treaty of Vervins, by which he
                    acknowledged his humiliating defeat, was almost the last act of Philip II.’s
                    reign, which ended with his death on September 13, 1598.</p>
                <p>Philip II. left to his son and successor, Philip III., an empire which was
                    nominally undiminished, as the independence of the United Provinces had never
                    been recognized, and the war for their reduction was still going on. But the
                    unwieldy mass was suffering from internal exhaustion. The resources of Spain and
                    the New World had been squandered in the prosecution of schemes of ambition
                    which had ended in failure. The attention of the people had been distracted from
                    peaceful industry to the unprofitable occupation of war. The soldiery of Spain,
                    once reckoned invincible, had lost their prestige in the marshes of Holland. The
                    enormous taxes, from which nobles and clergy were exempted, fell with ruinous
                    severity upon the productive classes. Castile had suffered most, because it was
                    most completely subject. The provinces which retained their liberties longest
                    were more prosperous, even though they had no share in the riches that were
                    poured into Castile from the western colonies. But they,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0353-0330"/> too, had suffered from the king’s reckless
                    ambition and from an economic policy which followed the most glaring errors of
                    the Middle Ages. Every other consideration had been sacrificed to the
                    accumulation of specie, with the result that prices were forced up to an
                    abnormal height, while the wealth of the country bore no proportion to the
                    currency. The nobles were carefully excluded from all political affairs and
                    ceased to take the slightest interest in the administration. When this exclusion
                    came to an end after Philip II.’s death, they appear as mere courtiers,
                    rivalling each other in the extravagance of their expenditure, but contributing
                    nothing to the efficiency of the state. The government had been centralized by
                    successive kings, but it was carried on without either wisdom or impartiality.
                    The administration of justice was venal and incompetent. The people had been
                    deprived of their liberties, but they failed to receive compensation in
                    increased order and security. Spain had to pay dearly for its short period of
                    glory. Its rapid decline in the 17th century was the inevitable penalty for the
                    faults and errors of the 16th.</p>
                <p>“God,” said Philip IL, “who has been gracious in giving me so many states, has
                    not given me an heir capable of governing them.” His successor was the natural
                    product of his father’s system: the exhaustion of Spain was inevitably
                    accompanied by the degeneracy of its rulers. Philip III,, who was twenty-one
                    years old at his accession, had been brought up among priests and women, and
                    showed all the defects of his education. Spanish writers are never weary of
                    dilating upon his piety and his devotion. The cares of government he left
                    entirely to his favourite, the duke of Lerma, while he contented himself with
                    the performance of religious duties and the ceremonies of a stately court. The
                    change of rulers was significantly marked in a quarrel with the province of
                    Biscay, which still retained its ancient privileges intact. An attempt was made
                    in 1601 to impose new duties by a royal ordinance; the Biscayan deputies
                    protested vigorously against this encroachment upon their liberties, and openly
                    threatened to seek another ruler. Philip III. hastened to avert the storm by
                    withdrawing the obnoxious ordinance. Thus the policy of centralization was
                    abandoned, and the tendencies to division and isolation were confirmed.</p>
                <p>The piety of Philip III., which was as disastrous to Spain as the more masculine
                    bigotry of his predecessors, found characteristic expression in the persecution
                    of the Moriscoes. Ever since the suppression of their first revolt in 1502,—a
                    revolt which was provoked by the breach of the compact made on the fall of
                    Granada,—the conquered Moors had been cruelly oppressed. Charles V. renewed the
                    edict of 1502 in 1526, and the overt profession of Mohammedanism was
                    extinguished in Spain. But in secret they continued to cherish the faith of
                    their ancestors, and this was enough to exasperate a monarch who preferred to
                    have no subjects at all rather than to rule over heretics. An edict of Philip
                    II. in 1566 forbade them to speak or write in Arabic, and ordered them to
                    renounce all their traditional habits and ceremonies. Futile remonstrances were
                    followed by a desperate rising, which was quelled in 1570. The most obstinate of
                    the rebels were exiled to Africa, but most of them sullenly submitted. Philip
                    III. determined to prove his zeal for orthodoxy by completing the work which his
                    father had left unfinished. In 1609 all the Moriscoes were ordered to depart
                    from the Peninsula within three days, and the penalty of death was decreed
                    against all who failed to obey, and against any Christians who should shelter
                    the recalcitrant. The edict was obeyed, but it was the ruin of Spain. The
                    Moriscoes were the backbone of the industrial population, not only in trade and
                    manufactures, but also in agriculture. The haughty and indolent</p>
                <p>Spaniards had willingly left what they considered degrading employments to their
                    inferiors. The Moors had introduced into Spain the cultivation of sugar, cotton,
                    rice, and silk. They had established a system of irrigation which had given
                    fertility to the soil. The province of Valencia in their hands had become a
                    model of agriculture to the rest of Europe. In manufactures and commerce they
                    had shown equal superiority to the Christian inhabitants, and many of the
                    products of Spain were eagerly sought for by other countries. All these
                    advantages were sacrificed to an insane desire for religious unity.</p>
                <p>The resources of Spain, already exhausted, never recovered from this terrible
                    blow. Under these circumstances it was an absolute necessity that the ambitious
                    schemes of previous rulers should be abandoned; and it was fortunate that Lerma
                    was personally inclined to a policy of peace and that events occurred to favour
                    its adoption. The accession of James I. in England gave a convenient opportunity
                    for concluding the long war that had been carried on with Elizabeth. English
                    mediation brought about a twelve years’ truce in 1609 with the United Provinces,
                    which amounted to a practical recognition of their independence. The death of
                    Henry IV. and the regency of Mary de’ Medici enabled Lerma to arrange an
                    alliance with France, which was cemented by a double marriage. Louis XIII.
                    married the infanta Anne of Austria, and Elizabeth of France was betrothed to
                    the son and heir of Philip III. For the moment Spain occupied a higher position
                    in Europe than it had held since the defeat of the Armada. James I. was weakened
                    by quarrels with his parliament and by the want of a definite policy. France
                    under the regency had abandoned the attitude of Henry IV. and was distracted by
                    internal squabbles. The empire was in the feeble hands of Mathias, and the
                    Austrian Hapsburgs were still divided by the family jealousies that had arisen
                    from the deposition of Rudolph II. The Turks had declined since the days of
                    Soliman the Magnificent with a rapidity characteristic of Oriental powers. In
                    the midst of these states Spain, subject to an apparently absolute monarchy,
                    enjoyed much the same prestige as in the best days of Philip II. With the
                    consciousness of power the old ambitions revived. An arrangement was being
                    discussed for the recognition of the archduke Ferdinand as the successor of
                    Mathias in the Austrian territories. Philip III., however, advanced a claim to
                    Hungary and Bohemia on the ground that his mother was a daughter of Maximilian
                    II., whereas Ferdinand was only descended from that emperor’s brother. The claim
                    was by no means indisputable, but it was inconvenient to Ferdinand to have to
                    discuss it. He agreed therefore to purchase the support of Spain by ceding
                    Alsace, and the vacant imperial fief of Finale in Italy (1617), and on these
                    terms he succeeded in effecting his designs. Thus a prospect was opened to Spain
                    of connecting its Italian possessions with the Netherlands and of forming a
                    compact Spanish dominion in central Europe. At the same time the old policy of
                    advancing Roman Catholicism was resumed, as the success of Ferdinand promised to
                    secure a signal victory for the Counter-Reformation in Germany. But this forward
                    policy was distasteful to Lerma, who found it necessary to retire in 1618. His
                    withdrawal from affairs was not accompanied by any loss of the royal favour, and
                    the offices which he had held were conferred upon his son, the duke of
                    Uzeda.</p>
                <p>The alliance between the two branches of the house of Hapsburg was not finally
                    completed by the arrangement with Ferdinand. It was vigorously urged by Onate,
                    the Spanish representative at Vienna, by Khevenhüller, the<pb break="no"

                    party, headed by Zuniga, which had always opposed the policy of Lerma. But
                    neither Uzeda nor the royal confessor Aliaga was in favour of an alliance by
                    which Spanish blood and treasure were to be expended in securing the interests
                    of Austria. Philip III., however, was gained over by an appeal to his religious
                    feelings, and in January 1620 he undertook to send assistance in men and money
                    to Ferdinand II. Thus Spain was involved in the Thirty Years’ War, which had
                    been commenced in 1618 by the revolt of Bohemia against Ferdinand, and the
                    acceptance of the crown by the elector-palatine Frederick V. Spanish troops from
                    Italy aided Tilly to win the battle of the White Hill, and Spinola led an army
                    from the Netherlands against the Palatinate. But the party of peace was still
                    strong in Spain. Frederick V. was the son-in-law of James I., and his complete
                    humiliation would hinder the long-cherished project of a marriage between Prince
                    Charles and the Spanish infanta. The truce with Holland would expire in April
                    1621, and if the war was to be resumed with the Dutch it was essential to
                    isolate them by concluding the alliance with England. Moreover, the finances of
                    Spain were by no means in a condition to support the extraordinary expenses of a
                    European war. All these considerations pointed to peace, and Philip III. was on
                    the point of recalling Lerma, when he died in March 1621. His reign had not been
                    glorious or advantageous to Spain, but it contrasts favourably with those of his
                    successors. Spanish literature and art, which had received a great impulse from
                    the intercourse with foreign countries under previous rulers, reached their
                    zenith during his lifetime. Three writers have obtained European fame—Cervantes,
                    who produced the immortal <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> between 1605 and
                    1613, and two of the most fertile of romantic dramatists, Lope de Vega and
                    Calderon. In the domain of art Spain produced two of the greatest masters of the
                    17th century, Velazquez and Murillo.</p>
                <p>The time which Philip III. had spent on his devotions was given by his successor
                    to the more secular pleasures of hunting and the theatre. But Philip IV. shared
                    to the full his father’s disinclination to burden himself with the cares of
                    government. The office of first minister was given to Zuniga, the chief advocate
                    of an aggressive policy in the late reign. Lerma and Uzeda were banished from
                    the court. But the chief influence over the administration was exercised from
                    the first by the royal favourite, the count of Olivares, who succeeded to
                    Zuñiga’s office on the latter’s death. Olivares was a man of considerable
                    industry and ability, though his reputation has suffered from the inevitable
                    comparison with his great contemporary and rival, Richelieu. He conceived the
                    plan of restoring Spain to its former greatness by returning to the policy of
                    Philip II., regardless of the change in the internal resources of the country.
                    All ideas of peace were abandoned, and Spain plunged headlong into the European
                    struggle. The truce with the United Provinces was unpopular because the
                    commercial progress of the Dutch was fatal to the trade of the Spanish
                    Netherlands, and Amsterdam had already begun to take the place of Antwerp. The
                    expiration of the truce in April 1621 was followed by an immediate renewal of
                    the war. To make the war successful it was imperative to secure the alliance
                    with England, but this was sacrificed because the emperor insisted upon
                    confiscating the Palatinate, which was conferred upon Maximilian of Bavaria. The
                    match with the Spanish infanta was broken off, and Prince Charles married
                    Henrietta Maria of France. The alienation of England was enough in itself to
                    ensure the ultimate failure of the Dutch War. On the mainland the succes sive
                    stadtholders, Maurice and Frederick Henry, held their own even against the
                    experienced Spinola, and after the latter’s recall in 1629 had a distinct
                    advantage. But it was by sea that the Dutch gained their most conspicuous
                    successes. In 1628 the Spanish treasure-fleet was captured by Admiral Hein,
                    whose booty was estimated at seven millions of guilders. The greater part of
                    Brazil, together with Malacca, Ceylon, Java, and other islands, were conquered
                    by the Dutch sailors. Instead of conquering the northern provinces, Spain had to
                    make great exertions to defend the frontiers of the southern Netherlands.</p>
                <p>In central Europe the fortune of war was more favourable to Spain and her allies.
                    The crushing defeat of the elector-palatine was followed by the humiliation of
                    the Protestant champion, Christian IV. of Denmark. Ferdinand II. enjoyed for a
                    moment greater power than any other successor of Charles V., and the Edict of
                    Restitution seemed to complete the triumph of the Catholic reaction in Germany.
                    But the revival of the Hapsburg power awakened the jealousy of France, which in
                    1624 had fallen under the strong rule of Richelieu. The Spaniards had occupied
                    the Valtelline, an important pass which connected Lombardy with Tyrol. A French
                    army expelled the conquerors in 1624, and the treaty of Monçon restored the pass
                    to the community of the Grisons. For a time France was occupied with the
                    suppression of a Huguenot rising, but no sooner had La Rochelle fallen than
                    Richelieu again interfered to thwart the designs of Spain in the question of the
                    Mantuan succession. The Spaniards endeavoured to exclude the duke of Nevers, the
                    rightful heir to the duchy, on account of his connexion with France. But
                    Richelieu forced the Spanish troops to raise the siege of Casale, and ultimately
                    extorted the treaty of Cherasco (1631), by which the emperor recognized the
                    succession of the duke of Nevers in Mantua. The occupation of Pinerolo in this
                    war gave the French an opening into Italy and threatened the ascendency which
                    Spain had so long exercised in the Peninsula. Meanwhile the victories of
                    Gustavus Adolphus had destroyed the imperial and Catholic ascendency in Germany.
                    The Spaniards were ignominiously driven from the positions which they occupied
                    on the Rhine.</p>
                <p>The death of Gustavus Adolphus at Lützen inspired the Roman Catholic powers with
                    new hopes. Spain determined to strain every nerve to turn the tide of victory.
                    Philip IV.’s brother Ferdinand, the cardinal-archbishop of Toledo, was sent to
                    raise troops in Italy and to lead them through Germany into the Netherlands. In
                    1634 Ferdinand effected a junction with the imperial forces, and their combined
                    efforts won a signal victory at Nordlingen. The Lutheran princes, headed by John
                    George of Saxony, hastened to make terms with the emperor in the treaty of
                    Prague (1635). The Swedes were left almost isolated in Germany, and a speedy
                    termination of the war seemed inevitable. At this crisis Richelieu decided to
                    embark in the war as a principal, and concluded a close alliance with the Dutch
                    against Spain. For two or three years the new policy of France seemed likely to
                    be attended with failure. The French troops, unaccustomed to war, were no match
                    for the trained veterans of Spain. Not only were they repulsed from the
                    Netherlands, but the cardinal-infant actually invaded France (1636) and inspired
                    a panic in the capital itself. His success, however, was only temporary, and
                    before long the superior policy of Richelieu gave France the upper hand. The
                    occupation of Alsace, which fell into French hands after the death of Bernhard
                    of Saxe-Weimar, interrupted the connexion between the Netherlands and Italy. In
                    the latter peninsula the French<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n355/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0355-0332"/> gained ground and restored the regent of Savoy,
                    whom the Spaniards had expelled. Finally, more important than all, the alliance
                    with Holland gave France the superiority by sea. The destruction of a great
                    Spanish fleet in the Downs, where it had taken refuge under the neutral flag of
                    England, made it almost impossible to send reinforcements from Spain to
                    Brussels. By striking at the points of connexion, Richelieu was breaking the
                    unwieldy Spanish empire to pieces. At this moment his task was immensely
                    facilitated by the outbreak of internal dissensions.</p>
                <p>Olivares had been inspired by the success of his great rival with the idea of
                    strengthening Spain by a vigorous policy of centralization. The monarchy
                    consisted of a number of scattered provinces, each ruled by a separate council
                    at Madrid, and each possessed of its own separate institutions. They were held
                    together only by the predominance of Castile and by religious unity. This system
                    Olivares determined to abolish by elevating the royal power to equal absolutism
                    in all the provinces. The dangers from foreign enemies were to be met by forming
                    Spain into one indissoluble whole. But the spirit of provincial independence was
                    still strong, and it was artfully encouraged by the intrigues of Richelieu, who
                    wished to absorb the attention of Spain in its domestic affairs. An edict
                    ordering all able-bodied men to arm for the war, under penalty of confiscation,
                    provoked a revolt in 1640 among the Catalans, who were jealously attached to
                    their old privileges, and whose proximity to the French frontier had already
                    exposed them to intolerable hardships. The Castilian troops were driven from the
                    province, and Catalonia formed itself into a republic under the protection of
                    France. This event exerted a magical influence upon Portugal, where Richelieu’s
                    emissaries had also been active, and where the antipathy to Castile was national
                    rather than provincial. In December 1640 a revolution was successfully
                    accomplished in Lisbon, and the crown was assumed by a native noble, John of
                    Braganza, in whose veins ran the blood of the ancient kings. These disasters
                    were fatal to Olivares, to whose system of government they were not unnaturally
                    attributed. In 1643 he was compelled to resign his post, and Philip IV.
                    announced his intention of ruling alone.</p>
                <p>The revolt of Catalonia and Portugal, together with the undisguised discontent
                    shown by several of the other provinces, could not but hamper Spain in the
                    conduct of the European War. The conquest of Roussillon in 1642 enabled the
                    French to give effectual assistance to the Catalans, who acknowledged Louis
                    XIII. as count of Barcelona. The successive deaths of Richelieu (1642) and Louis
                    XIII. (1643) made no difference to the policy of France, which was directed by
                    Mazarin under the regency of Anne of Austria. The French had now completely made
                    up the military inferiority which had foiled their efforts at the beginning of
                    the war. In 1643 Enghien (afterwards the great Condé) won the first of a
                    brilliant series of victories at Rocroi, and his success was the more important
                    because it placed the domestic authority of the regent upon a firm footing. The
                    disasters of Spain were increased by the formidable rising of Masaniello in
                    Naples (1647), which was carried on by the duke of Guise and was suppressed with
                    difficulty in 1648. This was followed by the loss of the Austrian alliance
                    through the treaty of Westphalia. As it would have been impossible for Spain to
                    contend single-handed against the hostile coalition, the opportunity was seized
                    to make terms with Holland. This was only achieved by consenting to great
                    sacrifices. Not only did Spain surrender all claims to sovereignty over the
                    northern provinces, but it also ceded to them the northern districts of Brabant,
                    Flanders, and Limburg, with the strong fortresses of Maestricht, Her togenbosch
                    (Bois-le-Duc), Bergen-op-Zoom, and Breda. The Dutch retained all their conquests
                    in America and the Indies, and secured themselves from the rivalry of Antwerp by
                    a clause which enjoined the permanent closing of the Scheldt. This marks the
                    final recognition of the United Provinces as an independent state, and also the
                    transference to the northern powers of the maritime supremacy hitherto claimed
                    by Spain.</p>
                <p>France and Spain were now left face to face with each other. For the next four
                    years the disturbances of the Fronde gave the Spaniards a great opportunity, of
                    which they were not slow to avail themselves. In the Netherlands they recovered
                    Gravelines, Ypres, and Dunkirk, while Don John of Austria, a natural son of
                    Philip 1V., took Barcelona and reduced the Catalans to submission. But the
                    triumph of Mazarin in 1653 enabled France once more to devote itself to the war,
                    although at the same time it drove the great Condé into the Spanish service. The
                    military operations now reduced themselves to a duel in the Netherlands between
                    the rival generals Condé and Turenne. The old tactics, which were adhered to
                    with Spanish obstinacy, were now out of date, and the once invincible infantry
                    was almost useless against the quick movements of light-armed troops which had
                    been introduced by Gustavus Adolphus. The struggle was finally decided by the
                    intervention of England. Both powers had earnestly sued for the support of
                    Cromwell. The rapid advance of the French power was a cogent reason for England
                    to assist Spain, but the religious bigotry that still prevailed at Madrid made
                    the alliance impossible. At last Mazarin gained over the Protector by promising
                    to banish the Stuarts from France and to cede Dunkirk. Reinforced by 6000
                    Ironsides, probably the best soldiers in Europe, Turenne was irresistible.
                    Dunkirk was reduced after an obstinate defence and handed over to the English,
                    to the great scandal of Roman Catholic Europe. One after another the fortresses
                    of Flanders fell into the hands of the French, and, though the death of Cromwell
                    lost them the support of England, it was impossible for Spain to continue the
                    war. In 1659 Mazarin and Don Luis de Haro, the successor of Olivares, met on a
                    small island in the Bidassoa, and there arranged the treaty of the Pyrenees.
                    Spain had again to make great sacrifices. Besides Artois and several fortresses
                    in the Netherlands, Roussillon and Cerdagne were ceded to France, and thus the
                    Pyrenees were fixed by law as the boundary between the two countries. Louis XIV.
                    was to marry the infanta Maria Theresa, who was to receive a large dowry, but
                    was to renounce all eventual claims to the Spanish crown. The only concessions
                    made by France were the pardon of Condé, the recognition of Catalonia as a
                    province of Spain, and the promise to give no more assistance to the
                    Portuguese.</p>
                <p>Now that Spain was freed from external hostilities, it seemed possible that the
                    reduction of Portugal might be at last accomplished. But the alliance of France
                    was speedily replaced by that of England, and Catherine of Braganza was married
                    to Charles II. Louis XIV., too, tried to obtain from the Spanish Government an
                    acknowledgment of his wife’s claims to the succession, and failing in this he
                    continued to send secret assistance to the Portuguese. A French general,
                    Schomberg, defeated Don John of Austria in 1663, and two years later routed the
                    Spanish forces at the battle of Villa Viciosa. This final disaster crushed the
                    declining energies of Philip IV., who died on September 17, 1665. As his son
                    Charles II. was only four years old, he bequeathed the government to his widow
                    Maria Anna of Austria, with a special junta to advise her in the conduct of
                    affairs. As the Spanish monarchy had declined, its<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0356-0333"/> authority had been exercised by a series of chief
                    ministers, —Lerma, Olivares, and Haro,—and this was the only way in which the
                    unity of the executive power could now be maintained. The favour of the
                    queen-mother raised to this position her confessor, Father Nithard, a native of
                    Styria. He was a man of ability and experience, and set himself to cope with the
                    most glaring evils of the state. He endeavoured to dimininish the public
                    expenditure by limiting the salaries of officials, and by putting an end to the
                    abuses which hindered the commerce with the colonies. But he was soon called
                    upon to face unexpected difficulties. Louis XIV. advanced a claim, on behalf of
                    his wife, to certain territories in the Netherlands in virtue of the so-called
                    “law of devolution.” This was an old custom by which the children of the first
                    marriage succeeded, to the exclusion of all later descendants. As Spain resisted
                    the claim, the French invaded Flanders and overran Franche-Comté. The regent was
                    compelled to purchase the restoration of the latter province by ceding part of
                    Flanders to France in the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668). At the same time the
                    independence of Portugal was finally acknowledged. These disasters increased the
                    jealousy with which the Spanish nobles regarded the rule of a Jesuit and a
                    foreigner. A strong opposition party was formed under the leadership of Don John
                    of Austria, and in 1669 Nithard was compelled to resign. But among the nobles
                    themselves there was little unity, and a difference arose as to the policy to be
                    pursued when Louis XIV. attacked Holland in 1672. The queenmother was naturally
                    on the side of Austria, and her influence was sufficient to secure the adhesion
                    of Spain to the first European coalition against France. This success she
                    followed up by obtaining the post of chief minister for another favourite,
                    Fernando de Valenzuela, who was appointed marquis of Villafierra and raised to
                    the rank of a grandee of Spain. This revived the jealousy of the nobles, who
                    again formed a league for the maintenance of their privileges under Don John of
                    Austria. This time they were completely successful. Not only was Valenzuela
                    banished, but Maria Anna herself was compelled to retire from the court and to
                    take up her residence in Toledo. Don John was now all-powerful. A natural
                    antipathy to the policy of the regent led him to draw aloof from the Austrian
                    alliance and to attach himself to France. A marriage was concluded between
                    Charles II. and Maria Louisa of Orleans. It was hoped that by this means better
                    terms would be obtained from Louis XIV., but in the treaty of Nimeguen Spain had
                    to surrender Franche-Comté and fourteen fortresses in Flanders. This treaty
                    marks the complete loss by Spain of its position as a first-rate power.
                    Henceforth it could only exist by the support of those states which resented the
                    aggrandizement of France. Don John was no more successful in his domestic than
                    in his foreign policy. His industry was as unwearying as that of Philip II.
                    himself, and he determined to rule independently of all interested advisers. The
                    reform from which he hoped most was a revocation of the crown domains which had
                    passed into private hands. But the scheme met with natural opposition from the
                    nobles, and he died in 1679 without having accomplished anything. For a year
                    Charles II. endeavoured to rule in person with the help of the ordinary council,
                    but the attempt only showed how the strength of the monarchy was bound up with
                    the personal character of the ruler. “Charles V.,” says Mignet, “had been both
                    general and king; Philip II. was merely king, Philip III. and Philip IV. had not
                    been kings; Charles II. was not even a man.” From infancy Charles’s health had
                    been so defective that his death had appeared an imminent contingency, and his
                    intellect was as feeble as his body. It was impossible for him to exercise any
                    effective control over the government, and he was little more than a tool in the
                    hands of the nobles, who, under Don Luis de Haro, had recovered much of the
                    political influence from which Olivares had excluded them. In 1680 the office of
                    first minister was given to the greatest of Spanish magnates, the duke of
                    MedinaCeli. It was at this time that Louis XIV. was conducting his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">reunions,</hi> and the weakness of Spain enabled him to annex
                    without opposition Courtrai, Dixmude, and the great fortress of Luxemburg.
                    Medina-Celi, disgusted with his thankless task, resigned in 1685, and his place
                    was taken by Count Oropesa. The new minister revived the alliance with Austria,
                    and Spain became a member of the league of Augsburg in 1686. The success of the
                    league seemed to be almost assured by the Revolution which gave the crown of
                    England to William III., the leader of the opposition to Louis XIV. But in spite
                    of apparently overwhelming odds France more than held her own, and Spain was
                    humiliated by the capture of Urgel and Barcelona. Ministers held office only at
                    the will of court factions, and the first disaster was fatal to Oropesa. Spain
                    continued to play a secondary part in the war, which was concluded in 1697 by
                    the treaty of Ryswick, the first for many years in which France did not obtain
                    any addition of territory. The chief motive for Louis XIV.’s moderation was the
                    desire to devote his attention to the approaching question of the Spanish
                    succession.</p>
                <p>The decline of Spain in the 17th century is not to be measured by its territorial
                    losses. Holland had extorted a tardy recognition of its independence; Portugal
                    was once more a separate kingdom; Catalonia was reduced only to very doubtful
                    submission; France had seized upon Roussillon and Cerdagne, Franche-Comté, and
                    great part of the southern Netherlands; French influence had been established in
                    Italy as a counterpoise to that of Spain. But the weakness of the extremities,
                    to which these facts bear conclusive testimony, was the result of still greater
                    weakness at the centre. The population of the peninsula, estimated at twenty
                    millions under the Arabs and at twelve under Ferdinand and Isabella, had fallen
                    to less than six millions in the reign of Charles II. This decrease of numbers
                    was doubtless due in the first place to the religious bigotry which had
                    condemned thousands of Jews and Moriscoes to death or exile, but it is partly
                    traceable to a fatal decline in the economic prosperity of the country.
                    Agriculture, for which many parts of Spain were peculiarly fitted, had suffered
                    from the departure of the Moriscoes and from a number of other causes. The want
                    of any law of mortmain had led to the accumulation of at least one-fourth of the
                    land in the hands of the monasteries, the most charitable but the most careless
                    and conservative of landlords. Thanks to their obstinate adherence to obsolete
                    methods of cultivation, their estates produced little more than one per cent. on
                    the outlay. The system of entail, which earlier monarchs had striven to
                    restrict, made enormous strides in the 16th century, and most of the secular
                    estates were inalienably concentrated in the hands of a few great nobles, who
                    lived at Madrid and spent their revenues in lavish extravagance without any
                    regard to the interests of their tenants. In the fertile provinces of Andalusia
                    and Estremadura agriculture was entirely ruined by the system of sheep-farming.
                    In the 12th century, when the country was exposed to the destructive forays of
                    the Moors, the inhabitants had been forbidden to enclose their lands with either
                    hedges or ditches, and successive kings had encouraged the rearing of huge
                    flocks of sheep which could easily be driven over the open country into a place
                    of safety. In the 16th and 17th centuries the condition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0357-0334"/> of things had entirely changed, but the old
                    regulations were jealously maintained by the company of <hi rend="italic">La
                    Mesta,</hi> one of the most powerful and independent corporations in Spain. This
                    body, which derived large revenues from the sale of wool, was enabled to retain
                    its privileges intact until the reign of Charles III. Every summer their flocks
                    poured down the northern mountains, and the absence of enclosures made it
                    impossible to defend the crops from their ravages. Besides making agriculture
                    impossible, the exclusive attention to sheep-rearing led to the gradual
                    disappearance of the old forests, and, as no one ventured to plant new trees,
                    great parts of Castile became an arid desert. Every kind of industry suffered in
                    the same way as agriculture. The true Spaniard despised all who earned a living
                    by handicraft, and when the Moriscoes had been banished it was impossible to
                    obtain skilled artisans except by importing them. The Spaniards could not even
                    cut their own timber into ships or construct fortifications for their own towns.
                    Madrid and other cities were crowded with foreigners, who hastened to make a
                    fortune that they might carry it back to their native land. The Government was
                    quite as much to blame as individuals. The gold from the New World would have
                    enabled Spain to command the markets of Europe, but the mediaeval restrictions
                    on the exportation of the precious metals were strictly enforced. The high price
                    of commodities was attributed, not to the superfluity of the medium of exchange,
                    but to the competition of foreign and colonial markets. It was forbidden to
                    export one article after another, and the colonies were expected to send gold
                    without receiving anything in exchange. A more ruinous policy could hardly be
                    conceived; but it was supported by the merchants themselves, who refused to fill
                    their vessels with anything but gold and silver, and left the indigo, cotton,
                    and other commodities to the English and the Dutch. Domestic production,
                    crippled by these restrictions, was almost destroyed by the excessive taxation
                    rendered necessary by the ambitious schemes of Philip II. and his descendants.
                    It is notorious that Austria could never have carried on the Thirty Years’ War
                    so long but for the supplies received from Spain. Spain, in fact, was the great
                    subsidizing power in the 17th century, as England was in the 18th. The enormous
                    expenditure thus necessitated was wrung from the classes least able to pay it,
                    as the Government was not strong enough to attack the exemption of the nobles
                    and clergy. The <hi rend="italic">alcavala,</hi> the tax on sales which Ximenes
                    had abolished, was restored under Philip II., and in the 17th century reached
                    the enormous amount of 14 per cent. The traders naturally sought to evade a tax
                    which it was impossible to pay. But this only increased the vigilance of the
                    revenue officers, who endeavoured to collect the tax at every opportunity, on
                    the raw material, on the manufactured product, and again every time that it
                    changed hands. Taxation in Spain was a caricature of Alva’s system in the
                    Netherlands, and was even more ruinous than that had been. Foreign nations
                    reaped all the advantages which the short-sighted policy of the Spaniards threw
                    away. It has been calculated that five-sixths of the manufactured commodities
                    consumed in Spain were provided by foreigners, and that they carried on
                    nine-tenths of the commerce with the Spanish colonies. By law all foreign trade
                    with the colonies was prohibited, but the decline of native industry made it
                    impossible to enforce the laws, and the Spanish Government had to connive at a
                    contraband trade of which other countries gained all the profit. The policy of
                    the earlier kings had made the colonies dependent upon European products, and
                    when Spain could no longer supply them they had to be obtained elsewhere.
                    Circumstances in the latter half of the 17th century allied Spain with England
                    and Holland against France, and the English and Dutch founded their commercial
                    supremacy upon the trade which Spain threw into their hands. The country which
                    had sent a hundred vessels to Lepanto, and which in 1588 had despatched the
                    great Armada against England, was reduced under Charles II. to borrowing Genoese
                    vessels to maintain its connexion with the New World. The army, which had once
                    been the terror of Europe, had sunk at this time to an effective force of little
                    more than 20,000 men. In literature and art the decadence of Spain was equally
                    conspicuous and complete. The religious unity of the country was preserved, but
                    all touch with the intellectual advance of Europe was deliberately
                    sacrificed.</p>
                <p>In spite of its loss of power and prestige, the crown of Spain was still regarded
                    as a prize well worth winning. Ever since Charles II.’s accession the Spanish
                    succession had been a prominent question for European diplomacy, and from 1697
                    it became the pivot on which international relations turned. Charles II.’s first
                    wife, Maria Louisa of Orleans, had died childless in 1689, and his second
                    marriage to Maria Anna of Neuburg was equally unfruitful. The male line of the
                    Spanish Hapsburgs was evidently on the verge of extinction, and by law and
                    tradition the crown would pass to the nearest female or her heir. But the
                    question was complicated in many ways. Of Charles II.’s two sisters, the elder,
                    Maria Theresa, had married Louis XIV., and had renounced her claims, but her
                    husband had always protested against the renunciation, and the non-payment of
                    the stipulated dowry gave him an argument for its nullity. The younger, Margaret
                    Theresa, had married the emperor Leopold I., and had made no renunciation; but
                    she had since died, leaving an only daughter, Maria, who married the elector of
                    Bavaria. Going a generation back, the two sisters of Philip IV. had also married
                    into the houses of Bourbon and Hapsburg. Anne of Austria, whose renunciation of
                    the Spanish crown was undisputed, was the mother of Louis XIV., while Maria Anna
                    was the mother of Leopold I. Ever since the division of the house of Hapsburg
                    into two branches it had been agreed by a family compact that if either became
                    extinct the other should succeed to its territories. Leopold I. was extremely
                    anxious to restore the unity of the family by securing the observance of this
                    compact, and he had a great advantage in the fact that Charles II.’s mother was
                    his own sister, and Charles’s second wife was his sister-in-law. The will of
                    Philip IV. had arranged that, after Charles II. and his descendants, the crown
                    should pass, first to Margaret Theresa and her children, and secondly to Leopold
                    and his children. It was a great disappointment to Leopold that his first wife
                    left him only a daughter, but he tried to secure the claims of his family by
                    extorting from her on her marriage a renunciation of her rights to the crown of
                    Spain. This renunciation the Spanish Government had never recognized, and the
                    queen-mother, whose adherence to the Hapsburg interests was overcome by her
                    feelings for her own family, induced Charles II. to make a will in 1696 in which
                    he named Joseph Ferdinand, the infant electoral prince of Bavaria, as his heir.
                    But the queen-mother’s death withdrew the dominant influence at the court of
                    Madrid and enabled the Austrian envoy, Count Harrach, with the help of the
                    queen, to procure the revocation of this will. The succession now became the
                    subject of party quarrels and intrigues, in which the rival envoys of Austria
                    and France took a prominent part. The aim of Leopold I. was to obtain the
                    succession of his second son, the archduke Charles, while Louis XIV. hoped to
                    procure the Spanish crown, if not for his son, at least for one of his
                    grandsons. The office of first minister<pb break="no"

                    Oropesa, and the most influential man in the kingdom was Cardinal Portocarrero,
                    archbishop of Toledo. He was a bitter opponent of the queen, who was extremely
                    unpopular, and all his efforts were directed to thwart the schemes of Austria.
                    To depress the cardinal, Maria Anna induced Charles II. to recall Oropesa, but
                    the latter declined to return to the Austrian alliance which he had previously
                    championed, and espoused the cause of the electoral prince. There was no
                    semblance at this time of a French party in Madrid, but Louis XIV. availed
                    himself of the cessation of hostilities to send thither an able diplomatist,
                    Count Harcourt, who speedily contrived to exercise considerable influence over
                    the course of events.</p>
                <p>Too many European interests were involved in the succession to allow it to be
                    settled as a mere question of domestic politics. The idea of the balance of
                    power dominated European diplomacy at this time, and William III. of England was
                    its avowed and recognized champion. England and Holland, the two countries with
                    which William was connected, were vitally interested in the Spanish trade. The
                    accession of a French prince in Spain would almost inevitably transfer to France
                    all the advantages which they at present enjoyed. It was obvious that William
                    III. must have a voice in the settlement of this succession, and Louis XIV., who
                    had no desire for a new European war, was willing to recognize this. The
                    negotiations between England and France resulted in the first treaty of
                    partition (October 11, 1698). The electoral prince was to receive the bulk of
                    the Spanish empire, viz., Spain itself, the Netherlands, Sardinia, and the
                    colonies; the dauphin was to have Naples, Sicily, Finale, and Guipuzcoa; while
                    Lombardy was to go to the archduke Charles. This treaty had one fatal
                    defect—that it was based solely on the interests of the contracting powers and
                    took no account of the wishes of the Spaniards, who resented any proposal for
                    the division of the empire. The first hint of the treaty irritated Charles II.
                    into making a second will in November in favour of the electoral prince, and all
                    parties in Spain agreed in its approval. But within three months both treaty and
                    will were rendered null by the sudden death of the infant prince (February
                    1699), and the question, thus reopened, became more thorny than ever, as the
                    choice now lay definitely between Austria and France. It seemed almost
                    impossible to prevent the outbreak of a general war, but William III. patiently
                    reunited the broken threads of his diplomacy, and arranged with France a second
                    treaty of partition. The Spanish monarchy was to be divided into two parts. The
                    larger, consisting of Spain, the Netherlands, Sardinia, and the colonies, was to
                    go to the archduke Charles. The dauphin was to receive the share stipulated in
                    the former treaty, with the material addition of Lorraine. The duke of Lorraine
                    was to be compensated with the Milanese. This treaty, unlike the first, was
                    communicated to Austria; but the emperor, who was now confident of securing the
                    whole inheritance, refused to accept it.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the death of the electoral prince had destroyed the temporary unanimity
                    at Madrid. Portocarrero and his partisans were gained over to the side of France
                    by Harcourt. Oropesa fell back upon a scheme of his own for uniting the whole
                    Peninsula under the king of Portugal The queen returned to her old allegiance to
                    her brother-in-law, and formed a close alliance with Harrach for the advancement
                    of the interests of the archduke Charles. A popular rising overthrew Oropesa and
                    enabled Portocarrero to regain his ascendency. At this juncture came the news of
                    the second partition treaty, which again irritated the tender susceptibility of
                    the</p>
                <p>Spaniards. The Austrian party hoped to utilize the popular feeling against Louis
                    XIV. as a party to the hated treaty. But Harcourt adroitly contrived to suggest
                    that the best way of annulling the partition project was to enlist Louis’s own
                    interests against it. The view steadily gained ground that the house of Bourbon
                    was the only power strong enough to secure the unity of the Spanish empire.
                    Portocarrero succeeded in inducing Pope Innocent XII. to support the French
                    claim. Charles II., feeble to the last, succumbed to this combination of
                    influences, and signed a testament bequeathing the succession to Philip of
                    Anjou, the second grandson of Louis XIV., on condition that he would renounce
                    all claims to the crown of France (October 3, 1700). Thus his last act was to
                    disinherit his own family in favour of the enemy with whom he had been at war
                    almost all his reign. He died on the 1st of November 1700.</p>
                <p>Everything now depended upon the decision of Louis XIV. The treaty of partition
                    offered substantial advantages to France; Charles II.’s will would exalt the
                    house of Bourbon above every other family in Europe. His hesitation, whether
                    real or feigned, did not last long. On November 16 he introduced his grandson to
                    the French court as Philip V. of Spain. The dynastic ambition of the king was
                    also based upon sound policy. In the face of Spanish opinion and of the
                    emperor’s refusal it was impossible to carry out the partition treaty. And for
                    the moment it appeared that the accession of a Bourbon prince would be secured
                    without difficulty. Philip V, was proclaimed in all parts of the Spanish
                    monarchy amid popular acclamations. Leopold I. protested and prepared to attack
                    Lombardy, but he could not hope to obtain the whole succession for his son
                    without the assistance of the maritime powers. William III., who saw the aims of
                    his life threatened with ruin, was eager for war, but his subjects, both in
                    England and Holland, were resolute to maintain peace. In these circumstances
                    Louis XIV. played into the hands of his enemies. He expelled the Dutch garrisons
                    from the fortresses of the Netherlands which they had occupied since the treaty
                    of Ryswick, and replaced them by French troops. He showed a cynical intention to
                    regard Spain as a province of France, and he took measures to secure for the
                    French the commercial advantages hitherto enjoyed by England and Holland.
                    William III. was thus enabled to conclude the Grand Alliance (September 7,
                    1701), by which the contracting powers undertook to obtain the Netherlands and
                    the Italian provinces of Spain for the archduke Charles and to preserve the
                    mercantile monopoly of the English and Dutch. A few days afterwards James II.
                    died at St Germains, and Louis XIV. was injudicious enough to acknowledge his
                    son as king of England. This insult exasperated public opinion in that country;
                    the Tory parliament was dissolved; and the last obstacle to William’s warlike
                    policy was swept away. William himself died in March 1702, but he left the
                    continuance of his policy to the able hands of Marlborough and Heinsius. The war
                    which the emperor had commenced single-handed in 1701 became general in the next
                    year.</p>
                <p>It is needless to follow the military operations of the War of the Spanish
                    Succession, which have been rendered famous by the exploits of Eugene and
                    Marlborough. The chief scenes of hostilities were the Netherlands, Germany, and
                    Italy, in each of which the French suffered fatal and humiliating reverses. At
                    first the peninsula of Spain was not directly concerned in the war. The Grand
                    Alliance did not aim at excluding Philip from the Spanish monarchy as a whole,
                    but only from those parts which the maritime powers wished to preserve from
                    French influence. But in 1703 Pedro II. of Portugal deserted the cause of<pb

                    England. T <hi rend="underline">his</hi> opened the Peninsula to the allied
                    forces and necessitated a revision of the terms of the alliance. Pedro’s support
                    could only be purchased by the expulsion of the French from Spain, and the
                    allies now determined to claim the whole Spanish inheritance for the archduke
                    Charles. In 1704 the archduke appeared in Portugal, and the English fleet, under
                    Sir George Rooke, captured Gibraltar. As the assistance of the Portuguese was
                    only half-hearted, it was decided in 1705 to seek a new opening in the east.
                    Catalonia, always inclined to revolt against its rulers, and recently irritated
                    by the conduct of Philip V., offered a convenient base of operations. The
                    brilliant but eccentric earl of Peterborough succeeded in capturing Barcelona,
                    and by the end of the year the archduke was acknowledged as Charles III. in
                    Catalonia, Valencia, and Aragon. A great effort on the part of Philip to recover
                    the lost provinces was repulsed, and a simultaneous advance of the allies from
                    the east and from Portugal compelled him to evacuate Madrid, where Charles III.
                    was formally proclaimed. But the provincial disunion, which had so often
                    hampered the Hapsburg kings, proved the salvation of their Bourbon successor.
                    The Castilians refused to obey a king who was forced upon them from Aragon, and
                    their religious instincts were offended by the alliance of Charles with the
                    heretics of England and Holland. Disunion among the allies aided the revolt of
                    Castile, and by the end of 1706 Charles III. found himself compelled to evacuate
                    his recent conquests and to return to Barcelona. In 1707 the allies attempted
                    another invasion of Castile, but they were routed by the duke of Berwick at
                    Almanza, and Aragon and Valencia were forced to return to their allegiance to
                    Philip V. For the next two years the war in the Peninsula languished. Charles
                    III. received reinforcements from Austria under Stahremberg, but he was unable
                    to do more than retain his hold upon Barcelona. In 1710 the cause of the allies
                    received a new impulse from the arrival of Stanhope with supplies of men and
                    money from England. Under the joint command of Stanhope and Stahremberg the army
                    advanced westwards from Barcelona, defeated Philip V. at Almenara and Saragossa,
                    and for the second time occupied Madrid. The disasters which the French had
                    experienced in other parts of Europe had broken the pride of Louis XIV., and he
                    was prepared to purchase peace by sacrificing his grandson. A treaty would have
                    been concluded to this effect at Gertruydenburg, if the allies had not insisted
                    that the French troops should be employed in forcing Philip V. to accept it.
                    Louis XIV. refused to take arms against his own family, and a sudden change in
                    the current of fortune saved him from the humiliation which his enemies wished
                    to force upon him. Charles III. found it impossible to maintain Madrid in face
                    of the enthusiasm of the Castilians for his rival. The capital of Spain was of
                    no importance from a military point of view, and the allies determined on its
                    evacuation. On their retreat they were followed by Vendôme, whom Louis XIV. had
                    sent to his grandson’s assistance. Stanhope, attacked at Brihuega, was compelled
                    to capitulate with all his forces before Stahremberg could arrive to his
                    assistance. The latter was defeated after an obstinate struggle at Villa
                    Viciosa. Aragon and Valencia again submitted to Philip, and the archduke was
                    once more confined to Catalonia.</p>
                <p>At this juncture two events occurred which completely altered the balance of the
                    contending powers. The fall of the Whig ministry through a court intrigue gave
                    the control of English policy to the Tories, who had always been hostile to the
                    war. The death of Joseph I. in April 1711 left the Austrian territories to his
                    brother, the archduke</p>
                <p>Charles, who was soon afterwards elected emperor as Charles VI. To allow him to
                    obtain the Spanish succession would be to revive the empire of Charles V., and
                    would be even more dangerous to the balance of power than the recognition of
                    Philip V. with adequate securities against the union of France and Spain. The
                    object for which the allies had been making such immense exertions was now a
                    result to be averted at any cost.</p>
                <p>In these altered circumstances, Bolingbroke, the English minister, hurried on the
                    negotiations with France which resulted in the treaty of Utrecht between
                    England, France, Spain, and Holland. Philip V. was acknowledged as king of
                    Spain, on condition that he should formally renounce all eventual claims to the
                    crown of France. But the partition of the Spanish monarchy was insisted upon by
                    the allies. The Netherlands were to be handed over to Austria, on condition that
                    the Dutch should garrison the barrier fortresses. Austria was also to receive
                    the Italian provinces of Spain, with the exception of Sicily, which was given to
                    the duke of Savoy with the title of king. England naturally obtained
                    considerable advantages from a war in which she had borne so prominent a part.
                    The acquisition of Gibraltar and Minorca gave her the control of the
                    Mediterranean. The <hi rend="italic">asiento</hi> conferred upon her the
                    privilege of importing slaves into the Spanish colonies, and she also obtained
                    the right of sending a single vessel into the South Seas. France had to
                    recognize the Protestant succession, and to cede Newfoundland, Acadia (Nova
                    Scotia), and Hudson’s Bay. Charles VI. refused to accept the terms offered to
                    him at Utrecht, but he found it impossible to carry on the war by himself, and
                    in 1714 he made peace with France by the treaty of Rastatt. But he still
                    retained the title of king of Spain, and showed no willingness to acknowledge
                    Philip V.</p>
                <p>The great blot on the conduct of the allies in arranging the treaty of Utrecht
                    was the desertion of the Catalans, who had rendered such loyal services during
                    the war. They were left to the tender mercies of Philip V., who sent Berwick to
                    reduce the rebellious province. Barcelona resisted for many months with the
                    heroism of despair, and was well-nigh reduced to ashes before it could be taken
                    (September 1714). With its fall all resistance came to an end. The three
                    Aragonese provinces were deprived of the last remnants of their ancient
                    privileges, and were henceforth ruled from Madrid under Castilian laws.</p>
                <p>With the final accession of a Bourbon king Spain entered upon a new period of
                    history, in which it once more played a considerable part in European politics.
                    The death of Louis XIV. (1715), and the acquisition of the regency in France by
                    the duke of Orleans, destroyed the close connexion that had hitherto existed
                    between France and Spain. Philip V. was hypochondriacal and bigoted, the slave
                    of his wife and his confessor, but he had certain definite schemes to which he
                    clung with the obstinacy of a weak character. In spite of his solemn
                    renunciations and the guarantee of the European powers, he never relinquished
                    the idea of ultimately succeeding to the French throne. In what was regarded as
                    the probable event of Louis XV.’s death, he was determined to enforce his
                    hereditary claim, even if he had to resign the crown of Spain. His interests
                    were diametrically opposed to those of the duke of Orleans, who was, after
                    Philip’s family, the natural heir to Louis XV. Philip V. had one other guiding
                    passion, enmity to Charles VI., who had robbed the Spanish monarchy of its
                    fairest provinces in Italy. These provinces he set his heart upon regaining, and
                    in this project he was encouraged by the two people who had most influence over
                    him,—his wife and his minister.</p>
                <p>Philip V.’s first wife, Maria Louisa of Savoy, had died in 1714, leaving him two
                    sons, Louis and Ferdinand. A suc<pb break="no"

                    of Elizabeth Farnese, niece of the duke of Parma, who was suggested by Alberoni,
                    at that time agent for Parma at Madrid. The new queen speedily obtained
                    unlimited ascendency over her husband’s mind, and she displayed an unbridled
                    ambition and a capacity for intrigue astounding in one who had been brought up
                    in complete retirement. As Philip’s sons by his first wife would exclude her own
                    children from the Spanish throne, she was anxious to obtain for the latter the
                    reversion of the duchies of Parma and Tuscany, to which she had an eventual
                    claim. With this end in view she encouraged her husband’s designs in Italy,
                    while personal ambition made her eager to see him on the French throne. Her
                    favour gave the conduct of Spanish affairs for a short period to her countryman
                    Alberoni, one of the strangest personages of the 18th century. The son of a
                    gardener at Piacenza, he had sought a career in the church, and had come to
                    Spain in the suite of Vendôme, whose favour he had won by combining the
                    functions of a cook and a buffoon. After the death of his patron he remained in
                    Spain, and conceived an ardent affection for the country of his adoption. Raised
                    to power by the part he had played in effecting the king’s marriage, he
                    determined to exalt Spain from its long depression to the position it had once
                    occupied in Europe. His domestic reforms showed that he had a real capacity for
                    government. Commerce and industry revived under his patronage; the army was
                    reorganized, and the revenue increased. But his chief attention was given to the
                    navy, the real foundation of the former greatness of Spain. Foreigners who had
                    known the country under Charles II. or during the Succession War were astounded
                    at the strides which it had made under the new administration. Alberoni himself
                    is said to have assured Philip that with five years of peace he would make him
                    the most powerful sovereign of Europe. But these years of peace he was not
                    destined to have. Alberoni cordially approved the Italian designs of Philip, and
                    hoped to employ the restored might of Spain in freeing his native country from
                    the hated rule of Austria. He had less sympathy with the king’s hankering after
                    the French crown and his enmity to the regent Orleans. But he held office only
                    by the royal favour, and could not venture to set up his own will against that
                    of his master. He was convinced, and not without reason, that everything would
                    go well if he could secure the English alliance.</p>
                <p>But the attitude of Spain had already awakened suspicion in France, and the ready
                    mind of Dubois had conceived a plan for thwarting Alberoni. He determined to
                    desert the policy of Louis XIV. and to conclude a close alliance between France
                    and England. This was to be based upon the common danger from rival pretenders,
                    which urged the houses of Orleans and Hanover to maintain the provisions of the
                    treaty of Utrecht. An agreement was arranged between the two states in 1716,
                    and, being joined by Holland in January 1717, was known as the Triple Alliance.
                    This was a great blow to Alberoni, and made him anxious to postpone all
                    hostilities until his preparations were complete. But his hand was forced by the
                    indignation excited in Philip V.’s mind by an insult offered to him by the
                    emperor. The grand inquisitor of Spain was arrested in Lombardy as a rebel
                    against Charles III., his lawful king. Philip V. decided for an immediate
                    rupture, and Alberoni against his will had to send an expedition to Sardinia,
                    which overran the island in 1717. The enthusiasm excited in Spain by the
                    unwonted news of a military success was increased in 1718 when another Spanish
                    force occupied Sicily. But meanwhile Charles VI. had appealed to France and
                    England for assistance against this rupture of the treaty of</p>
                <p>Utrecht. The Triple Alliance, reinforced by the junction of Austria, became the
                    Quadruple Alliance (August 1718). The resolution of the allies was convincingly
                    displayed in a naval encounter in which Admiral Byng destroyed the Spanish fleet
                    off Cape Passaro.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the only fault to be found with Alberoni’s schemes is that they were
                    attempted prematurely, and this was the fault of the king rather than of the
                    minister. But the Quadruple Alliance drove him in despair to form those
                    far-reaching projects which are generally associated with his name, and which
                    have given rise to the unjust impression that his whole policy was chimerical
                    and unsound. To meet the hostility of England and France he must make use of
                    internal divisions. He invited the Pretender to Spain, prepared an expedition in
                    his behalf, and concerted with Count Görz, the minister of Charles XII., a grand
                    scheme by which Sweden and Russia were to combine in supporting the Jacobites
                    against George I. At the same time, through the Spanish envoy Cellamare, he
                    organized a conspiracy among the numerous opponents of the regent. All these
                    schemes broke down simultaneously. Charles XII. was killed at the siege of an
                    obscure town in Norway; Görz was executed by his successor; the Spanish fleet
                    which was to carry the Pretender to England was wrecked; the conspiracy of
                    Cellamare was discovered and suppressed. France declared war, and sent an army
                    under Berwick across the Pyrenees. An English fleet gratified the national love
                    of a maritime monopoly by burning along the Spanish coast the vessels and docks
                    which Alberoni had created. The emperor, who had just ended a war with Turkey by
                    the treaty of Passarowitz, was able to send a force which succeeded in
                    recovering Sicily. Alberoni was sacrificed to appease the enemies of Spain, and
                    was exiled from the kingdom he had served so loyally in December 1719. A month
                    later Philip V. accepted the terms imposed upon him by the Quadruple Alliance.
                    He had to confirm his renunciation of the French crown, and also to abandon all
                    claims on the provinces of Spain which had been ceded to Austria by the treaties
                    of Utrecht and Rastatt. He also allowed the emperor to retain Sicily, the duke
                    of Savoy being compensated with Sardinia. On the other hand Charles VI.’s
                    pretensions to the Spanish crown were definitely abandoned, and the allies
                    recognized the eventual claims to Parma and Tuscany of Philip’s children by his
                    second marriage, on condition that those duchies should never be united with
                    Spain.</p>
                <p>In spite of the conclusion of peace, Philip continued to cherish his animosity
                    against Charles VI., especially as the latter showed an inclination to evade the
                    condition about Parma and Tuscany by encouraging other claimants to come
                    forward. To gratify this passion, Philip went so far as to lay aside his old
                    enmity against the duke of Orleans, and to authorize the negotiation of a close
                    alliance with France. His eldest son, Don Luis, was married to a daughter of the
                    regent, and Louis XV. was betrothed to the infanta Maria Anna. But the death of
                    Orleans in 1723 gave a new direction to the king’s policy. In 1724 Europe was
                    astounded by the news that Philip had abdicated in favour of Don Luis, and had
                    gone into retirement at San Ildefonso. This act was generally attributed to the
                    indolence and superstition which formed the basis of his character, but the real
                    motive was undoubtedly a desire to remove the chief obstacle to his accession in
                    France. Louis XV., however, disappointed his expectations by continuing to live,
                    and the queen soon wearied of her unwonted seclusion. Luis only survived his
                    accession eight months, and to the surprise of the world Philip V. emerged from
                    his retreat to resume the crown which he had laid down of his own accord.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0361-0338"/> The queen returned to power more determined than
                    ever to carry out her favourite scheme of obtaining an Italian principality for
                    her eldest son Don Carlos. As France and England had shown themselves lukewarm
                    in the matter, she resolved to turn to her husband’s enemy, Charles VI. This
                    scheme was suggested by a Dutch adventurer, Ripperda, who inspired Elizabeth
                    with a belief that the Austrian alliance would enable her not only to effect her
                    object in Italy, but also to regain Gibraltar and Minorca for Spain. This was
                    rendered the more probable by the fact that Charles VI. had quarrelled with
                    England about the foundation of the Ostend Company. The conduct of the affair
                    was entrusted to Ripperda himself, and while he was at Vienna a great impulse
                    was given to the negotiation by a complete rupture between Spain and France. The
                    duke of Bourbon, who had become chief minister in France after the death of
                    Orleans, had set himself to reverse the policy of his predecessor. To complete
                    this, he sent the infanta back to Spain and married Louis XV. to Maria
                    Leczinska, daughter of the ex-king of Poland. This insult removed the last
                    scruples of Philip V. about the Austrian alliance, and in April 1725 Ripperda
                    concluded the treaty of Vienna. The mutual renunciations arranged by the
                    Quadruple Alliance were confirmed: Spain recognized the settlement of the
                    Austrian succession by the Pragmatic Sanction and promised great commercial
                    privileges to the Ostend Company, while Charles VI. pledged himself to secure
                    the succession of Don Carlos in Parma and Tuscany and to use his influence with
                    England to obtain the restitution of Gibraltar and Minorca. By a secret treaty
                    Charles further undertook, in the case of England’s refusal, to assist Spain
                    with arms and also to send aid to the Jacobites. These terms were soon divulged
                    by the indiscreet vanity of Ripperda himself, and England and France formed the
                    counter-league of Hanover (September 1725), which was also joined by Frederick
                    William I. of Prussia, though only for a short time.</p>
                <p>Ripperda returned to Spain, to be rewarded with the office of chief minister. But
                    his success seems to have turned his head; his boasts about the grand results to
                    be expected from the Austrian alliance proved to be ill-founded, aud his fall
                    was as sudden as his rise had been. After a brief period of exile in England, he
                    sought a new home in Morocco, where he became a convert to Islam and died in
                    1737. But his policy was continued by his successor, Don Joseph Patino, who sent
                    a fleet to lay siege to Gibraltar. Europe was now divided into two hostile
                    leagues, but the outbreak of a general war was averted, partly by the pacific
                    inclinations of Walpole in England and Fleury in France, and partly by the
                    growing coolness between Austria and Spain. Charles VI. had been led into the
                    treaty of Vienna by a momentary pique against England, but he soon realized that
                    he had more to lose than to gain by favouring the Spanish designs upon Italy.
                    Accordingly, in May 1727, while the siege of Gibraltar was proceeding, he threw
                    over his obligations to Spain and signed the preliminaries of a peace with
                    England and France. The Ostend Company was suspended, and the questions about
                    Parma, Tuscany, and Gibraltar were referred to a European congress at Soissons.
                    The Spanish Government found it impossible to hold out in isolation, and
                    accepted these terms by the convention of the Pardo (March 1728).</p>
                <p>The congress of Soissons was a complete failure, and the irrepressible energy of
                    the Spanish queen discovered a new method of obtaining her ends. The birth of a
                    son to Louis XV. removed into the background all idea of the succession in
                    France, and the attitude of Charles VI. proved that he would do nothing for Don
                    Carlos. Under these circumstances there was no alternative but to sacrifice the
                    prospect of recovering Gibraltar and Minorca and to seek the alliance of England
                    and France. By the treaty of Seville (November 1729) these powers, with Holland,
                    concluded an offensive and defensive alliance with Spain. The privileges which
                    the latter country had conferred upon the Ostend Company were revoked. Don
                    Carlos was recognized as the heir to Parma and Tuscany, and to enforce his
                    claims these provinces were to be occupied by 6000 Spanish troops. Charles VI.,
                    astounded at this sudden change in the aspect of affairs, took active steps to
                    oppose this occupation of the duchies. He collected 30,000 troops in Italy, and
                    when the old duke of Parma died in January 1731 he seized his territories as an
                    imperial fief. Elizabeth called upon her allies to carry out the treaty of
                    Seville, but Walpole and Fleury were unwilling to resort to hostilities. Luckily
                    Charles VI. thought more of securing his daughter’s succession in Austria than
                    of anything else. By promising that England would guarantee the Pragmatic
                    Sanction, Walpole induced the emperor to conclude the second treaty of Vienna
                    (March 1731), which dissolved the Ostend Company and confirmed the provisions of
                    the treaty of Seville. In 1732 English ships conveyed Don Carlos and the Spanish
                    troops to Italy. Parma and Piacenza were immediately occupied, and the
                    grand-duke of Tuscany acknowledged Don Carlos as his heir.</p>
                <p>In the long and intricate series of negotiations of which we have given a brief
                    summary the guiding thread is the grasping ambition of the queen of Spain. That
                    ambition was by no means satisfied by the results obtained in the treaty of
                    Vienna. Austria still held the Italian provinces of Spain and was looking out
                    for an opportunity to expel Don Carlos from central Italy. England retained her
                    hold upon Gibraltar and Minorca, and claimed a maritime and colonial supremacy
                    which threatened to thwart all schemes for the revival of Spanish commerce.
                    Elizabeth never relinquished for a moment the hope of humiliating England and
                    expelling the Hapsburgs from Italy. Circumstances at this time were more
                    favourable than they had ever been before. The able administration of Patino,
                    “the Colbert of Spain,” had restored order in the Spanish finances, and had
                    already made considerable strides towards the creation of a formidable fleet.
                    But the great advantage lay in the fact that the death of Orleans and the birth
                    of children to Louis XV. had removed all obstacles in the way of an alliance
                    between Spain and France. The close union between the two branches of the house
                    of Bourbon, which the Grand Alliance had endeavoured to avert, and which
                    circumstances had postponed for twenty years, was now to become an accomplished
                    fact. In 1733 “an eternal and irrevocable family compact” was signed by the
                    Count Rottembourg and Don Joseph Patino. France and Spain pledged themselves to
                    pursue a common policy in regard both to Austria and England, the object of
                    which was to destroy the Italian ascendency of the one and the commercial
                    monopoly of the other. This treaty, which constituted a danger to Europe hardly
                    less than the aggressions of Louis XIV., was kept a profound secret, and, though
                    its existence was more than suspected at the time, its full importance has not
                    been apprehended until recent times.</p>
                <p>The first opportunity for carrying out this common policy was offered by the
                    dispute about the Polish succession which broke out in 1733 between Stanislaus
                    Leczinski and Augustus III. of Saxony. Austria and Russia supported the latter
                    prince, while Louis XV. espoused the cause of his father-in-law. But the war in
                    Poland itself was of very secondary importance compared with the hostilities to
                    which it gave rise in southern Europe.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0362-0339"/> France, Spain, and Sardinia concluded the league
                    of Turin (October 1733) for the partition of Charles VI.’s Italian provinces.
                    The chief events of the war, from the Spanish point of view, were the occupation
                    of Naples and Sicily by Don Carlos. It was intended that he should keep these
                    kingdoms, and that Parma and Tuscany should be transferred to his younger
                    brother Don Philip. But Fleury, seeing an opportunity of securing his own ends,
                    refused to continue the war for the aggrandizement of Spain. In 1735 he
                    concluded the preliminaries of a peace with Austria by which Don Carlos was to
                    be recognized as king of the Two Sicilies, Charles VI. was to be compensated
                    with Parma, and his son-in-law was to receive Tuscany in exchange for Lorraine,
                    which was eventually to pass to France. The Spanish queen was bitterly indignant
                    at the desertion of her ally, at the cession of her native Parma to Austria, and
                    at the failure to provide anything for her second son. She struggled hard to
                    prolong the war, but the only result of her manoeuvres was to postpone the
                    conclusion of the definitive treaty until 1739, when the preliminaries were
                    confirmed.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Spain had become involved in a maritime quarrel with England. The
                    restrictions imposed by the treaty of Utrecht upon English trade with the
                    Spanish colonies had been systematically evaded by the development of a system
                    of organized smuggling on the part of the British traders. The Spaniards,
                    encouraged by the secret compact with France, refused to tolerate an abuse which
                    their weakness had compelled them to connive at in the previous century. To put
                    a stop to it they rigidly enforced their right of search, often seizing British
                    vessels on the high seas and treating the crews with gross brutality. This gave
                    rise to great ill-feeling between the two nations, which was increased by other
                    colonial disputes about the right of gathering logwood in Campeachy Bay and on
                    the frontiers of Florida. The popular indignation in England, which Walpole’s
                    opponents fanned for their own purposes, was raised to fever-heat by the story
                    of Jenkins, an English captain, who maintained that he had been tortured and his
                    ears cut off by a Spanish <hi rend="italic">guarda costa.</hi> Walpole, who had
                    refused to believe in the Family Compact, and had steadily adhered to a policy
                    of peace, was compelled by the popular clamour to declare war in October 1739.
                    The maritime operations which followed were insignificant. Admiral Vernon took
                    Porto Bello, and Anson plundered Payta; but England was distracted by party
                    jealousies and her naval organization had fallen into disorder during the long
                    peace. Luckily for her, Patino had died in 1736, and the impulse which he had
                    given to the Spanish navy ended with him. But before long the quarrel was
                    absorbed in the great European war which arose about the Austrian
                    succession.</p>
                <p>Charles VI. had persuaded almost every European power to guarantee the Pragmatic
                    Sanction, but the succession of Maria Theresa to his territories was not in the
                    least facilitated by the paper promises to support her. England was almost the
                    only power that adhered to its engagements. Frederick of Prussia advanced an
                    obsolete claim to Silesia, and France seized the opportunity to humiliate the
                    house of Hapsburg. Spain hastened to join the coalition against the unfortunate
                    heiress. Philip V. claimed to represent the Spanish branch of the Hapsburgs, and
                    pleaded the old family agreement by which they were to succeed on the extinction
                    of the Austrian line. There was no possibility of so absurd a claim being
                    recognized, but it opened the prospect of recovering the lost provinces in
                    Italy. Sardinia was gained over by the promise of part of Lombardy. Naples and
                    Sicily were already in the hands of Don Carlos. It seemed hardly possible that
                    Maria Theresa, pressed by enemies on every side, could successfully defend her
                    Italian territories. A Spanish army under Montemar was embarked in French
                    vessels, and, after evading the English fleet, landed in the Gulf of Genoa in
                    1741. The first news was discouraging, as Charles Emmanuel of Sardinia, ready
                    like his predecessors to sell his alliance to the highest bidder, had been
                    bought off by Maria Theresa. It was not till 1742 that the campaign began with
                    an advance upon Modena, where the duke had promised his support to Spain. But
                    the Austrians and Sardinians were the first in the field. They expelled the duke
                    of Modena from his territories, and drove Montemar to retreat towards Naples. At
                    the same time the English fleet appeared before Naples, and the threat of an
                    immediate bombardment compelled Don Carlos to promise a strict neutrality during
                    the rest of the war. Count Gages, who was sent to supersede the unsuccessful
                    Montemar, was unable to recover the lost ground, and the first campaign ended
                    without any serious-advantage to either side beyond the Austrian occupation of
                    Modena. In 1743 Gages again attempted the invasion of Lombardy, but was defeated
                    at Campo Santo and repulsed. Austria and Sardinia concluded a close alliance in
                    the treaty of Worms (September 1743), which was negotiated by England. France
                    and Spain sought to meet this coalition by renewing the Family Compact at
                    Fontainebleau (October 1743). France undertook to aid in conquering the Milanese
                    for Don Philip, to declare war against England, and not to make peace until
                    Gibraltar, and if possible Minorca too, had been restored to Spain. Don Philip
                    himself was sent with a Spanish army through southern France, but he failed to
                    force a passage through the Alps. The campaign of 1744 was indecisive, but in
                    the next year the great efforts made by Maria Theresa to recover Silesia gave
                    her opponents in Italy an opportunity of which they were not slow to avail
                    themselves. Gages effected a junction at Genoa with the combined French and
                    Spanish troops under Maillebois and Don Philip. Advancing into Piedmont the
                    allies took Tortona, and after occupying Parma and Piacenza they invaded
                    Lombardy. This move effected the desired object of separating the Austrians and
                    Sardinians. Schulenburg hurried off to the defence of his mistress’s
                    territories, and the allies at once turned upon Charles Emmanuel and defeated
                    him at Bassignano. The French wished to complete the conquest of Piedmont, but
                    the Spaniards insisted upon renewing the invasion of Lombardy. That province was
                    now entirely undefended, as the Austrians had returned to the assistance of
                    Charles Emmanuel, who detained them by the threat that if he were deserted he
                    would make terms with the allies. One town after another surrendered or was
                    taken, and in December Don Philip entered Milan in triumph. But meanwhile Maria
                    Theresa had ended the Silesian War by the treaty of Dresden, and was thus
                    enabled to send reinforcements into Italy. The tide of success turned with
                    marvellous rapidity. The Spaniards evacuated Lombardy, and were soon driven from
                    all their conquests in Piedmont except Tortona. At Piacenza, to which the
                    Bourbon army had retreated, it was completely defeated by the Austrians.</p>
                <p>At this juncture the news arrived from Spain that Philip V. had died on July 9,
                    and had been succeeded by Ferdinand VI., the only surviving son of hrs first
                    marriage. Elizabeth Farnese, “the termagant,” as Carlyle calls her, whose
                    ambition had kept Europe embroiled for thirty years, went into retirement at San
                    Ildefonso. This event naturally influenced the war in Italy. It was not likely
                    that the new king, who had never been on good terms with his stepmother, would
                    expend more of his country’s blood and treasure to obtain a principality for his
                    halfbrother. His first act was to supersede Gages by the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0363-0340"/> marquis of Las Minas, who found the Spanish army
                    at Tortona and hastened to withdraw it from Italy into Savoy, which Don Philip
                    had occupied since 1742. The Austrians at once besieged and captured Genoa, thus
                    cutting off the possibility of a renewed invasion of Italy, except through the
                    well-guarded passes of the Alps. From this time the military operations ceased
                    to have any direct importance for Spain, and all interest centred in the
                    negotiations which were carried on at Breda in 1747 and transferred to
                    Aix-la-Chapelle in the next year. The chief obstacle to peace was the demand of
                    a principality for Don Philip, which Ferdinand VI. persisted in as necessary for
                    the honour of Spain. Maria Theresa had already made sacrifices to Prussia and to
                    Sardinia, and resented the idea of ceding any more of her territories. But the
                    persistence of England carried the day, and in the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle
                    (October 1748) Don Philip obtained Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla as an
                    hereditary principality, on condition that they should revert to Austria on
                    extinction of his male descendants. This was the sole advantage gained by Spain.
                    Austria retained Lombardy, shorn of the portion promised to Charles Emmanuel;
                    and the commercial and naval ascendency of England remained unshaken. The
                    recovery of Gibraltar, which at one time Philip V. had confidently expected, was
                    now further off than ever.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand VI. was as feeble in health and as averse to business as his father had
                    been, but he was equally obstinate on certain points. He would have nothing to
                    do with the aggressive policy of his stepmother or with the Bourbon schemes for
                    the humiliation of England. His accession broke off the Family Compact, and gave
                    to Spain the unaccustomed boon of thirteen years’ peace. His aim was to hold the
                    balance between the rival powers of western Europe, and in this he was aided by
                    the discord between his two ministers, Ensenada and Carvalho, of whom the former
                    favoured France and the latter England. When Kaunitz, the Austrian envoy at
                    Versailles, was endeavouring to negotiate an alliance between the Hapsburgs and
                    Bourbons, Ferdinand seized the opportunity to conclude the treaty of Aranjuez,
                    which guaranteed the neutrality of the Italian provinces of the two families. On
                    the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War in 1756 great efforts were made to draw
                    Spain into the struggle. France offered Minorca, which had been lost by Byng at
                    the first outbreak of hostilities, and England hastened to make the
                    counter-proposition of a cession of Gibraltar. Ferdinand, however, refused both
                    bribes, and maintained his policy of peace till his death in 1759.</p>
                <p>This event gave the Spanish crown to Charles III., who had ruled the Two Sicilies
                    since 1735. His accession threatened a speedy reversal of Spanish policy. The
                    new king was a true Bourbon, and naturally inclined to the French alliance. He
                    had an old grudge against England for the treatment he had received in the War
                    of the Austrian Succession. He also owed a debt of gratitude to Maria Theresa
                    for enabling him to transfer the crown of Naples to his third son, whereas by
                    the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle it ought to have passed to his brother, Philip of
                    Parma. In spite of these motives, he hesitated for two years to take a decisive
                    step. Spain was not prepared for war, and Charles had never cordially approved
                    the change of policy at Versailles which had united France with its old rival
                    Austria. But the rapid successes of England under Pitt’s administration, and the
                    danger of a vast extension of the maritime and colonial ascendency of that
                    country, soon overcame his scruples. In 1761 the third Family Compact was
                    concluded, and Spain undertook to give active assistance to France unless peace
                    were concluded within a year. Pitt, suspecting the existence of this agreement,
                    proposed an immediate declaration of war against Spain, but he failed to
                    convince his cabinet and resigned. His successors, however, were driven to adopt
                    his policy, and in January 1762 hostilities commenced between the two countries.
                    But Spain only entered the war to share the disasters which France had already
                    begun to suffer. An invasion of Portugal, which had been regarded as a
                    defenceless prey, was foiled by English assistance, and the English fleet
                    captured Martinique and Havana. The Bourbon powers found it necessary to implore
                    peace, and it was fortunate for them that the English government had passed into
                    the hands of Bute, who was eager to diminish the influence of Pitt by
                    terminating the war. By the treaty of Paris (February 1763) England recovered
                    Minorca, extended its colonies in every direction at the expense of France, and
                    rejected all the demands which Charles III. had advanced on behalf of Spain.</p>
                <p>In spite of the treaty Charles III.’s foreign policy continued to be guided by
                    jealousy of England, and he clung to the French alliance as the only means by
                    which he could avenge his recent humiliation. In this he was encouraged by his
                    foreign minister, Grimaldi, who was so devoted to France that Choiseul declared
                    himself to be more powerful at Madrid than at Versailles. In 1770 a dispute
                    about the Falkland Islands, from which the English settlers had been expelled by
                    a Spanish force, would probably have led to a renewal of war if a domestic
                    intrigue had not succeeded at this juncture in overthrowing Choiseul. For the
                    next few years a marked coolness grew up between France and Spain, which was
                    increased when Louis XVI. disappointed the hopes that had been formed of his
                    accession and left Choiseul in retirement. Grimaldi, chagrined at the failure of
                    an alliance on which all his schemes were based, resigned office in 1777 and was
                    succeeded by Count Florida Blanca, one of the most distinguished of the able
                    ministers who ruled Spain during this period. The change of ministers made no
                    difference to the policy of Charles III., whose obstinacy was in no way inferior
                    to that of his predecessors. For many years Spain and Portugal had been engaged
                    in disputes about the frontiers of their territories in South America, disputes
                    which were rendered more bitter by the arrogance of Pombal, the Portuguese
                    minister. The death of Joseph I. in 1777 and the consequent dismissal of Pombal
                    enabled Florida Blanca to negotiate the treaty of San Ildefonso, by which
                    Sacramento and the navigation of the Rio de la Plata were ceded to Spain, and a
                    definite boundary was drawn between Brazil and Paraguay on the one side and Peru
                    on the other. This was followed in March 1778 by the conclusion of a perpetual
                    alliance at the Pardo, by which Portugal was attached to the interests of the
                    Bourbon states. These treaties, which Florida Blanca regarded as among the most
                    signal successes of his ministry, came very opportunely to enable Charles III.
                    to resume the schemes that had lain in abeyance since 1763. England was involved
                    in a desperate struggle with the revolted colonies of North America, and this
                    offered the Bourbons the long-desired opportunity for revenge. In 1778 France
                    entered into close alliance with the colonists, and in the next year Spain
                    followed her example. Everything seemed to favour the allies. The Northern
                    powers, irritated by the high-handed way in which England had asserted and
                    exercised her maritime supremacy, formed the “armed neutrality” under the lead
                    of Catherine II. of Russia. Even Holland, the oldest and most constant ally of
                    England, was involved in the general coalition. England, which had failed
                    single-handed to coerce its own subjects, was now face to face with the whole
                    maritime power of Europe, and was also hampered by domestic and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0364-0341"/> Irish troubles. Spain succeeded in capturing
                    Minorca and laid close siege to Gibraltar. Many of the West-Indian islands were
                    captured from the English, and the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown destroyed
                    the last hope of restoring American dependence. The most confident hopes were
                    entertained of stripping England of the great bulk of its colonial possessions.
                    But in 1782 the tide of success turned. Rodney, by the novel manoeuvre of
                    breaking the line, destroyed the French fleet in the West Indies, while the
                    heroic defence of General Elliott and the opportune arrival of supplies under
                    the convoy of Lord Howe saved Gibraltar from overwhelming odds. The want of
                    unanimity among the allies, each of whom thought only of its own interests,
                    hastened the conclusion of peace in 1783. The treaty of Versailles, by which
                    Spain kept Minorca and obtained the Floridas, was the most honourable which that
                    country had concluded since Cateau Cambrésis. But the failure to recover
                    Gibraltar was a bitter disappointment to Charles III., who continued till his
                    death (December 14, 1788) to cherish the scheme of renewing the war, though the
                    growing disorders in France made it more and more certain that he could no
                    longer rely upon the assistance of that country.</p>
                <p>The reigns of the first three Bourbon kings form a period of great importance in
                    Spanish history. At the end of the 17th century Spain appeared to be a lifeless
                    corpse, over which the other powers of Europe could contend at will. In the 18th
                    century men were astounded to see that country rise with renewed vigour to play
                    once more an independent part on the international stage. This revival was due
                    in the first place to the change of dynasty. Another Hapsburg would probably
                    have continued the obsolete policy of his predecessors. The accession of the
                    Bourbons introduced into Spain the methods and ideas of government which had
                    raised France to greatness under Richelieu, Mazarin, and Colbert. The two great
                    problems to be grappled with were the profound depression of trade and
                    agriculture and the fatal wealth and ascendency of the church. Philip V., feeble
                    as he was personally, began the movement in advance even during the Succession
                    War. The abolition of the old provincial independence rendered possible a more
                    regular and centralized government, an increase of the revenue, and the removal
                    of the old impediments to trade between the various provinces. The French
                    officers who accompanied the king gave a new organization and new tactics to the
                    Spanish army. Under the influence of the princess Orsini Philip seemed inclined
                    to attack even the prescriptive privileges of the clergy. His marriage with
                    Elizabeth Farnese saved the hierarchy and diverted his attention to wars of
                    aggrandizement. But these wars were directed by purely political motives; the
                    old Hapsburg idea of a religious propaganda was for ever abandoned. And even
                    during the war the task of internal reform was hindered rather than neglected.
                    The efforts of Alberoni and Patino gave Spain a navy more powerful than that of
                    Philip II. The conquest of the Two Sicilies and the acquisition of Parma, though
                    they brought little direct advantage to Spain, yet gave conclusive evidence that
                    the old lethargy had been shaken off and that the country was capable of
                    exertions and sacrifices which had long appeared impossible. The period of peace
                    under Ferdinand VI. was an inestimable boon to Spain. Taxation was lightened,
                    production was facilitated by the removal of the most crushing burdens, yet at
                    the same time the revenue improved and the chronic deficit of previous reigns
                    was replaced by a surplus. And this prince took a step which no one would have
                    expected from him. The concordat of 1753 was the first vindication of the
                    political interests of Spain against the pretensions of Rome. The crown asserted
                    its right to appoint to all important benefices, and the number of papal
                    presentations was reduced from twelve thousand to fifty-two. The revenue derived
                    by the curia from Spain was proportionately diminished, and the clergy were
                    compelled to recognize their obligations as members of the body politic. This
                    measure was. followed by an edict that henceforth papal bulls should not be
                    obeyed until they had received the royal sanction.</p>
                <p>The work of reform, thus tentatively commenced under Philip V. and Ferdinand VI.,
                    was carried still further by Charles III., whose reign is regarded with more
                    pride by the Spaniards than any other since that of Philip II. Charles had
                    served an apprenticeship in the art of government in Naples, where, with the
                    help of his minister Tanucci, he had successfully grappled with evils similar to
                    those from which Spain was suffering. He would have been a prince quite after
                    the heart of the 18th century if he had not retained too large a share of the
                    superstition of his family. He shared to the full that conception of the rights
                    and duties of monarchy which inspired the reforms of Frederick the Great and
                    Joseph IL, and his allegiance to the church was fortunately counterbalanced by
                    his desire for absolutism. His greatest work, the expulsion of the Jesuits,
                    would never have been carried out if he had not been persuaded of its political
                    necessity. The order had already been driven by Pombal from Portugal and by
                    Choiseul from France, when Charles III. was convinced that a riot in Madrid,
                    provoked by the financial measures of Squillaci, had been promoted by the
                    Jesuits. This conviction overpowered all scruples; the fathers were promptly
                    removed from the country, and Spain joined the other Bourbon courts in demanding
                    that suppression of the order which was finally decreed by Clement XIV. in 1773.
                    The Rubicon once crossed, Charles’s ministers urged him on in the path of
                    ecclesiastical reform. The increase of lands in mortmain was restricted; the
                    number of monasteries was diminished; and the Inquisition was compelled to
                    moderate its procedure and to subordinate its independence to the royal will.
                    For the papal jurisdiction was substituted a national court, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pota,</hi> established at Madrid.</p>
                <p>These measures, of which the importance in a country like Spain can hardly be
                    over-estimated, were accompanied by others no less notable for the development
                    of trade and agriculture. The colonial trade was freed from the old restriction
                    which compelled it to pass through Cadiz, and other ports were opened for its
                    reception. Native manufactures were encouraged in every way, and a famous
                    ordinance in 1773 endeavoured to remove the old prejudice against trade by
                    declaring that the engaging in industrial occupations should not involve any
                    loss of rank or its privileges. Internal communication was facilitated by the
                    construction of canals. Agriculture was revived by the removal of the old
                    prohibition against enclosures,— so long maintained by the selfish influence of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mesta,</hi> —by the planting of trees in the arid deserts
                    of central Spain, and by the rapid growth of population, which rose in the
                    course of the century from 5,700,000 to 10,541,000. These measures, which are
                    only selected from a large number tending in the same direction, are to be
                    credited to three ministers, whose names reflect its chief lustre upon Charles
                    III.’s reign. D’Aranda, who succeeded the Italian Squillaci as finance minister,
                    was an Aragonese noble who had imbibed the spirit of philosophical speculation
                    from France. He was the first layman who presided in the council of Castile, and
                    he introduced into the Spanish administration a liberal tendency quite opposed
                    to the traditions of the country. His views, however, were not congenial to the
                    king, and, after completing his work with regard to the Jesuits and the
                    Inquisition, he retired to the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0365-0342"/> embassy in Paris and was succeeded by Campomanes.
                    The latter was not only a distinguished statesman but also one of the foremost
                    representatives of Spanish literature. He was one of the earliest students of
                    political economy, and many of the most enlightened measures for the relief and
                    encouragement of trade are to be assigned to him. But his administration, which
                    aimed at educating the people to a share in political life, was almost as alien
                    to the wishes of Charles III. as the liberal and anticlerical schemes of
                    D’Aranda. A far more congenial minister was found in Florida Blanca, whose aim
                    was to promote the material interests of Spain by the supervision of an internal
                    despotism, who stopped the attack on the church when its subordination was
                    secured, who supported the economic reforms of Campomanes, but would only carry
                    them out by a rigid bureaucracy, and who conciliated the king by falling in with
                    his foreign policy even when it conflicted with the national welfare.</p>
                <p>Meritorious as Charles III.’s reforms were, it would give a false impression to
                    represent them as completely successful. The regeneration of Spain was by no
                    means accomplished, and many of the abuses which had been growing for centuries
                    survived the attempt to effect their annihilation. One of the chief causes of
                    this failure was the corruption and ignorance of the lower officials. The
                    reforming impulse was confined to the educated classes, and made little
                    impression upon the bulk of the people. It was of little use to devise the most
                    enlightened measures when there was no efficient machinery to carry them out.
                    Many of the most promising reforms remained mere paper schemes. The methods
                    employed, too, were not always the best calculated to obtain their end. The
                    state took too much upon itself, and attempted to discharge functions which
                    would have been better left to local enterprise. Roads were constructed on a
                    magnificent scale, but only too often in directions where they were not wanted,
                    and they remained almost unused. Thus the debt was increased without any
                    improvement of the revenue. The return of Charles III. to a military policy
                    imposed serious burdens upon the country, and it would have been better to have
                    prolonged the peace of Ferdinand VI.’s reign, inglorious as it appeared to an
                    ambitious king. Undoubtedly a great advance was made, but equal exertions would
                    have produced a greater result in any other country. The population of Spain
                    remained to a great extent sunk in sloth and superstition. Much might be hoped
                    from a steady persistence in ameliorative measures, but unfortunately the work
                    of reform was interrupted just at the moment when success appeared to be within
                    reach.</p>
                <p>The death of Charles III. and the accession of Charles IV. were contemporary with
                    the outbreak of the French Revolution, which was destined to exercise a decisive
                    influence over the fortunes of the adjacent peninsula. Florida Blanca, who
                    continued to hold office during the first three years of the new reign, found it
                    impossible to continue his policy. The revival of Spain could only be effected
                    by the restoration of its naval and colonial ascendency at the expense of
                    England, and for the carrying out of this scheme the support of France was
                    imperatively necessary. But the French alliance rested upon the relationship
                    between the two branches of the house of Bourbon, and the Family Compact ceased
                    to exist when Louis XVI. was deprived of power by his subjects. Of this
                    conclusive evidence was given in 1791. Some English merchants founded a
                    settlement at Nootka Sound on the west coast of America, which provoked an
                    indignant protest from Spain. But the French national assembly refused to send
                    any assistance, and Florida Blanca was compelled to conclude a humiliating
                    treaty and to give up all hope of opposing the progress of England. This failure
                    was attributed by the minister to the Revolution, of which he became the
                    uncompromising opponent. The reforms of Charles III.’s reign were abandoned; all
                    liberal tendencies in Spain were suppressed; and the Government set itself to
                    restore the old lethargy under absolute rule from which the country had been
                    gradually awakened. The movement of reform had made so little progress among the
                    mass of the people that reaction was really easier than progress. But Florida
                    Blanca was not content with suppressing liberalism in Spain; he was eager to
                    avenge his disappointment by crushing the Revolution in France. He opened
                    negotiations with the emigrants, urged the European powers to a crusade on
                    behalf of legitimacy, and paraded the devotion of Charles IV. to the head of his
                    family. This bellicose policy, however, brought him into collision with the
                    queen. Maria Louisa of Parma, a woman whose real abilities were perverted to the
                    gratification of sensual lusts, was unwilling to allow the minister to share her
                    ascendency over the feeble mind of her husband, and she feared that the outbreak
                    of war would diminish the revenues which she squandered in self-indulgence. She
                    had already removed from the ministry Campomanes and other supporters of Florida
                    Blanca, and had compelled the latter to restrict himself to the single
                    department of foreign affairs. Early in 1792 she completed her task by inducing
                    Charles IV. to banish Florida Blanca to Murcia, aud his place was entrusted to
                    the veteran D’Aranda. But the new minister found that he held office only at the
                    favour of the queen, and that this had to be purchased by a disgraceful
                    servility to her paramour, Emanuel Godoy. Spain withdrew from the projected
                    coalition against France, and sought to maintain an attitude of neutrality,
                    which alienated the other powers, while it failed to conciliate the republic.
                    The repressive measures of Florida Blanca were withdrawn; society and the press
                    regained their freedom; and no opposition was offered to the propaganda of
                    French ideas. D’Aranda’s policy might have been successful if it had been
                    adopted earlier, but the time for temporizing was now past, and it was necessary
                    for Spain to choose one side or the other. But the decision was not allowed to
                    rest with the man who had always shown a sympathy with the revolutionary
                    principles. In November 1792 the queen felt herself strong enough to carry out
                    the scheme which she had been long maturing. D’Aranda was dismissed, and the
                    office of first minister was entrusted to Godoy, who had recently received the
                    title of duke of Alcudia. Godoy, who was at once the queen’s lover and the
                    personal favourite of the king, had had no education for the part which he was
                    called upon to play. Though endowed with a natural quickness of parts and a
                    capacity for intrigue, he had no habits of application, no experience of the
                    routine of office, and above all no settled policy. His appointment was regarded
                    with jealousy by the grandees of Spain, while his undisguised relations with the
                    queen outraged the moral feelings of the best part of the nation. Luckily for
                    Godoy, the course to be pursued was decided for him. The execution of Louis XVI.
                    (January 21, 1793) made a profound impression in a country where loyalty was a
                    superstition. Charles IV. was roused to demand vengeance for the insult to his
                    family, and from one end of Spain to the other a cry resounded for immediate war
                    with the impious rebels who had shed the blood of an anointed king. Godoy had
                    nothing to do but to follow the national impulse, and Spain became a member of
                    the first coalition against France. Everything seemed to promise a rapid and
                    complete success. The number of volunteers who offered their services rendered
                    conscription unnecessary; and the southern provinces of France were so
                    preponder<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0366-0343"/> atingly royalist that they were ready to welcome
                    the Spaniards as deliverers. These advantages, however, were nullified by the
                    shameful incompetence and carelessness of the Government. The troops were left
                    without supplies; no plan of combined action was imposed upon the commanders;
                    and each regiment was left to act of its own will. The military action of Spain
                    provoked the contempt of Europe. The two campaigns of 1793 and 1794 were one
                    long catalogue of failures. The bravery of the soldiers was rendered useless by
                    the incapacity of their officers, and the maladministration of the central
                    Government excited such disgust that an outbreak of revolutionary disturbance in
                    Spain itself seemed more than possible. Instead of reducing the southern
                    provinces of France, the Spaniards were driven from the strong fortresses that
                    guarded the Pyrenees, and the French advanced almost to the Ebro. And at the
                    same time the English, the hated rivals of Spain, were utilizing the war to
                    extend their colonial power and were establishing more firmly that maritime
                    supremacy which the Spanish Government had been struggling for almost a century
                    to overthrow. Under the circumstances it is no wonder that the queen and Godoy
                    hastened to follow the example set by Prussia, and concluded the treaty of Basel
                    with France. The terms were unexpectedly favourable. Spain purchased the
                    evacuation of her territories and fortresses by the cession of her share of St
                    Domingo, which had little but a sentimental value as the first discovery of
                    Columbus, and which had already been occupied by the English. So great was the
                    joy excited in Madrid that popular acclamation greeted the bestowal upon Godoy
                    of the title of “Prince of the Peace.” But the moderation of the treaty was only
                    a flimsy disguise of the disgrace that it involved. Spain found herself tied
                    hand and foot to the French republic. Godoy had to satisfy his allies by the
                    encouragement of reforms which both he and his mistress loathed, and in 1796 the
                    veil was removed by the conclusion of the treaty of San Ildefonso. This was a
                    virtual renewal of the Family Compact of 1761, but with far more disadvantageous
                    terms to Spain. Each power was pledged to assist the other in case of war with
                    twenty-five ships, 18,000 infantry, and 6000 cavalry. The real object of the
                    treaty, which was to involve Spain in the war against England, was cynically
                    avowed in the eighteenth article, by which, during the present war, the Spanish
                    obligations were only to apply to the quarrel between England and France. A
                    scheme was prepared for a joint attack on the English coast, but it was foiled
                    by the battle of St Vincent, in which Jervis and Nelson forced the Spanish fleet
                    to retire to Cadiz. This defeat was the more disastrous because it cut off the
                    connexion with the colonies and thus deprived Spain of the revenues derived from
                    that quarter. The finances, already exhausted by extravagance and
                    maladministration, were in no condition to meet the expenses of a naval war.
                    England seized the opportunity to punish Spain for its conduct in the American
                    War by encouraging discontent in the Spanish colonies, and in the Peninsula
                    itself both nobles and people were bitterly hostile to the queen and her
                    favourite. It was in vain that Godoy sought to secure the friendship of the
                    reforming party by giving office to two of its most prominent members,
                    Jovellanos and Saavedra. Spanish pride and bigotry were offended by the French
                    occupation of Rome and the erection of a republic in the place of the papal
                    government. The treatment of the duke of Parma by the Directory was keenly
                    resented by the queen. Godoy found himself between two parties, the liberals and
                    the ultramontanes, who agreed only in hatred of himself. At the same time the
                    Directory, whose mistrust was excited by his attitude in the question of Parma,
                    insisted upon his dismissal. Charles IV. could not venture to refuse a demand
                    from France; the queen was alienated by Godoy’s notorious infidelities; and in
                    March 1798 he was compelled to resign his office. But he did not forfeit his
                    hold on the king’s favour, and he only waited for a favourable opportunity to
                    emerge from his retirement.</p>
                <p>Godoy’s office was entrusted to Saavedra, but the reformers did not obtain the
                    advantages which they expected from the change. Jovellanos was compelled in
                    August to retire on account of ill-health,—the result, it was rumoured, of
                    attempts on the part of his opponents to poison him. His place was taken by
                    Caballero, an ardent opponent of reform, who restored all the abuses of the old
                    bureaucratic administration and pandered to the most bigoted prejudices of the
                    clergy and the court. The ministry was hopelessly divided, and the policy of the
                    country was directed by the basest and most paltry intrigues. The only advantage
                    which Spain enjoyed at this period was comparative independence of France. The
                    military plans of the Directory were unsuccessful during the absence of their
                    greatest general in Egypt, and the second coalition gained successes in 1799
                    which had seemed impossible since 1793. But the return of Bonaparte, followed as
                    it was by the fall of the Directory and the establishment of the Consulate,
                    commenced a new epoch for Spain. As soon as the First Consul had time to turn
                    his attention to the Peninsula, he determined to restore Godoy, who had already
                    regained the affection of the queen, and to make him the tool of his policy.
                    Maria Louisa was easily gained over by playing on her devotion to the house of
                    Parma, and on October 1, 1800, a secret treaty was concluded at San Ildefonso.
                    Spain undertook to cede Louisiana and to aid France in all her wars, while
                    Bonaparte promised to raise the duke of Parma to the rank of king and to
                    increase his territories by the addition either of Tuscany or of the Roman
                    Legations. This was followed by Godoy’s return to power, though he left the
                    department of foreign affairs to a subordinate. Spain was now more servile to
                    France than ever, and in 1801 was compelled to attack Portugal in the French
                    interests. Bonaparte was indignant against Portugal, partly because its fleet
                    had aided his enemies in Egypt, and partly because its harbours offered great
                    naval advantages to the English. The Spanish invasion, which was commanded by
                    Godoy in person, met with no resistance, and the prince ventured to conclude a
                    peace on his own authority by which Portugal promised to observe a strict
                    neutrality on condition that its territories were left undiminished. But
                    Bonaparte resented this show of independence, and compelled Charles IV. to
                    refuse his ratification of the treaty. Portugal had to submit to far harsher
                    terms, and could only purchase peace by the cession of territory in Guiana, by a
                    disadvantageous treaty of commerce, and by a payment of twenty-five millions of
                    francs. This insult to his ally Bonaparte followed up by others. In the
                    preliminary treaty with England he ceded the Spanish colony of Trinidad without
                    even consulting the court of Madrid, while he sold Louisiana to the United
                    States in spite of his promise not to alienate it except to Spain. For these
                    humiliations Spain had to console itself with the empty honour of being the
                    first signatory of the treaty of Amiens.</p>
                <p>For nearly three years Spain was allowed to remain at peace. Its finances were
                    partially revived by the restoration of free intercourse with the colonies and
                    by the payment of the supplies which had been withheld for the last six years.
                    But the administration was as incompetent and misdirected as ever. Godoy, since
                    his return to office, had abandoned all connexion with the reforming party<pb

                    policy of</p>
                <p>Caballero. The Spanish church was once more placed in strict subjection to the
                    Roman see, from which for a short time it had been freed. But the worst evil lay
                    in the undisguised domination of France, which the Government was wholly
                    incapable of shaking off. As soon as Bonaparte saw himself involved in a new war
                    with England, he turned to Spain for assistance and extorted a new treaty
                    (October 9, 1803), which was still more burdensome than that of 1796. Spain had
                    to pay a monthly subsidy of six million francs, and to pledge itself to enforce
                    a strict neutrality upon Portugal. Thus the country was involved in a new and
                    still more disastrous war with England. The last remnants of its maritime power
                    were shattered in the battles of Cape Finisterre and Trafalgar, and the English
                    seized Buenos Ayres. The popular hatred of Godoy was roused to passion by these
                    disasters, and many competent observers believed that Spain stood on the brink
                    of revolution. At the head of the opposition was the crown prince Ferdinand, as
                    insignificant as his rival, but endowed with all good qualities by the credulous
                    favour of the people. To maintain himself against his domestic enemies Godoy
                    turned to France, where Bonaparte, now the emperor Napoleon L, was irritated by
                    the crown prince’s marriage with a daughter of the king of Naples. The court
                    quarrels at Madrid were fomented from Paris in order to complete the
                    subordination of Spain. Napoleon was at this time eager to humble England by
                    excluding it from all trade with Europe. The only country which had not accepted
                    his “continental system” was Portugal, and he determined to reduce that kingdom
                    by force. It was not difficult to bribe Godoy, who was conscious that his
                    position could not be maintained after the death of Charles IV. In October 1807
                    Spain accepted the treaty of Fontainebleau, which arranged a partition of
                    Portugal into three parts. The northern provinces were to be given to the young
                    king of Etruria, who was to purchase them by the cession of Tuscany. In the
                    south a principality was to be carved out for Godoy himself. The central
                    district was to be kept in pledge by France until the conclusion of a general
                    peace. The treaty was hardly concluded when a French army under Junot marched
                    through Spain to Portugal, and the royal family of that country fled to Brazil.
                    But Spain was destined to share the same fate as its neighbour. The crown
                    prince, whose wife had died in 1806, determined to imitate his rival by bidding
                    for French support. He entered into secret relations with Beauharnais,
                    Napoleon’s envoy at Madrid, and went so far as to demand the hand of a Bonaparte
                    princess. Godoy, who discovered the intrigue, induced Charles IV. to order his
                    son s arrest. Napoleon at once seized the opportunity to make himself absolute
                    master of Spain, and ordered French troops to cross the Pyrenees in support of
                    the prince. This act terrified Godoy into a reconciliation with his opponents,
                    but the French invasion was not delayed by the removal of its pretext. Charles
                    IV. and his minister, conscious that they could expect no support from the
                    people, determined on flight. The news of this intention, however, excited a
                    popular rising in Madrid, and the king was compelled to abdicate in favour of
                    his son Murat, however, who commanded the French, refused to be turned aside by
                    this change of circumstances. He obtained from Charles IV. a declaration that
                    his abdication had been involuntary, and occupied Madrid (March 23, 1808).
                    Meanwhile Napoleon advanced to the frontier, and Ferdinand was lured by French
                    agents to an interview with the emperor at Bayonne. There he was confronted with
                    his parents and Godoy, and was intimidated into restoring the crown to his
                    father, who at once made a second abdication. Napoleon now divulged the real
                    intention of his actions, and the crown of Spain was formally conferred upon his
                    brother Joseph Bonaparte, who two years before had been made king of Naples.</p>
                <p>But Spanish loyalty was too profound to be daunted even by the awe-inspiring
                    power of the French emperor. For the first time Napoleon found himself
                    confronted, not by terrified and selfish rulers, but by an infuriated people.
                    The rising in Spain commenced the popular movement which ultimately proved fatal
                    to his power. At first he treated the novel phenomenon with contempt, and
                    thought it sufficient to send his less prominent generals against the rebels.
                    Madrid was taken without difficulty, but the capital was absolutely devoid of
                    military importance, and the Spaniards showed great capacity for the guerilla
                    warfare in the provinces. The French were repulsed from Valencia; and Dupont,
                    who had advanced into the heart of Andalusia, was compelled to retreat and
                    ultimately to capitulate with all his forces at Baylen (July 10). The Spaniards
                    now advanced upon Madrid and drove Joseph from the capital, which he had just
                    entered. Unfortunately the insurgents displayed less political ability than
                    military courage. The government was entrusted in Ferdinand’s name to a central
                    junta of thirty-four members, a number which was far too large for the conduct
                    of executive business. Napoleon’s arrival in Spain was enough to restore victory
                    to the French. In less than a week the Spanish army was broken through and
                    scattered, and Napoleon restored his brother in Madrid. Sir John Moore, who had
                    advanced with an English army to the relief of the capital, retired when he
                    found he was too late, and an obstinate battle, in which the gallant general
                    lost his life, had to be fought before the troops could secure their embarkation
                    at Coruna. Napoleon, thinking the work accomplished, had quitted the Peninsula,
                    and Soult and Victor were left to complete the reduction of the provinces. The
                    capture of Seville resulted in the dissolution of the central junta, and the
                    Peninsula was only saved from final submission by the obstinate resistance of
                    Wellington in Portugal and by dissensions among the French. The marshals were
                    jealous of each other, and Napoleon’s plans were not approved by his brother.
                    Joseph wished to restore peace and order among his subjects in the hope of
                    ruling an independent nation, while Napoleon was determined to annex Spain to
                    his own overgrown empire. So far did these disputes go that Joseph resigned his
                    crown, and was with difficulty induced to resume it. Meanwhile Cadiz became the
                    capital of what was left of independent Spain, and there the cortes met in 1810
                    for the purpose of drawing up a new constitution. The fall of the old monarchy
                    and the exigencies of self-defence had given to the reforming party an
                    ascendency which they had never before possessed. In the constitution which was
                    promulgated early in 1812 the principles of the French constituent assembly were
                    closely followed. The Inquisition had already perished, and the last relics of
                    the old autocratic government shared its fate. Supreme legislative power was
                    placed in the hands of a single national assembly, and effective checks were
                    devised to restrict the power of the monarchy whenever it should be revived. The
                    freedom of the press was established, and the property of the clergy was
                    confiscated to defray the expenses of the war. The great defect of the
                    constitution was that it was the work of one party, to which circumstances had
                    given a temporary supremacy, and it failed to command the support of the united
                    nation. The nobles and priests were bitterly hostile, and the latter had more
                    influence in Spain than in any European country except Ireland.</p>

                    England. Wellington had already made two attempts to advance from Portugal into
                    the adjacent kingdom, but had been foiled by superior forces. In 1812 he
                    determined on a great effort. He secured his base of operations by the capture
                    of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, and at Salamanca he completely routed the
                    opposing army of Marmont. This victory enabled the English general to enter
                    Madrid (August 12), and Joseph retreated to Valencia. But further advance was
                    prevented by the concentration of the French forces in the east, and Wellington
                    found it advisable to retire for the third time to winter-quarters on the
                    Portuguese frontier. It was during this winter that Napoleon suffered his first
                    and greatest reverse in the retreat from Moscow and the destruction of his grand
                    army. This was the signal for the outbreak of the “war of liberation” in
                    Germany, and French troops had to be withdrawn from Spain to central Europe. For
                    the first time Wellington found himself opposed by fairly equal forces. In the
                    spring of 1813 he advanced from Ciudad Rodrigo and defeated Jourdan at Vittoria,
                    the battle which finally decided the Peninsular War. Joseph retired altogether
                    from his kingdom, and Wellington, eager to take his part in the great European
                    contest, fought his way through the Pyrenees into France. Napoleon, who had
                    suffered a crushing defeat at Leipsic, hastened to recognize the impossibility
                    of retaining Spain by releasing Ferdinand VII., who returned to Madrid in March
                    1814.</p>
                <p>After the convulsions it had endured Spain required a period of firm but
                    conciliatory government, but the ill-fate of the country gave the throne at this
                    crisis to the worst of her Bourbon kings. Ferdinand VII. had never possessed the
                    good qualities which popular credulity had assigned to him, and he had learnt
                    nothing in his four years’ captivity except an aptitude for lying and intrigue.
                    He had no conception of the duties of a ruler; his public conduct was regulated
                    by pride and superstition, and his private life was stained by the grossest
                    sensual indulgence. Spain was still governed under the constitution of 1812, but
                    the king’s first act was to dissolve the cortes and to abrogate the
                    constitution, promising, however, to grant a new one in its place. But no sooner
                    was he established on the throne, and conscious of the strong reaction in favour
                    of the monarchy, than he threw his promises to the wind and set himself to
                    restore the old absolutism with all its worst abuses. The nobles recovered their
                    privileges and their exemption from taxes; the monasteries were restored; the
                    Inquisition resumed its activity; and the Jesuits returned to Spain. The
                    liberals were ruthlessly persecuted, together with all who had acknowledged
                    Joseph Bonaparte. A <hi rend="italic">camarlla</hi> of worthless courtiers and
                    priests conducted the government, and urged the king to fresh acts of
                    revolutionary violence. For six years Spain groaned under a royalist “reign of
                    terror,” and isolated revolts only served as the occasion for fresh cruelties.
                    The finances were squandered in futile expeditions to recover the South American
                    colonies, which had taken advantage of Napoleon’s conquest of Spain to establish
                    their independence. In his straits for money Ferdinand ventured to outrage
                    national sentiment by selling Florida to the United States in 1819. Discontent
                    found expression in the formation of secret societies, which were especially
                    powerful among the neglected and ill-paid soldiers. At last, in 1820, Riego and
                    Quiroga, two officers of an expedition which had been prepared for South
                    America, raised the standard of revolt in Cadiz. Ferdinand and his advisers
                    proved as incapable as they were tyrannical, and their feeble irresolution
                    enabled the movement to spread over the whole country. In March the king gave
                    way and accepted the constitution of 1812.</p>
                <p>The royalists or <hi rend="italic">serviles,</hi> as they were called, were
                    dismissed from office and their places taken by liberals. The cortes met in
                    July, and at once proceeded to dissolve the monasteries and the Inquisition, to
                    confiscate the clerical tithes, to abolish entails, and to secure the freedom of
                    the press and of popular meetings. Great results might have been achieved if the
                    moderate party, under Martinez de la Rosa, had been able to grapple with the
                    task of suppressing disorder and establishing a permanent constitution. But this
                    was the last thing which the king desired, and the moderates were defeated by a
                    factious combination of the <hi rend="italic">serviles</hi> and the radicals.
                    Risings took place among the loyal and bigoted peasants of the provinces, and
                    their suppression contributed to the victory of the extreme party, which seemed
                    to be secured in 1822 by the election of Riego as president of the cortes.</p>
                <p>But Spain was not allowed to work out its own salvation. Europe was dominated at
                    this time by the Holy Alliance, which disguised a resolution to repress popular
                    liberties and to maintain despotism under a pretended zeal for piety, justice,
                    and brotherly love. At the congress of Verona (October 1822) France, Austria,
                    Russia, and Prussia agreed upon armed intervention in Spain, in spite of the
                    protest of Canning on the part of England. Spain was to be called upon to alter
                    her constitution and to grant greater liberty to the king, and if an
                    unsatisfactory answer were received France was authorized to take active
                    measures. The demand was unhesitatingly refused, and a French army, 100,000
                    strong, at once entered Spain under the duke of Angoulême (April 1823). No
                    effective resistance was made, and Madrid was entered by the invaders (May 23).
                    The cortes, however, had carried off the king to Seville, whence they again
                    retreated to Cadiz. The bombardment of that city terminated the revolution and
                    Ferdinand was released (October 1). His first act was to revoke everything that
                    had been done since 1819. The Inquisition was not restored, but the secular
                    tribunals took a terrible revenge upon the leaders of the rebellion. The protest
                    of the duke of Angoulême against these cruelties was unheeded. Even the fear of
                    revolt, the last check upon despotism, was removed by the presence of the French
                    army, which remained in Spain till 1827. But Spain had to pay for the
                    restoration of the royal absolutism, as Canning backed up his protest against
                    the intervention of France by acknowledging the independence of the Spanish
                    colonies.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand VII. was enabled to finish his worthless and disastrous reign in
                    comparative peace. In 1829 he married a fourth wife, Maria Christina of Naples,
                    and at the same time he issued a “Pragmatic Sanction” abolishing the Salic law
                    in Spain. No one expected any practical results from this edict, but a formal
                    protest was made against it by the king’s brothers, Carlos and Francisco, and
                    also by the French and Neapolitan Bourbons. In the next year, however, the queen
                    gave birth to a daughter, Isabella, who was proclaimed as queen on her father’s
                    death in 1833, while her mother undertook the office of regent. Don Carlos at
                    once asserted his intention of maintaining the Salic law, and rallied round him
                    all the supporters of absolutism, especially the inhabitants of the Basque
                    Provinces. Christina was compelled to rely upon the liberals, and to conciliate
                    them by the grant of a constitution, the <hi rend="italic">estatuto real,</hi>
                    which established two chambers chosen by indirect election. But this
                    constitution, drawn up under the influence of Louis Philippe of France, failed
                    to satisfy the advanced liberals, and the Christinos split into two parties, the

                    1836 the latter party extorted from the regent the revival of the constitution

                    considerable successes under Zumalacarregui and Cabrera. But the death of
                    Zumalacarregui in 1835 and the support of France and England ultimately gave the
                    regent the upper hand, and in 1839 her general, Espartero, forced the Basque
                    Provinces to submit to Isabella. Don Carlos renounced his claims in favour of
                    his eldest son, another Carlos, and retired to Trieste, where he died in 1855.
                    Christina now tried to sever herself from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >progresistas,</hi> and to govern with the help of the moderate party who
                    enjoyed the patronage of Louis Philippe. But England, jealous of French
                    influence at Madrid, threw the weight of her influence on to the side of the
                    radicals, who found a powerful leader in Espartero. In 1840 Christina had to
                    retire to France, and Espartero was recognized as regent by the cortes. But his
                    elevation was resented by the other officers, while his subservience to England
                    made him unpopular, and in 1843 he also had to go into exile. Isabella was now
                    declared of age. Christina returned to Madrid, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >moderados</hi> under Narvaez obtained complete control over the government.
                    This was a great victory for France, and Louis Philippe abused his success by
                    negotiating the infamous “Spanish marriages.” A husband was found for Isabella
                    in her cousin, Francis of Assis, whose recommendation in French eyes was the
                    improbability of his begetting children. On the same day the queen’s sister,
                    Maria Louisa, was married to Louis Philippe’s son, the duke of Montpensier. By
                    this means it was hoped to secure the reversion of the Spanish throne for the
                    house of Orleans. The scheme recoiled on the heads of those who framed it. The
                    alienation of England gave a fatal impulse to the fall of Louis Philippe, while
                    the subsequent birth of children to Isabella deprived the Montpensier marriage
                    of all importance.</p>
                <p>Spanish history during the reign of Isabella II. presents a dismal picture of
                    faction and intrigue. The queen herself sought compensation for her unhappy
                    marriage in sensual indulgence, and tried to cover the dissoluteness of her
                    private life by a superstitious devotion to religion and by throwing her
                    influence on to the side of the clerical and reactionary party. Every now and
                    then the <hi rend="italic">progre-sistas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >moderados</hi> forced themselves into office, but their mutual jealousy
                    prevented them from acquiring any permanent hold upon the government. In 1866
                    Isabella was induced to take vigorous measures against the liberal opposition.
                    Narvaez was appointed chief minister; and the most prominent liberals, Serrano,
                    Prim, and O’Donnell, had to seek safety in exile. The cortes were dissolved, and
                    many of the deputies were transported to the Canary Islands. The ascendency of
                    the court party was maintained by a rigorous persecution, which was continued
                    after Narvaez’s death (April 1868) by Gonzales Bravo. Common dangers succeeded
                    at last in combining the various sections of the liberals for mutual defence,
                    and the people, disgusted by the scandals of the court and the contemptible <hi
                    rend="italic">camardla</hi> which surrounded the queen, rallied to their side.
                    In September 1868 Serrano and Prim returned to Spain, where they raised the
                    standard of revolt and offered the people the bribe of universal suffrage. The
                    revolution was speedily accomplished, and Isabella fled to France, but the
                    successful rebels were at once confronted with the difficulty of finding a
                    successor for her. During the interregnum Serrano undertook the regency, and the
                    cortes drew up a new constitution, by which an hereditary king was to rule in
                    conjunction with a senate and a popular chamber. As no one of the Bourbon
                    candidates for the throne was acceptable, it became necessary to look round for
                    some foreign prince. The offer of the crown to Leopold of
                    Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen excited the jealousy of France, and gave Napoleon III.
                    the opportunity of picking a quarrel, which proved fatal to himself, with the
                    rising state of Prussia. At last a king was found (1870) in Amadeus of Aosta,
                    the second son of Victor Emmanuel, who made an honest effort to discharge the
                    difficult office of a constitutional king in a country which was hardly fitted
                    for constitutional government. But he found the task too hard and too
                    distasteful, and resigned in 1873. A provisional republic was now formed, of
                    which Castelar was the guiding spirit. But the Spaniards, trained to regard
                    monarchy with superstitious reverence, had no sympathy with republican
                    institutions. Don Carlos seized the opportunity to revive the claim of
                    inalienable male succession, and raised the standard of revolt in the Basque
                    Provinces, where his name was still a power. The disorders of the democrats and
                    the approach of civil war threw the responsibility of government upon the army.
                    The cortes were dissolved by a military <hi rend="italic">coup d'etat;</hi>
                    Castelar threw up his office in disgust; and the administration was undertaken
                    by a committee of officers. Anarchy was suppressed with a strong hand, but it
                    was obvious that order could only be restored by reviving the monarchy. Foreign
                    princes were no longer thought of, and the crown was offered to and accepted by
                    Alfonso XII., the young son of the exiled Isabella (1874). His first task was to
                    terminate the Carlist War, which still continued in the north, and this was
                    successfully accomplished in 1876. Time was required to restore the prosperity
                    of Spain under a peaceful and orderly government and to consolidate by
                    prescription the authority of the restored dynasty. Unfortunately a premature
                    death carried off Alfonso XII. in 1885, before he could complete the work which
                    circumstances laid upon him. The regency was entrusted to his widow, Christina
                    of Austria, and the birth of a posthumous son (May 17, 1886), who is now the
                    titular king of Spain, has excited a feeling of pitying loyalty which may help
                    to secure the Bourbon dynasty in the last kingdom which is left to it.</p>

                <p>PART III.—LANGUAGE.</p>
                <p>The Iberian Peninsula is not a linguistic unity. Not to speak of the Basque,
                    which still forms an island of some importance in the north-west, three Romance
                    languages share this extensive territory :—(1) Portuguese-Galician, spoken in
                    Portugal, Galicia, and a small portion of the province of Leon; (2) Castilian,
                    covering about two-thirds of the Peninsula in the north, centre, and south; (3)
                    Catalan, occupying a long strip of territory to the east and south-east.</p>
                <p>These three varieties of the <hi rend="italic">Romana. Rustica</hi> are marked
                    off from one another much more distinctly than is the case with, say, the
                    Romance dialects of Italy; they do not interpenetrate one another, but where the
                    one ends the other begins. It has only been possible to establish at the points
                    of junction of two linguistic regions the existence of certain mixed jargons in
                    which certain forms of each language are intermingled; but these jargons, called
                    into existence for the necessities of social relations by bilinguists, have an
                    essentially individualistic and artificial character. The special development of
                    the vulgar<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n370/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0370-0347"/> Latin tongue in Spain, and the formation of the
                    three linguistic types just enumerated, were promoted by the peculiar political
                    circumstances. From the 9th century onwards Spain was slowly recaptured from the
                    Mohammedans, and the Latin spoken by the Christians who had taken refuge on the
                    slopes of the Pyrenees was slowly carried back to the centre and ultimately to
                    the south of the Peninsula, whence it had been driven by the Arab invasion.
                    Mediaeval Spain divides itself into three <hi rend="italic">conquistas—</hi>
                    that of Castile (much the most considerable), that of Portugal, and that of
                    Aragon; and to these three political conquests correspond an equal number of
                    linguistic varieties. If a given province now speaks Catalan rather than
                    Castilian, the explanation is to be sought simply and solely in the fact that it
                    was conquered by a king of Aragon and peopled by his Catalan subjects.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Catalan.</hi> —This domain now embraces, on the mainland,
                    the Spanish provinces of Gerona, Barcelona, Tarragona, and Lerida (the old
                    principality of Catalonia), and of Castellon de la Plana, Valencia, and Alicante
                    (the old kingdom of Valencia), and, in the Mediterranean, that of the Balearic
                    Islands (the old kingdom of Majorca). Catalan, by its most characteristic
                    features, belongs to the Romance of southern France and not to that of Spain; it
                    is legitimate, therefore, to regard it as imported into Spain by those <hi
                    rend="italic">Hispani</hi> whom the Arab conquest had driven back beyond the
                    mountains into Languedoc, and who in the 9th century regained the country of
                    their origin; this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the dialect is also
                    that of two French provinces on the north of the Pyrenees—Roussillon and
                    Cerdagne. From the 9th to the 12th century Catalan spread further and further
                    within the limits of Catalonia, properly so called; in 1229 it was brought to
                    Majorca by Jaime el Conquistador, and in 1238 the same sovereign carried it to
                    Valencia also. Even Murcia was peopled by Catalans in 1266, but this province
                    really is part of the Castilian conquest, and accordingly the Castilian element
                    took the upper hand and absorbed the dialect of the earlier colonists. The river
                    Segura, which falls into the Mediterranean in the neighbourhood of Orihuela, a
                    little to the north of Murcia, is as nearly as possible the southern boundary
                    off the Catalan domain; westward the boundary coincides pretty exactly with the
                    political frontier, the provinces of New Castile and Aragon not being at all
                    encroached on. Catalan, which by the reunion of Aragon and the countship of
                    Barcelona in 1137 became the official language of the Aragonese
                    monarchy,—although the kingdom of Aragon, consisting of the present provinces of
                    Saragossa, Huesca, and Teruel, has always been Castilian in speech,—established
                    a footing in Italy also, in all parts where the domination of the kings of
                    Aragon extended, viz., in Sicily, Naples, Corsica, and Sardinia, but it has not
                    maintained itself there in modern times except in a single district of the
                    last-named island (Alghero); everywhere else in Italy, where it was not spoken
                    except by the conquerors, nor written except in the royal chancery, it has
                    disappeared without leaving a trace.</p>

                    was understood, essentially, the spoken language and the language of prose,
                    while that of poetry, with a large admixture of Provencal forms, was early
                    called <hi rend="italic">Lemosi, Limosi,</hi> or language of Limousin,—Catalan
                    grammarians, and particularly the most celebrated of them, Ramon Vidal de
                    Besalú, having adopted <hi rend="italic">Lemosi</hi> as the generic name of the
                    language of the troubadours. These grammarians carefully distinguish the vulgar
                    speech, or <hi rend="italic">pla Catalá,</hi> from the refined <hi rend="italic"
                    >trobar</hi> idiom, which originally is simply a more or less modified form of
                    Provençal. Afterwards, and especially in these parts of the Catalan domain
                    outside of Catalonia which did not care to acknowledge that they derived their
                    language from that province, <hi rend="italic">Lemosi</hi> received a more
                    extensive signification, so as to mean the literary language in general, whether
                    of verse or of prose. To this hour, particularly in Valencia and the Balearics,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lemosi</hi> is employed to designate on the one hand the old
                    Catalan and on the other the very artificial and somewhat archaizing idiom which
                    is current in the “jochs florals”; while the spoken dialect is called, according
                    to the localities, <hi rend="italic">Valencia</hi> (in Valencia), <hi
                    rend="italic">Majorquí</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Menorquí</hi> (in Majorca and
                    Minorca), or <hi rend="italic">Catalá</hi> (in Catalonia); the form <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalanesch</hi> is obsolete.</p>
                <p>The principal features which connect Catalan with the Romance of France and
                    separate it from that of Spain are the following. (1) To take first its
                    treatment of the final vowels,—Catalan, like French and Provençal, having only
                    oxytones and paroxytones, does not tolerate more than one syllable after the
                    tonic accent: thus <hi rend="italic">anima</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">arma,
                    camera</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">cambra.</hi> All the proparoxytones of
                    modern Catalan are of recent introduction and due to Castilian influence.
                    Further, the only post-tonic Latin vowel preserved by the Catalan is, as in
                    Gallo-Roman, <hi rend="italic">a: mare</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">mar,
                    gratu(s)</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">grat,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >anima</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">arma</hi>; and, when the word terminates in
                    a group of consonants requiring a supporting vowel, that vowel is represented by
                    an <hi rend="italic">e: arb(o)rem,</hi> Cat. <hi rend="italic">abre</hi> (Prov.
                    and Fr. <hi rend="italic">arbre,</hi> but Cast. á <hi rend="italic">rbol);
                    pop(u)l(us),</hi> Cat. <hi rend="italic">poble</hi> (Prov. <hi rend="italic"
                    >poble,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">peuple,</hi> but Cast. <hi rend="italic"
                    >pueblo);</hi> sometimes, when it is inserted between the two consonants instead
                    of being made to follow them, the supporting vowel is represented by an <hi
                    rend="italic">o: escándol</hi> (scándalum), <hi rend="italic">frévol</hi>
                    (frivolus), <hi rend="italic">círcol</hi> (circulus). In some cases a post-tonic
                    vowel other than <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is preserved in Catalan, as, for
                    example, when that vowel forms a diphthong with the tonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Deu,</hi> Deus; <hi rend="italic">Ebriu,</hi> Hebreus); or, again, it
                    sometimes happens, when the tonic is followed by an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in
                    hiatus, that the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> persists (<hi rend="italic"
                    >dilúvi,</hi> dilúvium; <hi rend="italic">servici,</hi> servicium; <hi
                    rend="italic">lábi,</hi> lábium; <hi rend="italic">ciri,</hi> cereus); but in
                    many cases these ought to be regarded as learned forms, as is shown by the
                    existence of parallel ones, such as <hi rend="italic">servey,</hi> where the
                    atonic <hi rend="italic">i</hi> has been attracted by the tonic and forms a
                    diphthong with it <hi rend="italic">(servíci, servii, servey).</hi> What has
                    just been said as to the treatment of the final vowels in Catalan must be
                    understood as applying only to pure Catalan, unaltered by the predominance of
                    the Castilian, for the actual language is no longer faithful to the principle we
                    have laid down; it allows the final <hi rend="italic">o</hi> atonic in a number
                    of substantives and adjectives, and in the verb it now conjugates <hi
                    rend="italic">canto, temo, sento,—</hi> a thing unknown in the ancient language.
                    (2) As regards conjugation, only two points need be taken up here :—(<hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>) it employs the form known as the inchoative, that is to
                    say, the lengthening of the radical of the present in verbs of the third
                    conjugation by means of the syllable <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ix,</hi> a proceeding common to Italian, Walachian, Provençal, and
                    French, but altogether unknown in Hispanic Romance; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                    the formation of a great number of past participles in which the termination is
                    added, as in Provençal, not to the radical of the verb, but to that of the
                    perfect: <hi rend="italic">tingut</hi> formed from <hi rend="italic">tinch,
                    pogut</hi> from <hi rend="italic">poch, conegut</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >conech,</hi> while Castilian says <hi rend="italic">tenido</hi> (formerly also
                    <hi rend="italic">tenudo), podido, conocido,</hi> that is to say, it forms those
                    participles from the infinitive.</p>
                <p>As for features common alike to Catalan and Hispanic (Castilian and Portuguese)
                    Romance, on the other hand, and which are unknown to French Romance, there is
                    only one which possesses any importance, the conservation, namely, of the Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> with its original sound, while the same vowel has
                    assumed in French and Provençal, from a<pb break="no"

                    oldest existing monuments of those languages,—a labio-palatal pronunciation (<hi
                    rend="italic">ü</hi>). It is not to be supposed that the separation of Catalan
                    from the Gallo-Roman family should have occurred before the transformation had
                    taken place; there is good reason to believe that Catalan possessed the <hi
                    rend="italic">ü</hi> at one time, but afterwards lost it in its contact with the
                    Spanish dialects. The question, however, is one for further examination.</p>
                <p>Catalan being a variety of the <hi rend="italic">langue Toc,</hi> it will be
                    convenient to note the peculiarities of its phonetic and inflexion as compared
                    with ordinary Provençal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tonic Vowels.—</hi> With regard to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    which is pronounced alike in open and close syllables <hi rend="italic"
                    >(amar,</hi> amare; <hi rend="italic">abre,</hi> arbor), there is nothing to
                    remark. The Latin <hi rend="italic">ē,</hi> which is treated like <hi
                    rend="italic">ĭ,</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> sometimes close, sometimes
                    open. On this point Catalan is more hesitating than Provençal; it does not
                    distinguish so clearly the pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> according
                    to its origin; while ē (<hi rend="italic">ĭ</hi>) is capable of yielding an open
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the ĕ is often pronounced close, and the poets have no
                    difficulty in making words in <hi rend="italic">e</hi> close and in <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> open rhyme together, which is not the case in Provençal.
                    The Latin ĕ never yields <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> in Catalan as it does in
                    French and occasionally in Provençal; sedet becomes <hi rend="italic">seu</hi>
                    (where <hi rend="italic">u</hi> represents the final <hi rend="italic">d),</hi>
                    pedem makes <hi rend="italic">peu,</hi> and ego <hi rend="italic">eu∙,</hi> in
                    some words where the tonic ĕ is followed by a syllable in which an <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> occurs, it may become <hi rend="italic">i (ir,</hi> hĕri;
                    <hi rend="italic">mig,</hi> mĕdius; <hi rend="italic">mils,</hi> melius); and
                    the same holds good for ē in a similar situation <hi rend="italic">(ciri,</hi>
                    cērius, cēreus; <hi rend="italic">fira,</hi> fēria), and for <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> in a close syllable before a nasal <hi rend="italic">(eximpli,</hi>
                    exemplum; <hi rend="italic">mintré</hi> for <hi rend="italic">menitiré</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">gint</hi> for <hi rend="italic">gent). I</hi> tonic long and <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> short, when in hiatus with another vowel, produce <hi
                    rend="italic">i (amich,</hi> amicus; <hi rend="italic">via,</hi> via). <hi
                    rend="italic">O</hi> tonic long and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> short are
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">o</hi> close and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> open
                    <hi rend="italic">(amor,</hi> amorem; <hi rend="italic">poble,</hi> populus).
                    <hi rend="italic">O</hi> short is never diphthongized into <hi rend="italic"
                    >uo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ue</hi>; such a treatment is as foreign to Catalan
                    as the diphthongization of ĕ into <hi rend="italic">ie.</hi> Just as <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> before a syllable in which an <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    occurs is changed into <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> so in the same circumstances
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">ze (full,</hi> folium; <hi
                    rend="italic">vull,</hi> volio for voleo) and also when the accented vowel
                    precedes a group of consonants like <hi rend="italic">cl, pl,</hi> and the like
                    <hi rend="italic">(ull,</hi> oc’lus; <hi rend="italic">escull,</hi> scop’lus).
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">u</hi> persists with the Latin pronunciation, and, as
                    already said, does not take the Franco-Provençal pronunciation <hi rend="italic"
                    >u.</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">au</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">o (cosa,</hi>
                    causa; <hi rend="italic">or,</hi> aurum); Old-Catalan has kept the diphthong
                    better, but possibly we should attribute the examples of <hi rend="italic"
                    >au</hi> which are met with in texts of the 13th and 14th centuries to the
                    literary influence of Provence. Latin <hi rend="italic">ua</hi> tends to become
                    <hi rend="italic">o (cor,</hi> quare).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Atonie Vowels.—</hi> As for the Latin post-tonic vowels already
                    spoken of, it remains to be noted that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is often
                    represented in writing by <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> especially before <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi>; in old Catalan, the substantives, adjectives, and
                    participles readily form their singular in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and their
                    plural in <hi rend="italic">es: arma, armes</hi> (anima, animas); <hi
                    rend="italic">bona, bones</hi> (bona, bonas); <hi rend="italic">amada,
                    amades</hi> (amata, amatas). This <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is neither open nor
                    close, but a surd <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the pronunciation of which comes very
                    near <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In the same way the supporting vowel, which is
                    regularly an <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in Catalan, is often written <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> especially after <hi rend="italic">r (abra,</hi> arborem;
                    <hi rend="italic">astra,</hi> astrum; <hi rend="italic">para,</hi> patrem); one
                    may say that in the actual state of the language post-tonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> become indistinguishable in a surd sound
                    intermediate between the French <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and mute <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi> Before the tonic the same change between <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> constantly takes place; one finds in
                    manuscripts <hi rend="italic">enar, emor</hi> for <hi rend="italic">anar,
                    amor</hi> (the same manner of writing extends even to the case of the tonic
                    syllable, <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> from tantum
                    and sanctum being far from rare), and, on the other hand, <hi rend="italic"
                    >antre, arrar,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">entre, errar. I</hi> atonic is often
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">e</hi> even when it is long <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vehi,</hi> vicinus). <hi rend="italic">O</hi> atonic close, which in genuine
                    Catalan exists only before the tonic, has become <hi rend="italic">u</hi>; at
                    the present day <hi rend="italic">truvar, cuntradir</hi> is the real
                    pronunciation of the words spelt <hi rend="italic">troνar, contradir,</hi> and
                    in the final syllables, verbal or other, where under Castilian influence an <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> has come to be added to the normal Catalan form, this <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> has the value of a <hi rend="italic">u: trovo</hi> (genuine
                    Catalan, <hi rend="italic">trop)</hi> is pronounced <hi rend="italic">trovu;
                    bravo</hi> (genuine Catalan, <hi rend="italic">brau)</hi> is pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">bravu. U</hi> atonic keeps its ground.</p>
                <p>The only strong diphthongs of the spoken language are <hi rend="italic">ái,
                    du</hi> (rather rare), <hi rend="italic">ėi, éu, íu, ói, óu, úi, uu. Ai</hi>
                    produced by <hi rend="italic">a + i</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + a
                    palatal consonant has for the greater part of the time become an <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in the modem language; <hi rend="italic">factum</hi> has
                    yielded <hi rend="italic">fait, feit,</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">fet,</hi>
                    the last being the actual form; <hi rend="italic">arius</hi> has given <hi
                    rend="italic">er</hi> alongside of <hi rend="italic">aire, ari,</hi> which are
                    learned or semi-learned forms. Of the two weak diphthongs <hi rend="italic"
                    >ió</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uá,</hi> the latter, as has been seen, tends to
                    become <hi rend="italic">o</hi> close in the atonic syllable, and is pronounced
                    <hi rend="italic">ze: quaranta</hi> has become c <hi rend="italic">oranta,</hi>
                    then <hi rend="italic">curanta.</hi> After the tonic <hi rend="italic">ua</hi>
                    often becomes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in the Catalan of the mainland <hi
                    rend="italic">(ayga,</hi> aqua, <hi rend="italic">llenga,</hi> lingua), while in
                    Majorca it becomes <hi rend="italic">o (aygo, llengo).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Consonants.—</hi> Final <hi rend="italic">t</hi> readily disappears after <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> or <hi rend="italic">l (tan,</hi> tantum; <hi rend="italic"
                    >aman, venin, partin,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">amant, venint,</hi> &amp;c.;
                    <hi rend="italic">mol,</hi> multum; <hi rend="italic">ocul,</hi> ocultum); the
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> reappears in composition before a vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">(fon,</hi> fontem, but <hi rend="italic">Font-alba).</hi> On the
                    other hand, a <hi rend="italic">t</hi> without etymo logical origin is
                    frequently added to words ending in <hi rend="italic">r (cart</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">car, quare; mart</hi> for <hi rend="italic">mar, mare; amart,
                    ohirt,</hi> infinitive for <hi rend="italic">amar, ohir),</hi> and even to some
                    words terminating in a vowel <hi rend="italic">(genit,</hi> ingenium; <hi
                    rend="italic">premit,</hi> premium), or the addition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> has taken place by assimilation to past participles in <hi rend="italic"
                    >it.</hi> The phenomenon occurs also in Provençal (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Romania,</hi> vii. 107, viii. 110). Median intervocal <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">s (z)</hi> in the first stage of the language,
                    has disappeared: fidelis gave <hi rend="italic">fesel,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">feel,</hi> and finally <hi rend="italic">fel</hi>; videtis became
                    <hi rend="italic">vezets,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">veels, vets,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">veu.</hi> Final <hi rend="italic">d</hi> after· a vowel has
                    produced <hi rend="italic">u (peu,</hi> pedem; <hi rend="italic">niu,</hi>
                    nidum; <hi rend="italic">mou,</hi> modum); but, when th <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> in consequence of the disappearance of the preceding vowel, rests upon
                    a consonant, it remains and passes into the corresponding surd: frigidus gives
                    <hi rend="italic">fred</hi> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">fret).</hi> The group
                    <hi rend="italic">dr,</hi> when produced by the disappearance of the
                    intermediate vowel, becomes <hi rend="italic">ur (creure,</hi> credere; <hi
                    rend="italic">ociure,</hi> occidere; <hi rend="italic">veure,</hi> vidĕre; <hi
                    rend="italic">seure,</hi> sedĕre). Final <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> if originally
                    it stood between two vowels, falls away <hi rend="italic">(bo,</hi> bonum; <hi
                    rend="italic">vi,</hi> vinum), but not when it answers to <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> (thus donum makes <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> but domnum <hi

                    before <hi rend="italic">e, i</hi> is treated like <hi rend="italic">d;</hi>
                    within a word it disappears after having been represented for a while by <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> (lucere gives <hi rend="italic">llusir, lluhir</hi>;
                    recipere gives <hi rend="italic">rezebre, reebre, rebre)</hi>; at the end of a
                    word it is replaced by <hi rend="italic">u (veu,</hi> vicem; <hi rend="italic"
                    >feu,</hi> fecit). The group <hi rend="italic">c’r</hi> gives <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi> mouillée (Prov. <hi rend="italic">lh),</hi> which in
                    the present orthography is written <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> as in Castilian,
                    but formerly used to be represented by <hi rend="italic">ly</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">yl (lletra,</hi> litera; <hi rend="italic">llengua,</hi> lingua).
                    <hi rend="italic">P</hi> readily disappears after <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> like
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> after <hi rend="italic">n (cam,</hi> campum; <hi
                    rend="italic">terns,</hi> tempus). <hi rend="italic">B</hi> is replaced by the
                    surd <hi rend="italic">p</hi> at the end of a word <hi rend="italic"
                    >(trobar</hi> in the infinitive, but <hi rend="italic">trop</hi> in the present
                    tense); so also in the interior of a word when it precedes a consonant <hi
                    rend="italic">(supvenir,</hi> subvenire, <hi rend="italic">sopte,</hi> sub’to).
                    Median intervocalic <hi rend="italic">f</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">v
                    (Esetve,</hi> Stephanus); it has disappeared from profundus, which yielded the
                    form <hi rend="italic">preon,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">pregon (g</hi> being
                    introduced to obviate the hiatus). <hi rend="italic">V,</hi> wherever it has
                    been preserved, has the same pronunciation as <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; at the
                    end of a word and between vowels it becomes vocalized into <hi rend="italic">u
                    (suau,</hi> suavis; <hi rend="italic">viure,</hi> vivere). <hi rend="italic"
                    >G</hi> guttural, written <hi rend="italic">qu</hi> before <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> keeps its ground as a central and as a
                    final letter; in the latter position it is generally written <hi rend="italic"
                    >ch (aznich,</hi> amicum; <hi rend="italic">joch,</hi> jocum). <hi rend="italic"
                    >G</hi> guttural is replaced as a final letter by surd <hi rend="italic">c
                    (longa,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">lonc; trigar,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >trich). Tj</hi> after a consonant gives <hi rend="italic">ss (cassar,</hi>
                    captiare); between vowels, after having been represented by soft <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi>, it has disappeared (rationem gave <hi rend="italic">razó,
                    raysó,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">rahó)</hi>; at the end of every word it
                    behaves like <hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> that is to say, changes into <hi
                    rend="italic">u (preu,</hi> pretium); instead of <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> the
                    second person plural of the verb —at(i)s, et(i)s, it(i)s—now has <hi
                    rend="italic">au, eu, iu</hi> after having had <hi rend="italic">ats, ets, its.
                    Dj</hi> gives ǵ between vowels <hi rend="italic">(verger,</hi> viridiarum), and
                    ć as a terminal (written either <hi rend="italic">ig</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tx: goig,</hi> gaudium, <hi rend="italic">mig, mitx,</hi> medium). <hi
                    rend="italic">Stj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sc</hi> before <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">x</hi> anti
                    <hi rend="italic">ps,</hi> yield the sound <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi>
                    represented in Catalan by <hi rend="italic">x (angoxa,</hi> angustia; <hi
                    rend="italic">coneixer,</hi> cognoscere; <hi rend="italic">dix,</hi> dixit; <hi
                    rend="italic">mateix,</hi> metipse). <hi rend="italic">J</hi> almost everywhere
                    has taken the sound of the French <hi rend="italic">j (jutge,</hi> &amp;c. ).
                    <hi rend="italic">Lj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll</hi> give <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> mouillée <hi rend="italic">(ll</hi> in the present orthography: <hi
                    rend="italic">fill,</hi> filium; <hi rend="italic">consell,</hi> consilium; <hi
                    rend="italic">nzell,</hi> nullum). In the larger portion of the Catalan domain
                    this <hi rend="italic">l</hi> mouillée has become <hi rend="italic">y</hi>;
                    almost everywhere <hi rend="italic">fiy</hi> is pronounced for <hi rend="italic"
                    >fill</hi>, <hi rend="italic">consey</hi> for <hi rend="italic">consell. Nj</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> give <hi rend="italic">n</hi> mouillée <hi
                    rend="italic">(ny</hi> in both old and modern spelling: <hi rend="italic"
                    >senyor,</hi> seniorem; <hi rend="italic">any,</hi> annum). Sometimes the <hi
                    rend="italic">ny</hi> becomes reduced to <hi rend="italic">y</hi>; one
                    occasionally meets in manuscripts with <hi rend="italic">seyor, ay,</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">senyor, any,</hi> but this pronunciation has not become general,
                    as has been the case with the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> having its origin in <hi
                    rend="italic">ll.</hi> Lingual <hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the end of a word has
                    a tendency to disappear when preceded by a vowel: thus the infinitives amare,
                    temere, *legire are pronounced <hi rend="italic">amá, temé, llegi.</hi> It is
                    never preserved except when protected by the non-etymological <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> already spoken of <hi rend="italic">(llegirt</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >llegí,</hi> but never <hi rend="italic">llegir)</hi>; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> reappears, nevertheless, whenever the infinitive is followed by a
                    pronoun <hi rend="italic">(donarme, dirho). Rs</hi> is reduced to <hi
                    rend="italic">s (cos</hi> for <hi rend="italic">cors,</hi> corpus). <hi
                    rend="italic">H</hi> is merely an orthographic sign; it is used to indicate that
                    two consecutive vowels do not form a diphthong <hi rend="italic">(vehi,
                    raho),</hi> and, added to <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> it denotes the pronunciation
                    of the guttural <hi rend="italic">c</hi> at the end of a word <hi rend="italic"
                    >(amich).</hi><hi rend="italic">Inflexion.—</hi> Catalan, unlike Old Provençal
                    and Old French, has never had declensions. It is true that in certain texts
                    (especially metrical texts) certain traces of case-endings are to be met with,
                    as for example <hi rend="italic">Dezes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Deze,
                    amors</hi> and <hi rend="italic">amor, clars</hi> and <hi rend="italic">clar,
                    forts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fort</hi>, <hi rend="italic">tuyt</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tots, abduy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abdos, senyer</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">senyor, emperaire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">emperador</hi>; but,
                    since these forms are used convertibly, the nominative form when the word is in
                    the objective, and the accusative form when the word is the subject, we can only
                    recognize in these cases a confused recollection of the Provençal rules known
                    only to the literate but of which the transcribers of manuscripts took no
                    account. Catalan, then, makes no distinctions save in the gender and the number
                    of its nouns. As regards the formation of the plural only two observations are
                    necessary. (1) Words which have their radical termination in <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> but which in the singular<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0372-0349"/> drop that <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> resume it in
                    the plural before <hi rend="italic">s: homin-em</hi> makes <hi rend="italic"
                    >ome</hi> in the singular and <hi rend="italic">omens</hi> in the plural; <hi
                    rend="italic">asin-um</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">ase</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">asens.</hi> (2) Words terminating in <hi rend="italic">s</hi> surd
                    or sonant and in <hi rend="italic">x</hi> anciently formed their plural by
                    adding to the singular the syllable <hi rend="italic">es (bras, brasses; pres,
                    preses; matrix, matrixes),</hi> but subsequently, from about the 15th century,
                    the Castilian influence substituted <hi rend="italic">os,</hi> so that one now
                    hears <hi rend="italic">brasses, presos, mateixos.</hi> The words in <hi
                    rend="italic">tx, sc, st</hi> have been assimilated to words in <hi
                    rend="italic">s (x);</hi> from <hi rend="italic">bosch</hi> we originally had
                    the plural <hi rend="italic">bosches,</hi> but now <hi rend="italic"
                    >boscos</hi>; from <hi rend="italic">trist, tristes,</hi> but now <hi
                    rend="italic">tristos.</hi> For these last in <hi rend="italic">st</hi> there
                    exists a plural formation which is more in accordance with the genius of the
                    language, and consists in the suppression of the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> before
                    the <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> from <hi rend="italic">aquest,</hi> for example,
                    we have now side by side the two plurals <hi rend="italic">aguestos,</hi> in the
                    Castilian manner, and <hi rend="italic">aquets.</hi> The article is <hi
                    rend="italic">lo, los</hi> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">lu, lus</hi> in a
                    portion of the domain), fem. <hi rend="italic">la, les (las').</hi> Some
                    instances of <hi rend="italic">li</hi> occur in the ancient tongue, applying
                    indifferently to the nominative and the objective case; <hi rend="italic"
                    >el</hi> applying to the singular is also not wholly unknown. On the
                    north-western border of Catalonia, and in the island of Majorca, the article is
                    not a derivative from <hi rend="italic">ille</hi> but from <hi rend="italic"
                    >ipse</hi> (sing, masc. <hi rend="italic">es</hi> or <hi rend="italic">so,</hi>
                    fem. <hi rend="italic">sa;</hi> pl. masc. <hi rend="italic">es,</hi> and also
                    <hi rend="italic">ets,</hi> which appears to come from <hi rend="italic"
                    >istos,—ets</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ests,</hi> like <hi rend="italic"
                    >aguets</hi> for <hi rend="italic">aquests,—</hi> fern. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sas).</hi> Compare the corresponding Sardinian forms <hi rend="italic">su,
                    sa,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic">sos, sas.</hi> On the pronouns it has only to be
                    remarked that the modern language has borrowed from Castilian the composite
                    forms <hi rend="italic">nosaltres</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vosaltres</hi>
                    (pronounced also <hi rend="italic">nosaltros</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >nosatrus),</hi> as also the form <hi rend="italic">vosté</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">vusté</hi> (Castilian <hi rend="italic">usted</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">vuestra mereed).</hi><hi rend="italic">Conjugation.—</hi> Catalan,
                    and especially modern Catalan, has greatly narrowed the domain of the 2d
                    conjugation in ēre; a large number of verbs of this conjugation have been
                    treated as if they belonged to the 3d in ere; debere makes <hi rend="italic"
                    >deure,</hi> videre, <hi rend="italic">veure,</hi> and alongside of <hi
                    rend="italic">haber,</hi> which answers to habere, there is a form <hi
                    rend="italic">heure</hi> which points to habere. A curious fact, aud one which
                    has arisen since the 15th century, is the addition of a paragogic <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> to those infinitives which are accented on the radical; in
                    a portion of the Catalan domain one hears <hi rend="italic">creurer,
                    νeurer.</hi> Some verbs originally belonging to the conjugation in ēre have
                    passed over into that in <hi rend="italic">ir</hi>; for example tenēre gives <hi
                    rend="italic">tenir</hi> alongside of <hi rend="italic">tindre,</hi> remanēre
                    <hi rend="italic">romanir</hi> and <hi rend="italic">romandre.</hi> In the
                    gerundive and in the present participle Catalan differs from Provençal in still
                    distinguishing the conjugation in <hi rend="italic">ir</hi> from that in <hi
                    rend="italic">er, re,—</hi> saying, for example, <hi rend="italic">sentint.</hi>
                    As in Provençal, the past participle of a large number of verbs of the 2d and 3d
                    conjugations is formed, not from the infinitive, but from the perfect <hi
                    rend="italic">(pogut, volgut, tingut</hi> suggest the perfects <hi rend="italic"
                    >poeh, volch, tinch,</hi> and not the infinitives <hi rend="italic">poder,
                    voler, tenir).</hi> In the present indicative and subjunctive many verbs in <hi
                    rend="italic">ir</hi> take the inchoative form already described, by lengthening
                    the radical in the three persons of the singular and in the third person of the
                    plural by means of the syllable <hi rend="italic">esc (ise). agrahir</hi> has
                    the present indicative <hi rend="italic">agraesch, agraheixes, agraheix,
                    agraheixen,</hi> the present subjunctive <hi rend="italic">agraesea, -as, -a,
                    -an</hi> (or more usually now <hi rend="italic">agraesgui, -is, -i, -in).</hi>
                    The old perfect of the conjugation in <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> had <hi
                    rend="italic">é</hi> (also <hi rend="italic">i)</hi> in the 1st pers. sing, and
                    <hi rend="italic">-á</hi> in the 3d; alongside of the <hi rend="italic">-ά,</hi>
                    which is proper to Catalan exclusively, we also find, in the first period of the
                    language, <hi rend="italic">-et</hi> as in Provençal. Subsequently the perfect
                    of the three conjugations has admitted forms in <hi rend="italic">-r (amáres,
                    amárem, amáreu, amaren),</hi> derived from the ancient pluperfect <hi
                    rend="italic">amara,</hi> &amp;c., which has held its ground down to the present
                    day, with the meaning of a conditional in some verbs (one still hears <hi
                    rend="italic">fora, haguera).</hi> But the simple perfect is no longer employed
                    in the spoken language, which has substituted for it a periphrastic perfect,
                    composed of the infinitive of the verb and the present of the auxiliary <hi
                    rend="italic">anar: vaig pendre,</hi> for example, does not mean “I am going to
                    take,” but “I have taken.” The earliest example of this periphrastic perfect
                    carries us back to the 15th century. The most usual form of the subj. pres. in
                    spoken Catalan is that in <hi rend="italic">-i</hi> for all the three
                    conjugations <hi rend="italic">(ami, -is, -i, -em, -eu, -in; temi, -is,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; <hi rend="italic">senti, -is,</hi> &amp;c. ); it appears to be an
                    abbreviation from <hi rend="italic">-ia,</hi> and in effect certain
                    subjunctives, such as <hi rend="italic">cántia, témia, tinguia, vinguia</hi>
                    (for <hi rend="italic">cante, tema, tinga, vingia),</hi> evidently formed upon
                    <hi rend="italic">sia</hi> (subj. of <hi rend="italic">esser),</hi> have been
                    and still are used. The same <hi rend="italic">i</hi> of the present
                    subjunctive, whatever may be its origin, is still found in the imperfect: <hi
                    rend="italic">amés, -essis, -es, -essim,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Catalan Dialect of Alghero (Sardinia).—</hi> As compared with
                    that of the mainland, the Catalan of Alghero, introduced into this portion of
                    Sardinia by the Aragonese conquerors and colonists, does not present any very
                    important differences; some of them, such as they are, are explicable by the
                    influence of the indigenous dialects of Sassari and Logudoro. In phonetics one
                    observes—(1) the change of <hi rend="italic">lj</hi> into <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> as an initial before <hi rend="italic">i (yitx, yigis; lego,
                    legis),</hi> a change which does not take place in the Catalan of the mainland
                    except in the interior, or at the end of the word; (2) the frequent change of
                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi> between vowels and of <hi rend="italic">l</hi> after
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi>, <hi rend="italic">g, f, p</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> into <hi rend="italic">r (taura, tabula; candera, candela·, sangrot,
                    singultum·, frama, flama).</hi> In conjugation there are some notable
                    peculiarities. The 1st pers. sing, does not take the o which continental Catalan
                    has borrowed from Castilian <hi rend="italic">(cant,</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                    >canto,</hi> &amp;c.); the imp. ind. of verbs of the 2d and 3d conjugations has
                    <hi rend="italic">eva, iva</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">ia,</hi> a form
                    which also occurs in the conditional <hi rend="italic">(cantariνa,
                    drumiriva);</hi> the simple perfect, of which some types are still preserved in
                    the actual language <hi rend="italic">(e.g., anighé, aghé),</hi> has likewise
                    served for the formation not only of the past participle but also of the
                    infinitive <hi rend="italic">(agher, habere,</hi> can only be explained by <hi
                    rend="italic">ach,</hi> 3d person of the perfect); the infinitives with <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> paragogic <hi rend="italic">(viurer, seurer, plourer)</hi>
                    are not used <hi rend="italic">(viure, seure, ploure</hi> instead); in the
                    conjugation of the present of the verb <hi rend="italic">essar</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">esser,</hi> the 2d pers. sing, <hi rend="italic">ses</hi> formed
                    upon the persons of the plural, while continental Catalan says <hi rend="italic"
                    >ets</hi> (anciently <hi rend="italic">est),</hi> as also, in the plural, <hi
                    rend="italic">sem, seu,</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">som, sou,</hi> are to
                    be noted; <hi rend="italic">tenere</hi> has passed over to the conjugation in
                    <hi rend="italic">re (trenda=tendre),</hi> but it is at the same time true that
                    in ordinary Catalan also we have <hi rend="italic">tindrer</hi> alongside of <hi
                    rend="italic">tenir</hi> the habitual form; <hi rend="italic">dicere</hi> gives
                    not <hi rend="italic">dir</hi> but <hi rend="italic">diure,</hi> which is more
                    regular.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Castilian.</hi> —This name (derived from the kingdom of
                    Castile, the most powerful element in the Spanish monarchy) is the most
                    convenient designation to apply to the linguistic domain which comprises the
                    whole of central Spain and the vast regions of America and Asia colonized from
                    the 16th century onwards by the Spaniards. We might also indeed call it the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spanish</hi> domain, narrowing the essentially geographical
                    meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">Español</hi> (derived, like the other old
                    form <hi rend="italic">Españon,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Hispania),</hi> and
                    using it in a purely political sense. But the first expression is to be
                    preferred, all the more because it has been long in use, and even the
                    inhabitants of the domain outside the two Castiles fully accept it and are
                    indeed the first to call their idiom <hi rend="italic">Castellano.</hi> It is
                    agreed on all hands that Castilian is one of the two branches of the vulgar
                    Latin of Spain, Portuguese-Galician being the other; both idioms, now separated
                    by very marked differences, can be traced back directly to one common source
                    —the Hispanic Romance. One and the same vulgar tongue, diversely modified in the
                    lapse of time, has produced Castilian and Portuguese as two varieties, while
                    Catalan, the third language of the Peninsula, connects itself, as has already
                    been pointed out, with the Gallo-Roman.</p>
                <p>Within the Castilian domain, thus embracing all in Spain that is neither
                    Portuguese nor Catalan, there exist linguistic varieties which it would perhaps
                    be an exaggeration to call dialects, considering the meaning ordinarily attached
                    to that word, but which are none the less worthy of attention. Generally
                    speaking, from various circumstances, and especially that of the reconquest, by
                    which the already-formed idiom of the Christian conquerors and colonists was
                    gradually conveyed from north to south, Castilian has maintained a uniformity of
                    which the Romance languages afford no other example. We shall proceed in the
                    first instance to examine the most salient features of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >normal Castilian,</hi> spoken in the provinces more or less closely
                    corresponding to the old limits of Old and New Castile, so as to be able
                    afterwards to note the peculiarities of what, for want of a better expression,
                    we must call the Castilian dialects.</p>
                <p>In some respects Castilian is hardly further removed from classical Latin than is
                    Italian; in others it has approximately reached the same stage as Provençal. As
                    regards the tonic accent and the treatment of the vowels which come after it,
                    Castilian may be said to be essentially a paroxytonic language, though it does
                    not altogether refuse proparoxytonic accentuation and it would be a mistake to
                    regard vocables like <hi rend="italic">lámpara, lágrima, rápido,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    as learned words. In this feature, and in its almost universal conservation of
                    the final vowels <hi rend="italic">e, i, u</hi> (o), Castilian comes very near
                    Italian, while it separates from it and approaches the Gallo-Roman by its
                    modification of the consonants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vowels.—</hi> Normal Castilian faithfully preserves the vowels
                    <hi rend="italic">ē, ī, ō, ū</hi>; the comparatively infrequent instances in
                    which <hi rend="italic">ē</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ō</hi> are treated like ĕ
                    and ŏ must be attributed to the working of analogy. It diphthongizes ĕ in <hi
                    rend="italic">ie, ō</hi> in <hi rend="italic">ue,</hi> which may be regarded as
                    a<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n373/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0373-0350"/> weakening of <hi rend="italic">uo</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Romania,</hi> iv. SO). Sometimes <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ue</hi> in the modem language are changed into <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi>: <hi rend="italic">silla</hi> from sella
                    (Old Cast, <hi rend="italic">siella), víspera</hi> from vespera (Old Cast, <hi
                    rend="italic">viespera), castillo</hi> from castellum (Old Cast. <hi
                    rend="italic">castiello), freute</hi> from frontem(Old Cast. <hi rend="italic"
                    >fruente), fleco</hi> from floccus (Old Cast, <hi rend="italic">flueeo).</hi>
                    The words in which ĕ and ŏ have kept their ground are either learned words like
                    <hi rend="italic">medico, mérito,</hi> or have been borrowed from dialects which
                    do not suffer diphthongization. In many cases the old language is more rigorous;
                    thus, while modern Castilian has given the preference to <hi rend="italic"
                    >mente, como, modo,</hi> we find in old texts <hi rend="italic">miente, cuemo,
                    muedo.</hi> Lat. au makes <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in all words of popular
                    origin <hi rend="italic">(cosa, oro,</hi> &amp;c. ).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consonants. —</hi> On the liquids <hi rend="italic">l, m, n,
                    r</hi> there is little to be remarked, except that the last-named letter has two
                    pronunciations— one soft (voiced), as in <hi rend="italic">amor, bιιrla,</hi>
                    the other hard (voiceless), as in <hi rend="italic">rendir, tierra</hi> (Old
                    Cast. in this case goes so far as to double the initial consonant: <hi
                    rend="italic">rrendir)—</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is often inserted
                    before <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d: ensayo, mensage,
                    rendir</hi> (reddere). <hi rend="italic">L</hi> mouillée (written <hi
                    rend="italic">ll)</hi> represents not only the Latin <hi rend="italic">l, ll,
                    lj,</hi> but also, at the beginning of words, the combinations <hi rend="italic"
                    >cl, gl, pl, bl,fl</hi>: <hi rend="italic">llama</hi> (flamma), <hi
                    rend="italic">llave</hi> (clavis), <hi rend="italic">llorar</hi> (plorare); the
                    tendency of the modern language is, as in Catalan, to reduce <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll</hi> to <hi rend="italic">y</hi>; thus one readily hears <hi rend="italic"
                    >yeno</hi> (plenum). <hi rend="italic">N</hi> mouillée <hi rend="italic"
                    >(n)</hi> corresponds to the Latin <hi rend="italic">nn, mn, nj,</hi> and
                    sometimes to initial <hi rend="italic">n</hi>: <hi rend="italic">año</hi>
                    (annum), <hi rend="italic">daño</hi> (damnum), <hi rend="italic">ñudo</hi>
                    (nodum). Passing to the dentals, except as an initial, <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    in words that are popularly current and belong to the old stock of the language,
                    can only be derived from Lat. <hi rend="italic">tt, pt,</hi> and sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">ct,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">meter</hi> (mittere), <hi
                    rend="italic">catar</hi> (captare), <hi rend="italic">punto</hi> (punctum); but
                    it is to be observed that the habitual mode of representing <hi rend="italic"
                    >ct</hi> in normal Castilian is by <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> (pron. <hi
                    rend="italic">tch</hi>), as in <hi rend="italic">derecho</hi> (directum), <hi
                    rend="italic">pecho</hi> (pectus), so that we may take those words in which <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> alone represents <hi rend="italic">ct</hi> as secondary
                    forms of learned words; thus we have <hi rend="italic">bendito, otubre,
                    santo</hi> as secondary forms of the learned words <hi rend="italic">bendicto,
                    octubre, sancto,</hi> alongside of the old popular forms <hi rend="italic"
                    >bendicho, ochubre, sancho. D</hi> corresponds in Castilian to Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> between vowels, or <hi rend="italic">t</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">r: amado</hi> (amatus), <hi rend="italic">padre</hi> (patrem). At
                    the present day the <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the suffixes <hi rend="italic"
                    >ado, ido</hi> is no longer pronounced throughout the whole extent of the
                    domain, and the same holds good also of the final <hi rend="italic">d: salú,
                    poné,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">salud, poned</hi> (from salutem, ponite).
                    Sometimes <hi rend="italic">d</hi> takes the interdental sound of <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> (English <hi rend="italic">th),</hi> or is changed into <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi>; witness the two pronunciations of the name of the capital—
                    <hi rend="italic">Madriz</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Madril</hi> (adj. <hi
                    rend="italic">Madrileño).</hi> The study of the spirants <hi rend="italic">c, z,
                    s; g, j</hi> is made a very delicate one by the circumstance that the
                    interdental pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">c, z</hi> on the one hand, and
                    the guttural pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">g, j</hi> on the other, are of
                    comparatively recent date, and convey no notion of the value of these letters
                    before the 17th century. It is admitted, not without reason, that the spirants
                    c, <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> which at present represent but one interdental
                    sound (a lisped <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, or a sound between <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> and Eng. <hi rend="italic">th</hi> in thing), had down till about the
                    middle of the 16th century the voiceless sound <hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and the
                    voiced sound <hi rend="italic">dz</hi> respectively, and that in like manner the
                    palatal spirants <hi rend="italic">g, j, x,</hi> before assuming the uniform
                    pronunciation of the guttural spirant ( = Germ. <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Buch),</hi> had previously represented the voiced sound of ž (Fr.
                    <hi rend="italic">j)</hi> and the voiceless sound of š (Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >ch),</hi> which are still found in Portuguese and in the Castilian dialects of
                    the north-west. The substitution of these interdental and guttural sounds for
                    the surd and sonant spirants respectively did certainly not take place
                    simultaneously, but the vacillations of the old orthography, and afterwards the
                    decision of the Spanish Academy, which suppressed <hi rend="italic">x</hi> (=š;
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> was retained for <hi rend="italic">cs)</hi> and allows
                    only <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i, z</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >j</hi> before <hi rend="italic">a, o, u,</hi> make it impossible for us to
                    follow, with the help of the written texts, the course of the transformation.
                    <hi rend="italic">S</hi> now has the voiceless sound even between vowels: <hi
                    rend="italic">casa</hi> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">cassa);</hi> final <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> readily falls away, especially before liquids: <hi
                    rend="italic">todo los</hi> for <hi rend="italic">todos los, vamono</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">νamos nos.</hi> The principal sources of <hi rend="italic">j
                    (g)</hi> are—Lat. <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i (juego,</hi> jocum; <hi
                    rend="italic">gente,</hi> gentem); Lat. initial <hi rend="italic">s (jabon,</hi>
                    saponem); Lat. <hi rend="italic">x (cojo,</hi> coxum); <hi rend="italic">lj, cl
                    (consejo,</hi> consilium; <hi rend="italic">ojo,</hi> oc’lum). The sources of
                    <hi rend="italic">z (c)</hi> are Lat. <hi rend="italic">ce, cj, tj, s
                    (cielo,</hi> caelum; <hi rend="italic">calza,</hi> calcea; <hi rend="italic"
                    >razon,</hi> rationem; <hi rend="italic">zampoña,</hi> symphonia). As regards
                    the spirants <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ν,</hi> it is to be
                    observed that at the beginning of a word <hi rend="italic">f</hi> has in many
                    instances been replaced by the aspirated <hi rend="italic">h</hi> (afterwards
                    silent), while in others no less current among the people the transformation has
                    not taken place; thus we have <hi rend="italic">hijo</hi> (filium) alongside of
                    <hi rend="italic">fiesta</hi> (festa). In some cases the <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> has been preserved in order to avoid confusion that might arise from
                    identity of sound: the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in <hi rend="italic">fiel</hi>
                    (fidelis) has been kept for the sake of distinction from <hi rend="italic"
                    >hiel</hi> (fel). As for <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> it has a marked tendency to
                    become confounded, especially as an initial letter, with the sonant explosive
                    <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> Joseph Scaliger’s pun— <hi rend="italic">bibere est
                    vivere—</hi> is applicable to the Castilians as well as to the Gascons. <hi
                    rend="italic">II</hi> is now nothing more than a graphic sign, except in
                    Andalusia, where the aspirate sound represented by it comes very near <hi
                    rend="italic">j.</hi> Words beginning in <hi rend="italic">hue,</hi> where the
                    <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> not etymologically derived, marks the inseparable
                    aspiration of the initial diphthong <hi rend="italic">ue,</hi> are readily
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">güe</hi> throughout almost the whole extent of the

                    <hi rend="italic">güeso</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hueso</hi> (os). This <hi
                    rend="italic">güe</hi> extends also to words beginning with <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Inflexion. —</hi> There is no trace of declension either in
                    Castilian or in Portuguese. Some nominative forms— <hi rend="italic">Diós</hi>
                    (anciently <hi rend="italic">Díos,</hi> and in the Castilian of the Jews <hi
                    rend="italic">Dío), Cárlos, Márcos, sastre</hi> (sartor)— have been adopted
                    instead of forms derived from the accusative, but the vulgar Latin of the
                    Peninsula in no instance presents two forms (subjective and objective case) of
                    the same substantive. The article is derived from ille, as it is almost
                    everywhere throughout the Romance regions: <hi rend="italic">el, la,</hi> and a
                    neuter <hi rend="italic">lo; los, las.</hi> The plural of the first and second
                    personal pronoun has in the modern language taken a composite form— <hi
                    rend="italic">nosotros, vosotros—</hi> which has been imitated in Catalan. <hi
                    rend="italic">Quien,</hi> the interrogative pronoun which has taken the place of
                    the old <hi rend="italic">qui,</hi> seems to come from quem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conjugation.—</hi> The conjugation of Castilian (and
                    Portuguese) derives a peculiar interest from the archaic features which it
                    retains. The vulgar Latin of Spain has kept the pluperfect indicative, still in
                    current use as a secondary form of the conditional <hi rend="italic">(cantára,
                    vendiéra, partiéra),</hi> and, what is more remarkable still, as not occurring
                    anywhere else, the future perfect <hi rend="italic">(cantáre, vendiére,
                    partiére,</hi> formerly <hi rend="italic">cantáro, vendiéro, partiéro).</hi> The
                    Latin future has been replaced, as everywhere, by the periphrasis (cantare
                    habeo), but it is worth noticing that in certain old texts of the 13th century,
                    and in the popular songs of a comparatively ancient date which have been
                    preserved in Asturias, the auxiliary can still <hi rend="italic">precede</hi>
                    the infinitive (habeo cantare), as with the Latin writers of the decadence:
                    “Mucho de mayor preçio a seer el tu manto Que non sera el nuestro” (Berceo, <hi
                    rend="italic">S. Laur.,</hi> str. 70), where <hi rend="italic">a seer</hi>
                    (habet sedere) corresponds exactly to <hi rend="italic">sera</hi> (sedere
                    habet). The vulgar Latin of the Peninsula, moreover, has preserved the 2d pers.
                    pl. of the imperative <hi rend="italic">(cantad, voided, ρartid),</hi> which has
                    disappeared from all the other Romance languages. Another special feature of
                    Castilian-Portuguese is the complete absence of the form of conjugation known as
                    inchoative (intercalation, in the present tense, of the syllable <hi
                    rend="italic">isc</hi> or <hi rend="italic">esc</hi> between the radical and the
                    inflexion), although in all the other tenses, except the present, Spanish shows
                    a tendency to lay the accent upon the same syllable in all the six persons,
                    which was the object aimed at by the inchoative form. Castilian displaces the
                    accent on the 1st and 2d pers. pl. of the imperfect <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cantábamos, cantábais),</hi> of the pluperfect indicative <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cantáramos, cantárais),</hi> and of the imperfect subjunctive <hi
                    rend="italic">(cantásemos, cantáseis);</hi> possibly the impulse to this was
                    given by the forms of future perfect <hi rend="italic">cantáremos, cantáreis
                    (cantavimus, canturitis).</hi> The 2d persons plural were formerly (except in
                    the perfect) <hi rend="italic">-ades, -edes, -ides</hi>; it was only in the
                    course of the 16th century that they got reduced, by the falling away of <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ais, eis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >is.</hi> The verb essere has been mixed, not as in tho other Romance languages
                    with stare, but with sedere, as is proved by older forms <hi rend="italic">seer,
                    sicdes, sieden, seyendo,</hi> obviously derived from sedere, and which have in
                    the texts sometimes the meaning of “to be seated,” sometimes that of “to be,”
                    and sometimes both. In old Latin charters also sedere is frequently met with in
                    the sense of esse: <hi rend="italic">e.g., “sedeat</hi> istum meum donativum
                    quietum et securum” (anno 1134), where <hi rend="italic">sedeat=sit.</hi> The 2d
                    pers. sing, of the present of s <hi rend="italic">er</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >eres,</hi> which is best explained as borrowed from the imperfect <hi
                    rend="italic">(eras),</hi> this tense being often used in Old Spanish with the
                    meaning of the present; alongside of <hi rend="italic">eres</hi> one finds (but
                    only in old documents or in dialects) <hi rend="italic">sos,</hi> formed like
                    <hi rend="italic">sois</hi> (2d pers. pl. ) upon <hi rend="italic">somos.</hi>
                    The accentuation in the inflexion of perfects in the conjugation called strong,
                    like <hi rend="italic">hubiéron, hiziéron,</hi> which correspond to habuerunt,
                    fecerunt (while in the other Romance languages the Latin type is ěrunt: Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">eurent, firent),</hi> may be regarded as truly etymological, or
                    rather as a result of the assimilation of these perfects to the perfects known
                    as weak <hi rend="italic">(amáron),</hi> for there are dialectic forms having
                    the accent on the radical, such as <hi rend="italic">dixon, hizon.</hi> The past
                    participle of verbs in <hi rend="italic">er</hi> was formerly <hi rend="italic"
                    >udo</hi> (utus) in most cases; at present <hi rend="italic">ido</hi> serves for
                    all verbs in <hi rend="italic">er</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ir,</hi> except
                    some ten or twelve in which the participle has retained the Latin form accented
                    on the radical: <hi rend="italic">dicho, hecho, visto,</hi> &amp;c. It ought to
                    be added that the past participle in normal Castilian derives its theme not from
                    the perfect but from the infinitive: <hi rend="italic">habido, sabido,</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">haber, saber,</hi> not from <hi rend="italic">hubo,
                    supo.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Castilian Dialects.</hi> —To discover the
                    features by which these are distinguished from normal Castilian we must turn to
                    old charters and to certain modern compositions in which the provincial forms of
                    speech have been reproduced more or less faithfully.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Asturian.—</hi> The Asturian idiom, called by the natives <hi
                    rend="italic">bable,</hi> is differentiated from the Castilian by the following
                    characters. <hi rend="italic">Ie</hi> occurs, as in Old Castilian, in words
                    formed with the suffix <hi rend="italic">ellum (castiellu, portiellu,</hi> while
                    modern Castilian has reduced <hi rend="italic">ie</hi> to <hi rend="italic">i.

                    >i</hi> this <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is hardly perceptible, to judge by the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Naνarrese-Aragonese.—</hi> In its treatment of the post-tonic
                    vowels this dialect parts company with normal Castilian and comes nearer
                    Catalan, in so far as it drops the final <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> especially
                    after <hi rend="italic">nt, rt (mont, plazient, muert, fuert, parents,
                    gents)</hi>; and, when the atonic <hi rend="italic">e</hi> has dropped after a
                    <hi rend="italic">ν,</hi> this <hi rend="italic">ν</hi> becomes a vowel— <hi
                    rend="italic">breu</hi> (brevem), <hi rend="italic">grieu</hi> (*grevem), <hi
                    rend="italic">nueu</hi> (novem). Navarrese-Aragonese has the diphthongs <hi

                    rend="italic">ŏ,</hi> and adheres more strictly to them than normal Castilian
                    does,— <hi rend="italic">cuende</hi> (cŏmitem), <hi rend="italic">huey</hi>
                    (hŏdie), <hi rend="italic">pueyo</hi> (pŏdium), <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>
                    (est), <hi rend="italic">yeran</hi> (ĕrant), while Castilian says <hi
                    rend="italic">eonde, hoy, poyo, es, eran.</hi> The initial combinations <hi
                    rend="italic">cl, pl, fl,</hi> have withstood the transformation into <hi

                    plega, clamado, flama</hi> are current in old documents; and at the present day,
                    although the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> has come to be “mouillée,” the first
                    consonant has not disappeared <hi rend="italic">(plluma, pllora, pllano—</hi>
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">pljuma,</hi> &amp;c. ). Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >ct</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> as in

                    rend="italic">D</hi> between vowels kept its ground longer than in Castilian:
                    documents of the 14th century supply such forms as <hi rend="italic">vidieron,
                    νido, hudio, ρroνedir, redemir, prodeza, Benedit, vidiendo,</hi> &amp;c.; but
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">y</hi> came to be substituted for <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">fillo, feito.</hi> Navarrese-Aragonese does not possess the
                    guttural spirant <hi rend="italic">(j)</hi> of Castilian, which is here rendered
                    according to circumstances either by <hi rend="italic">g</hi> (Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">j)</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">ll (l</hi> mouillée), but never by
                    the Asturian <hi rend="italic">x</hi>. Certain forms of the conjugation of the
                    verb differ from the Castilian: <hi rend="italic">dar, estar, haver, saber,
                    poner</hi> readily form their imperfects and imperfect subjunctives like the
                    regular verbs in <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >er,—havieron</hi> (Cast. <hi rend="italic">hubieron), estaron</hi> (Cast. <hi

                    >pusiese)</hi>; on the other hand, past participles and gerundives formed from
                    the perfect are to be met with,— <hi rend="italic">fisiendo</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">faciendo</hi> (perf. <hi rend="italic">fiso), tuviendo</hi> and

                    <hi rend="italic">tuvo).</hi> In the region bordering on Catalonia the simple
                    perfect has given way before the periphrastic form proper to Catalan: <hi

                    done), <hi rend="italic">vamos ir</hi> (we went), &amp;c.; the imperfects of
                    verbs in <hi rend="italic">er, ir,</hi> moreover, are found in <hi rend="italic"
                    >eba, iba (comeba, subiba,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">comia, subia),</hi> and
                    some presents also occur where the Catalan influence makes itself felt: <hi

                    Navarrese-Aragonese makes use of the adverb <hi rend="italic">en</hi> as a
                    pronoun: <hi rend="italic">no les en daren pas, no'n hi ha.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Andalusian.—</hi> The word “dialect” is still more appropriately
                    applied to Andalusian than either to Asturian or Navarrese-Aragonese. Many
                    peculiarities of pronunciation, however, are commonly called Andalusian which
                    are far from being confined to Andalusia proper, but are met with in the vulgar
                    speech of many parts of the Castilian domain, both in Europe and in America. Of
                    these but a few occur only there, or at least have not yet been observed
                    elsewhere than in that great province of southern Spain. They are the following.
                    <hi rend="italic">L, n, r, d</hi> between vowels or at the end of a word
                    disappear: <hi rend="italic">sá (sal), só (sol), viee (viene), tiee (tiene),
                    paa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pa ( para), mia (mira), naa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">na (nada), too</hi> and <hi rend="italic">to (todo). D</hi> is
                    dropped even from the beginning of a word: <hi rend="italic">e (de), inero
                    (dinero), on (don).</hi> Before an explosive, <hi rend="italic">l, r, d</hi> are
                    often represented by <hi rend="italic">i: saiga (salga), vaiga (valga), laigo
                    (largo), maire (madre), paire (padre).</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is
                    more rigorously represented by <hi rend="italic">h</hi> than in normal
                    Castilian, and this <hi rend="italic">h</hi> here preserves the aspirate sound
                    which it has lost elsewhere; <hi rend="italic">hablá, horma (forma), hoder,</hi>
                    are pronounced with a very strong aspiration, almost identical with that of <hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi>. The Andalusians also very readily write these words <hi
                    rend="italic">jabla, jorma, joder.</hi> This aspirate, expressed by <hi
                    rend="italic">j,</hi> often has no etymological origin; for example, <hi
                    rend="italic">Jándalo,</hi> a nickname applied to Andalusians, is simply the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Andaluz</hi> pronounced with the strong aspiration
                    characteristic of the inhabitants of the province. <hi rend="italic">C, z</hi>
                    are seldom pronounced like <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; but a feature more peculiar
                    to the Andalusians is the inverse process, the softened and interdental
                    pronunciation of the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> (the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ceceo): zeñor (senor),</hi> &amp;c. Before a consonant and at the end of a word
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> becomes a simple aspiration: <hi rend="italic">mihmo
                    (mismo), Dioh (Dios), do reales (dos reales).</hi> In the inflexion of the verb
                    there is nothing special to note, except some instances of 2d pers. sing. of the
                    perfect in <hi rend="italic">tes</hi> for <hi rend="italic">te: estuvistes,
                    estuvites,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">estuviste,—</hi> evidently a formation by
                    analogy from the 2d pers. of the other tenses, which all have <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi>.</p>
                <p>It is with the Andalusian dialect that we can most readily associate the
                    varieties of Castilian which are spoken in South America. Here some of the most
                    characteristic features of the language of the extreme south of Spain are
                    reproduced,—either because the Castilian of America has spontaneously passed
                    through the same phonetic transformations or because the Andalusian element,
                    very strongly represented in colonization, succeeded in transporting its local
                    habits of speech to the New World.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Leonese. —</hi> Proceeding on inadequate indications, the
                    existence of a Leonese dialect has been imprudently admitted in some quarters;
                    but the old kingdom of Leon cannot in any way be considered as constituting a
                    linguistic domain with an individuality of its own. The fact that a poem of the
                    13th century (the <hi rend="italic">Alexandro),</hi> and certain redactions of
                    the oldest Spanish code, the <hi rend="italic">Fuero Juzgo,</hi> have a Leonese
                    origin has been made too much of, and has led to a tendency to localize
                    excessively certain features common to the whole western zone where the
                    transition takes place from Castilian to Galician-Portuguese.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Portuguese.</hi> —Portuguese-Galician constitutes the
                    second branch of the Latin of Spain. In it we must distinguish—(1) Portuguese
                    <hi rend="italic">(Portuguez,</hi> perhaps a contraction from the old <hi
                    rend="italic">Portugalez=</hi> Portugalensis), the language of the kingdom of
                    Portugal and its colonies in Africa, Asia, and America (Brazil); (2) Galician
                    <hi rend="italic">(Gallego),</hi> or the language of the old kingdom of Galicia
                    (the modern provinces of Pontevedra, La Coruna, Orense, and Lugo) and of a
                    portion of the old kingdom of Leon (the territory of Vierzo in the province of
                    Leon). Portuguese, like Castilian, is a literary language, which for ages has
                    served as the vehicle of the literature of the Portuguese nation constituted in
                    the beginning of the 12th century. Galician, on the other hand, which began
                    early in the Middle Ages a literary life,—for it was employed by Alfonso the
                    Wise in his <hi rend="italic">cantigas</hi> in honour of the Virgin,—decayed in
                    proportion as the monarchy of Castile and Leon, to which Galicia had been
                    annexed, gathered force and unity in its southward conquest. At the present day
                    Gallego, which is simply Portuguese variously modified and with a development in
                    some respects arrested, is far from having as a dialect the same importance as
                    Catalan, not only because the Spaniards who speak it (1,800,000) number much
                    less than the Catalans (3,500,000), but also because, its literary culture
                    having been early abandoned in favour of Castilian, it inevitably fell into the
                    vegetative condition of a provincial patois. Speaking generally, Portuguese is
                    further removed than Castilian from Latin; its development has gone further, and
                    its actual forms are more worn out than those of the sister language, and hence
                    it has, not without reason, been compared to French, with which it has some very
                    notable analogies. But, on the other hand, Portuguese has remained more
                    exclusively Latin in its vocabulary, and, particularly in its conjugation, it
                    has managed to preserve several features which give it, as compared with
                    Castilian, a highly archaic air. Old Portuguese, and more especially the poetic
                    language of the 13th century, received from the language of the troubadours, in
                    whose poetry the earlier Portuguese poets found much of their inspiration,
                    certain words and certain turns of expression which have left upon it indelible
                    traces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vowels. —</hi> Lat. 8, 8 with the accent have not been
                    diphthongized into <hi rend="italic">ie, uo, ue: pé</hi> (pedem), <hi
                    rend="italic">dez</hi> (decem), <hi rend="italic">born</hi> (bonus), <hi
                    rend="italic">pode</hi> (potet). On the other hand, Portuguese has a large
                    number of strong diphthongs produced by the attraction of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> in hiatus or the resolution of an explosive into <hi rend="italic">i:
                    rαibα</hi> (rabia), <hi rend="italic">feira</hi> (feria), <hi rend="italic"
                    >feito</hi> (factum), <hi rend="italic">seixo</hi> (saxum), <hi rend="italic"
                    >oito</hi> (octo). A quite peculiar feature of the language occurs in the “nasal
                    vowels,” which are formed by the Latin accented vowels followed by <hi
                    rend="italic">m, n,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nt, nd: b</hi> ẽ (bene), <hi
                    rend="italic">grã</hi> (grandem), <hi rend="italic">bo</hi> (bonum). These nasal
                    vowels enter into combination with a final atonic vowel: <hi rend="italic"
                    >irmão</hi> (germanus); also <hi rend="italic">amão</hi> (amant), <hi
                    rend="italic">sermão</hi> (sermonem), where the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is a
                    degenerated representative of the Latin final vowel. In Old Portuguese the nasal
                    vowel or diphthong was not as now marked by the <hi rend="italic">til</hi> (˜)
                    <hi rend="italic">,</hi> but was expressed indifferently and without regard to
                    the etymology by <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n: bem</hi>
                    (bene), <hi rend="italic">tan</hi> (tantum), <hi rend="italic">disserom</hi>
                    (dixerunt), <hi rend="italic">sermom</hi> (sermonem). The Latin diphthong <hi
                    rend="italic">aU</hi> is rendered in Portuguese by <hi rend="italic">ou
                    (ouro,</hi> aurum; <hi rend="italic">pouco,</hi> paucum), also pronounced <hi
                    rend="italic">oi</hi>. With regard to the atonic vowels, there is a tendency to
                    reduce <hi rend="italic">a</hi> into a<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0375-0352"/> vowel resembling the Fr. <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    “muet,” to pronounce <hi rend="italic">o</hi> as <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> and
                    to drop <hi rend="italic">e</hi> after a group of consonants (<hi rend="italic"
                    >dent</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dente).</hi><hi rend="italic">Consonants.
                    —</hi> Here the most remarkable feature, and that which most distinctly marks
                    the wear and tear through which the language has passed, is the disappearance of
                    the median consonants <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n:
                    corõa</hi> (corona), <hi rend="italic">lua</hi> (luua), <hi rend="italic"
                    >pôr</hi> formerly <hi rend="italic">poer</hi> (ponere), <hi rend="italic"
                    >conego</hi> (canonicus), <hi rend="italic">vir</hi> (venire), d <hi
                    rend="italic">ôr,</hi> formerly <hi rend="italic">door</hi> (dolorem), <hi
                    rend="italic">paço</hi> (palatium), <hi rend="italic">saude</hi> (salutem), <hi
                    rend="italic">pego</hi> (pelagus). Latin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> passes
                    regularly into <hi rend="italic">v: cavallo</hi> (caballus), <hi rend="italic"
                    >fava</hi> (faba), <hi rend="italic">arvore</hi> (arborem); but, on the other
                    hand, Latin initial <hi rend="italic">v</hi> readily tends to become <hi
                    rend="italic">b: bexiga</hi> (vesica), <hi rend="italic">bodo</hi> (votum).
                    Latin initial <hi rend="italic">f</hi> never becomes <hi rend="italic">h:
                    fazer</hi> (facere), <hi rend="italic">filo</hi> (filum). Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> is represented either by the hard sibilant <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or
                    by the soft <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">g</hi> between
                    vowels is dropped before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and i: <hi rend="italic"
                    >1er</hi> for <hi rend="italic">leer</hi> (legere), <hi rend="italic">dedo</hi>
                    (digitum); the same is the case with <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> of course, in
                    similar circumstances: <hi rend="italic">remir</hi> (redimere), <hi
                    rend="italic">rir</hi> (ridere). Latin <hi rend="italic">j</hi> has assumed the
                    sound of the French <hi rend="italic">j.</hi> The Latin combinations <hi
                    rend="italic">cl, fl, pl</hi> at the beginning of words are transformed in two
                    ways in words of popular origin. Either the initial consonant is retained while
                    the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">r</hi>: <hi
                    rend="italic">cravo</hi> (clavum), <hi rend="italic">prazer</hi> (placere), <hi
                    rend="italic">fror</hi> (florem); or the group is changed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >eh</hi> ( = Fr. <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> Catal. <hi rend="italic">x)</hi>
                    through the intermediate sounds <hi rend="italic">kj, fj, pj: chamar</hi>
                    (clamare), <hi rend="italic">chao</hi> (planus), <hi rend="italic">chamma</hi>
                    (flamma). Within the word the same group and other groups also in which the
                    second consonant is an <hi rend="italic">l</hi> produce <hi rend="italic">l</hi>
                    mouillée (written <hi rend="italic">lh,</hi> just as <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    mouillée is written <hi rend="italic">nh,</hi> as in Provençal): <hi
                    rend="italic">ovelha</hi> (ovic’la), <hi rend="italic">velho</hi> (*veclus); and

                    >ancho</hi> (amplum). Lat. <hi rend="italic">ss</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >sc</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> gives <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">eh): baixo</hi> (bassus), <hi
                    rend="italic">faxa</hi> (fascia). The group <hi rend="italic">et</hi> is reduced
                    to <hi rend="italic">it: leito</hi> (lectum), <hi rend="italic">peito</hi>
                    (pectus), <hi rend="italic">noite</hi> (noctem); sometimes to <hi rend="italic"
                    >douto</hi> (doctus). Such words as <hi rend="italic">fruto</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">reto, dileto</hi> are modern derivatives from the learned forms
                    <hi rend="italic">frueto, recto, dilecto.</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">es</hi>
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">is: seis</hi> (sex); or isc, <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    (=Fr. <hi rend="italic">ich, eh): seixo</hi> (saxum), <hi rend="italic"
                    >luxo</hi> (luxum); or even <hi rend="italic">ss: disse</hi> (dixi).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inflexion.—</hi> The Portuguese article, now reduced to the
                    vocalic form o, <hi rend="italic">a, os, as,</hi> was <hi rend="italic">lo</hi>
                    (exceptionally also <hi rend="italic">el,</hi> which still survives in the
                    expression <hi rend="italic">El-Rei), la, los, las</hi> in the old language.
                    Words ending in <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in the singular lose the <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> in the plural (because it then becomes median, and so is
                    dropped): <hi rend="italic">sol</hi> (solem), but <hi rend="italic">soes</hi>
                    (soles); those having <hi rend="italic">ão</hi> in the sing. form the plural
                    either in <hi rend="italic">ães</hi> or in <hi rend="italic">ões</hi> according
                    to the etymology: thus <hi rend="italic">cão</hi> (canem) makes <hi
                    rend="italic">cães,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">ração</hi> makes <hi
                    rend="italic">rações.</hi> As regards the pronoun, mention must be made of the
                    non-etymological forms of the personal <hi rend="italic">mim</hi> and of the
                    feminine possessive <hi rend="italic">mνnha,</hi> where the second <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> has been brought in by the initial nasal. Portuguese
                    conjugation has more that is interesting. In the personal suffixes the forms of
                    the 2d pers. pl. in <hi rend="italic">ades, edes, ides</hi> lost the <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> in the 15th century, and have now become <hi rend="italic"
                    >ais, eis, is</hi> through the intermediate forms <hi rend="italic">aes, ees,
                    eis.</hi> The form in <hi rend="italic">des</hi> has persisted only in those
                    verbs where it was protected by the consonants <hi rend="italic">n</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> preceding it: <hi rend="italic">pondes, tendes, vindes,
                    amardes,</hi> and also no doubt in some forms of the present of the imperative,
                    where the theme has been reduced to an extraordinary degree by the disappearance
                    of a consonant and the contraction of vowels: <hi rend="italic">ides, credes,
                    ledes,</hi> &amp;c. Portuguese is the only Romance language which possesses a
                    personal or conjugated infinitive: <hi rend="italic">amar, amar-es, amar,
                    amar-mos, amar-des, amar-em; e.g., antes de sair-mos,</hi> “before we go out.”
                    Again, Portuguese alone has preserved the pluperfect in its original meaning, so
                    that, for example, <hi rend="italic">amara</hi> (amaveram) signifies not merely
                    as elsewhere “I would love,” but also “I had loved.” The future perfect,
                    retained as in Castilian, has lost its vowel of inflexion in the 1st and 3d
                    pers. sing. and consequently becomes liable to be confounded with the infinitive
                    <hi rend="italic">(amar, render, partir).</hi> Portuguese, though less
                    frequently than Castilian, employs <hi rend="italic">ter</hi> (tenere) as an
                    auxiliary, alongside of <hi rend="italic">aver·,</hi> and it also supplements
                    the use of essere with sedere, which furnished the subj. <hi rend="italic"
                    >seja,</hi> the imperative <hi rend="italic">se, sede,</hi> the gerundive <hi
                    rend="italic">sendo,</hi> the participle <hi rend="italic">sido,</hi> and some
                    other tenses in the old language. Among the peculiarities of Portuguese
                    conjugation may be mentioned—(1) the assimilation of the 3d pers. sing. to the
                    1st in strong perfects (<hi rend="italic">houve, ρudc, quiz, fez),</hi> while
                    Castilian has <hi rend="italic">hube</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hubo</hi>; (2)
                    the imperfects <hi rend="italic">punha, tinha, vinha</hi> (from <hi
                    rend="italic">pοr, ter,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vir),</hi> which are accented
                    on the radical in order to avoid the loss of the <hi rend="italic">n (ponia</hi>
                    would have made <hi rend="italic">poía),.</hi> and which substitute <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> for <hi rend="italic">o</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in order to distinguish from the present
                    subjunctive (<hi rend="italic">ponha, tenha, venha).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Galician.—</hi> Almost all the phonetic features which distinguish Portuguese
                    from Castilian are possessed by Gallego also. Portuguese and Galician even now
                    are practically one language, and still more was this the case formerly: the
                    identity of the two idioms would become still more obvious if the orthography
                    employed by the Galicians were more strictly phonetic, and if certain
                    transcriptions of sounds borrowed from the grammar of the official language
                    (Castilian) did not veil the true pronunciation of the dialect. It is stated,
                    for example, that Gallego does not possess nasal diphthongs; still it may be
                    conceded once for all that such a word as planus, which in Galician is written
                    sometimes c <hi rend="italic">hau</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >chan,</hi> cannot be very remote from the Portuguese nasal pronunciation <hi
                    rend="italic">chao.</hi> One of the most notable differences between normal
                    Portuguese and Galician is the substitution of the surd spirant in place of the
                    sonant spirant for the Lat. <hi rend="italic">j</hi> before all vowels and <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i:
                    xuez</hi> (judicem), Port. <hi rend="italic">juiz; xunto</hi> (junctum), Port.
                    <hi rend="italic">junto; xente</hi> (gentem), Port. <hi rend="italic"
                    >genie.</hi> In conjugation the peculiarities of Gallego are more marked; some
                    find their explanation within the dialect itself, others seem to be due to
                    Castilian influence. The 2d persons plural have still their old form <hi
                    rend="italic">ades, edes, ides,</hi> so that in this instance it would seem as
                    if Gallego had been arrested in its progress while Portuguese had gone on
                    progressing; but it is to be observed that with these full forms the grammarians
                    admit contracted forms as well: <hi rend="italic">ás</hi> (Port. <hi
                    rend="italic">ais), és</hi> (Port. <hi rend="italic">eis), is</hi> (Port. <hi
                    rend="italic">is).</hi> The 1st pers. sing. of the perfect of conjugations in
                    <hi rend="italic">er</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ir</hi> has come to be
                    complicated by a nasal resonance similar to that which we find in the Portuguese
                    <hi rend="italic">mim;</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">vendin, partin,</hi>
                    instead of <hi rend="italic">vendi, parti,</hi> and by analogy this form in <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> has extended itself also to the perfect of the conjugation
                    in <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">falin, gardin,</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">falei, gardei</hi> are found. The second persons of the same tense
                    take the endings <hi rend="italic">ehe, ches</hi> in the singular and <hi
                    rend="italic">chedes</hi> in the plural: <hi rend="italic">falache</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">falaehes</hi> (fabulasti), <hi rend="italic">falaehedes</hi> as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">falástedes</hi> (fabulastis), <hi rend="italic"
                    >bateche</hi> or <hi rend="italic">batiche,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic"
                    >batestes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">batechedes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ti</hi> (tibi) having given <hi rend="italic">che</hi> in Galician, we see that
                    <hi rend="italic">falasti</hi> has become <hi rend="italic">falache</hi> by a
                    phonetic process. The 3d pers. sing. of strong perfect is not in <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> as in Portuguese <hi rend="italic">{houve, pode),</hi> but
                    in <hi rend="italic">o (houbo, puido, soubo, coubo,</hi> &amp;c. ); Castilian
                    influence may be traceable here. If a contemporary grammarian, Saco Arce, is to
                    be trusted, Gallego would form an absolute exception to the law of Spanish
                    accentuation in the imperfect and pluperfect indicative: <hi rend="italic"
                    >falabámos, falabádes; batiámos, batiádes; pidiámos, pidiádes;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">falarámos, falarádes; baterámos, baterádes; pidirámos,
                    pidirádes.</hi> The future perfect indicative and the imperfect subjunctive, on
                    the other hand, would seem to be accented regularly: <hi rend="italic"
                    >faláremos, falásemos.</hi> The important question is worth further study in
                    detail.</p>

                <p>PART IV.—LITERATURE.</p>
                <p>The name Spanish is now generally restricted to the literature of the Castilian
                    tongue. In the present article it is taken in the wider sense as embracing the
                    literature of the whole Iberian Peninsula, with the exceptions of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Portugal</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) and of Galicia, the
                    latter of which as regards language and literature belongs to the Portuguese
                    domain. Spanish literature thus considered falls into two divisions —Castilian
                    and Catalan.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Castilian Literature.</hi> —Of the Castilian texts now
                    extant none are of earlier date than the 12th century, and very probably none go
                    farther back than 1150. That accepted as the oldest—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mystery of the Magian Kings,</hi> as it is rather inappropriately designated—is
                    a fragment of a short semi-liturgical play meant to be acted in the church of
                    Toledo at the feast of Epiphany. Manifestly an imitation of the Latin <hi

                    composed much before 1150.</p>
                <p>The great national hero Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar (died 1099), better known in
                    history by the Arabic surname of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cid (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> was celebrated in the vulgar tongue less than a
                    century after his death in two poems, neither of which, however, has come down
                    to us in its entirety. The first <hi rend="italic">cantar,</hi> usually entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Poema del Cid</hi> since the first edition by Tomas Antonio
                    Sanchez, relates in its first part the valiant deeds (<hi rend="italic">la
                    gesta)</hi> of the Cid subsequent to his quarrel with King Alfonso VI.; in the
                    second the capture of Valencia, the reconciliation of the hero with the king,
                    and the marriage of his daughters with the “infantes” of Carrion;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Carrion de
                    los Condes is a district in the province of Valencia.</hi></p></note> and then
                    in the third the treason of the infantes, the vengeance of the Cid, and the
                    second marriage of his daughters with the infantes of Navarre and Aragon. The
                    narrative of the last years of the Cid, which closes this third part, is very
                    much curtailed. Whilst in the <hi rend="italic">Poema</hi> the Cid appears as
                    the loyal vassal, faithful to his king and deploring the necessity of separating
                    from him, the Cid of the second poem, <hi rend="italic">Crónica rimαda del
                    Cid,</hi> is almost a rebel and at least a refractory vassal who dares treat his
                    sovereign as an equal. The portion of the <hi rend="italic">Crónica</hi> which
                    has been preserved deals in the main with the youth <hi rend="italic"
                    >{mocedades)</hi> of Rodrigo; it contains the primitive version of his quarrel
                    with the Count Gomez de Gormaz, and the marriage of the slayer of the count with
                    Ximena, his daughter, and also a series of fabulous episodes, such as the Cid’s
                    journey to France to fight with the twelve peers of Charlemagne, &amp;c. If the
                    <hi rend="italic">Poema</hi> really belongs to the 12th century, some doubt
                    attaches to the date of the <hi rend="italic">Crónica</hi>; it would seem that
                    the form under which this latter text has reached us is more recent than that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Poema,</hi> but, on the other hand, several traditions
                    collected by the author bear an incontestable stamp of antiquity. The
                    versification of both poems is very barbarous, the metre very irregular.
                    Normally this great epic measure ought to be divided into two hemistichs of
                    seven or eight syllables each; but here the lines sometimes fall short of this
                    number and sometimes exceed it. Instead of rhyme, assonance steadily prevails
                    throughout; the strophes follow the model of the <hi rend="italic">laisses</hi>
                    of the French <hi rend="italic">chansons de geste,—</hi> that is, they have a
                    single assonance and vary greatly in extent.</p>
                <p>The other heroes of Spanish history, such as the last Gothic king Roderick,
                    Bernardo del Carpio, the infantes of Lara, have not given rise to long poems; at
                    least we are acquainted with none of which they are the subject. Still some may
                    have existed; and in fact the frequent allusions in the chronicle of Alfonso the
                    Wise (13th century) to the narratives of the <hi rend="italic">juglares</hi>
                    suggest that Castilian heroic poetry was richer than the scarcity of the
                    monuments still extant would lead us to believe. Fernan Gonzalez, first
                    independent count of Castile (10th century), has alone been celebrated in a poem
                    of the 13th century, composed in single-rhyme quatrains.</p>
                <p>With the heroic poetry which takes its themes from the national history and
                    legends, there grew up in the 13th century a religious and didactic poetry, the
                    most eminent representative of which is Gonzalo de Berceo (1198-1268). This
                    poet, born at Berceo in the province of Logrono, composed several lives of
                    Spanish saints (St Domingo de Silos, St Millan de la Cogulla, St Oria), and also
                    devotional poems, such as the <hi rend="italic">Miracles</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Praises of the Virgin,</hi> and some religious hymns. Berceo names
                    his poems <hi rend="italic">prosa, decir, dictado,</hi> indicating thereby that
                    he intended them to be read and recited, not sung like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cantares.</hi> They are written in single-rhyme quatrains and in verses of
                    twelve to fourteen syllables, according as the ending of each hemistich is
                    masculine or feminine. In the same kind of versification were composed, also in
                    the 13th century, two long poems,—one on Alexander the Great, the other on
                    Apollonius of Tyre, —after Latin and French sources. The author of the first of
                    these poems contrasts his system of versification, which he calls <hi
                    rend="italic">mester de clerecia,</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">mester de
                    joglaria,</hi> the one of the heroic poetry, intended to be sung, and declares
                    that this single-rhyme quatrain (<hi rend="italic">curso rirnado ρor la quaderna
                    via)</hi> consists of counted syllables. The composer of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appolonio</hi> calls this same versification <hi rend="italic">nueva
                    maestria.</hi> The single-rhyme quatrain, introduced in imitation of the French
                    poetry of the 12th century into Castilian literature, became from the time of
                    Berceo and the <hi rend="italic">Alexandro</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appolonio</hi> the regular form in Castilian narrative and didactic poetry, and
                    prevailed down to the close of the 14th century.</p>
                <p>To the 13th century seem also to belong a <hi rend="italic">Life of St Mary the
                    Egyptian,</hi> translated from the French, perhaps through a Provençal version,
                    and an <hi rend="italic">Adoration of the Three Kings,</hi> in verses of eight
                    or nine syllables rhyming in pairs <hi rend="italic">{aa, bb, cc,</hi> Ac.), as
                    well as a fragment of a <hi rend="italic">Debate between Soul and Body,</hi> in
                    verses of six or seven syllables, evidently an imitation of one of those
                    mediaeval Latin poems entitled <hi rend="italic">Rixa Animi et Corporis.</hi>
                    Mention may here also be made of the <hi rend="italic">cantigas</hi> (“songs ”)
                    of Alfonso the Wise in honour of the Virgin, although, being in the Galician
                    dialect, these properly belong to the history of Portuguese literature.</p>
                <p>The 14th century saw the birth of the most original mediaeval Spanish poet. Juan
                    Ruiz (1300-1350), archpriest of Hita (near Guadalajara), has left us a poem of
                    rather irregular composition, in which, while reproducing apologues translated
                    from the Latin or French fabulists, and extracts from Ovid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Art of Love,</hi> or from a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Pamphilus de
                    Amore,</hi> or, lastly, from <hi rend="italic">fabliaux</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">dits,</hi> such as the <hi rend="italic">Bataille de Karesme et de
                    Charnage,</hi> the author frequently gives way to his own inspiration. Ruiz
                    celebrates love and woman; his book is of <hi rend="italic">buen amor,</hi> that
                    is, he shows by his own experience and the example of the authors whom he
                    follows how a man ought to set to work to be a successful lover. The character
                    of the female go-between, named “Trota-Conventos,” here plays an important part;
                    it was suggested to Ruiz by the <hi rend="italic">Pamphilus,</hi> but he has
                    greatly strengthened the characteristics and thus prepared the way for the
                    Celestina of the close of the 15th century. By way of precaution, the author
                    represents himself as one who has survived his illusions, and maintains that
                    carnal love <hi rend="italic">{loco amor)</hi> must in the long run give place
                    to divine love; but this stratum of devotion is a thin one and ought not to
                    disguise the real character of the work. His form of versification is the
                    single-rhyme quatrain in the narrative portions; as to the “songs” (<hi
                    rend="italic">cantigas)</hi> which sometimes interrupt the narrative, and of
                    which the most successful are a “song of scholars” and a “song of the blind,”
                    their rhythm is different and much more varied. The <hi rend="italic">Rimado de
                    Palacio</hi> of the grand chancellor of Castile, Pedro Lopez de Ayala
                    (1332-1407), does not exclusively refer to court life; the author takes up all
                    classes of laymen and churchmen, whose vices he depicts in jocular style. Amid
                    the tirades of this long moral poem there occur occasionally some <hi
                    rend="italic">cantares</hi> or even <hi rend="italic">decires</hi> in strophes
                    of eight lines of twelve syllables. Akin to this <hi rend="italic">Rimado de
                    Palacio</hi> are the <hi rend="italic">Proverbios Morales</hi> of the Jew Santob
                    (Shemtob) of Carrion, dedicated to King Pedro the Cruel, who reigned from 1350
                    to 1369, as well as the <hi rend="italic">General Dance of Death</hi> and a new
                    version of the <hi rend="italic">Debate between Soul and Body,</hi> both in
                    eight-line strophes of <hi rend="italic">arte mayor</hi> (verses of twelve
                    syllables), and both imitations of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0377-0354"/> French originals. The 14th century also produced
                    a long-historical composition in verse, the <hi rend="italic">Rhymed Chronicle
                    of Alfonso XI.</hi> (died 1350), by Rodrigo Yanez, important fragments of which
                    have come down to us; the versification of this chronicle is similar to that of
                    Santob’s <hi rend="italic">Proverbs</hi> (strophes of four octosyllabic verses
                    rhyming <hi rend="italic">abab).</hi></p>
                <p>The word romance not only signifies in Spain, as in other Romanic countries, the
                    vulgar tongue, but also bears the special meaning of a short epic narrative poem
                    (historic ballad) or, at a later date, a short lyric poem. As regards the form,
                    the “romance” (Spanish <hi rend="italic">el romance,</hi> in contrast to French,
                    &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">la romance)</hi> is a composition in long verses of
                    fourteen syllables ending with one rhyme, or assonance, which have been
                    generally, but wrongly, divided into two short lines, the first of which,
                    naturally, is rhymeless. This being the form of the romance verse, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Crónica rimada del Cid,</hi> and even the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poema</hi> (though in this case the influence of the French alexandrines is
                    perceptible), might be considered as a series of romances tagged on one after
                    the other; and in fact several of the old romances of the Cid, which form each
                    an independent whole and have been printed as separate poems in the 16th
                    century, are partly to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Crónica.</hi> Other
                    romances, notably those dealing with the heroes of the Carlovingian epic, so
                    popular in Spain, or with the heroes which Spanish patriotism opposed at a
                    certain period to the French paladins,— as, for example, Bernardo del Carpio,
                    the rival and the conqueror of Roland in Castilian tradition,—seem to be
                    portions severed from those <hi rend="italic">cantares de gesta</hi> composed by
                    <hi rend="italic">juglares</hi> of which Alfonso X. makes mention. It is only at
                    the close of the 15th century, and especially during the 16th, that the
                    romances, which had previously passed from mouth to mouth by song and
                    recitation, began to be written down and afterwards to be printed, at first on
                    broadsheets <hi rend="italic">(pliegos sueltos)</hi> and subsequently in
                    collections <hi rend="italic">(romanceros),</hi> either general, in which
                    romances of very different date, character, and subject are mixed up, or
                    restricted to a single historical or legendary episode or to a single personage
                    (for example, the <hi rend="italic">Romancero del Cid).</hi> In those
                    collections the epic verse is always regarded as octosyllabic and printed as
                    such; occasionally certain editions divide the romance into strophes of four
                    verses <hi rend="italic">(cuartetas).</hi></p>
                <p>King Alfonso X. (died 1284), under whose patronage were published the memorable
                    code entitled <hi rend="italic">Las Siete Partidas</hi> and great scientific
                    compilations, such as the <hi rend="italic">Libros de Astronomia</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lapidario,</hi> was also the founder of Spanish historiography
                    in the vulgar tongue. The <hi rend="italic">Crónica General,</hi> composed under
                    his direction, consists of two distinct parts: the one treats of universal
                    history from the creation of the world to the first centuries of the Christian
                    era <hi rend="italic">(La General é Grant Historia),</hi> the other exclusively
                    of the national history <hi rend="italic">(La Crónica o Historia de Espana)</hi>
                    down to the death of Ferdinand III. (1252), father of Alfonso. The main sources
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Crónica General</hi> are two Spanish chroniclers of the
                    13th century,—Lucas of Tuy and Rodriguez of Toledo,—who wrote in Latin, but
                    whose works were early translated into the vernacular. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia de Espana</hi> of Alfonso X., which has collected many legends and
                    which occasionally refers to the songs of the <hi rend="italic">juglares</hi>
                    (for the purpose, however, of refuting them), the narrative relating to the Cid
                    is partly based on an Arabic text. This portion has frequently been printed by
                    itself, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Crónica del Cid.</hi> Alfonso’s
                    example bore fruit. In the 14th century we find another <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crónica General de Espana</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de Castilla,</hi>
                    constructed on the model of the first and embracing the years 1030-1312; next,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Grant Crónica de Espana</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grant Crónica de los Conqueridores,</hi> compiled by command of the grandmaster
                    of the order of St John of Jerusalem, Juan Fernandez de Heredia, about</p>
                <p>1390. Special chronicles of each king of Castile were soon written. Our
                    information is at fault in regard to the authorship of the chronicles of Alfonso
                    X., Sancho IV., Ferdinand IV., and Alfonso XL; but the four following
                    reigns—those of Pedro I., Henry II., John I., and Henry</p>
                <p>III. —were dealt with by Pedro Lopez de Ayala, and here we can recognize the man
                    of literary culture, who had acquired some knowledge of ancient history, for the
                    form of the narrative becomes freer and more personal and the style rises with
                    the thought. Several authors had a hand in the chronicle of John IL, but the
                    final redaction was by Fernan Perez de Guzman. The sad reign of Henry</p>
                <p>IV. was related by Diego Enriquez del Castillo and Alfonso de Palencia, the
                    glorious reign of the Catholic sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella by Fernando del
                    Pulgar and Andrès Bernaldes. Along with those royal chronicles must be mentioned
                    some biographies of important persons. Thus in the 15th century the chronicle of
                    Pedro Nino, count of Buelna (1379-1452), by Gutierre Diez de Gamez; that of
                    Alvaro de Luna, constable of Castile (died 1453); also a very curious book of
                    travels, the narrative of the embassy sent by Henry III. of Castile to Timur in
                    1403, written by the head of the mission, Ruy Gonzalez de <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Clavijo</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p>
                <p>The other productions of Castilian prose in the 13th and 14th centuries are for
                    the most part didactic and sententious compositions, which, however, contain
                    illustrations or tales of Eastern origin. The Spanish translation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Kalila and Dimna,</hi> made direct from an Arabic text, dates from
                    the middle of the 13th century, and the romance of the <hi rend="italic">Seven
                    Sages (Sindibad),</hi> published under the title of <hi rend="italic">En-gaños e
                    Assayamientos de las Mugeres,</hi> must be referred to almost the same period.
                    From the second half of the 13th century the collections of sentences, <hi
                    rend="italic">dits,</hi> apologues, and moral tales become very numerous: first
                    of all, versions of the <hi rend="italic">Secretum Secretorum,</hi> attributed
                    in the Middle Ages to Aristotle, one of which is entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poridat de las Poridades,</hi> next the <hi rend="italic">Proverbios
                    Buenos,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bocados de Oro</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Libro de Bonium, Rey de Persia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Libro de los
                    Gatos,</hi> which is derived from the <hi rend="italic">Narrationes</hi> of
                    Eudes of Cheriton. But the most celebrated is the <hi rend="italic">Libro de los
                    Castigos y Documentos</hi> of King Sancho IV. (died 1295), who also composed a
                    <hi rend="italic">Lucidario,</hi> a kind of encyclopaedia of theology, morals,
                    and natural history. It was during the first half of the 14th century that the
                    nephew of Alfonso X., the infant Juan Manuel (1282-1349), wrote those various
                    works which place him in the first rank of mediaeval Spanish prose writers. The
                    best known is the collection of tales, many of them borrowed from Oriental
                    sources, entitled <hi rend="italic">El Conde Lucanor</hi>; but besides this
                    contribution to light literature he wrote graver and more specially instructive
                    works, notably the <hi rend="italic">Libro de los Estados</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Libro del Infante,</hi> a kind of manual of education, domestic
                    economy, and politics; the <hi rend="italic">Librο del Caballero é del
                    Escudero,</hi> a practical treatise on chivalry somewhat resembling a work of
                    Raymond Lully on the same subject. Unfortunately Juan Manuel’s poems, which he
                    had collected in a <hi rend="italic">Libro de las Cantigas</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">de los Cantares,</hi> have been lost. The knowledge of antiquity,
                    previously so poor and vague, made remarkable progress in the 14th century. It
                    was thought desirable to learn more about certain episodes of ancient history,
                    such as the War of Troy, and therefore the poem on that subject by the Frenchman
                    Benoit de Sainte-More and the Latin narrative of Guido de Columna were both
                    translated. Pedro Lopez de Ayala translated or caused to be translated Pierre
                    Bersuire’s French version of Livy, Boetius, and various writings of Isidore of
                    Seville and Boccaccio.</p>

                    century editions in which they have been more or less modified to suit the taste
                    of the time, but it is impossible not to recognize that books such as <hi
                    rend="italic">El Baladro del Sabio Merlin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Demanda
                    del Sancto Grial</hi> (1515) presuppose a considerable antecedent literature of
                    which they are only the afterglow. The principal French romances of the Round
                    Table were translated and imitated in Spain and in Portugal as early as the
                    first half of the 14th century at least; of that there is no doubt. And, even if
                    there was not on this point satisfactory testimony, the prodigious development
                    in Spanish literature of the <hi rend="italic">caballerias</hi> or “book of
                    chivalry,” incontrovertibly derived from fictions of British origin, is proof
                    enough that the Spaniards have at an early date been familiarized with this
                    romance from France. The first book which begins the series of strictly Spanish
                    <hi rend="italic">caballerias</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaula
                    (i.e.,</hi> of Wales, not France). We know the <hi rend="italic">Amadis</hi>
                    only by the version made about 1480 in four books by Garci Ordonez de Montalvo
                    (the oldest edition extant is dated 1508), but the work in its original form
                    (three books), already widely distributed and celebrated by various Castilian
                    poets from about 1350, must have been composed at the latest in the second third
                    of the 14th century. A few rather vague hints and certain sentimental
                    considerations lead one to seek for the unknown author of the first <hi
                    rend="italic">Amadis</hi> in Portugal, where the romances of the Round Table
                    were even more highly appreciated than in Spain, and where they have exercised a
                    deeper influence on the national literature. To Montalvo, however, falls the
                    honour of having preserved the book by republishing it; he only made the mistake
                    of diluting the original text too much and of adding a poor continuation, <hi
                    rend="italic">Las Sergas de Esplandian.</hi> Allied to Montalvo’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Amadis</hi> with its Esplandian appendage are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Florisando</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lisuarte de
                    Grecia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Grecia,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Florisel de Niquea,</hi> &amp;c., which form what Cervantes called the
                    “Amadis sect.” Along with the Amadises range the Palmerines, the most celebrated
                    of which are the <hi rend="italic">Palmerin de Oliva,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primaleon,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Palmerin de Inglaterra.</hi> None of
                    those <hi rend="italic">caballerias</hi> inspired by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amadis</hi> were printed or even written before the 16th century; and they bear
                    in language and style the stamp of that period; but they cannot be separated
                    from their mediaeval model, the spirit of which they have preserved intact.
                    Among the <hi rend="italic">caballerias</hi> we may also class some narratives
                    belonging to the Carlovingian epic,—the <hi rend="italic">Historia del Emperador
                    Carlomagno y de los Doce Pares,</hi> a very popular version still reprinted of
                    the French romance of <hi rend="italic">Fierabras,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Espejo de Caballerias,</hi> into which has passed a large part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando Innamorato</hi> of Boiardo, the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    de la Reina Sibilla,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The first half of the 15th century, or, what comes almost to the same thing, the
                    reign of John II. of Castile (1407-1454), is as regards its literature
                    characterized by three facts—(1) by the development of a court poetry,
                    artificial and pretentious; (2) by the influence of Italian literature on
                    Castilian prose and poetry, the imitation of Boccaccio and Dante, especially of
                    the latter, which introduced into Spain a liking for allegory; and (3) by more
                    assiduous intercourse with antiquity—a fuller understanding of the Latin writers
                    who had been brought to the front by the Italian renaissance. After the example
                    of the Provençale, whose literary doctrines had made their way into Castile
                    through Portugal and Catalonia, poetry is now styled the <hi rend="italic">arte
                    de trobar.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">arte de trobar</hi> is strictly “court”
                    poetry, which consists in short pieces of rather complicated versification,—love
                    plaints, debates, questions, and repartees, <hi rend="italic">motes</hi> with
                    their <hi rend="italic">glosas,</hi> burlesque and satirical songs,—a poetry
                    wholly “occasional,” and which when separated from its natural environment loses
                    great part of its charm. In order to understand and appreciate those pieces they
                    must be read in the collections made by the poets of the time, and the one must
                    be brought to throw light on the other. The most celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >cancionero</hi> of the 15th century is that compiled for the amusement of his
                    sovereign by Alfonso de Baena (who has not designated himself a Jew, as has been
                    supposed, the word <hi rend="italic">judino</hi> attached to his name in the
                    preface being nothing but <hi rend="italic">indino)</hi>; it is, so to say, the
                    official collection of the poetic court of John II., although it also contains
                    some pieces by poets of earlier date. After Baena’s collection may be mentioned
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cancionero de Stuñiga,</hi> which contains the Castilian
                    poems of the trobadores who followed Alfonso V. of Aragon to Naples. Those <hi
                    rend="italic">cancioneros,</hi> consisting of the productions of a society, a
                    group, were succeeded by collections of a more general character in which
                    versifiers of very different periods and localities are jumbled together, the
                    pieces being classed simply according to their type. The earliest <hi
                    rend="italic">Cancionero General</hi> is that compiled by Juan Fernandez de
                    Constantina, which appears to have issued from the Valencia press in the very
                    beginning of the 16th century; the second, much better known, was published for
                    the first time at Valencia in 1511; its editor was called Fernando del Castillo.
                    The other poetic school of the 15th century, which claims to be specially
                    related to the Italians, had as its leaders Juan de Mena (1411-1456), author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Coro-nacion</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Labirinto</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Las Trecientas</hi> (a long poem so called because of the
                    number of stanzas which, according to the scheme, were to compose it), and the
                    marquis of Santillana, D. Inigo Lopez de Mendoza (1398-1458), who in his sonnets
                    was the first to imitate the structure of the Italian <hi rend="italic"
                    >endecasillabo.</hi> Along with those two, who may be designated <hi
                    rend="italic">poetas,</hi> in distinction from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >decidores</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">trobadores</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cancioneros,</hi> must be ranked Francisco Imperial, a Genoese by
                    descent, who also helped to acclimatize in Spain the forms of Italian poetry.
                    The marquis of Santillana occupies a considerable place in the literature of the
                    15th century, not only by reason of his poems, but quite as much if not more
                    through the support he afforded to all the writers of his time, and the impulse
                    he gave to the study of antiquity and to the labours of translators who at his
                    request turned Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, &amp;c., into Castilian. He himself was not
                    acquainted with Latin; but the generous efforts he made to stir up his
                    fellow-countrymen to learn it have justly procured him the title of father of
                    Spanish humanism. That he had an extensive knowledge of the national literature
                    and of the literatures of France and Italy he has shown in the preface to his
                    works, which is a sort of <hi rend="italic">ars poetica</hi> as well as an
                    historical exposition of the kinds of poetry cultivated in the Middle Ages by
                    the Spaniards and the neighbouring nations.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the chronicles and some <hi rend="italic">caballerias,</hi>
                    the prose of the 15th century contains nothing very striking. The translation of
                    Virgil by Enrique de Villena (died 1434) is very clumsy and shows no advance on
                    the versions of Latin authors made in the previous century; better worth reading
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Trabajos de Hercules,</hi> a whimsical production but
                    with some savour in its style. A curious and amusing book, full of details about
                    Spanish manners, is the <hi rend="italic">Corbacho</hi> of the archpriest of
                    Talavera, Alonso Martinez de Toledo, chaplain to King John II.; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corbacho</hi> belongs to the numerous family of satires against
                    women, and its title (“The Lash” or “Whip”) borrowed from a work of Boccaccio’s,
                    with which it has otherwise nothing akin, correctly indicates that he has not
                    spared them.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0379-0356"/> The ancient liturgical Spanish theatre is known
                    to us only by fragments of the play of the <hi rend="italic">Magian Kings,</hi>
                    of which mention has already been made; but certain regulations of the code of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Siete Partidas</hi> (compiled between 1252 and 1257) prove
                    that this theatre existed, and that at the great festivals, such as Christmas,
                    Epiphany, and Easter, dramatic representations were given in church. These
                    representations, originally a mere commentary on the liturgy, grew more
                    complicated in course of time; they were gradually adulterated with buffoonery,
                    which frequently brought down the censure of the clergy. Alfonso the Wise even
                    thought it necessary formally to forbid the “clerks” playing <hi rend="italic"
                    >juegos de escarnios,</hi> and permitted in the sanctuary only dramas destined
                    to commemorate the principal episodes of the life of Christ. Of all the church
                    festivals, the most popular in Spain was that of Corpus Christi, instituted by
                    Urban IV. in 1264. At an early date was introduced the custom of accompanying
                    the celebration of this festival with dramatic representations intended to
                    explain to the faithful the Eucharistic mystery. Those dramas, called <hi
                    rend="italic">autos sacramentales,</hi> acquired more and more importance; in
                    the 17th century, with Calderon, they become grand allegorical pieces, regular
                    theological dissertations in the form of dramas. To the <hi rend="italic">auto
                    sacramental</hi> corresponds the <hi rend="italic">auto al nacimiento,</hi> or
                    drama of the Nativity. The secular theatre is in Spain as elsewhere a product of
                    the religious theatre. Expelled from the church, the <hi rend="italic">juegos de
                    escarnios</hi> took possession of the public squares and there obtained a free
                    development; they cease to be a mere travesty of dogma to become a separate
                    type, a drama whose movement is no longer determined by the liturgy, and whose
                    actors are borrowed from real life in Spanish society. This new theatre starts
                    about the close of the 15th century with the little pastoral pieces of Juan del
                    Encina (died 1534), which, after Virgil’s example, he calls <hi rend="italic"
                    >eglogas.</hi> Genuine shepherds, clumsy, rude, and long-haired <hi
                    rend="italic">(melenudos),</hi> are the interlocutors of those bucolics, into
                    which are also sometimes introduced students, and even, by Lucas Fernandez, a
                    contemporary and pupil of Encina’s, gentlemen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(caballeros)</hi> and soldiers. A book which, strictly speaking, does not
                    belong to the theatre, the <hi rend="italic">Tragicomedia de Calixto y
                    Melibea,</hi> by Fernando de Rojas, much better known as <hi rend="italic">La
                    Celestina,</hi> and dating from about 1492, caused the new theatre, still so
                    childish in the attempts of the school of Encina, to make a gigantic step
                    onwards. The history of two lovers, who are brought together by a go-between
                    (Celestina), and who after various vicissitudes ultimately commit suicide,—this
                    astonishing novel taught the Spaniards the art of dialogue, and for the first
                    time exhibited persons of all classes of society (particularly the lowest)
                    speaking in harmony with their natural surroundings, thinking and acting in
                    accordance with their condition of life. The progress caused by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Celestina</hi> may be estimated by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Propaladia</hi> of Bartolome Torres Naharro (Naples, 1517), a collection of
                    pieces represented at Rome in presence of Leo X. and distributed by their author
                    into two groups— <hi rend="italic">comedias a noticia,</hi> those treating of
                    things really known and seen, and <hi rend="italic">comedias a fantasia,</hi>
                    those bringing fictions on the stage, though it may be with the appearance of
                    reality. The most interesting, if not the best composed, are the <hi
                    rend="italic">comedia soldadesca,</hi> depicting to the life the Spanish
                    man-at-arms of the time, and the <hi rend="italic">comedia tinelaria,</hi> a
                    picture of the manners of the menials of the pontifical court. Torres Naharro is
                    the first Spaniard who borrowed from France the division of the play into “days”
                    <hi rend="italic">(jοrnadas)</hi>; shortly after Naharro we find the comedy of
                    manners in Lope de Rueda, goldbeater of Seville (died about 1566), whose
                    dramatic work is composed of regular comedies constructed on the model of
                    Naharro and Italian authors of the beginning of the 16th century, and also of
                    little pieces intended for performance in the intervals between the larger plays
                    <hi rend="italic">(entremeses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pasos),</hi> some of
                    which, such as <hi rend="italic">El Convidado, El Rufian Cobarde, Las
                    Aceitunas,</hi> are storehouses of sprightliness and wit. Some of Naharro’s and
                    especially of Rueda’s pieces have already the character of the comedy of
                    intrigue, which is emphatically the type of the classic stage. But to reach Lope
                    de Vega the Spanish stage had to be enlarged in relation to national history. A
                    poet of Seville, Juan de la Cueva (born about 1550), first brought on the boards
                    subjects such as the exploits of the Cid, Bernardo del Carpio, and others, which
                    had previously been treated of only in the “romances.” To a. poet called Berrio,
                    of whose work nothing has been preserved, are attributed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comedias</hi> of Moors and Christians, in which were represented famous
                    episodes of the age-long struggle against the infidel. Aud it is at this period
                    that Cervantes (1585) experimented in the dramatic line; in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tratos de Argel</hi> he gives us a picture of galley-life, painful
                    recollections of his long captivity in Algiers. There is no need to linger over
                    certain attempts at tragedy of the ancient type by Geronimo Bermudez (born
                    1530), Cristobal de Virues (born about 1550), Lupercio Leonardo Argensola
                    (1562-1613), &amp;c., the only successful specimen of which is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Numancia</hi> of Cervantes; these works in fact, cold and
                    manneristic, mere exercises in style and versification, remained without
                    influence on the development of the Spanish stage. The pre-classic period of
                    this stage is, as regards dramatic form, one of indecision. Some write in prose,
                    like Rueda; others, like Naharro, show a preference for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >redondillas</hi> of popular poetry; and there are those again who, to elevate
                    the style of the stage, versify in hendecasyllabics. Hesitation is also evident
                    as to the mode of dividing the drama. At first a division into five acts, after
                    the manner of the ancients, is adopted, and this is still followed by Cervantes
                    in his first pieces; then Juan de la Cueva reduced the five acts to four, and in
                    this he is imitated by most of the poets to the close of the 16th century (Lope
                    de Vega himself in his youth composed pieces in four acts). It was only at this
                    time that the custom which is still maintained of dividing all dramatic works
                    into three acts or days was introduced,—exception of course being made of short
                    pieces like the <hi rend="italic">loa</hi> (prologue), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >entremes,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">paso,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >baile</hi> (different kinds of <hi rend="italic">entr’acte).</hi></p>
                <p>The golden age of Spanish literature, as it is called, belongs to the 16th and
                    the 17th centuries, extending approximately from 1550 to 1650. Previous to the
                    reign of the Catholic sovereigns there exists, strictly speaking, only a
                    Castilian literature, not very self-reliant and largely influenced by imitation
                    first of France and then of Italy; the union of the two crowns of Aragon and
                    Castile, and afterwards the advent of the house of Austria and the king of
                    Spain’s election as emperor, proved the creation at once of the political unity
                    of Spain and of Spanish literature. After the death of Philip IV. (1665) this
                    fair-shining light went out; the nation, exhausted by distant expeditions, the
                    colonization of America, Continental wars, and bad administration, produced
                    nothing; its literary genius sank in the general decline, and Spain is destined
                    ere long to be subjected again to the influence of France, to which she had
                    submitted during all the first period of the Middle Ages. In the 16th and 17th
                    centuries the literature is eminently national. Of course all is not equally

                    hendecasyllabics—as the marquis of Santillana had formerly done, though his
                    attempts had fallen into oblivion—and to group their verses in tercets, octaves,
                    sonnets, and <hi rend="italic">canciones (canzoni).</hi> Garcilaso de la Vega
                    (1503-1536), Juan Boscan (1493-c. 1550), and Diego de Mendoza (1503- 1575) are
                    the recognized chiefs of the school <hi rend="italic">al italico modo,</hi> and
                    to them belongs the honour of having successfully transplanted to Spain those
                    different forms of verse, and of having enriched and improved the poetic
                    language of their country. The few uncouthnesses of which Mendoza and Boscan
                    more especially are guilty (such as certain faults of rhythmic accentuation)
                    were corrected by their disciples Gutierre de Cetina, Gregorio Silvestre,
                    Hernando de Acuña, by the poets of the so-called school of Seville, headed by
                    Fernando de Herrera (died 1597), and also by those of the rival school of
                    Salamanca, rendered famous mainly by the inspired poetry of Fr. Luis de Leon
                    (1528-1591). Against those innovators the poets faithful to the old Castilian
                    manner, the rhymers of <hi rend="italic">redondillas</hi> and romances, hold
                    their own; under the direction of Cristóbal de Castillejo (1556) they carry on a
                    fierce war of the pen against the “Petrarchists.” But by the last third of the
                    16th century the triumph of the new Italian school is assured, and no one any
                    longer thinks of reproaching it for its foreign flavour. Only a sort of schism
                    is effected from that period between the higher poetry and the other varieties:
                    the former employs only the hendecasyllabic and the heptasyllabic <hi
                    rend="italic">(quebrado),</hi> while the popular poets, or those who affect a
                    more familiar tone, preserve the national metres. Almost all the poets, however,
                    of the 16th and 17th centuries have tried their powers in both kinds of
                    versification, using them in turn according to the nature of their subjects.
                    Thus Lope de Vega, first of all, who wrote <hi rend="italic">La Jerusalem
                    Conquistada</hi> (1609), <hi rend="italic">La Dragontea</hi> (1602), <hi
                    rend="italic">La Hermosura de Angelica</hi> (1602), in Italian verses and in
                    octaves, composed his long narrative poem on Isidore, the husbandman patron of
                    Madrid (1599), in quintils of octosyllabic verse, not to mention a great number
                    of “romances.” As regards this last form, previously disdained or almost so by
                    artistic poets, Lope de Vega gave it a prestige that brought it into favour with
                    the literates of the court. A host of poets were pleased to recast the old
                    “romances” or to compose new ones. The 17th century, it may be said, is
                    characterized by a regular surfeit of lyric poetry, to which the establishment
                    of various literary academies in the Italian style contributed not a little. Of
                    this enormous mass of verses of all sorts and sizes very little still keeps
                    afloat: the names of three-fourths of the versifiers must be forgotten, and in
                    addition to those already cited it will be sufficient to mention Luis de Góngora
                    (1561—1626) and Francisco de Quevedo Villegas (1580-1645). Góngora is especially
                    famous as the founder of the “cultist” school, as the introducer into Castilian
                    poetry of a flowery, bombastic, and periphrastic style, characterized by
                    sonorous vocables and artificial arrangements of phrase. The Spaniards have
                    given the name of <hi rend="italic">culto</hi> to this pompous and manneristic
                    style, with its system of inversions based on Latin syntax. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Soledades</hi> of Góngora are the monument <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence</hi> of Spanish mannerism, which made numerous victims and inflicted
                    on the poetry of the Peninsula irreparable injury. But Góngora, a poet of really
                    great powers, had started better, and as often as he cares to forget about being
                    sonorous and affected, and is contented to rhyme romances, he finds true poetic
                    accents, ingenious ideas, and felicitous expressions. Quevedo, much greater,
                    moreover, in his prose works than in his verse, displays real power only in
                    satire, epigram, and parody. There are in some of his serious pieces the stuff
                    of a Juvenal, and his satiric and burlesque romances, of which several are even
                    written in slang <hi rend="italic">(germania),</hi> are in their way little
                    masterpieces. Another commonplace of Spanish poetry at this period was epic
                    poetry after the style of Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme.</hi> None of
                    those interminable and prosaic compositions in <hi rend="italic">octavas
                    reales</hi> come near their model; none of them could even be compared in style,
                    elevation of thought, and beauty of imagery to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lusiadas.</hi> They are in reality only rhymed chronicles, and consequently,
                    when the author happens to have taken part in the events he narrates, they have
                    a genuine historical interest. Such is the case with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araucana</hi> of Alonso de Ercilla (1533-1594), of which it may be said that it
                    was written less with a pen than with a pike. In burlesque poetry the Spaniards
                    have been rather more successful: <hi rend="italic">La Gatomaquia</hi> of Lope
                    de Vega and <hi rend="italic">La Mosquea</hi> of Villaviciosa (died 1658) are
                    somewhat agreeable pieces of fun.</p>
                <p>The departments of imaginative literature in which the genius of the new Spanish
                    nation revealed itself with most vigour and originality are the <hi
                    rend="italic">novela</hi> and the drama. By <hi rend="italic">novela</hi> must
                    be understood the novel of manners, called <hi rend="italic">picaresca</hi>
                    (from <hi rend="italic">picaro,</hi> a rogue or “picaroon ”) because of the
                    social status of the heroes of those fictions; and this kind of novel is quite
                    an invention of the Spaniards. Their pastoral romance, on the other hand—the
                    best known examples of which are the <hi rend="italic">Diana Enamorada</hi> of
                    Jorge de Montemayor (died 1561), continued by Alonso Perez and Gaspar Gil Polo,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Galatea</hi> of Cervantes, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcadia</hi> of Lope de Vega, as well as their novel of adventure, started by
                    Cervantes in his <hi rend="italic">Novelas Ejemplares</hi> (1613), and
                    cultivated after him by a host of writers—is directly derived from Italy. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of Sannazaro is the source of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diana</hi> and of all its imitations, just as the Italian <hi
                    rend="italic">novellieri</hi> alone are the masters of the Spanish <hi
                    rend="italic">novelistas</hi> of the 17th century. The picaresque novel starts
                    in the middle of the 16th century with the <hi rend="italic">Vida de Lazarillo
                    de Tormes, sus Fortunas y Adversidades</hi> (1554), the work of a very bold
                    intellect whose personality unfortunately remains unknown, there being no
                    satisfactory reason for assigning this little book, which is as remarkable for
                    the vigour of its satire as for the sobriety and firmness of its style, to Diego
                    Hurtado de Mendoza. A supplement to the adventures of Lazarillo appeared at
                    Antwerp in 1555; it is probably, however, not the production of the author of
                    the original romance. The impetus was given, and the success of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lazarillo</hi> was so great that imitators soon appeared. In 1599
                    Mateo Aleman published, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Atalaya de la Vida
                    Humana,</hi> the first part of the adventures of another picaroon, Guzman de
                    Alfarache; and, as he was in no hurry to finish this narrative, another writer,
                    jealous of his success, took possession of it and issued in 1603, under the
                    pseudonym of Mateo Luxan, a continuation of the first Guzman. Aleman, not to be
                    thwarted, resumed his pen, and published the second part of his romance in 1605.
                    Quite unlike that of the <hi rend="italic">Lazarillo,</hi> the style of Mateo
                    Aleman of Seville is eloquent, full, with long and learned periods, sometimes
                    diffuse. Nothing could be more extravagant and more obscure than the history of
                    Justina the beggar woman <hi rend="italic">(La Picara Justina)</hi> by Francisco
                    Lopez de Ubeda (1605), an assumed name which concealed the person of the
                    Dominican Andrés Perez de Leon. The other picaresque romances are— <hi
                    rend="italic">Alonso Mozo de muchos Amos,</hi> by Geronimo de Alcalá (two parts,
                    1624 and 1626); the <hi rend="italic">Historia y Vida del Gran Tacaño Pablo de
                    Segovia</hi> (1626), in which Quevedo has made his most brilliant display of
                    style and wit; the <hi rend="italic">Garduña de Sevilla</hi> (1634) of Alonso de
                    Castillo Solorzano; <hi rend="italic">La Vida y Hechos de Estebanillo
                    Gonzalez</hi> (1646), described as <hi rend="italic">compuesto por el
                    mesmo,</hi> but an Estéban Gonzalez is unknown in the literary history of the
                    17th century.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0381-0358"/> By degrees the picaresque romance was combined
                    with the novel of Italian origin and gave rise to a new type,— half novel of
                    manners, half romance of adventure,—of which the characteristic example appears
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">Relacion de la Vida y Aventuras del Escudero Marcos
                    de Obregon</hi> (1618), by Vicente Espinel, one of the most genial and best
                    written works of the 17th century. To the same class belong almost all the
                    novels of Alonso Gerónimo de Salas Barbadillo, such as <hi rend="italic">La
                    Ingeniosa Helena, Don Diego de Noche, El Caballero puntual,</hi> &amp;c.; Luiz
                    Velez de Guevara’s <hi rend="italic">Diablo Cojuelo</hi> (1641), the model of
                    Lesage’s <hi rend="italic">Diable Boiteux;</hi> and Francisco Santos’s highly
                    popular pictures of life in Madrid, <hi rend="italic">Dia y Noche de Madrid</hi>
                    (1663), <hi rend="italic">Periquillo, el de las Gallineras,</hi> &amp;c. On the
                    contrary, the novels of Tirso de Molina (<hi rend="italic">Los Cigarrales de
                    Toledo,</hi> 1624), Perez de Montalban <hi rend="italic">(Para Todos,</hi>
                    1632), Maria de Zayas <hi rend="italic">(Novelas,</hi> 1637), are more in the
                    manner of the <hi rend="italic">Novelas Ejemplares</hi> of Cervantes, and
                    consequently of the Italian type. Among the so-called historical romances one
                    only deserves to be mentioned,—the <hi rend="italic">Guerras Civiles de
                    Granada</hi> by Gines Perez de Hita, which deals with the last years of the
                    kingdom of Granada and the insurrection of the Moors of the Alpujarras in the
                    time of Philip II. <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> the masterpiece of Miguel
                    Cervantes de Saavedra (1547-1616), is too great a work to be treated along with
                    others; and, besides, it does not fall strictly within the limits of any of the
                    classes just mentioned. If it has to be defined, it may be described as the
                    social romance of 16th and 17th century Spain. Cervantes undoubtedly owed much
                    to his predecessors, notably to the picaresque romancers, but he considerably
                    enlarged the scope of the type, and, what had as yet been done by no one,
                    supported the framework of the story by a lofty moral idea. His main purpose
                    was, as we are beginning to realize, not to turn into ridicule the books of
                    chivalry, which were already out of fashion by his time, but to show by an
                    example pushed to absurdity the danger of <hi rend="italic">hidalgism,</hi> of
                    all those deplorable prejudices of pure blood and noble race with which
                    three-fourths of the nation were imbued, and which, by the scorn of all useful
                    labour which they involved, were destined to bring Spain to ruin. The lesson is
                    all the more effective as his <hi rend="italic">hidalgo,</hi> although
                    ridiculous, was not put beyond the pale of the reader’s sympathy, and the author
                    condemns only the exaggeration of the chivalrous spirit, and not true courage
                    and devotion when these virtues have a serious object. The same thing happened
                    to <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> which had happened to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guzman de Alfarache.</hi> After the publication of the first part (1605),
                    Cervantes allowed his pen to lie too long idle; and so it occurred to some one
                    to anticipate him in the glory of completing the story of the heroic deeds of
                    the knight of La Mancha. In 1614 a second part of the adventures of Don Quixote
                    made its appearance—the work of a certain Avellaneda, a pseudonym under which
                    people have sought to recognize the inquisitor Luis de Aliaga. Cervantes was
                    thus roused from inactivity, and the following year gave to the world the true
                    second part, which soon effaced the bad impression produced by Avellaneda’s
                    heavy and exaggerated imitation.</p>
                <p>The stage in the 17th century in some measure took the place of the romances of
                    the previous age; it is, as it were, the medium of all the memories, all the
                    passions, and all the aspirations of the Spanish people. Its style, being that
                    of the popular poetry, made it accessible to the most illiterate classes, and
                    gave it an immense range of subject. From the books of the Bible, the acts of
                    the martyrs, national traditions, the chronicles of Castile and Aragon, and
                    foreign histories and novels, down to the daily incidents of contemporary
                    Spanish life, the escapades and nightly brawls of students, the gallantries of
                    the Calle</p>
                <p>Mayor and the Prado of Madrid, balcony escalades, sword thrusts and dagger
                    strokes, duels and murders, fathers befooled, jealous ladies, pilfering and
                    cowardly valets, inquisitive and sprightly waiting-maids, sly and tricky
                    peasants, fresh country girls,—all are turned to dramatic account. The enormous
                    mass of plays with which the literature of this period is inundated may be
                    divided into two great classes—a secular and a religious, the latter again
                    subdivided into (1) the liturgical play, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">auto</hi> either <hi rend="italic">sacramental</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">al nacimiento,</hi> and (2) the <hi rend="italic">comedia
                    divina</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">comedia de santos,</hi> which have no
                    liturgical element and differ from a secular play only in the fact that the
                    subject is religious, and frequently, as one of the names indicates, derived
                    from the history of a saint. In the secular drama, classification might be
                    carried almost to any extent if the nature of the subject be taken as the
                    criterion. It will be sufficient to distinguish the <hi rend="italic">comedia
                    (i.e.,</hi> any tragic or comic piece in three acts) according to the social
                    types brought on the stage, the equipment of the actors, and the artifices
                    resorted to in the representation. We have (1) the <hi rend="italic">comedia de
                    capa y espada,</hi> which represents any everyday incident, the actors belonging
                    to the middle class, simple <hi rend="italic">caballeros,</hi> and consequently
                    wearing the garb of ordinary town-life, of which the chief items were the cloak
                    and the sword, and (2) the <hi rend="italic">comedia de teatro</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">de ruido,</hi> or again <hi rend="italic">de tramoya</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">de aparencias (i.e.,</hi> the theatrical, spectacular, or scenic
                    play), which prefers kings and princes for its <hi rend="italic">dramatis
                    personae</hi> and makes a great display of mechanical devices and decorations.
                    Besides the <hi rend="italic">comedia,</hi> the classic stage has also a series
                    of little pieces subsidiary to the play proper: the <hi rend="italic">loa</hi>
                    or prologue, the <hi rend="italic">entremes,</hi> a kind of interlude which
                    afterwards developed into the <hi rend="italic">saynete,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">baile,</hi> or ballet accompanied with singing, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">zarzuela,</hi> a sort of operetta thus named after the royal
                    residence of La Zarzuela, where the kings of Spain had a theatre. As to the
                    dramatic poets of the golden age, even more numerous than the lyric poets and
                    the romancers, it is rather difficult to group them. All are more or less pupils
                    or imitators of the great chief of the new school, Lope Felix de Vega Carpio
                    (1562-1635); everything has ultimately to be brought back to him whom the
                    Spaniards call the “monster of Nature.” Among Lope’s contemporaries, only a few
                    poets of Valencia (Gaspar de Aguilar, Francisco Tarrega, Guillem de Castro
                    (1569-1631), the author of the <hi rend="italic">Mocedades del Cid</hi> (from
                    which Corneille derived his inspiration), formed a small school, as it were,
                    less subject to the master than that of Madrid, which was bound to merit the
                    applause of the public by copying as exactly as possible the manner of the great
                    initiator. Lope left his mark on all varieties of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comedia,</hi> but did not attain to equal excellence in all. He was especially
                    successful in the comedy of intrigue <hi rend="italic">(enredo),</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">capa y espada</hi> class, and in dramas whose subjects are derived
                    from national history. His great and most incontestable merit is to have given
                    the Spanish stage a range and scope of which it had not been previously thought
                    capable, and of having taught his contemporaries to find dramatic situations and
                    to carry on a plot. It is true he wrote nothing perfect: his prodigious
                    productiveness aud facility allowed him no time to mature anything; he wrote
                    negligently, and, besides, he considered the stage an inferior department, good
                    for the <hi rend="italic">vulgo,</hi> and consequently did not judge it worthy
                    of the same regard as lyric or narrative poetry borrowed from the Italians.
                    Lope’s first pupils exaggerated some of his defects, but, at the same time,
                    each, according to his own taste, widened the scope of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comedia.</hi> Antonio Mira de Amescua and Luis Velez de Guevara (died 1644)
                    were successful especially in tragic histories and <hi rend="italic">comedias
                    divinas.</hi> Fr. Gabriel Tellez (1570-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0382-0359"/> 1648), better known under the pseudonym of Tirso
                    de Molina, one of the most flexible, ingenious, and inventive of the dramatists,
                    displayed no less talent in the comedy of contemporary manners than in
                    historical drama. <hi rend="italic">El Burlador de Sevilla (Don Juan),</hi> the
                    most celebrated of his plays since the Italians and the French have taken
                    possession of the subject, is reckoned his masterpiece; but he showed himself a
                    much greater poet in <hi rend="italic">El Vergonzoso en Palacio, Don Gil de las
                    Calzas Verdes, Marta la Pia-dosa.</hi> Finally Juan Ruiz de Alarcon (died 1639),
                    the most serious and most observant of Spanish dramatic poets, successfully
                    achieved the comedy of character in <hi rend="italic">La Verdad Sospechosa,</hi>
                    closely followed by Corneille in his <hi rend="italic">Menteur.</hi> The
                    remaining play-writers hardly did anything but increase the number of the <hi
                    rend="italic">comedias</hi>; they added nothing to the real elements of the
                    drama. The second epoch of the classical drama is represented mainly by Pedro
                    Calderon de la Barca (1600-1681), the Spanish dramatist who has obtained most
                    celebrity abroad, where his pieces have been studied and admired (perhaps
                    extravagantly) by certain critics who have not feared to rank him with
                    Shakespeare. It is Calderon who first made honour, or more correctly the point
                    of honour, an essential motive in the conduct of his personages (<hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., El Medico de su Honra);</hi> it is he also who made the <hi
                    rend="italic">comedia de capa y espada</hi> uniform even to monotony, and gave
                    the comic “part” of the <hi rend="italic">gracioso</hi> (confidential valet of
                    the <hi rend="italic">caballero)</hi> a fixity which it never previously
                    possessed. There is depth and poetry in Calderon, but vagueness also and much
                    bad taste. His most philosophic drama, <hi rend="italic">La Vida es Sueno,</hi>
                    is a bold and sublime idea, but indistinct and feebly worked out; that his <hi
                    rend="italic">autos sacramentales</hi> give evidence of extensive theological
                    knowledge is all that can be said in their favour. Calderon was imitated, as
                    Lope had been, by exaggerating his manner and perverting his excellencies. Two
                    poets only of the second half of the 17th century deserve to be cited along with
                    him— Francisco de Rojas, author of the fine historic play <hi rend="italic">Del
                    Rey abajo ninguno,</hi> and Agustin Moreto (1618-1662), author of some pleasant
                    comedies. Among those who worked in secondary forms mention must be made of Luis
                    Quinones de Benavente, a skilful writer of <hi rend="italic">entremeses,</hi>
                    and in fact the greatest master of the form.</p>
                <p>A new manner of writing appears with the revival of learning: the purely
                    objective style of the old chroniclers, with their tagging on of one fact after
                    another, without showing the logical connexion or expressing any opinion on men
                    or things, begins to be thought puerile. An attempt is now made to treat the
                    history of Spain in the manner of Livy, Sallust, Tacitus, whose methods of
                    narration were directly adopted. The 16th century, however, still presents
                    certain chroniclers of the mediaeval type, with more erudition, precision, and a
                    beginning of the critical element. <hi rend="italic">La Crónica General de
                    Espana</hi> by Ambrosio de Morales, the <hi rend="italic">Compendio
                    Historial</hi> of Estéban de Garibai, the <hi rend="italic">Historia General de
                    las Indias Occidentales</hi> by Antonio de'Herrera, are, as far as the style is
                    concerned, continuations of the last chronicles of Castile. Geronimo de Zurita
                    (1512-1580) is emphatically a scholar; no one in the 16th century knew as he did
                    how to turn to account documents and records for the purpose of completing and
                    correcting the narratives of the ancient chronicles; his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anales de la Corona de Aragon</hi> is a book of great value, though written in
                    a painful style. With Juan de Mariana (1536-1623) history ceases to be a mere
                    compilation of facts or a work of pure erudition, in order to become a work of
                    art and of thought. The <hi rend="italic">Historia de Espana</hi> by the
                    celebrated Jesuit, at first written in Latin in the interest especially of
                    foreigners, was afterwards rendered by its author into excellent Castilian; as a
                    general survey of its history, well-planned, well written, and well thought out,
                    Spain possesses nothing that can be compared with it; it is eminently a national
                    work, steeped throughout in the prejudices of the race. Various works of less
                    extent,— accounts of more or less important episodes in the history of
                    Spain,—may take their place beside Mariana’s great monument: for example, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Guerra de Granada</hi> by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (a history
                    of the revolt of the Moors of the Alpujarras under Philip II.), written about
                    1572, immediately after the events, but not published till about thirty years
                    later, after the author’s death; the narrative of the expedition of the Catalans
                    in the Morea in the 14th century by Francisco de Moncada (died 1635); that of
                    the revolt of the same Catalans under the reign of Philip IV. by Francisco
                    Manuel de Melo (died 1666), a Portuguese by birth; and that of the conquest of
                    Mexico by Antonio de Solis. Each of these writers has been more or less inspired
                    by some Latin author, one preferring Livy, another Sallust, &amp;c. These
                    imitations, it must be admitted, have something artificial and stilted, which in
                    the long run proves as fatiguing as the unskilfulness and heaviness of the
                    chroniclers of the Middle Ages. On the other hand, the historians of the wars of
                    Flanders, such as Carlos Coloma, Bernardino de Mendoza, Alonso Vazquez,
                    Francisco Verdugo, are less refined, and for that very reason are more vivid and
                    more thoroughly interest us in that struggle of the two races, so foreign to
                    each other and of such different genius. As for the accounts of the
                    trans-Atlantic discoveries and conquests, they are of two kinds,—either (1)
                    memoirs of the actors or witnesses of those great dramas, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva
                    Espana</hi> by Bernal Diaz del Castillo, one of the companions of Cortes, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Historia de las Indias</hi> by P. Bartolomé de las Casas,
                    the apostle of the Indians; or (2) works by professional writers, such as
                    Francisco Lopez de Gomara,—official historiographers who wrote in Spain on
                    information sent to them from the newly-discovered lands.</p>
                <p>Letter writers, a rather numerous body in Spanish literature, are nearly related
                    to the historians; in fact, letters written to be read by others than the
                    persons addressed, or in any case revised afterwards, are only another method, a
                    little more familiar, of writing history. Fernando del Pulgar appended to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Claros Varones</hi> a series of letters on the affairs of his
                    time; and at the commencement of the 16th century Antonio de Guevara (died 1545)
                    collected, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Epistolas Familiares,</hi> his
                    correspondence with his contemporaries, which throws a great light on the early
                    part of the reign of Charles V., although it must be used with caution because
                    of the numerous <hi rend="italic">rifaciamentos</hi> it has undergone. A
                    celebrated victim of Philip IL, Antonio Perez (died 1611), revenged himself on
                    his master by relating in innumerable letters, addressed during his exile to his
                    friends and protectors, all the incidents of his disgrace, and by selling to the
                    ministers of France and England the secrets of the Spanish policy in which he
                    had a hand; some of these letters are little masterpieces of sprightliness and
                    gallantry.</p>
                <p>Philosophy is rather poorly represented in the 16th and 17th centuries in the
                    literature of the vernacular. The greater number of the Spanish thinkers of this
                    epoch, whatever the school to which they belonged,·—scholastic, Platonic,
                    Aristotelian, or independent,—wrote in Latin. Ascetic and mystical authors alone
                    made use of the vulgar tongue for the readier diffusion of their doctrine among
                    the illiterate, from whose ranks a good number of their disciples were
                    recruited. Fr. Luis de Granada (died 1588) the great preacher, Juan de la Cruz
                    (1542-1591), Fr. Luis de Leon (1528—1598), Teresa de Jesus (1515-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0383-0360"/> 1582), and Malon de Chaide are the brighter
                    lights of this class of writers. Some of their books, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guia de Pecadores</hi> of Fr. Luis de Granada, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions</hi> of St Teresa, Malon de Chaide’s <hi rend="italic">Conversion
                    of the Magdalen,</hi> have obtained a brilliant and lasting success beyond the
                    limits of the Peninsula, and have not been without some influence on the
                    development of mysticism in France. The Spanish mystics are not only remarkable
                    for the depth or subtlety of their thoughts and the intensity of the divine love
                    with which they are inspired; many of them are masters of style; some, like Juan
                    de la Cruz, have composed verses which rank with the most delicate in the
                    language. A notable fact is that those men who are regarded as illuminati
                    profess the most practical ideas in the matter of morality. Nothing is more
                    sensible, nothing less ecstatic, than the manual of domestic economy by Fr. Luis
                    de Leon— <hi rend="italic">La Perfecta Casada.</hi> Lay moralists are very
                    numerous in the 16th and 17th centuries. Some write long and heavy treatises on
                    the art of governing, the education of princes, the duties of subjects, &amp;c.
                    Pedro Fernandez de Navarrete’s <hi rend="italic">Conservacion de
                    Monarquias,</hi> Diego de Saavedra Faxardo’s <hi rend="italic">Idea de un
                    Principe Cristiano,</hi> Quevedo’s <hi rend="italic">La Politica de Dios y
                    Gobierno de Cristo,</hi> give a correct idea of the ability which the Spaniards
                    have displayed in this kind of didactic and preceptorial literature,—ability of
                    no high order, for the Spaniard, when he means to teach and work out a doctrine,
                    loses himself in distinctions and rapidly becomes diffuse, pedantic, and
                    obscure. But there is a kind of morality in which he indubitably excels, namely,
                    in social satire, which, under all its forms,—dialogue and dream in the style of
                    Lucian, epistle after the manner of Juvenal, or pamphlet,—has produced several
                    masterpieces and a host of ingenious, caustic, and amusing compositions. Juan de
                    Valdes, the most celebrated of the Spanish Protestants, led the way by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogo de Mercurio y Caron,</hi> where all the great political
                    and religious questions of the first half of the 16th century are discussed and
                    resolved with admirable vigour and freedom. The king in the department of social
                    satire, as in those of literary and political satire, is Quevedo. Nothing
                    escapes his scrutinizing spirit and pitiless irony. All the vices of the society
                    of his time are, in his <hi rend="italic">Suen,os</hi> and many other little
                    pamphlets, remorselessly placed in the pillory and cruelly cut to pieces. While
                    this great satirist, in philosophy a disciple of Seneca, imitates his master
                    even in his style of writing, he is none the less one of the most vigorous and
                    original writers of the 17th century. The only serious defect in his style is
                    that it is too full, not of figures and epithets, but of thoughts. His phrases
                    are of set purpose charged with a double meaning, and we are never sure on
                    reading whether we have taken in all that the author meant to convey. <hi
                    rend="italic">Conceptism</hi> is the name that has been given to this refinement
                    of thought, which was doomed in time to fall into the ambiguous and equivocal;
                    it must not be confounded with the <hi rend="italic">cultism</hi> of Góngora,
                    the artifice of which lies solely in the choice and arrangement of words. This
                    new school, of which Quevedo may be regarded as the founder, had its Boileau in
                    the person of Baltasar Gracian, who in 1642 published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agudeza y Arte de Ingenio,</hi> in which all the subtleties of conceptism are
                    very exactly reduced to a code. Gracian, who had the gift of sententious
                    moralizing rather than of satire, produced in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criticon</hi> animated pictures of the society of his own day, while he also
                    displayed much ingenuity in little collections of political and moral aphorisms
                    which have procured him a great reputation abroad,— <hi rend="italic">El Heroe,
                    El Politico Fernando el Catolico, Oraculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia.</hi></p>
                <p>Spanish thought as well as public spirit and all other forms of national activity
                    began to decline towards the close of the 17th century. The advent of the house
                    of Bourbon, and the increasing invasion of French influence in the domain of
                    politics as well as in literature and science, confirmed this decay by rendering
                    abortive the efforts of a few writers who had remained faithful to the pure
                    Spanish tradition. In the hands of the second-rate imitators of Calderon the
                    stage sank ever lower and lower; lyric poetry, already compromised by the pomp
                    and galimatias of Góngora, was abandoned to wretched rhymsters, who tried
                    without success to make up by extravagance of style for meanness of thought. In
                    a word, everything was suffering from anaemia. The first symptoms, not of a
                    revival, but of a certain resumption of intellectual production appear in the
                    department of linguistic study. In 1714 there was created, on the model of the
                    French academies, La Real Academia Española, intended to maintain the purity of
                    the language and to correct its abuses. This Academy set itself at once to work,
                    and in 1726 was able to commence the publication of its dictionary in six
                    volumes folio, the best title of this association to the gratitude of men of
                    letters. The <hi rend="italic">Gramatica de la Lengua Castellana,</hi> drawn up
                    by the Academy, did not appear till 1771. For the new ideas which were
                    introduced into Spain as the result of more intimate relations with France, and
                    which were in many cases repugnant to a nation for two centuries accustomed to
                    live a self-contained life, it was necessary that fully sanctioned patrons
                    should be found. D. Ignacio de Luzan, well read in the literatures of Italy and
                    France, a disciple of Boileau and the French rhetoricians, yet not without some
                    originality of his own, undertook in his <hi rend="italic">Poetica</hi> (1737)
                    to expound to his fellow-countrymen the rules of the new school, and, above all,
                    the principle of the famous “unities” accepted by the French stage from
                    Corneille’s day onward. What Luzan had done for letters, Benito Feyjoo
                    (1676-1764), a Benedictine of good sense and great learning, did for the
                    sciences. His <hi rend="italic">Teatro Critico</hi> (1726-1729) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cartas Erúditas y Curiosas</hi> (1742-1760), collections of
                    dissertations in almost every department of human knowledge, introduced the
                    Spaniards to the leading scientific discoveries of foreign countries, and helped
                    to deliver them from many superstitions and absurd prejudices. The study of the
                    ancient classics and the department of learned research in the domain of
                    national histories and literatures had an eminent representative in Gregorio
                    Mayans y Siscar (died 1782), who worthily carried on the great traditions of the
                    renaissance; besides publishing good editions of old Spanish authors, he gave to
                    the world in 1757 a <hi rend="italic">Retórica</hi> which is still worth
                    consulting and a number of learned memoirs. What may be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">littérature d'agrément</hi> did not recover much lost ground; it
                    would seem as if the vein had been exhausted. Something of the old picaresque
                    novel came to life again in the <hi rend="italic">Historia del Famoso Predicador
                    Fray Gerundio de Campazas</hi> of the Jesuit José Francisco de Isla, a
                    biographical romance which is also and above all—to the detriment, it is true,
                    of the interest of the narrative—a satire on the follies of the preachers of the
                    day; the history of Fray Gerundio is merely a pretext, as it were, for
                    displaying and holding up to ridicule the eloquence of the pulpit at the sorry
                    pass to which it had then been brought by the ignorance and bad taste of the
                    Spanish clergy. Isla is known also by his translation of <hi rend="italic">Gil
                    Blas,</hi> a work which he professed to restore to his native country, trying to
                    make out—unsuccessfully, of course—that Le Sage had no other merit than that of
                    rendering it into French. The lyric poetry of this period is very pale and
                    colourless when compared with its dazzling splendour in the preceding century.
                    Nevertheless one or two poets can be named who were possessed of refinement of
                    taste, and whose<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0384-0361"/> collections of verse, though wanting in genuine
                    inspiration, at least show respect for the language and will always meet with
                    some appreciation. At the head of the new school is Juan Menendez Valdés
                    (1754-1817), and with his are associated the names of P. Diego Gonzales (1733-
                    1794), José Iglesias de la Casa (1748-1791), known especially by his <hi
                    rend="italic">letrillas,</hi> Nicasio Alvarez de Cienfuegos (1764-1809), and
                    some others. Among the verse writers of the 18th century who produced odes and
                    didactic poetry it is only necessary to mention Leandro Fernandez de Moratin
                    (1760-1828) and Manuel José Quintana (1772-1857), but the latter belongs rather
                    to the present century, during the first half of which he published his most
                    important works. The poverty of the period in lyric poetry is even exceeded by
                    that of the stage. Here no kind of comedy or tragical drama arose to take the
                    place of the ancient <hi rend="italic">comedia,</hi> whose platitudes and
                    absurdities of thought and expression had ended by disgusting even the least
                    exacting portion of the public. The attempt was indeed made to introduce the
                    comedy and the tragedy of France, but the stiff and pedantic adaptations of such
                    writers as Agustin de Montiano y Luyando (1697-1764), Tomas de Iriarte
                    (1750-1791), Garcia de la Huerta, and the well-known economist Gaspar de
                    Jovellanos (1744- 1811) were unable to interest the great mass of playgoers. The
                    only one who was really successful in composing on the French pattern some
                    pleasant comedies, which owe much of their charm to the great purity of the
                    language in which they are written, is Leandro Fernandez de Moratin; his best
                    pieces are <hi rend="italic">La Nueva Comedia,</hi> a parody on the extravagant
                    work of Comella, a playwright of the period, <hi rend="italic">El Viejo y la
                    Niña, El Baron,</hi> and particularly <hi rend="italic">El Si de las Ninas.</hi>
                    It has to be added that the <hi rend="italic">saynete</hi> was cultivated in the
                    18th century by one writer of genuine talent, Ramon de la Cruz; nothing helps us
                    better to an acquaintance with the curious Spanish society of the reign of
                    Charles IV. than the intermezzos of this genial and light-hearted author.</p>
                <p>The terrible struggle of the War of Independence (1808-1814), which was destined
                    to have such important consequences in the world of politics, did not exert any
                    immediate influence on the literature of Spain. One might have expected as a
                    consequence of the rising of the whole nation against Napoleon that Spanish
                    writers would have given up seeking their inspiration from those of France, and
                    would have tried to resume the national traditions which had been broken at the
                    end of the 17th century. But nothing of the sort occurred. Not only the <hi
                    rend="italic">afrancesados</hi> (as those were called who had accepted the new
                    régime), but also the most ardent partisans of the patriotic cause, continued in
                    literature to be the submissive disciples of France. Quintana, who in his
                    inflammatory odes preached to his compatriots the duty of resistance and
                    revenge, has nothing of the innovator about him; by his education and by his
                    literary doctrines he remains a man of the 18th century. The same may be said of
                    Francisco Martinez de la Rosa (1789-1848), who, however, from his intercourse
                    with Horace, whom he translated with skill into good Castilian verse, had a
                    greater independence of spirit and a more highly trained and classical taste.
                    And, when romanticism begins to find its way into Spain and to enter into
                    conflict with the spirit and habits of the 18th century, it is still to France
                    that the poets and prose writers of the new school turn, much more than either
                    to England or to Germany. The first decidedly romantic poet of the generation
                    which flourished about 1830 was the duke of Rivas, Angel de Saavedra
                    (1791-1856); no one succeeded better in reconciling the genius of Spain and the
                    tendencies of modern poetry; his epic poem <hi rend="italic">El Moro
                    Esposito</hi> and his drama of <hi rend="italic">Don Alvaro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ó la Fuerza del Sino</hi> belong as much to the old romances and
                    old theatre of Spain as to the romantic spirit of 1830. On the other hand, José
                    de Espronceda (1808-1842), who has sometimes been called the Spanish Musset,
                    savours much less of the soil than the duke of Rivas; he is a quite cosmopolitan
                    romanticist of the school of Byron and the French imitators of Byron; an
                    exclusively lyric poet, he did not live long enough to give full proof of his
                    genius, but what he has left is certainly exquisite. José Zorrilla (born 1817)
                    has a more flexible and exuberant but much more unequal talent than Espronceda,
                    and if the latter has written too little it cannot but be regretted that the
                    former should have produced too much; nevertheless, among a multitude of hasty
                    performances, brought out before they had been matured, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Don Juan Tenorio,</hi> a new and fantastic version of the legend treated by
                    Tirso de Molina and Molière, will always remain as one of the most curious
                    specimens of Spanish romanticism. In the dramatic literature of this period it
                    is noticeable that the tragedy more than the comedy is modelled on the examples
                    furnished by the French drama of the Restoration; thus, if we leave out of
                    account the play of Garcia Gutierrez (born 1813) entitled <hi rend="italic">El
                    Trovador,</hi> which inspired the well-known opera of Verdi, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Los Amantes de Teruel</hi> of Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch (born
                    1806), and a few others, all the dramatic work belonging to this date recalls
                    more or less the manner of the professional playwrights of the boulevard
                    theatres, while on the other hand the comedy of manners still preserves a
                    certain originality and a genuine local colour. Manuel Breton de los Herreros
                    (1796-1873), who wrote as many as a hundred comedies, some of them of the first
                    order after their kind, apart from the fact of their being written in language
                    of great excellence, adheres with great fidelity to the tradition of the 17th
                    century; he is the last of those writers who have preserved the feeling of the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">comedia.</hi> One prose writer of the highest talent
                    must be mentioned along with Espronceda, with whom he has in the moral aspect
                    several features in common,—namely, D. José de Larra (1809-1837), so famous by
                    his pseudonym of “Figaro,” with which he signed the greater number of his works.
                    Caustic in temper, of a keenly observant spirit, remarkably sober and clear as a
                    writer, he was specially successful in the political pamphlet, the <hi
                    rend="italic">article d’actualités;</hi> to this category belong his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cartas de un Pobrecito Hablador,</hi> in which he ridicules
                    without pity the vices and oddities of his contemporaries; his reputation is
                    much more largely due to these letters than either to his somewhat feeble play
                    of <hi rend="italic">Macias</hi> or to his not very attractive novel <hi
                    rend="italic">El Doncel de Enrique el Doliente.</hi> With Larra must be
                    associated two other humoristic writers. The first of these is Ramon Mesonero
                    Romanos, “El Curioso Parlante” (born 1803), whose <hi rend="italic">Escenas
                    Matritenses,</hi> although not possessed of the literary value of Larra’s
                    articles, give pleasure by their good-natured gaiety and by the curious details
                    they furnish with regard to the contemporary society of Madrid. The other is
                    Serafin Estébanez Calderon, “El Solitario” (1799-1867), who in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Escenas Andaluzes</hi> sought to revive the manner of the
                    satirical and picaresque writers of the 17th century; in a uselessly archaic
                    language of his own, patched up from fragments taken from Cervantes, Quevedo,
                    and others, he has delineated with a peculiar but somewhat artificial grace
                    various piquant scenes of Andalusian or Madrilenian life. The most prominent
                    literary critics belonging to the first generation of the century were Alberto
                    Lista (1775-1848), whose critical doctrine may be described as a compromise
                    between the ideas of French classicism and those of the romantic school, and
                    Agustin Duran (died 1862), who made it his special task to restore to honour the
                    old literature of Castile, particularly its<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0385-0362"/> romances, which he had studied with unequalled
                    thoroughness, and of which he published highly esteemed collections.</p>
                <p>If the struggle between classicists and romanticists continued even after 1830,
                    and continued to divide the literary world into two opposing camps, it is plain
                    that the new generation—that which occupied the scene from 1840 till about
                    1868—had other preoccupations. The triumph of the new ideas is now assured; only
                    a few reactionaries are still seen to cling to the principles bequeathed by the
                    18th century. What was now being aimed at was the creation of a new literature
                    which should be truly national and no longer a mere echo of that beyond the
                    Pyrenees. To the question whether contemporary Spain has indeed succeeded in
                    calling into existence such a literature, we may well hesitate to give an
                    affirmative answer. It is true that in every species of composition, the gravest
                    as well as the lightest, it can show works of genuine talent; but many of them
                    are strikingly deficient in originality; all of them either bear unmistakable
                    traces of imitation of foreign models, or show (more or less happily) the
                    imprint of the older literature of the 17th century, to which the historical
                    criticism of Duran and the labours of various other scholars had given a flavour
                    of novelty. With this observation before him, the student can divide the authors
                    of this period into two groups,—the one composed of those who, won by modern
                    ideas, are more or less liberal in politics, and draw their inspiration in all
                    they write from France or from what they are able to assimilate of other
                    literatures through France; the other consisting of ultra-conservatives, whose
                    dream in every sphere—letters, art, and politics—is the restoration of the Spain
                    of the past. Nowhere does this antagonism manifest itself more clearly than in
                    the drama. A play of Aureliano Fernandez Guerra might have been conceived and
                    written by a contemporary of Lope or of Calderon, while a comedy of Adelardo
                    Lopez de Ayala is moulded in the pattern given by the younger Dumas and by
                    Augier. In the department of romance, on the other hand—much neglected by the
                    writers of the first half of the century— the Spaniards have recovered something
                    of the genius of Cervantes and their 17th century <hi rend="italic">novelas
                    picarescas.</hi> The art of constructing a story and of telling it in an
                    agreeable way, which seemed for a long time to have been lost, is recovered in
                    such authors as Fernan Caballero, Antonio de Trueba, Pedro Antonio de Alarcon,
                    Juan Valera, Perez Galdos, and Pereda. These novelists are far from alike in
                    method or in spirit; how widely separated, for example, are the somewhat banal
                    facility and the sentimental catholicism of Fernan Caballero on the one hand,
                    and the searching psychological analysis and the fine scepticism of Juan Valera
                    on the other. But all have this in common, that they understand how to interest
                    their readers, and how to make their characters live and speak. Incontestably
                    the novel is the triumph of contemporary Spanish literature; it is almost the
                    only kind of composition that actually lives with a life of its own and makes
                    steady progress. One cannot say as much of lyric poetry, represented feebly
                    enough by Ramon de Campoamor, Nunez de Arce, and some others. Deficient
                    inspiration, diffuseness of style, and want of precision in language
                    characterize them all; it is unfortunately very easy to make mediocre verses in
                    Spanish, and too many people give themselves over to the pursuit. Passing from
                    the literature of amusement, we have still some very distinguished names to
                    enumerate. Philosophy, indeed, has but one representative of merit, the
                    traditionalist Jaime Balmes,—for the Krausist school, an importation from
                    Germany, may be ignored here,— but history and literary criticism have been
                    cultivated during the last thirty years or so with genuine success. Modesto
                    Lafuente is in some sort the Mariana of the 19th century; much inferior as a
                    writer to the celebrated Jesuit, he has, however, always manifested the same
                    passion for his subject, the same persevering determination to raise a worthy
                    monument of his fatherland; his <hi rend="italic">Historia de Espana,</hi> in
                    spite of all its defects, deserves respect, and is at least readable. Although
                    primarily a politician, Antonio Cánovas del Castillo has many of the qualities
                    which go to the making of a good historian; he has evinced greater acuteness and
                    larger acquirements than Lafuente, and his <hi rend="italic">Ensayo sobre la
                    Casa de Austria en Espana,</hi> founded upon a careful examination of a large
                    number of documents, gives evidence of a correct judgment and praiseworthy
                    impartiality. The literary history of old Spain has been treated in a masterly
                    manner by Aureliano Fernandez Guerra in various studies devoted to the great
                    writers of the 17th century, notably Quevedo, and also quite recently by a young
                    and talented scholar, Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia de las Ideas Estéticas en Espana,</hi> a work as solid in its
                    substance as it is pure in its style, would do honour to any veteran in
                    literature. As regards criticism of contemporary literature, no one shows more
                    spirit and taste than Juan Valera, whose delicate Andalusian nature has been
                    matured by a refining education and by an adequate knowledge of foreign
                    literatures.</p>

                    Boston, 1872, 3 vols. 8vo), a work of solid value, especially from the
                    bibliographical point of view; it is quite indispensable that the reader should
                    consult also the Spanish translation by D. Pascual de Gayangos and Enrique de
                    Vedia (Madrid, 1851-56) and the German translation of Julius with some important
                    additions by Ferdinand Wolf (Leipsic, 1852-67). Nothing can be said in favour of
                    the French translation by J. G. Magnabal (Paris, 1864- 72). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia Critica de la Literatura Espanola</hi> of José Amador de
                    los Bios (Madrid, 1861-65, 7 vols. 8vo), although deficient in criticism and
                    full of errors in fact, supplies some useful information as to the period prior
                    to the 15th century, with which it exclusively deals. Menendez Pelayo’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia de las Ideas Estéticas en Espana</hi> (Madrid, 1884-86, 3
                    vols. 8vo), already referred to, is very instructive. For the 18th century,
                    Leopoldo A. de Cueto’s “Bosquejo Histórico-Crítico de la Poesia Castellana en el
                    Siglo xviii.,” prefixed to the first vol. of Rivadeneyra’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poetas Líricos del Siglo xviii.,</hi> is indispensable. For the 19th century
                    there is not as yet any satisfactory work dealing with the literature as a
                    whole; that of M. G. Hubbard, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Littérature
                    Contemporaine en Espagne</hi> (Paris, 1876, 1 vol. 8vo), although superficial
                    and inaccurate, is useful in the absence of anything better. Some descriptions
                    of Castilian literature have been specially studied with care and competence,
                    notably the drama, on which we have two thorough works,—Frederick von Schack’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der dramatischen Literatur u. Kunst in Spanien</hi>
                    (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1846-54, 3 vols. 8vo), unfortunately now much
                    behindhand, and in no way improved in this respect in the Spanish translation
                    now in course of publication at Madrid under the superintendence of Eduardo de
                    Mier, and Cayetano Alberto de la Barrera’s excellent <hi rend="italic">Catalogo

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Catalan Literature.</hi> —Although the Catalan language
                    is simply a branch of the southern Gallo-Roman, the literature, in its origin at
                    least, ought to be considered as a mere appendix of that of Provence. Nay more,
                    until about the second half of the 13th century there existed in the Catalan
                    districts no other literature than the Provençal, and the poets of north-eastern
                    Spain used no other language than that of the troubadours. Guillem de Bergadan,
                    Uc de Mataplana, Ramon Vidal de Besalú, Guillem de Cervera, Serveri de Gerona,
                    and several other verse writers of a still more recent date are all genuine
                    Provençal poets, in the same sense as are those of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n386/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0386-0363"/> Limousin, Quercy, or Auvergne, since they write
                    in the <hi rend="italic">langue d'oc</hi> and make use of all the forms of
                    poetry cultivated by the troubadours north of the Pyrenees. Ramon Vidal (end of
                    12th century and beginning of 13th) was a grammarian as well as a poet; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rasos de Trobar</hi> became the code for the Catalan poetry
                    written in Provençal, which he called <hi rend="italic">Lemosi,</hi> a name
                    still kept up in Spain to designate, not the literary idiom of the troubadours
                    only, but also the local idiom—Catalan,—which the Spaniards choose to consider
                    as derived from the former. The influence of R. Vidal and other grammarians of
                    his school, as well as that of the troubadours we have named, lasted for a very
                    long time; and even after Catalan prose—an exact reflexion of the spoken
                    language of the south-east of the Pyrenees—had given evidence of its vitality in
                    some considerable works, the Catalan poetry remained faithful to the Provençal
                    tradition. From the combination of spoken Catalan with the literary language of
                    the troubadours there arose a sort of composite idiom, which has some analogy
                    with the Franco-Italian current in certain parts of Italy in the Middle Ages,
                    although in the one case the elements of the mixture are more distinctly
                    apparent than are the romance of France and the romance of Italy in the other.
                    The poetical works of Raymond Lully (Ramon Lull) (died 1315) are among the
                    oldest examples of this Provençalized Catalan; one has only to read the fine
                    piece entitled <hi rend="italic">Lo Desconort</hi> (“Despair ”), or some of his
                    stanzas on religious subjects, to apprehend at once the eminently composite
                    nature of that language. Muntaner in like manner, whose prose is exactly that
                    spoken by his contemporaries, becomes troubadour when he writes in verse; his
                    <hi rend="italic">Sermó</hi> on the conquest of Sardinia and Corsica (1323),
                    introduced into his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> of the kings of Aragon,
                    exhibits linguistically quite the same mixed character as is found in Lully, or,
                    we may venture to say, in all the Catalan verse writers of the 14th century.
                    These are not very numerous, nor are their works of any great merit. The
                    majority of their compositions consist of what were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >noves rimades,</hi> that is, stories in octosyllabic verse in rhymed couplets.
                    There exist poems of this class by Pere March, by a certain Torrella, by Bernat
                    Metge (an author more celebrated for his prose), and by others whose names we do
                    not know; among the works belonging to this last category special mention ought
                    to be made of a version of the romance of the <hi rend="italic">Seven
                    Sages,</hi> a translation of a book on good breeding entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Facetus,</hi> aud certain tales where, by the choice of subjects, by various
                    borrowings, aud even occasionally by the wholesale introduction of pieces of
                    French poetry, it is clearly evident that the writers of Catalonia understood
                    and read the <hi rend="italic">langue d'oui.</hi> Closely allied to the <hi
                    rend="italic">noves rimades</hi> is another analogous form of versification—that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">codo-lada,</hi> consisting of a series of verses of
                    eight and four syllables, rhyming in pairs, still made use of in one portion of
                    the Catalan domain (Majorca).</p>
                <p>The 15th century is the golden age of Catalan poetry. At the instigation and
                    under the auspices of John I. (1387-1395), Martin I. (1395-1410), and Ferdinand
                    I. (1410-1416), kings of Aragon, there was founded at Barcelona a consistory of
                    the “Gay Saber,” on the model of that of Toulouse, and this official protection
                    accorded to poetry was the beginning of a new style much more emancipated from
                    Provençal influence. It cannot be denied, indeed, that its forms are still of
                    foreign importation, that the Catalan verse writers accept the prescriptions of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Leys d'Amor</hi> of Guillaume Molinier, and the names
                    which they gave to their <hi rend="italic">cobles</hi> (stanzas) are all
                    borrowed from the same <hi rend="italic">art de trobar</hi> of the school of
                    Toulouse; but, a very noteworthy fact, their language begins to rid itself more
                    and more of Provençalisms and tends to become the same as that of prose and of
                    ordinary conversation. With Pere and Jaume March, Jordi de Sant Jordi, Johan de
                    Masdovelles, Francesch Ferrer, Pere Torroella, Pau de Bellviure, Antoni
                    Vallmanya, and, above all, the Valencian Auzias March (died 1459), there
                    flourished a new school, of which the éclat lasted till the end of the 15th
                    century, and which, as regards the form of its versification, is distinguished
                    by its almost exclusive employment of eight-verse <hi rend="italic">cobles</hi>
                    of ten syllables, each with “crossed” or “chained” rhymes (<hi rend="italic"
                    >cobla crohada</hi> or <hi rend="italic">encade-nada),</hi> each composition
                    ending with a <hi rend="italic">tornada</hi> of four verses, in the first of
                    which the “device” <hi rend="italic">(divis</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >senyal)</hi> of the poet is given out. The greater number of these poems are
                    still unedited or have only recently been extracted from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cançoners,</hi> where they had been collected in the 15th century. Auzias March
                    alone, the most inspired, the most profound, but also the most obscure of the
                    whole group, had the honour to be printed in the 16th century; his <hi
                    rend="italic">cants d’amor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cants de mort</hi> contain
                    the finest verses ever written in Catalan, but the poet fails to keep up to his
                    own high level, and by his studied obscurity occasionally becomes unintelligible
                    to such a degree that one of his editors accuses him of having written in
                    Basque. Of a wholly different class, and in quite another spirit, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Libre de les Dones</hi> of Jaume Roig (died 1478), a Valencian
                    also, like March; this long poem is a <hi rend="italic">nova rimada,</hi> only
                    <hi rend="italic">comediada,</hi> that is to say, it is in quadrisyllabic
                    instead of octosyllabic verse. A bitter and caustic satire upon women, it
                    purports to be a true history,—the history of the poet himself and of his three
                    unhappy marriages in particular. Notwithstanding its author’s allegations,
                    however, the <hi rend="italic">Libre de les Dones</hi> does not seem to be other
                    than a fiction; but it derives a very piquant interest from its really authentic
                    element, its vivid picture of the Valencia of the 15th century and the details
                    of the manners of that time. After this bright period of efflorescence Catalan
                    poetry rapidly fell off, a decline due more to the force of circumstances than
                    to any fault of the poets. The union of Aragon with Castile, and the resulting
                    predominance of Castilian throughout Spain, inflicted a death blow on Catalan
                    literature, especially on its artistic poetry, a kind of composition more ready
                    than any other to avail itself of the triumphant idiom which soon came to be
                    regarded by men of letters as the only noble one, and alone fit to be the
                    vehicle of elevated or refined thoughts. The fact that a Catalan, Juan Boscan,
                    inaugurates in the Castilian language a new kind of poetry, and that the
                    Castilians themselves regard him as the head of a school, is important and
                    characteristic; the date of the publication of the works of Boscan (1543) marks
                    the end of Catalan poetry.</p>
                <p>The earliest prose works in Catalan are later indeed than the poems of the oldest
                    Catalan troubadours of the Provençal school, not dating farther back than from
                    the close of the 13th century, but they have the advantage of being entirely
                    original; their language is the very language of the soil which we see appearing
                    in charters from about the time of the accession of James I. (1213). This is
                    true especially of the chronicles, a little less so of the other writings,
                    which, like the poetry, have difficulty in escaping the influence of the more
                    polished dialect of the country to the north of the Pyrenees. Its chronicles are
                    the best ornament of mediaeval Catalan prose. Four of them,—that of James I.,
                    apparently reduced to writing a little after his death (1276) with the help of
                    memoirs dictated by himself during his lifetime; that of Bernat Des Clot, which
                    deals chiefly with the reign of Pedro III. of Aragon (1276-1286); that of Ramon
                    Muntaner (first half of the 14th century), relating at length the expedition of
                    the Catalan company to the Morea and the conquest<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0387-0364"/> of Sardinia by James II.; finally that of Pedro
                    IV., The Ceremonious (1336-1387), genuine commentaries of that astute monarch,
                    arranged by certain officials of his court, notably by Bernat Des Coll,—these
                    four works are distinguished alike by the artistic skill of their narration and
                    by the quality of their language; it would not be too much to liken these
                    Catalan chroniclers, and Muntaner especially, to Villehardouin, Joinville, and
                    Froissart. The Doctor Illuminatus, Raymond Lully, whose acquaintance with Latin
                    was very poor,—his philosophical works were done into that language by his
                    disciples,—wrote in a somewhat Provençalized Catalan various moral and
                    propagandist works,—the romance <hi rend="italic">Blanquerna</hi> in praise of
                    the solitary life, the <hi rend="italic">Libre de les Maravelles,</hi> into
                    which is introduced a “bestiary” taken by the author from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kalilah and Dimnay,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Libre del Orde de
                    Cavalleria,</hi> a manual of the perfect knight, besides a variety of other
                    treatises and opuscula of minor importance. The majority of the writings of
                    Lully exist in two versions,—one in the vernacular, which is his own, the other
                    in Latin, originating with his disciples, who desired to give currency
                    throughout Christendom to their master’s teachings. Lully—who was very popular
                    in the lay world, although the clergy had a low opinion of him and in the 15th
                    century even set themselves to obtain a condemnation of his works by the
                    Inquisition—had a rival in the person of Francesch Ximenez or Eximeniz, a
                    Franciscan, born at Gerona some time after 1350. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crestiá</hi> (printed in 1483-84) is a vast encyclopaedia of theology, morals,
                    and politics for the use of the laity, supplemented in various aspects by his
                    three other works— <hi rend="italic">Vida de Jesu Christ, Libre dels
                    Angels,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Libre de les Dones</hi>; the last-named,
                    which is at once a book of devotion and a manual of domestic economy, contains a
                    number of curious details as to a Catalan woman’s manner of life and the luxury
                    of the period. Lully and Eximeniz are the only Catalan authors of the 14th
                    century whose works written in a vulgar tongue had the honour of being
                    translated into French shortly after their appearance.</p>
                <p>We have chiefly translators and historians in the 15th century. Antoni Canals, a
                    Dominican, who belongs also to the previous century, translates into Catalan
                    Valerius Maximus and a treatise of St Bernard; Bernat Metge, himself well-versed
                    in Italian literature, presents some of its great masters to his countrymen by
                    translating the <hi rend="italic">Griselidis</hi> of Petrarch, and also by
                    composing <hi rend="italic">Lo Sompni</hi> (“The Dream”), in which the influence
                    of Dante, of Boccaccio, and, generally speaking, of the Italy of the 13th and
                    14th centuries is very perceptible. The <hi rend="italic">Feyts d'Armes de
                    Catalunya</hi> of Bernat Boades, a knightly chronicle brought to a close in
                    1420, reveals a spirit of research and a conscientiousness in the selection of
                    materials which are truly remarkable for the age in which it was written. On the
                    other hand, Pere Tomich, in his <hi rend="italic">Histomes é Conquestes del
                    Reyalme d'Aragó</hi> (1438), carries us back too much to the manner of the
                    mediaeval chroniclers; his credulity knows no bounds, while his style has
                    altogether lost the naive charm of that of Muntaner. To the list of authors who
                    represent the leading tendencies of the literature of the 15th century we must
                    add the name of Johanot Martorell, a Valencian, author of the celebrated romance
                    of chivalry <hi rend="italic">Tirant lo Blanch</hi> (finished in 1460), which
                    the reader has nowadays some difficulty in regarding as that “treasury of
                    contentment” which Cervantes will have it to be.</p>
                <p>With the loss of political was bound to coincide that of literary independence in
                    the Catalonian countries. Catalan fell to the rank of a patois and was written
                    less and less; lettered persons ceased to cultivate it, and the upper classes,
                    especially in Valencia, owing to the proximity of Castile, soon affected to make
                    no further use of the local speech except in familiar conversation. The 16th
                    century, in fact, furnishes literary history with hardly more than a single poet
                    at all worthy of the name—Pere Serafí, some of whose pieces, in the style of
                    Auzias March, but less obscure, are graceful enough and deserve to live; his
                    poems were printed at Barcelona in 1565. Prose is somewhat better represented,
                    but, to tell the truth, it is only the erudite who persist in writing in
                    Catalan,—antiquaries and historians like Pere Miguel Carbonell, compiler of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Chroniques de Espanya</hi> (1547), Francesch Tarafa, Pere
                    Anton Beuter, also chroniclers, and some others not so well known. In the 17th
                    and 18th centuries the decadence becomes still more marked. A few scattered
                    attempts to restore to the Catalan, now more and more neglected by men of
                    letters, some of its old life and brilliance, fail miserably. Neither Hieronim
                    Pujades the historian, author of a <hi rend="italic">Coronica Universal del
                    Principal</hi> (Barcelona, 1609), nor even Dr Vicens Garcia, rector of
                    Vallfogona (1582-1623), a verse-writer by no means destitute of verve or humour,
                    but whose literary talent and originality have been very greatly exaggerated by
                    the Catalans of the present day, was able to bring back his countrymen to a
                    cultivation of the local idiom. Some sermons, some lives of saints, some books
                    of devotion, some relations and complaints for the use of the people, exhaust
                    the catalogue of everything written in Catalan throughout the whole area of its
                    domains down to the beginning of the present century; not a single book of
                    importance can be mentioned. Writers who were Catalan by birth had so completely
                    unlearned their mother-tongue that it would have seemed to them quite
                    inappropriate, and even ridiculous, to make use of it in serious works, so
                    profoundly had Castilian struck its roots in the eastern provinces of Spain, and
                    so thoroughly had the work of assimilation been carried out to the advantage of
                    the official language of the court and of the Government.</p>
                <p>In 1814 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Gramatica y Apologia de la Llengua
                    Cathalana</hi> of Joseph Pau Ballot y Torres, which may be considered as marking
                    the origin of a genuine renaissance of the grammatical and literary study of
                    Catalan. Although the author avows no object beyond the purely practical one of
                    giving to strangers visiting Barcelona for commercial purposes some knowledge of
                    the language, the enthusiasm with which he sings the praises of his
                    mother-tongue, and his appended catalogue of works which have appeared in it
                    since the time of James I., sufficiently show that this was not his only aim. In
                    point of fact the book, which is entitled to high consideration as being the
                    first systematic Catalan grammar, written, too, in the despised idiom itself,
                    had a great influence on the authors and literary men of the principality. Under
                    the helping influence of the new doctrines of romanticism twenty years had not
                    passed before a number of attempts in the way of restoring the old language had
                    made their appearance, in the shape of various poetical works of very unequal
                    merit. The <hi rend="italic">Oda á la Patria</hi> (1833) of Buenaventura Carlos
                    Aribau is among the earliest if not actually the very first of these, and it is
                    also the best; the modern Catalan school has not produced anything either more
                    inspired or more correct. Following in the steps of Aribau, Joaquin Rubió y Ors
                    <hi rend="italic">(Lo Gayter del Llobregat),</hi> Antonio de Bofarull <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lo Coblejador de Moncada),</hi> and soon afterwards a number of
                    other verse writers took up the lyre which it might have been feared was never
                    to sound again since it fell from the hands of Auzias March. The movement spread
                    from Catalonia into other provinces of the ancient kingdom of Aragon; the appeal
                    of the Catalans of the principality was responded to at Valencia and in the
                    Balearic Isles. Later, the example of Provence, of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >felibritge</hi> of the south of France, accelerated still further this
                    renaissance movement, which received official recogni<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">jochs florals,</hi> in which prizes are given to the best
                    competitors in poetry, of whom some succeed in obtaining the diploma of <hi
                    rend="italic">mestre en gay saber.</hi> It is of course impossible to foresee
                    the future of this new Catalan literature,—whether it is indeed destined for
                    that brilliant career which the Catalans themselves anticipate. In spite of the
                    unquestionable talent of poets like Mariano Aguiló (Majorca), Teodoro Llorente
                    (Valencia), and, among the younger of them, Jacinto Verdaguer (Catalonia),
                    author of an epic poem <hi rend="italic">Λtlantída</hi> and of very fascinating
                    <hi rend="italic">Cants Mistichs,</hi> it is by no means certain that this
                    generation will be succeeded by another to follow in its footsteps, or that such
                    a restoration of a provincial literature has much chance of permanence at the
                    very moment when all the peoples of Europe are tending rather towards unity and
                    centralization in the matter of language. At all events, in order to secure even
                    a comparative success for such a revival, it would be well if the language
                    serving as its instrument were somewhat more fixed, and if its writers would no
                    longer hesitate, as they at present do, between a pretentious archaism and the
                    incorrectness of the most vulgar colloquialism. The few attempts of modern
                    Catalans in the direction of romance writing and dramatic composition have not
                    hitherto been particularly felicitous, and have not led to anything
                    noteworthy.</p>
