                <p><label type="entry">SMITH, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Henry</hi></label>
                    (1808-1872), best known as the author of <hi rend="italic">Thorndale,</hi> is
                    one of those thinkers and students whose work, whilst scarcely recognized in
                    their own day and soon all but overlooked in the larger perspective of history,
                    is yet of real value for an appreciation of the intellectual character of the
                    time. The literary production of which <hi rend="italic">Thorndale</hi> is the
                    most representative example affords a moral countenance to contemporary workers
                    in philosophy which is invaluable, but which for obvious reasons can never be
                    exactly appraised. With a fine and reflective, rather than robust and active,
                    intelligence, Smith deals suggestively in the form of conversation—which he
                    adopts in <hi rend="italic">Thorndale</hi> and in his later book <hi
                        rend="italic">Gravenhurst—</hi> with the problem of good and evil, with
                    materialism and idealism, with most of the subtle modern perplexities in the
                    interaction of religion, philosophy, and science. But his more exact
                    contributions to thought, such as the <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the Ethics
                        of the School of Paley</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Essays on Knowing and
                        Feeling,</hi> do not work out anything like a complete system, and are
                    somewhat lacking in intellectual grip. Smith also wrote several books of verse
                    and two plays, one of which, <hi rend="italic">Athelwold,</hi> was produced by
                    Macready in 1812. Much graceful reflexion and a true feeling for nature are
                    found in his verse, but it lacks energy. Smith spent a serene uneventful life,
                    chiefly in the studious seclusion which he loved, but which must have tended to
                    foster the inactive tendencies that led him to call himself playfully in his
                    latter days “the snail.” He was born at Hammersmith in 1808 in comfortable
                    surroundings, his father being a retired merchant; his mother was of German
                    extraction, with a vein of mysticism, which is worth noticing in view of the
                    son’s metaphysical tendencies. He was sent in 1821 to Glasgow, where Byron’s
                    poetry and Scottish metaphysics seem to have had most influence upon him. Then
                    he entered a lawyer’s office, in which he remained for five years. His first
                    writings appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi> and in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> to which he contributed under the name of
                    “Wool-gatherer,” attracting some attention by the delicacy and finish of his
                    style. His ambition was at the outset chiefly poetical, however, and, when his
                    first book appeared and was almost completely ignored, he dug a grave and buried
                    the unsold copies in a fit of Byronic despondency. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ernesto,</hi> a philosophical romance, also belongs to this early period.
                    In 1836 he wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> and in 1839 he
                    formed a connexion with <hi rend="italic">Blackwoods Magazine,</hi> which lasted
                    for thirty years, during the latter part of which he acted as its philosophical
                    critic. In 1846 a visit to Italy led to the writing of a tale entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Mildred,</hi> which was too purely reflective to be
                    successful. In 1851 he declined the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh,
                    having determined a year or two previously to retire to the English Lake
                    district, there to study in seclusion. There he completed <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thorndale,</hi> which was published in 1857. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gravenhurst</hi> appeared in 1862; a second edition contained a memoir of
                    the author by his wife. He died at Brighton on 28th March 1872.</p>
