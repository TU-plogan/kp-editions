                    arsenal (founded 1777) and armoury (1794), employing some 460 hands, is the
                    largest in the republic. The Springfield breech-loading rifle of 45 calibre has
                    been the regulation pattern in the United States army since 1873. A
                    pistol-factory, car-works, manufactories of cotton and silk goods, buttons,
                    needles, envelopes, paper, watches, skates, and brass-work may be mentioned
                    among the industrial establishments. The city hall (1855), a Romanesque building
                    with an audience-room capable of holding 2700 persons; the city free library
                    (1871), a Gothic building of brick, which contains 56,000 volumes and a museum;
                    the granite court-house; the Roman Catholic cathedral of St Michael; Christ
                    Church, Episcopal; the Church of the Unity, a fine Gothic structure in brown
                    stone; the South Congregational church; the office of the Boston and Albany
                    Railroad, a massive granite block; and the high school are among the chief
                    architectural features of the city. Races are held in Hampden Park by the river
                    side. The population was 15,199 in 1860, 26,703 in 1870, 33,340 in 1880 (775
                    coloured), and 37,577 in 1885.</p>
                <p>Springfield was settled in 1636 by William Pynchon and emigrants from
                    Roxbury,—the determination of the founder being to limit the “town” to forty or
                    at most fifty families. The name was at first Agawam; but the present
                    designation was adopted in 1641 in memory of Springfield (Essex), Pynchon’s
                    residence in his native country, England, to which he was obliged to return in
                    1652 to escape the clerical persecution called forth by his book on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meritorious Price of Christ's Redemption.</hi> The town was burned
                    by the Indians in 1675; and in 1787 the arsenal was attacked by Shays’s rebels.
                    The opening of the Boston and Albany Railroad in 1839 was the beginning of rapid
                    development, and the town was made a city in 1852. The manufacture of firearms
                    carried on here during the Civil War, 1861-65, gave the city a great
                    impulse.</p>
