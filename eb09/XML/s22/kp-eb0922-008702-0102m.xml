                    mathematician, was the eldest son of a Glasgow merchant, John Simson of
                    Kirktonhill in Ayrshire, and was born on the 14th of October 1687. He was
                    intended for the church, and passed with distinction through the usual course of
                    study for that profession at the university of Glasgow. The bent of his mind,
                    however, was towards mathematics, not theology; and, when a prospect was opened
                    up to him of succeeding to the mathematical chair, he proceeded to London in
                    order to become acquainted with some of the eminent mathematicians there and to
                    increase his stock of mathematical knowledge. After a year’s residence in London
                    he returned to Glasgow, and in 1711 was appointed by the university to the
                    professorship of mathematics. The duties of this office he discharged for half a
                    century. During that time he published several works on pure geometry, and
                    carried on an extensive mathematical correspondence. In 1746 the university of
                    St Andrews, wishing to confer on him an honorary degree, chose, according to his
                    biographer Dr William Trail, that of doctor of medicine, because in his youth he
                    had made a careful study of botany. He never married, and his long life was
                    spent within the walls of his college. His habits were exceedingly regular, his
                    hours of work and of amusement being rigorously fixed. A studious man of
                    science, he had no relish for the promiscuous intercourse of society, and his
                    manner of living was simple and inexpensive. In person he was tall, with a
                    handsome countenance and an affable manner, and he used always to dress in
                    lightcoloured clothes. Though, like some other distinguished mathematicians, he
                    was rather absent-minded, in matters of business he was very circumspect. He was
                    a man of the strictest integrity, ready to do justice to the merits of others,
                    and not too sensible of his own. He enjoyed a long course of uninterrupted
                    health, and was seriously indisposed only for a few weeks before his death,
                    which took place on the 1st of October 1768.</p>
                <p>The first of Simson’s published writings is a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society of London (vol. xl. p.
                    330, 1723) on the subject of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Porisms,</hi> the nature
                    of which he was the first to elucidate (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Porisms).</hi>
                    Then followed <hi rend="italic">Sectionum Conicarum Libri V.</hi> (Edinburgh,
                    1735), a second edition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0103-0088"/> of which, with additions, appeared in 1750. The
                    first three books of <hi rend="underline">this</hi> treatise were translated
                    into English, and several times printed, with the title <hi rend="italic">The
                    Elements of the Conic Sections.</hi> In 1749 was published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apollonii Pergaei Locorum Planorum Libri II.</hi>, a restoration of one of
                    Apollonius’s lost treatises, founded on the lemmas given in the seventh book of
                    Pappus’s <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Collection.</hi> In 1756 appeared, both
                    in Latin and in English, the first edition of his Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements.</hi> This work, which contained only the first six and the eleventh
                    and twelfth books, and to which in its English version he added the <hi
                    rend="italic">Data</hi> in 1762, has become the standard text of Euclid in
                    England. The additions and alterations which Simson made by way of restoring the
                    text to its "original accuracy” are certainly not all of them improvements, and
                    the notes he appended show with what an uncritical reverence he regarded the
                    great geometers of antiquity. Two other works, restorations of Apollonius’s
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Be Sectione Determinata</hi> and Euclid’s treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De Porismatibus,</hi> which Simson was too distrustful of
                    himself to publish during his lifetime, were printed for private circulation in
                    1776 at the expense of Earl Stanhope, in a volume with the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Roberti Simson, M.D Opera Quaedam Reliqua.</hi> The volume
                    contains also two additional books <hi rend="italic">De Sectione
                    Determinata,</hi> two small dissertations on <hi rend="italic">Logarithms</hi>
                    and on the <hi rend="italic">Limits of Quantities and Ratios,</hi> and a few
                    problems illustrative of the ancient geometrical analysis. How far these
                    restorations represent the lost originals will probably always be a matter of
                    conjecture. The <hi rend="italic">De Porismatibus</hi> certainly cannot be
                    coextensive with Euclid’s three books; but, if it is only a restored fragment,
                    the credit due to Simson’s perseverance and penetration in recovering from
                    oblivion the nature and some of the contents of one of the most interesting
                    treatises of antiquity will always be such as to keep his name in the
                    remembrance of geometers.</p>
