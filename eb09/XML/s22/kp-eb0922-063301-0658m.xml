                    greater part of his life. Some one of his numerous enemies pretended that he did
                    not really belong to the illustrious family represented four centuries earlier
                    by the trouvère and warrior Quenes de Béthune, but that his race was derived
                    from Scottish Bethunes of no mark. There is, however, no reason for giving any
                    credit to this story. Sully was a second son; his elder brother died when but
                    just of age, and even before this his father (if his own account may be trusted)
                    treated Maximilian (so he himself spelt his name, and not Maximilien) as an
                    eldest son. He was only eleven years old when his father, who was a Protestant,
                    was presented to Henry of Navarre, and from that time he was more or less
                    inseparably attached to the future king of France. He had a narrow escape on St
                    Bartholomew’s Day, but he did escape, and when little more than sixteen began to
                    take an active part in the Civil Wars. He distinguished himself not a little,
                    especially in the character of engineer. In 1583 he married Anne de Courtenay,
                    who, however, died in 1589, and in the intervals of war he lived the life of a
                    country gentleman at Rosny. At the battle of Ivry, 1590, he had the good luck,
                    though seriously wounded, to capture Mayenne’s standard. As soon as Henry’s
                    power was established, Sully, who, though by no means always a complaisant or
                    obliging servant, had been uniformly faithful, received his reward in the shape
                    of numerous places, estates, and dignities. In 1601 he was made grand-master of
                    the ordnance and in 1606 duke of Sully. He was also practically the king’s
                    minister of finance during the greater part of his reign. After the
                    assassination of his master he makes no further figure in history, though he
                    survived for many years, saw the rise of a far greater minister than himself,
                    and did not die till (less than a year before Richelieu himself died) the 22d of
                    December 1641, at Villebon near Chartres.</p>
                <p>He had married a second time, and anecdote is not complimentary to his second
                    wife, while his daughter, who married the great duke of Rohan, also had a not
                    unblemished reputation. Sully, however, who, though deprived of (and indeed
                    resigning) all control of public affairs after Henry’s death, retained great
                    wealth, lived in what was almost a caricature of the stately fashions of the
                    time, aud busied himself in the composition of memoirs which are among the most
                    curious in form, and not the least interesting in contents, of the kind. He
                    instructed his secretaries to draw the book up in the form of an elaborate
                    address to himself: “you then did this”; “you said as follows”; “as you have
                    been good enough to inform us, the affair went on this wise”; and so forth. And
                    he not only had the book executed in this extraordinary fashion but had it read
                    out to him. Its title is as odd as other things about it and runs thus: <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires des Sages et Royales (Economies d'Estat, domestiques,
                    politiques, militaires de Henry le Grand, l’Exemplaire des Roys, le Prince des

                    printed, nominally at Amsterdam, but really under Sully’s own eye at his
                    château, in 1634; the other two did not appear till twenty years after his
                    death. As his wealth, his im-<pb break="no"

                    had enjoyed and his subsequent loss of it, joined to attract odium, his
                    character and his book were rather roughly handled in his lifetime. Marbault
                    secretary to Du Plessis-Mornay, Sully’s chief rival, wrote a very caustic
                    criticism of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> from which, though it remained
                    in MS. till the 19th century, Tallemant des Réaux, the insatiable
                    scandal-monger, compiled a not unamusing but distinctly calumnious article on
                    Sully. Most of the stories it contains may be unhesitatingly disbelieved. At the
                    same time Sully was by no means the ideally wise and good minister that he has
                    not unfrequently been represented as being. He was as faithful as a dog, and as
                    surly. He grasped wealth and place to an extent not quite compatible with the
                    idea of pure devotion to his king or his country, and his jealousy of all other
                    ministers and all other favourites was extravagant and unceasing. Still there is
                    no doubt that he was an excellent man of business, that, if not exactly what
                    would be now called an incorruptible minister, he made no gains not sanctioned
                    by the customs of the time, that he was inexorable in interfering with
                    peculation and malversation on the part of others, that he opposed the ruinous
                    personal expenditure which was the bane of almost all European monarchies in his
                    day, and that he did much both as a man of war and as a man of peace to make
                    France strong, united, and happy. His literary power, moreover, was far from
                    small. Although the fantastic form of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> after
                    being diverting for a time, grows not a little wearisome, they have phrases and
                    passages of great vivacity, which it is reasonable to attribute to Sully himself
                    rather than to his spokesmen, and they show much grasp of administrative
                    business.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> so shocked the 18th century
                    that in 1745 the abbé de l’Écluse re-edited or rather rewrote them in the
                    ordinary form of narrative. This text has of course no interest; the proper
                    version with the commentary of Marbault may be found in the collection of
                    Michaud and Poujoulat (vols. xvi. and xvii.).</p>
