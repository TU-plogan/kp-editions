                    miles. It covers the east of the low swelling, studded with lakes, which skirts
                    the south coast of the Baltic (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Poland),</hi> its
                    highest parts reaching 800 to 1000 feet above the sea. Its northern slopes
                    descend to the valley of the lower Niemen, while in the south it falls away
                    gently to the marshy tract of the Bebrz. The rivers flow there in deep gorges
                    and valleys, diversifying the surface. Suwalki is watered by the Niemen, which
                    forms its eastern and its northern boundary and is largely used as a channel of
                    communication: it has many affluents from both slopes<pb break="no"

                    navigable Hancza, tributary of the Niemen, with a tributary of the Bebrz, which
                    belongs to the basin of the Vistula, and an active traffic is carried on on this
                    canal. The population was 606,573 in 1883, the increase being 3400 during the
                    year. It has a most varied composition, embracing Lithuanians (the prevailing
                    element), who number about four-tenths of the whole (Zhmuds, 31·5 per cent.;
                    Lithuanians proper, 10·3), Poles (28·4, of whom 5·3 are Mazurs), Jews (17·2),
                    Germans (6·8, but they are rapidly increasing), and White Russians (4·6). In
                    religion the Catholics are predominant (449,476 in 1883); the Jews come next
                    (98,743); there are also 38,610 Protestants, 13,275 Orthodox Greeks, and 6246
                    Raskolniks.</p>
                <p>Tertiary and Chalk deposits are widely spread in Suwatki, and the entire surface
                    is covered with Post-Tertiary deposits. The bottom moraine of the great
                    ice-sheet of North Germany, containing scratched boulders and furrowed by
                    depressions having a direction north-north-east to south-south-west,<note

                    immense tracts of the ridge of the lake-districts and its slopes, while limited
                    spaces are covered with well-washed glacial sands and gravel. On the northern
                    slopes of the coast-ridge, the boulder-clay being covered with lacustrine
                    deposits, there are at many places layers of fertile soil; and in the southern
                    parts of the province the boulder-clay is very stony, and sometimes covered with
                    gravel. Still, nearly nine-tenths of the surface are considered suitable for
                    cultivation. Agriculture is the chief occupation, and potatoes are extensively
                    grown for export to Prussia, where they are used for the manufacture of spirits,
                    which are smuggled into the province. The manufactures are unimportant (600
                    workmen; annual produce valued at £124,000, one-half being due to distilleries).
                    All manufactured wares are imported, mostly from Prussia; and all trade is in
                    the hands of Jews. The educational institutions include two gymnasia for boys,
                    one for girls, one seminary for teachers (at Weiwery), one Catholic seminary,
                    and 196 lower grade schools, having altogether an aggregate of 13,193 scholars
                    in 1884. Suwatki is divided into seven districts, the chief towns of which with
                    their populations in 1882 were— <hi rend="smallcaps">Suwalki</hi> (see below),
                    Augustowo (11,100), Kalwarya (10,600), Mariampol (5610), Seiny (4035),
                    Wilkowiszki (6700), and Wfadistawow (9300). Wierzbolowo (3550), an important
                    customhouse, situated on the railway from St Petersburg to Berlin, also has
                    municipal institutions.</p>
