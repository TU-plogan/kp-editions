                    N. lat. and between 8° 10' and 9° 10' W. long., and is bounded N. by the
                    Atlantic, E. by Leitrim, S.E. by Roscommon, and S. and W. by Mayo. The total
                    area is 451,129 acres, or nearly 705 square miles. Its greatest length from
                    north to south, between Mullaghmore Head and Lough Gara, is 38 miles and its
                    greatest breadth from east to west is 41.</p>
                <p>The coast-line is very irregular and in some places rises into grand escarpments
                    and terraces. The principal inlets are Killala Bay and Sligo Bay, the latter
                    subdivided into Brown Bay, Drumcliffe Bay, and Ballysadare Bay. Near the coast
                    are the islets of Inishmurray, Coney, and Oyster. Though Sligo cannot be
                    compared for scenery with the western parts of Mayo, it is in many places
                    charmingly picturesque, being well wooded and possessing several fine lakes and
                    rivers, as well as some ranges of hills which from their situation and grouping
                    have a very striking effect. In the north are the limestone elevations of
                    Ben-bulbin (1722 feet) and Knocknarea (1078), contrasting finely with the
                    adjacent rugged gneiss mountains, among which are King’s Mountain (1965 feet)
                    and Gullogherboy (1430). In the west are the ranges of the Slieve Gamph and Ox
                    Mountains, 1300 and 1600 feet respectively. The Curlew Mountains (nearly 900
                    feet high) separate Sligo from Roscommon. The principal rivers are the Moy,
                    forming for a part of its course the boundary with Mayo, and flowing
                    south-westwards and then northwards into Killala Bay; the Easky, flowing
                    northwards from Lough Easky; the Ballysadare, with its branches the Owenmore,
                    Owenbeg, and Arrow or Unshin; and the Garvogue, flowing from Lough Gill. Except
                    the finely situated Lough Gill (3130 acres) extending into Leitrim, Lough Arrow
                    (3010), and Lough Gara (3683), none of the lakes have so large an area as 400
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The Carboniferous Mountain Limestone forms the basis of a great part of the
                    county, and includes the Lower Limestone calp or black shale series and the
                    Upper Limestone, which rises occasionally into a lofty tableland. There is a
                    small tract of Yellow Limestone in the extreme north, as also on the north and
                    north-east of Lough Gara, whence it extends into Mayo. The Old Red Sandstone
                    appears in two masses near Lough Arrow. A small tract of granite enters the
                    county on the south-west, coming from between Lough Conn and Foxford in Mayo,
                    giving place to a broad belt of trap porphyry bounded by a narrow fringe of Old
                    Red Sandstone, which stretches in a north-easterly direction along the line of
                    the Ox Mountains to Ballysadare Bay. Iron is abundant, especially in the
                    neighbourhood of the Ox Mountains, but from want of fuel is not worked. Pure
                    copper is found in the beds of some of the rivers, and sulphate of copper and
                    iron pyrites occur in some places.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> There is considerable variety both in the
                    character of the soil and in the agricultural advancement in different parts of
                    the county. In some parts it is a light sandy loam resting on a freestone
                    bottom, and in the lower districts a rich and deep mould prevails resting on a
                    substratum of limestone. Owing to the moistness of the climate cattle feeding is
                    found to be the most remunerative method of farming. Out of a total of 451,129
                    acres</p>
                <p>231,753 or 5∙3 per cent. in 1884 were under grass, 86,365 under crops, 38,431 bog
                    and marsh, 70,599 barren mountain land, 7577 woods and plantations, and 417
                    fallow, the remaining 15,987 acres being under water, roads, fences, &amp;c. The
                    total number of holdings was 15,352, there being 752 under 1 acre, 1443 between
                    1 and 5 acres each in extent, 5834 between 5 and 15, 4592 between 15 and 30,
                    1520 between 30 and 50, and 1211 of 100 acres and upwards. The total area under
                    corn crops in 1884 was 24,324 acres, while in 1875 it was 30,810; under green
                    crops 25,897, in 1875 30,491; under meadow and clover 36,120, in 1875 32,396;
                    and under flax 24, in 1875 175,—the total area under tillage having decreased
                    between 1875 and 1884 from 93,872 to 86,365 acres. Of the corn crops in 1884
                    oats occupied 23,055 acres, and green crops and potatoes 19,835. The number· of
                    horses between 1875 and 1884 increased from 7244 to 8292, of asses from 7588 to
                    8471; cattle decreased from 97,658 to 89,458, sheep from 65,857 to 64,324; pigs,
                    again, increased from 19,726 to 26,996, goats from 3081 to 4745, and poultry
                    from 277,113 to 305,509. According to the landowners return Sligo was divided
                    among 856 proprietors, possessing 448,397 acres at an annual value of £210,382,
                    or about 9s. 4 ½ d. per acre. The principal proprietors were Colonel E. H.
                    Cooper, 34,120 acres; Sir Robert Gore Booth, 31,774; Charles W. O’Hara, 21,070;
                    W. R. O. Gore, 21,019; Owen Wynne, 12,982; Colonel King-Harman, 12,629; Hon.
                    Evelyn Ashley, 12,426; and William Phibbs, 10,507.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and other Industries.—</hi> Coarse woollens and
                    linens are manufactured for home consumption, and there are tanneries,
                    distilleries, and breweries in the principal towns. A considerable general trade
                    is carried on at the ports of Ballina (on the Moy) and Sligo. The fisneries on
                    the coast are valuable, and there are important salmon fisheries at the mouths
                    of the rivers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county is divided into
                    6 baronies, and contains 37 parishes and 4 parts of parishes, and 1292
                    townlands. The county has three poor-law unions—Dromore West, Sligo, and
                    Tobercurry—with parts of the unions of Ballina and Boyle (Roscommon). It is in
                    the Connaught circuit, and assizes are held at Sligo and quarter sessions at
                    Ballymote, Easky, and Sligo. It is in the Dublin military district, and there
                    are barracks at Sligo. For parliamentary representation the county has since
                    1885 formed two divisions (North and South), each returning a member. Between
                    1841 and 1851 the population decreased from 180,886 to 128,515 or 29 per cent.,
                    and by 1881 it had decreased to 111,578 (55,144 males, 56,434 females), or 38∙3
                    per cent. since 1841. In 1881 the number of persons who could read and write was
                    52,602, who could read only 15,574, who could neither read nor write 43,402.
                    There were 2326 who could speak Irish only, while 24,263 could speak Irish and
                    English. There were 10 superior schools with 266 pupils, of whom 142 were
                    Catholics and 124 Protestants, and 211 primary schools with 13,714 pupils, of
                    whom 12,070 were Catholics and 1644 Protestants. The principal towns are Sligo
                    (population 10,808 in 1881), Ballina (1442 in Sligo and 4318 in Mayo), Ballymote
                    (1145), and Tobercurry (1081).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> In the time of Ptolemy the
                    district was inhabited by the <hi rend="italic">Nagnatae,</hi> the capital <hi
                    rend="italic">Nagnata</hi> being somewhere near the site of the present town of
                    Sligo. Afterwards it was possessed by a branch of the O’Connors, called O’Connor
                    Sligo. On the landing of Henry II. it gradually fell into the power of the De
                    Burgos. The district formed part of Connaught, which, in the reign of Elizabeth,
                    was divided into seven counties. On the lands of Carrowmore, between Sligo and
                    Ballysadare, there is a remarkable collection of Druidical remains, consisting
                    of cairns, a circle, cromlechs, and pillar stones. At Drumcliffe is the only
                    round tower now remaining in the county, and a beautiful Celtic cross 13 feet in
                    height. The principal monastic ruins are the abbey of St Fechan at Ballysadare,
                    with an ancient church displaying some curious architecture of the 11th or 12th
                    century; the remarkable group of buildings on Inishmurray; and the abbey of
                    Sligo, noticed under the town below. There are a considerable number of old
                    castles, but none of special interest.</p>
