                    di Ventura; he has also been called Luca da Cortona. The precise date of his
                    birth is uncertain; but, as he is said to have died at the age of eighty-two,
                    and as he was certainly alive during some part of 1524, the birth-date of 1442
                    must be nearly correct. He belongs to the Tuscan school, associated with that of
                    Umbria. His first impressions of art seem to be due to Perugia,— the style of
                    Bonfigli, Fiorenzo, and Pinturicchio. Lazzaro Vasari, the great-grandfather of
                    Giorgio Vasari, the historian of art, was brother to Luca’s mother; he got Luca
                    apprenticed to Piero della Francesca. In 1472 the young man was painting at
                    Arezzo, and in 1474 at Città di Castello. He presented to Lorenzo de’ Medici a
                    picture which is probably the one named the School of Pan, discovered some years
                    ago in Florence, and now belonging to Marquis Corsi; it is almost the same
                    subject which he painted also on the wall of the Petrucci palace in Siena,— the
                    principal figures being Pan himself, Olympus, Echo, a man reclining on the
                    ground, and two listening shepherds (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Schools of
                    Painting,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 434, fig. 8). He executed, moreover, various sacred
                    pictures, showing a study of Botticelli and Lippo Lippi. Pope Sixtus IV.
                    commissioned Signorelli to paint some frescos, now mostly very dim, in the
                    shrine of Loreto,—Angels, Doctors of the Church, Evangelists, Apostles, the
                    Incredulity of Thomas, and the Conversion of St Paul. He also executed a single
                    fresco in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, the Acts of Moses; another, Moses and
                    Zipporah, which has been usually ascribed to Signorelli, is now recognized as
                    the work of Perugino. Luca may have stayed in Rome from 1478 to 1484. In the
                    latter year he returned to his native Cortona, which remained from this time his
                    ordinary home. From 1497 he began some professional excursions. In Siena, in the
                    convent of Chiusuri, he painted eight frescos, forming part of a vast series of
                    the Life of St Benedict; they are at present much injured. In the palace of
                    Pandolfo Petrucci he worked upon various classic or mythological subjects,
                    including the School of Pan already mentioned. From Siena he went to Orvieto,
                    and here he produced the works which, beyond all others, stamp his greatness in
                    art. These are the frescos in the chapel of S. Brizio, in the cathedral, which
                    already contained some pictures on the vaulting by Fra Angelico. The works of
                    Signorelli represent the Last Days of the Mundane Dispensation, with the Pomp
                    and the Fall of Antichrist, and the Eternal Destiny of Man, and occupy three
                    vast lunettes, each of them a single picture. In one of them, Antichrist, after
                    his portents and impious glories, falls headlong from the sky, crashing down
                    into an innumerable crowd of men and women. Paradise, the Elect and the
                    Condemned, Hell, the Resurrection of the Dead, and the Destruction of the
                    Reprobate follow in other compartments. To Angelico’s ceiling Signorelli added a
                    section showing figures blowing trumpets, &amp;c.; and in another ceiling he
                    depicted the Madonna, Doctors of the Church, Patriarchs, and Martyrs. There is
                    also a great deal of subsidiary work connected with Dante, and with the poets
                    and legends of antiquity. The daring and terrible invention of the great
                    compositions, with their powerful treatment of the nude and of the most arduous
                    foreshortenings, and the general mastery over complex grouping and distribution,
                    marked a development of art which had never previously been attained. It has
                    been said that Michelangelo felt so strongly the might of Signorelli’s
                    delineations that he borrowed, in his own Last Judgment, some of the figures or
                    combinations which he found at Orvieto; this statement, however, has not been
                    verified by precise instances. The contract for Luca’s work is still on record.
                    He undertook on 5th April 1499 to complete the ceiling for 200 ducats, and to
                    paint the walls for 600, along with lodging, and in every month two measures of
                    wine and two quarters of corn. Signorelli’s first stay in Orvieto lasted not
                    more than two years. In 1502 he returned to Cortona, and painted a dead Christ,
                    with the Marys and other figures. Two years later he was once more back in
                    Orvieto, and completed the whole of his work in or about that time, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> some two years before 1506,—a date famous in the
                    history of the advance of art, when Michelangelo displayed his cartoon of
                    Pisa.</p>
                <p>After finishing off at Orvieto, Signorelli was much in Siena. In 1507 he executed
                    a great altarpiece for S. Medardo at Arcevia in Umbria—the Madonna and Child,
                    with the Massacre of the Innocents and other episodes. In 1508 Pope Julius II.
                    determined to re-adorn the camere of the Vatican, and he summoned to Rome
                    Signorelli, in company with Perugino, Pinturicchio, and Bazzi (Sodoma). They
                    began operations, but were shortly all superseded to make way for Raphael, and
                    their work was taken down. Luca now returned to Siena, living afterwards for the
                    most part in Cortona. He continued constantly at work, but the performances of
                    his closing years were not of special mark. In 1520 he went with one of his
                    pictures to Arezzo. Here he saw Giorgio Vasari, aged eight, and encouraged his
                    father to second the boy’s bent for art. Vasari tells a pretty story how the
                    wellnigh octogenarian master said to him “Impara, parentino” (“You must study,
                    my little kinsman”), and clasped a jasper round his neck as a preservative
                    against nose-bleeding, to which the child was subject. He was partially
                    paralytic when he began a fresco of the Baptism of Christ in the chapel of
                    Cardinal Passerini’s palace near Cortona, which is the last picture of his that
                    we find specified. Signorelli stood in great repute not only as a painter but
                    also as a citizen. He entered the magistracy of Cortona as early as 1488, and in
                    1524 held a leading position among the magistrates of his native place. In or
                    about the year 1524 he died there.</p>
                <p>Signorelli from an early age paid great attention to anatomy, carrying on his
                    studies in burial grounds. He surpassed all his contemporaries in showing the
                    structure and mechanism of the nude in immediate action; and he even went beyond
                    nature in experiments of this kind, trying hypothetical attitudes and
                    combinations. His drawings in the Louvre demonstrate this and bear a close
                    analogy to the method of Michelangelo. He aimed at powerful truth rather than
                    nobility of form; colour was comparatively neglected, and his chiaroscuro
                    exhibits sharp oppositions of lights and shadows. He had a vast influence over
                    the painters of his own and of succeeding times, but had no pupils or assistants
                    of high mark; one of them was a nephew named Francesco. He was a married man
                    with a family; ope of his sons died, seemingly through some sudden casualty, and
                    Luca depicted the corpse with sorrowful but steady self-possession. He is
                    described as full of kindliness and amiability, sincere, courteous, easy with
                    his art assistants, of fine manners, living and dressing well; indeed, according
                    to Vasari, he always lived more like a nobleman than a painter. The Torrigiani
                    Gallery in Florence contains a grand life-sized portrait by Signorelli of a man
                    in a red cap and vest; this is said to be the likeness of the painter himself,
                    and corresponds with Vasari’s observation. The pictorial reputation of
                    Signorelli has revived and ripened very much throughout Europe in recent years.
                    The foregoing account of him is principally founded upon that given by Messrs
                    Crowe and Cavalcaselle. In Great Britain there is no better specimen of his work
                    than the Circumcision of Jesus, a panel lately in Hamilton Palace, near Glasgow.
