                    Modena, and was pressed to enter that body. He went, however, to the university
                    of Bologna, where his famous kinswoman Laura Bassi, was professor, and it is to
                    her influence that his scientific impulse has been usually attributed. With her
                    he studied natural philosophy and mathematics, and gave also great attention to
                    languages, both ancient and modern, but soon abandoned the study of law, and
                    afterwards took orders. His reputation soon widened, and in 1754 he became
                    professor of logic, metaphysics, and Greek in the university of Reggio, and in
                    1760 was translated to Modena, where he continued to teach with great assiduity
                    and success, but devoted his whole leisure to natural science. He declined many
                    offers from other Italian universities and from St Petersburg until 1768, when
                    he accepted the invitation of Maria Theresa to the chair of natural history in
                    the university of Pavia, which was then being reorganized. He also became
                    director of the museum, which he greatly enriched by the collections of his many
                    journeys along the shores of the Mediterranean. In 1785 he was invited to
                    succeed Vallisneri at Padua, but to retain his services his sovereign doubled
                    his salary and allowed him leave of absence for a visit to Turkey, where he
                    remained nearly a year, and made many observations, among which may be noted
                    those of a copper mine in Chalki and of an iron mine at Principi. His return
                    home was almost a triumphal progress: at Vienna he was cordially received by
                    Joseph II., and on reaching Pavia he was met with acclamations outside the city
                    gates by the students of the university. During the following year his students
                    exceeded five hundred. His integrity in the management of the museum was called
                    in question, but a judicial investigation speedily cleared his honour, to the
                    satisfaction even of his accusers. In 1788 he visited Vesuvius and the volcanoes
                    of the Lipari Islands and Sicily, and embodied the results of his researches in
                    a large work published four years later. He died from an apoplectic seizure, in
                    1799, at the age of seventy.</p>
                <p>His indefatigable exertions as a traveller, his skill and good fortune as a
                    collector, his brilliance as a teacher and expositor, and his keenness as a
                    controversialist no doubt aid largely in accounting for Spallanzani’s
                    exceptional fame among his contemporaries, yet greater qualities were by no
                    means lacking. His life was one of incessant eager questioning of nature on all
                    sides, and his many and varied works all bear the stamp of a fresh and original
                    genius, capable of stating and solving problems in all departments of
                    science,—at one time finding the true explanation of “ducks and drakes”
                    (formerly attributed to the elasticity of water) and at another helping to lay
                    the foundations of our modern yulcanology and meteorology. His main discoveries,
                    however, were in the field of physiology: he wrote valuable and suggestive
                    papers on respiration, on the senses of bats, &amp;c., while his highly
                    important controversy with Needham and Buffon, in which he experimentally
                    disproved the occurrence of spontaneous generation, has been already<pb

                    >Abiogenesis.</hi> In this regard also he was led to pay considerable attention
                    to the infusorial animalcules. His great work, however, is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertationi de Fisica Animale e Vegetale</hi> (2 vols., 1780). Here he first
                    interpreted the process of digestion, which he proved to be no mere mechanical
                    process of trituration, but one of actual solution, taking place primarily in
                    the stomach, by the action of the gastric juice. Verifying this by the important
                    experiment of artificial digestion outside the stomach in sealed tubes, he was
                    attacked by John Hunter, but emerged victorious from the encounter. Of no less
                    importance are his researches on reproduction, in which he experimentally
                    settled the relative functions of the ovum and the spermatozoon. See <hi
