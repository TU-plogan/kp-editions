                    Stettiner Haff and 30 miles from the Baltic Sea. The main part of the town
                    occupies a hilly site on the left bank of the river, and is connected by four
                    bridges (including a mass ive railway swing-bridge)</p>

                <p>from <hi rend="italic">lastadium, “</hi> bur den,”) and Silberwiese, on an island
                    formed by the Parnitz and Dunzig, which here diverge from the Oder to
                    Dammsche-</p>
                <p>See. Until 1874 Stettin was closely girdled by very extensive and strong
                    fortifications, which pre vented the expansion of the town proper, but the
                    steady growth of its commerce and manufactures encouraged the foundation of
                    numerous industrial suburbs beyond the line of defence. Some of these are
                    themselves “towns,” as Grabow, with 13,672 inhabitants in 1880, and Bredow with
                    11,255 inhabitants; but all combine with Stettin to form one industrial and
                    commercial centre. Since the removal of the fortifications their site has begun
                    to be built upon. Apart from its commerce, Stettin is a comparatively
                    uninteresting city. The church of Sts Peter and Paul, originally founded in 1124
                    and restored in 1816— 17, was the earliest Christian church in Pomerania. St
                    James’s church, dating from the 13th and the two following centuries, is
                    remarkable, like several other Pomeranian churches, for its size. The old
                    palace, now occupied by Government offices, is a large unattractive edifice,
                    scarcely justifying the boast of an old writer that it did not yield in
                    magnificence even to the palaces of Italy. Among the more modern structures are
                    the theatre and the new town-house, superseding an earlier one of 1245. Statues
                    of Frederick the Great and of Frederick William III. adorn one of the five open
                    squares of the old town. As a prosperous commercial town Stettin has numerous
                    educational, benevolent, and scientific institutions.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are very important; many of the largest factories are in the
                    neighbouring villages, beyond Stettin proper. The shipbuilding yards (among
                    which<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n567/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0567-0544"/> that of the Vulcan Company deserves mention) have
                    comparatively recently attained some reputation for their ironclads and
                    war-vessels. Machinery, cement, chemicals, and soap are produced in large
                    quantities, and there are also large sugar-refineries, besides a vast miscellany
                    of other smaller industrial establishments. The trade of Stettin is very
                    flourishing. More than any other harbour it may be regarded as the port of
                    Berlin, from which it is 93 miles north-east by railway; and a larger number of
                    vessels enter and clear at Stettin than at any other German port except Hamburg
                    and Bremerhaven. <hi rend="smallcaps">Swinemünde</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.v.)</hi> serves as its fore-port. The forest and river scenery of the
                    neighbourhood of Stettin is picturesque, but the low level and swampy nature of
                    the soil render the climate bleak and unhealthy. In 1885 the population was
                    99,475; in 1880 it was 91,756, of whom 85,727 were Protestants, 3112 Roman
                    Catholics, and 2388 Jews.</p>
                <p>In 1885 3809 ocean vessels (2207 steamers) and 1965 coasting and river craft,
                    besides 10,039 Oder barges, entered the port. In 1885 Stettin possessed (besides
                    a large number of river craft) a fleet of 127 sea-going ships, with a burden of
                    47,066 tons, of which 26,754 tons were distributed in 59 steamers. The chief
                    exports are grain, spirits, and wood; the chief imports petroleum, train-oil,
                    wine, and herrings. The annual value of the former is about £7,500,000 and of
                    the latter about £6,000,000.</p>
                <p>Stettin is said to have existed as a Wendish fishing-village as early as 830 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and it appears as Stedyn in the time of the Saxon
                    emperors. From the 12th century it was the seat of the dukes of Pomerania, who
                    became extinct in 1637. Passing then to Sweden, it remained united with that
                    kingdom for eighty-three years, with one brief interval, but in 1720 it was
                    ceded to Prussia. Gustavus Adolphus undertook to improve its fortifications in
                    1630, but Frederick the Great was the first to convert it into a strong modern
                    fortress. From 1806 till 1813 it was held by the French to whom it was
                    surrendered without a blow. Known even in the12th century as the leading
                    trading-town on the Oder, Stettin entered the Hanseatic League in 1360. The
                    development of its trade in modern times dates chiefly from the deepening and
                    protection of the Swine in the former half of last century. See <hi
