                <p><label type="entry">SPARTA</label>, after Athens, was the most powerful and
                    important of the Greek states. Her fame rested mainly on her soldiers, her
                    military discipline, her somewhat narrow patriotism, and her intense political
                    conservatism; in general intellectual culture, in art and in everything
                    connected with it, she was immeasurably inferior to Athens, and even to some of
                    the other Greek states, though there is evidence to show that a genius and a
                    taste for sculpture and music were by no means wanting to her citizens. Her
                    eminent men were almost all eminent as soldiers, and few of them had any
                    pretensions to rank as able and enlightened statesmen. No such man as
                    Themistocles or Pericles ever appeared in Sparta; she produced no great thinkers
                    or philosophers; the typical Spartan, in short, was a brave and well-trained
                    soldier, with a decided simplicity of character and strong religious scruples,
                    amounting to what we must call superstition, which from time to time were a
                    hindrance to prompt action and discredited the state in the public opinion of
                    Greece.</p>
                <p>Sparta was not so much a city as a cluster of open villages in a plain in the
                    heart of Laconia (see vol. xi. plate I.), in the middle valley of the Eurotas,
                    on the west bank of the river, between the ranges of Taygetus and Parnon, and
                    built in part on the spurs of these mountains. Its situation was very
                    picturesque: “hollow, lovely Lacedaemon”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lacedaemon was simply another name for
                                Sparta, though sometimes it seems to stand for the surrounding
                                district.</hi></p></note> is Homer’s description. Taygetus on the
                    west rises to its greatest height of nearly 8000 feet just above the city, with

                    wild boar. Sparta seems to have been about six miles in circuit; it was not,

                    distant; nor was it built with anything like the compactness of an Athens or a
                    Corinth. The houses for the most part stood in spacious gardens, an open-air
                    life being altogether to the Spartan taste, and well suited to the pleasant
                    genial climate of the valley. The olive still grows to great perfection in the
                    neighbourhood, and the silk is said to be of particularly fine quality. The
                    mountain ranges round the city gave it a very strong defensive position, and for
                    a long period Sparta was without walls or fortifications, trusting exclusively
                    to the prowess of her citizens till she was seriously menaced by the victorious
                    Macedonians in the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The city was never
                    a very splendid one; the houses were plain and simple and there seem to have
                    been no public buildings of striking magnificence. There was the so-called
                    Brazen House of Athene on a hill within a large enclosure, with plates of bronze
                    which gave it its name, on which, among other mythological scenes, were
                    represented the labours of Hercules and the exploits of the great twin brethren,
                    Castor and Pollux, who were specially honoured at Sparta. There was the theatre,
                    still to be traced in huge quadrangular blocks of stone, and there were porticos
                    and colonnades, and the chapels and tombs of Spartan heroes, such as Lycurgus,
                    Leonidas, Brasidas. Sparta delighted to honour her worthy citizens, and paid
                    them divine honours after death. The site of the city has not been thoroughly
                    investigated, but it is a question whether much remains worth bringing to light.
                    What has hitherto been discovered is poor and disappointing. Sparta’s greatness
                    as a city, as Thucydides (i. 10) clearly implies, fell very far short of her
                    political importance as a state.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Sparta’s history, passing over her share in the prehistoric Trojan War under her
                    king Menelaus, the brother of Agamemnon, begins with the legislation of Lycurgus
                    in the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was this, as has been
                    explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Lycurgus,</hi> which made Sparta
                    what she was, a state whose aim it was rather to hold her own within the
                    Peloponnesus than to launch out into doubtful enterprises far away from home.
                    Sparta was not naturally aggressive or ambitious; she was not easily roused to
                    action even in great emergencies. She was safe amid her mountains from the
                    perils to which other Greek cities were exposed. It would seem that in early
                    days Argos had been decidedly the first power in the Peloponnesus, Sparta being
                    second to her by a long interval. The relative position of the two states was
                    reversed soon after the time of Lycurgus. The spirit and vigour which his
                    discipline infused no doubt enabled Sparta, after two severe wars in the 8th and
                    7th centuries, to accomplish at last the complete conquest of Messene, the
                    south-western portion of the Peloponnesus, and so to become the undisputed
                    mistress of at least two-fifths of the whole peninsula, By the year 600 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Sparta was quite in the first rank of Greek
                    states, and it was generally felt that she had a right to take the lead in Greek
                    politics. In the 6th century she put down the tyrants, the heads of the
                    democratic and popular party, in several Greek cities, and drove, for a time at
                    least, the reforming and innovating Clisthenes from Athens. Sparta was the
                    steady foe of democracy and popular government. The Spartans were themselves a
                    small landowning aristocracy, in the midst of a comparatively numerous
                    population, consisting of so-called Perioeci (dwellers round about), the
                    aboriginal inhabitants, in fact, of Laconia, and of Helots or serfs, taken to a
                    great extent from the conquered Messenians.</p>
                <p>The government was highly centralized; it was wholly in the hands of the
                    Spartans, the Perioeci having no share in it, though many of them may have
                    themselves been landowners, or at any rate have held land under Spartan
                    landlords, and been well-to-do and prosperous. The Helots were farm labourers
                    bound to the soil, slaves in every sense of the word, anything like self-respect
                    being studiously made impossible for them. Spartans could put down a popular
                    rising or a slave insurrection with coldblooded cruelty, and in a panic
                    following on an earthquake of unusual violence in 464 there was a
                    deliberately-planned massacre of a multitude of Helots for the safety of Sparta,
                    carried out and executed by Spartans in person. A calculating selfishness was a
                    marked trait in Spartan character. Sparta seems always to have put her own
                    interests before those of Greece, though she claimed to be the leading and
                    representative Greek state. She was cautious and even timid, though the courage
                    of her individual citizens in war was unsurpassed. Every Spartan was a hero on
                    the battlefield, and a Spartan army was long assumed to be invincible. Sparta
                    was not much of a colonizing state, but she could point to the famous city of
                    Tarentum in southern Italy as her offspring, and to Lyctus (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Il</hi>., ii. 647; xvii. 611) in Crete, whence came warriors to the Trojan
                    War. In 491, when Greece was threatened with invasion by Persia, we find Athens
                    appealing to Sparta and urging a complaint against the Aeginetans as traitors to
                    Greece for having given earth and water, the symbols of submission, to the
                    emissaries of the great king. In 480 a Spartan admiral commanded the Greek fleet
                    off Artemisium against Xerxes, and in the following year a Spartan general,
                    Pausanias, commanded the united forces of Greece in the famous battle of
                    Plataea. All this implies a distinct recognition of Sparta as the head of
                    Greece. The Persian War over, Athens under Cimon and Pericles developed
                    extraordinary energy and took Sparta’s place. Sparta indeed seems to have
                    retired upon her laurels, and it was not without reluctance and much urgent
                    pressure that she embarked in the Peloponnesian War, which, after twenty-eight
                    years of hard fighting, ended in the overthrow of the Athenian empire and the
                    capture of Athens by Lysander in 405. Sparta contributed greatly to the final
                    result by despatching an able officer, Gylippus, to the relief of Syracuse in
                    414, when the city was on the point of surrendering to the Athenian armament. It
                    was the decisive success of Gylippus in Sicily which turned the scale against
                    Athens. The crushing blow of Aegospotami in 405, which annihilated her fleet and
                    left her defenceless, and the subsequent surrender of the city transferred the
                    supremacy of Greece once more to Sparta, but not for much more than thirty
                    years. Sparta’s policy was ungenerous and short-sighted; it consisted in
                    establishing little oligarchical factions under Spartan control in the Greek
                    cities, and soon degenerated into a tyranny which became utterly odious. All
                    Sparta’s worst qualities came out during this period: “autonomy,” which had been
                    her watchword throughout the war against Athens, became a dead letter under her
                    rule; and the freedom of city life, so dear to a Greek, was crushed out under
                    her officials and commissioners, whom she thrust on a number of Greek cities.
                    Still more did she disgust all the better men of Greece by concluding, after a
                    series of intrigues for her own selfish ends, a peace with Persia in 387, known
                    as the peace of Antalcidas, the Spartan through whom it was negotiated. It was a
                    dishonourable peace for Greece, as its effect was to facilitate Persian
                    intervention in Greek affairs and make the king of Persia the arbiter of Greek
                    disputes and differences. Meanwhile Athens was recovering herself; the tables
                    were soon turned on Sparta, and her maritime<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0394-0371"/> power collapsed before the united action of
                    Athens and Persia. In the Peloponnesus Sparta was still supreme, but Thebes, she
                    felt, might become a dangerous rival and must be humbled. She insisted that the
                    townships of Boeotia must be “autonomous” and independent of Thebes, and so
                    contrived to pick a quarrel with that state, which to Sparta’s cost had at that
                    time the famous Epaminondas, the greatest, perhaps, of Greek generals, among her
                    leading citizens. In 371 came Sparta’s crushing defeat at Leuctra, a blow from
                    which she never really recovered, though her courage and military discipline
                    long survived it. But her prestige was gone. Epaminondas carried the war into
                    the heart of Laconia and penetrated to Sparta itself. His victory at Mantinea in
                    362 gave independence to Messene, and Sparta was now politically ignored by her
                    old allies.</p>
                <p>From this time Sparta almost drops out of Greek history. She took no part in the
                    struggle against Macedon; no Spartan soldier stood by the side of the Athenians
                    and Thebans at Chaeronea. She seems to have sunk into political apathy; very
                    possibly she may have had to concentrate all her remaining strength and energy
                    in keeping down her Helots and the native population of Laconia. When Alexander
                    was winning his victories in Asia, she intrigued feebly against Macedon, and she
                    would take no part in the congress of the Greek states at Corinth which declared
                    Alexander “Leader of the Greeks.”</p>
                <p>She appears once again, but as not much more than the ghost of her former self,
                    in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> attempting vainly in 281 to
                    unite Greece against the Macedonian Antigonus, and repulsing Pyrrhus from her
                    walls in 272, Spartan women working at the city’s defence, and a few Spartan
                    warriors driving back the formidable soldier-king. There was still the old
                    spirit about her, but the number of her citizens is said to have dwindled down
                    to 700, and in her last days, with a wealthy few in the midst of a poor and
                    needy people, Sparta had shrunk into the narrowest and feeblest of oligarchies.
                    In the latter half of the 3d century B.c., in the days of the Achaean league, a
                    vigorous but unsuccessful attempt at internal reforms and a restoration of the
                    old discipline of Lycurgus was made by two of her kings, Cleomenes and Agis. She
                    sank finally, we know not how, under the degrading dominion of a sort of robber
                    chief, Nabis, who fastened his tyranny upon her by the support of emancipated
                    slaves and mercenaries of the lowest class. Her best citizens were put to death
                    or banished, and she was debased into a refuge of pirates and robbers. Nabis and
                    his vile gang were put down by Philopoemen in the name of the Achaean league,
                    and Philopoemen completed his work by razing the walls of Sparta and abolishing
                    her old institutions. Rome simply looked on, knowing well that she was mistress
                    of the situation, and let matters drag on till 146, when she captured Corinth,
                    and closed the page of Greek history. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">j. b.)</hi></p>
