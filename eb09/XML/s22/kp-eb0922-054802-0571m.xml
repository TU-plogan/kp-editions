                    term used with specific reference to the infliction of wounds like those of
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>An ancient and widespread method of showing tribal connexion, or relation to
                    tribal deities, is by marks set upon the person; thus Herodotus, in describing a
                    temple of Hercules in Egypt (ii. 113), says that it is not lawful to capture
                    runaway slaves who take refuge therein if they receive certain marks on their
                    bodies, devoting them to the deity. Some such idea is perhaps alluded to by Paul
                    (Gal. vi. 17) in the words, “from henceforth let no man trouble me, for I bear
                    branded on my body the stigmata of Jesus and some few authors have even
                    understood the passage as referring to stigmatization in the modern sense
                    (Molanus, <hi rend="italic">De Historia SS. Imaginum et Picturarum,</hi> ed.
                    Paquot, iii. 43, p. 365). Branding, as indicative of servi-<pb break="no"

                    (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">H. N.,</hi> xviii. 3; Varro, <hi rend="italic">De Re
                    Rustica,</hi> i. 18; Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">Caligula,</hi> xxvii.
                    &amp;c.), and was forbidden by Constantine.</p>
                <p>In the period of persecution Christian martyrs were sometimes branded with the
                    name of Christ on their foreheads (Pontius, “De Vit. S. Cypriani,” <hi
                    rend="italic">Biblioth. Veterum Patrum,</hi> iii. p. 472, § vii.). This was
                    sometimes self-inflicted as a disfigurement by nuns for their protection, as in
                    the case of St Ebba, abbess of Coldingham (see Baronius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annales,</hi> xv. p. 215, anno 870, also Tert., <hi rend="italic">De Vel.
                    Virg.</hi>) Some Christians likewise marked themselves on their hands or arms
                    with the cross or the name of Christ (Procopius, <hi rend="italic">In
                    Esaiam,</hi> ed. Curterius, p. 496), and other voluntary mutilations for
                    Christ’s sake are mentioned (Matt. xix. 12; Fortunatus, <hi rend="italic">Life
                    of St Rhadegund,</hi> ed. Migne, col. 508; Palladius, <hi rend="italic">Lausiac
                    History,</hi> cxii.; Jerome’s <hi rend="italic">Letter to St Eustochium,</hi>
                    &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>In the life of St Francis of Assisi we have the first example of the alleged
                    miraculous infliction of stigmata (see vol. ix. p. 692). While meditating on the
                    sufferings of our Lord, in his cell on Mount Alverno, we are told by his
                    biographers, Thomas of Celano and Bonaventura, that the Lord appeared to him as
                    a seraph and produced upon his body the five wounds of Christ; of these we are
                    told that the side wound bled occasionally, though Bonaventura calls it a scar,
                    and the wounds in the feet had the appearance and colour of nails thrust
                    through. After his death St Clare endeavoured but in vain to extract one of
                    these. Pope Alexander IV. and other witnesses declared that they had seen these
                    marks both before and after his death (Raynaldus, ad annum 1255, p. 27). The
                    divinely-attested sanctity of their founder gave to the newly-established order
                    of Franciscans a powerful impulse, so that they soon equalled and threatened to
                    overshadow in influence the previously-founded order of St Dominic.</p>
                <p>The reputation of the latter order was, however, equally raised in the next
                    century by the occurrence of the same wonder in the case of a sister of the
                    third rule of St Dominic, Catherine Benincasa,—better known as St Catherine of
                    Siena. From her biographer’s account we gather that she was subject to
                    hystero-epileptic attacks, in one of which, when she was twenty-three years old,
                    she received the first stigma (see vol. v. p. 230). In spite of her great
                    reputation, and the number of attesting witnesses, this occurrence was not
                    universally believed in. Pope Sixtus IV. published a bull in 1475 ordering, on
                    pain of anathema, the erasure of stigmata from pictures of St Catherine, and
                    prohibiting all expressions of belief in the occurrence. Pope Innocent VIII.
                    similarly legislated “ne de caetero S. Catherina cum stigmatibus depingatur;
                    neve de ejus stigmatibus fiat verbum, aut sermo, vel praedicatio ad tollendam
                    omnem scandali occasionem” (see references in Raynaud, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Stigmatisme,</hi> cap. xi., 1665). In the years which followed, cases of
                    stigmatization occurred thick and fast,—now a Franciscan, now a Dominican, very
                    rarely a religieuse of another order, showing the marks. Altogether about ninety
                    instances are on record, of which eighteen were males and seventy-two females.
                    Most of them occurred among residents in religious houses, and took place after
                    the austerities of Lent, usually on Good Friday, when the mind was intently
                    fixed on our Lord’s Passion; and, from their occurrence being for the most part
                    among members of the two orders to which St Francis and St Catherine belonged,
                    the possibility of the reception of the marks was constantly before their eyes
                    and thoughts. The order of infliction in the majority of cases was that of the
                    crucifixion, the first token being a bloody sweat, followed by the coronation
                    with thorns; afterwards the hand and foot wounds appear, that of the side being
                    the last. The grade of the infliction varied in individual cases, and they may
                    be grouped in the following series :—</p>
                <p>I. As regards full stigmatization, with the visible production of the five
                    wounds, and generally with the mark of the crown as well, the oldest case, after
                    St Francis, is that of Ida of Louvain (1300), in whom the marks appeared as
                    coloured circles; in Gertrude von Oosten of Delft (1344) they were coloured
                    scars, and disappeared in answer to prayer as they also did on Dominica de
                    Paradis; in Sister Pierona, a Franciscan, they were blackish grey. They were
                    true wounds in Margaret Ebnerin of Nuremberg (d. 1351), but they also
                    disappeared in answer to her prayer (see her <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi>
                    Augsburg, 1717), as was the case with Brigitta, a Dominican tertiary (1390), and
                    also with Lidwina. An intermission is described in the marks on Johanna della
                    Croce of Madrid (1524), in whom the wound in the side was large, and the others
                    were rose-coloured circular patches. The marks appeared on each Friday and
                    vanished on Sunday. These emitted an odour of violets; but in Sister Apollonia
                    of Volaterra they were fetid while she lived. Angela della Pace (1634) was fully
                    stigmatized at nine years of age, being even marked with the sponge and hyssop
                    on the mouth; while Joanna de Jesu-Maria at Burgos (1613), a widow, who had
                    entered the convent of Poor Clares, was marked in her sixtieth year. To her in
                    vision two crowns were offered,—one of flowers and one of thorns; she chose the
                    latter and immediately was seized with such pain that her confessor heard her
                    skull cracking. This case was investigated by the officers of the Inquisition.
                    The stigmatization of Veronica Giuliani (1696) was also the subject of inquiry,
                    and in this case the nun drew on a paper a representation of the images which
                    she said were engraved on her heart. On a post-mortem examination being made in
                    1727 by Prof. Gentili and Dr Bordiga, the image of the cross, the scourge,
                    &amp;c., were said to have been impressed on the right side of the organ <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vita della Veronica Giuliani,</hi> by Salvatori, Rome, 1803). The
                    case of Christina Stum-beleu, a Dominican at Cologne, is noteworthy, as on her
                    skull there was found a raised ridge or crown which was at first green, with red
                    dots. This relic is still preserved. In Lucia di Narni (1546) the marks were
                    variable, as they also were on Sister Maria di S. Dominico. On the body of St
                    Margaret of Hungary the stigmata were found fresh and clear when her body was
                    exhumed some time after her death for transportation to Presburg. Other
                    stigmatized persons were Elizabeth von Spalbeck, a Cistercian; Sister Coleta, a
                    Poor Clare; Matilda von Stanz; Margaret Bruch of Endringen (1503); Maria Razzi
                    of Chios (1582); Catharina Januensis; Elizabeth Reith of Allgau; Stieva zu Hamm
                    in Westphalia; Sister Mary of the Incarnation at Pontoise; Archangela Tardera in
                    Sicily (1608); Catharina Ricci in Florence (1590); and Joanna Maria della Croce,
                    a Poor Clare at Roveredo (d. 1673), upon whom the markings of the thorn crown
                    and spear wound were especially deep.</p>
                <p>II. In some cases, although the pains of stigmatization were felt, there were no
                    marks apparent. This occurred to Helen Brumsen (1285); Helena of Hungary (1270);
                    Osanna of Mantua (1476); Columba Rocasani; Magdalena de Pazzis; Anna of Vargas;
                    Hiero-nyma Carvaglio; Maria of Lisbon, a Dominican; Joanna di Vercelli;
                    Stephania Soncinas, a Franciscan; Sister Christina, a Carthusian; and Joanna
                    Rodriguez, a Poor Clare. In the case of Ursula Aguir de Valenza, a tertiary of
                    St Dominic (1608), and Catharine Cialina (d. 1619) the pain was chiefly that of
                    the crown of thorns, as it was also in Amelia Bicchieri of Vercelli, an
                    Augustinian.</p>
                <p>III. In a third series some of the marks were visible on the body, while others
                    were absent or only subjectively indicated by severe pains. The crown of thorns
                    only was marked on the head of Vincentia Ferreria at Valencia (d. 1515) and
                    Philippa de Santo Tomaso of Montemor (1670), while according to Torellus the
                    Augustinian Ritta von Cassia (d. 1430) had a single thorn wound on the forehead.
                    The crown was marked on Catharina of Raconizio (b. 1486), who also suffered a
                    severe bloody sweat. In the case of Stephano Quinzani, in Soncino (1457), there
                    was a profuse bloody sweat and the wounds were intermitting, appearing on Friday
                    and Saturday, vanishing on Sunday. Blanche Gazinan, daughter of Count Arias de
                    Sagavedra (1564), was marked only on the right foot, as also was Catherine, a
                    Cistercian nun. The heart wound was visible in Christina Mirabilis (1232).
                    Gabrielda de Piezolo (d. 1473) died from the bleeding of such a wound, and
                    similar wounds were described in Maria de Acosrin in Toledo; Eustochia, a
                    tertiary of St Francis; Clara de Bugny, a Dominican (1514); Cecilia Nobili, a
                    Poor Clare of Nuceria (d. 1655). In the last instance the heart wound was found
                    after death—a three-cornered puncture. A similar wound was seen in the heart of
                    Martina de Arilla (d. 1644). Maria Villana, a Poor Clare, daughter of the
                    margrave of La Pella, was marked with the crown and the spear thrust, and after
                    death the impresses of the spear, sponge, and reed were found on her heart (d.
                    1670). The wound was usually on the left side, as in Sister Masrona of Grenoble,
                    a tertiary of St Francis (1627); it was on the right in Margareta Columna, also
                    a Clare. In Maria de Sarmiento it was said to have been inflicted by a seraph in
                    a vision.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0573-0550"/> IV. In a fourth set of cases the imprints were
                    said to have been found on the heart, even though there was no surface marking.
                    Thus the Dominican Paula de St Thomas was said to have had the stigmata on her
                    heart. The heart of Clare of Moutfaucon (1308) was said to have been as large as
                    a child's head and impressed with the cross, the scourge, and the nails. Similar
                    appearances were found in Margaret of Citta di Capello and Johanna of Yepes
                    (1591).</p>
                <p>The instances of masculine stigmatization are few. Benedict di Rhegio, a Capuchin
                    at Bologna, had the marks of the crown (1602); Carolus Sazia, an ignorant lay
                    brother, had the wound in his side. Dodo, a Praemonstratensian lay brother, was
                    fully stigmatized, as also was Philip de Aqueria. The marks after death were
                    found on the heart of Angelos del Pas, a minorite of Perpignan, as also on
                    Matheo Carery in Mantua, Melchior of Arazel in Valentia, Cherubin de Aviliana
                    (an Augustinian), and Agolini of Milan. Walter of Strasburg, a preaching friar
                    (1264), had the heart-pain but no mark, and the same was the case with a
                    Franciscan, Robert de Malatestis (1430), and James Stephanus. On Nicholas of
                    Ravenna the wounds were seen after death, while John Gray, a Scotsman, a
                    Franciscan martyr, had one wound on his foot.</p>
                <p>Within the last hundred years several cases have occurred. Anna Katharina
                    Emmerich, a peasant girl born at Münster in 1774, afterwards an Augustinian nun
                    at Agnetenberg, was even more famous for her visions and revelations than for
                    the stigmata. Biographies, with records of her visions, have been published by
                    Brentano at Munich in 1852 and the Abbé Cazalès at Paris (1870). Colombe
                    Schanolt of Bamberg (1787) was fully stigmatized, as also was Rose Serra, a
                    Capuchin of Ozieri in Sardinia (1801), and Madeleine Lorger (1806). Two
                    well-known cases occurred in Tyrol,—one “L’Ecstatica” Maria von Mörl of Caldaro,
                    a girl of noble family, stigmatized in 1839, the other “L’Addolorata” Maria
                    Dominica Lazzari, a miller’s daughter at Capriana, stigmatized in 1835 (see
                    Boré, <hi rend="italic">Les Stigmatisées du Tyrol,</hi> Paris, 1846). A case of
                    the second class is that of Elizabeth Eppinger of Niederbrunn in Bavaria (1814),
                    reported on by Kuhn. An interesting example of stigmatic trance also occurred in
                    the case of a Protestant young woman in Saxony in 1820, who appeared as if dead
                    on Good Friday and Saturday and revived on Easter Sunday.</p>
                <p>The last case recorded is that of Louise Lateau, a peasant girl at Bois de Haine,
                    Hainault, upon whom the stigmata appeared April 24, 1868. This case was
                    investigated by Professor Lefebvre of Louvain, who for fifteen years was
                    physician to two lunatic asylums. In her there was a periodic bleeding of the
                    stigmata every Friday, and a frequent recurrence of the hystero-cataleptic
                    condition. Her biography has been written by Lefebvre and published at Louvain
                    (1870).</p>
                <p>On surveying these ninety cases, we may discount a certain number, including all
                    those of the second class, as examples of subjective sensations suggested by the
                    contemplation of the pains of crucifixion. A second set, of which the famous
                    case of Jetzer (Wirz, <hi rend="italic">Helvetische Kirchengeschichte,</hi>
                    1810, iii. p. 389) is a type, must be also set aside as obvious and intentional
                    frauds produced on victims by designing persons. A third series, and how large a
                    group we have not sufficient evidence to decide, we must regard as due to the
                    irresponsible self-infliction of injuries by persons in the hystero-epileptic
                    condition, those perverted states of nervous action which Charcot has done so
                    much to elucidate. To any experienced in this form of disease, many of the
                    phenomena described in the records of these examples are easily recognizable as
                    characteristic of the hystero-epileptic state.</p>
                <p>There are, however, some instances not easily explained, where the
                    self-infliction hypothesis is not quite satisfactory.</p>
                <p>Parallel cases of physical effects due to mental suggestion are well
                    authenticated. Beaunis vouches for rubefaction and vesication as produced by
                    suggestion in the hypnotic state, and Bourru and Burot describe a case, still
                    under observation, of bloody sweat, and red letters marked on the arm by simple
                    tracing with the finger. See <hi rend="italic">Congrès Scientifique de Grenoble,

                    Hysterie chez l'Homme,</hi> Paris, 1886. We know so little of the trophic action
                    of the higher nerve centres that we cannot say how far tissue nutrition can be
                    controlled in spots. That the nerve centres have a direct influence on local
                    nutrition is in some cases capable of experimental demonstration, and, in
                    another sphere, the many authenticated instances of connexion between maternal
                    impression and congenital deformity seem to indicate that this trophic influence
                    has wider limits and a more specific capacity of localization than at first
                    sight seems possible. There is no known pathological condition in which blood
                    transudation can take place through an unbroken skin.</p>
