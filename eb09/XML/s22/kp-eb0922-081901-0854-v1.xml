                    a province of Russian Turkestan, in Asia, comprising wide tracts of land on both
                    sides of the Syr-Daria river, from its entrance into the Sea of Aral up to
                    Khojend, where it issues from the mountain region of the Tian-Shan. It is
                    bounded on the N. by the Russian provinces of Turgai and Akmolinsk, on the E. by
                    Semiryetchensk and Ferghana (ex-khanate of Khokand), on the S. by the district
                    of Zerafshan, Bokhara, and the Russian province of Amu-daria, and on the W. by
                    the Sea of Aral. Its area (166,000 square miles), its population (more than one
                    million inhabitants), and its cities (Tashkend, Khojend, Jizak, &amp;c.) make it
                    the most important province of Russian Turkestan; and from its position between
                    the mountain region of Central Asia and the great lake of the west Asian
                    depression it is a region of deep interest for the geographer and geologist.</p>
                <p>The south-eastern border of the province runs along the lofty Tchotkat Mountains.
                    This chain, which separates the river Tchotkat from the Naryn, and runs for more
                    than 200 miles from south-west to north-east, joining Alexandrovsk Mountains on
                    the east, raises its snow-clad peaks to an altitude of 14,000 feet. It
                    diminishes in height towards the south, not exceeding 7000 feet in the barren
                    Mogol-tau Mountains, but seems to be continued to the soutli-west by the
                    Baisun-tau. A series of shorter chains—<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0855-0820"/> the Talas Ala-tau, the Bishelik, the Badam
                    Mountains, the Kazyk-urt, and the Alym-tau—fringe the above on the north-west,
                    and occupy the south-east corner of Syr-Dari-insk. The snowclad summits of the
                    Talas Ala-tau range from 14,000 to 15,000 feet, and immense glaciers occur about
                    Manas Mountain. So far as our maps show, the range seems to run from
                    west-south-west to east-north-east. The other chains just mentioned have a
                    decidedly south-westerly direction, and are much lower, the outlying ranges
                    having rather the character of broad plateaus, above 2000 feet in height, where
                    the Kirghiz find excellent pasture grounds. Some of them, such as the Kazyk-urt,
                    rise as isolated mountains from the steppe, and have therefore been called
                    Ararats. The Kara-tau is quite separate from the preceding and runs at right
                    angles to them—that is, from north-west to south-east. It belongs therefore to
                    another series of upheavals which prevails in western Asia and to which
                    Richthofen has given the name of the “Kara-tau series.” Its length is about 270
                    miles, and its average height about 5000 feet, rising at some points to 6000 and
                    7000 feet. It separates the Syr-Daria from the Tchu, and its gentle
                    south-western slope contains the sources of a multitude of streams, which water
                    the oasis around the town of Turkestan. Another range, having the same
                    direction, from north-west to south-east, touches the southern border of
                    Syr-Daria, namely, the Nura-tau (or Nuratyn-tau), also called Turkestan
                    Mountains, which lifts its icy peaks (15,000 to 16,000 feet in height) abruptly
                    from the steppe. It separates Syr-Daria from Zerafshan, and the passes by which
                    it is crossed reach an altitude of from 10,000 to 13,000 feet. Finally, a few
                    islands of metamorphic or granitic rock, called Ararats by the natives, stand
                    isolated in the steppes.</p>
                <p>The mountainous tracts occupy, however, only a small part of Syr-Daria; the rest
                    of its wide surface is steppe. Three different areas must be distinguished,—the
                    Kizil-kum, the Muyun-kum or Ak-kum, and the Kara-kum (“black sands,” so called
                    more from their desert character than from their colour). The Kizil-kum (red
                    sands) is the most interesting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Comp. J. Mushketoff’s <hi rend="italic">Turkestan,</hi>
                            vol. i.</p></note> These sands occupy the wide stretch between the Amu
                    and the Syr, and have a gradual ascent from 160 feet at the Sea of Aral to 1500
                    and 2000 feet in the southeast. They are covered with numerous folds or
                    elongated dunes (<hi rend="italic">barkhans),</hi> partly shifting partly
                    stationary, 30 to 60 feet high, and mostly parallel to each other, amidst which
                    are immense spaces covered with clay, and saline clays appear here and there on
                    the surface. The Kizil-kum varies much in its characteristics. Close by the Sea
                    of Aral it is covered with shifting sands, the result of the disintegration of
                    cretaceous sandstones; and every storm raises clouds of hot sand which render
                    communication exceedingly difficult. But even there a rich verdure covers the
                    undulations in spring. Farther east the sands lose their shifting character, and
                    the barkhans are covered with a kind of <hi rend="italic">Carex,</hi> which
                    serves as excellent food for sheep. The <hi rend="italic">Holoxylon
                        Anemodendron</hi> grows extensively on the elevated ridges and yields fuel
                    and charcoal, which last is exported to Bokhara. In the west the surface is
                    covered with remains of Aral-Caspian deposits. As the Tian-Shan is approached
                    the steppe takes another character: a thick covering of loess girdles the
                    foothills and forms the fertile soil to which Turkestan is indebted for its rich
                    fields and gardens.</p>
                <p>The Kara-kum sands, situated to the north-east of the Sea of Aral, are manifestly
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> former bottom of the lake. They are covered with
                    débris of <hi rend="italic">Cardium edule, Mytilus, Dreissena polymorpha,
                        Neritina litturata, Adacna vitrea, Hydrobia stagnatis,</hi> with remains of
                    marine <hi rend="italic">Algae {Zostera),</hi> and with fragments of <hi
                        rend="italic">Scirpus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phragmites.</hi> The
                    Kizil-kum is characterized by the presence of <hi rend="italic">Lithoglyphïes
                        caspius, H. stagnalis, Anodonta podervsa,</hi> and the sponge <hi
                        rend="italic">Metehnikowia tuberculata.</hi> The evil reputation of the
                    Kara-kum has been exaggerated to some extent; the harsh things said of it apply
                    only to the neighbourhood of the Sea of Aral. In the east the steppe has some
                    vegetation and is readily visited by the Kirghiz. The barkhans do not shift,
                    being covered with <hi rend="italic">Calligonum, Tamarix, Holoxylon
                        Anemodendron,</hi> and some rushes; shifting dunes 40 to 50 feet high occur,
                    especially towards the Sea of Aral. The Muyun-kum or Ak-kum Steppe, between the
                    Kara-tau Mountains and the Tchu, is quite uninhabited, except in the loess
                    region at the northern base of the mountains.</p>
                <p>Granites, granilites, syenites, porphyries, and various meta morphic slates
                    constitute the bulk of the western Tian-Shan Mountains. They appear also in the
                    Kara-tau and Nura-tau, and sometimes in the form of isolated islands in the
                    steppe. Silver and lead ores, as well as malachite and copper ore, are found in
                    them, especially in the Mogol-tau, and turquoises about Khojend. The crystalline
                    rocks, much metamorphosed, especially in the west, are overlain by thick
                    Devonian and Carboniferous deposits. Jurassic rocks (Rhaetic) cover small areas
                    on the slopes of the mountains. These last are all of fresh-water origin; hence
                    it would seem that throughout the Jurassic and Triassic periods Turkestan was a
                    continent intersected only by lagoons of the Jurassic sea. The Jurassic deposits
                    are most important on account of their coal-beds, which occur in the basins of
                    the Badam and Sairam and in Ferghana. Chalk and Tertiary marine deposits are
                    superimposed upon the above to the thickness of 2000 to 5000 feet, and are
                    widely spread, although they have suffered greatly from denudation. The former
                    belong to the Upper (Ferghana deposits, much resembling Senonian) and Middle
                    Chalk, and contain phosphorite, gypsum, and naphtha (in the Amu-Daria basin).
                    The Tertiary deposits, which contain gypsum and lignite, are represented by
                    nummulitic sands around the Sea of Aral, and by Oligocene and Miocene (Sarmatic)
                    deposits. In the Tian-Shan the red Tertiary conglomerates (Pliocene ?) attain a
                    great development. Throughout the Chalk and earlier Tertiary periods the
                    lowlands of Syr-Daria were under the sea. The character of the region during the
                    Post-Pliocene period remains unsettled. To what extent the mountains of the
                    western Tian-Shan were under ice during the Glacial period remains a subject of
                    controversy among geologists; many deposits, however, have been described, even
                    in the outer parts of mountain tracts, which have a decidedly Glacial character.
                    A girdle of loess, varying in width from 30 to 50 miles, encircles all the
                    mountain tracts, increasing in extent in Bokhara and at the lower end of the
                    valley of Ferghana. It seems certain that during the Lacustrine period the
                    Caspian was connected by a narrow gulf with the Aral basin, which was then much
                    larger, while another inland sea of great dimensions covered the present Balkash
                    basin, and at an earlier period may have been connected with the Aral basin.
                    Recent traces of these basins are found in the steppes.</p>
                <p>The chief river of the province is the <hi rend="smallcaps">Syr-Daria</hi> (see
                    above), with its tributaries. The frontier touches the eastern shore of the Sea
                    of Aral, and numerous small lakes, mostly salt, are scattered over the sandy
                    plains. A few lakes of alpine character occur in the valleys of the hilly
                    tracts.</p>
                <p>The climate of Syr-Daria varies greatly in its different parts. It is most severe
                    in the high treeless <hi rend="italic">syrts</hi> of the mountain region; and in
                    the lowlands it is very hot and dry. As a whole, the western parts of the
                    Tian-Shan receive but little precipitation, and are therefore very poor in
                    forests. In the lowlands the heat of the dry summer is almost insupportable, the
                    thermometer rising to 111° Fahr. in the shade; the winter is severe in the lower
                    parts of the province, where the Syr remains frozen for three months. The
                    average yearly temperature at Tashkend and Kazalinsk respectively is 54° and 44°
                    (January, 28° and 8°; July, 80° and 76°).</p>
                <p>The flora and fauna belong to two distinct regions,—to Turkestan and to the
                    Aral-Caspian depression (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turkestan).</hi> The terraces
                    of loess mentioned above are alone available for culture, and accordingly less
                    than 1 per cent. (0·8) of the total area of the province is under crops, the
                    remainder being either quite barren (57 per cent. of the surface) or pasture
                    land (42 per cent.). Although cultivation is possible only in a few oases, it is
                    there carried to great perfection owing to a highly developed system of
                    irrigation,— two crops being gathered every year. Wheat and barley come first,
                    then pease, millet, and lentils, which are grown in the autumn. Rye and oats are
                    grown only about Kazalinsk. Cotton is cultivated in the districts of Khojend,
                    Kurama, and Turkestan. Gardening is greatly developed. Sericulture is also an
                    important source of income, nearly 85 tons of silk being produced every year.
                    Cattle-breeding is largely pursued, not only by the nomads but also by the
                    settled population, and in 1881 it was estimated that Syr-Daria had 242,000
                    camels, 396,000 horses, 294,000 horned cattle, and 3,200,000 sheep. Fishing is
                    pursued to some extent on the lower Syr. Timber and firewood are exceedingly
                    dear; timber is floated down from the mountains, but in small quantities; trees
                    raised in gardens, dung, and some coal (the last in very limited quantity) are
                    used for fuel.</p>
                <p>The population of the province amounted to 1,109,500 in 1881, of whom 146,300
                    lived in towns, 326,600 were settled, and 621,600 were nomadic. It is
                    comparatively dense in certain parts, reaching 15 to 31 inhabitants per square
                    mile in Kurama and Khojend, and still more in the valley of the Tchirtchik. Its
                    ethnographical composition is very mixed. The Russians barely number 8500, if
                    the military be left out of account; they live principally in towns and about
                    Kazalinsk. Kirghiz (709,400 with the Kara-Kirghiz) and Sarts (211,000) are the
                    main elements of the population; 50,000 Tadjiks, 26,000 Uzbegs, 4500 Tatars,
                    about 77,000 Kuramints (settled Kirghiz mixed with other elements), and a few
                    Jews, Persians, and Hindus must be added. The chief occupations of the Sarts,
                    Uzbegs, Tadjiks, and Kuramints are agriculture and<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0856-0821"/> gardening, while the Kirghiz chiefly lead a
                    nomadic pastoral life. Manufactures are represented by a few distilleries; but a
                    great variety of petty industries are practised in the towns and villages. Trade
                    is carried on very largely.</p>
                <p>Syr-Daria is divided into eight districts, the chief towns of which, with their
                    populations in 1881, were— <hi rend="smallcaps">Tashkend</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Khojend (28,000), Perovsk (3400), Tchemkent (8050), and Tchinaz (300). Turkestan
                    or Agret (6700) and Ura-tube (11,000) also deserve mention. (P. A. K.)</p>
