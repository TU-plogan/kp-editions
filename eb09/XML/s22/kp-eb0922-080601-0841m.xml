                    noted what looked like an inlet, to which he gave the name of Port Jackson,
                    after Sir George Jackson, one of the secretaries to the admiralty. It may seem
                    strange that so careful an observer as Cook should have passed close to one of
                    the finest harbours in the world without recognizing its capacity; but the
                    cliffs which guard the entrance are 300 feet in height, and no view of the
                    landlocked basin can be seen from the masthead. Middle Head, which is posted
                    right opposite the entrance, closes it in, and it is necessary to enter, turn to
                    the south, and then to the west before the best part of the harbour discloses
                    itself. This topographical peculiarity gives to the port its great shelter. When
                    in 1788 Captain Phillip arrived at Botany Bay with the first convict fleet, he
                    found its shallow waters and flat shores unsuited for the purposes of a
                    settlement. Strangely enough he was also deterred by the want of water; yet it
                    is on that very shore that the pumping-engine is situated by which Sydney has
                    been supplied for many years. Going northwards, he turned in to examine Port
                    Jackson inlet. Thither the fleet was instantly removed; and Sydney was founded,
                    and Australian colonization started, on 26th January 1788. Captain Phillip’s
                    choice of a site was determined by the existence of fresh water in a small
                    stream running into Sydney Cove.</p>
                <p>The port is flanked on both sides by a number of promontories—its characteristic
                    feature—so that in addition to a broad central channel with deep water there is
                    both on the north and the south side a series of sheltered bays with good
                    anchorage. The entrance is a mile wide, with a minimum depth of 15 fathoms. Some
                    little distance inside is a rock awash, known as the Sow and Pigs, between which
                    and the nearest headlands on either side is an inner bar, with 20 feet of water
                    at low tide; through this bar on the southern side a ship channel has been
                    dredged giving 27 feet of water at neap tide. On the southern side there occur
                    in succession Watson’s Bay, Rose<pb break="no"

                    Bay, Farm Cove, Sydney Cove, Darling Harbour, Johnstone’s Bay, Blackwattle Bay,
                    Iron Cove, Five Dock Bay, Hen and Chickens Bay, besides smaller inlets. On the
                    northern side, beginning again at the Heads, there are North Harbour, Middle
                    Harbour (with many subsidiary inlets), Chowder Bay, Sirius Cove, Mossman’s Bay,
                    Shell Cove, Neutral Bay, Careening Cove, Lavender Bay, Berry’s Bay, Ball’s Head
                    Bay, Lane Cove, Tarban Creek, and other small bays. All these promontories and
                    coves give a length of water frontage which is estimated at not less than 110
                    miles. Besides these, Botany Bay, though shallow and exposed and destitute of
                    promontories, has a coastline of about 18 miles. Into it debouches George’s
                    river, which is navigable to Liverpool, a distance of 14 miles from the mouth,
                    and in which are several capacious bays.</p>
                <p>The metropolitan area of Sydney really consists of a peninsula about 13 miles in
                    length, lying between Parramatta and George’s rivers. The sea frontage of this
                    area, from the South Head of Port Jackson to the North Head of Botany Bay, is 12
                    miles in length, and consists alternately of bold cliffs and beautiful beaches.
                    Two of the latter—Bondi and Coogee—are connected with the city by tramways, and
                    are favourite places of holiday resort. Sydney occupies, therefore, a position
                    enjoying singular natural advantages.</p>
                <p>The city proper, as subsequently determined, takes in the water frontage from the
                    head of Rushcutter’s Bay on the east to the head of Blackwattle Bay on the west,
                    giving a shore-line of 8 miles, of which 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> are the frontage of the Domain and Botanic Gardens. The
                    remainder is occupied for commercial purposes, and is held partly by the
                    Government and partly by private owners. There are three large public
                    wharfs—one, known as Circular Quay, embracing the greater part of Sydney Cove,
                    seveneighths of a mile in length, the second at the head of Darling Harbour, a
                    quarter of a mile in extent, and the third at the head of Woolloomooloo Bay. The
                    rest is occupied by private wharfs, the principal of which are on the east shore
                    of Darling Harbour. A project is on foot for the resumption of the whole by the
                    Government, and the making of a uniform quay, with a railway and a new street.
                    The area of the city is 2670 acres, of which no part is more than a mile and a
                    quarter distant from the water, whilst the average distance is three-quarters of
                    a mile. The surface contour is undulating, the maximum elevation being 230 feet
                    and the average 120. The soil is sandstone, covered more or less with shaly
                    clay. Of the city area about 800 acres are devoted to public use. The largest
                    reserve is Moore Park, lying to the south-east of the city, nearly 500 acres in
                    extent—originally a waste of sandhills. On it are the rifle range, the
                    Agricultural Society’s showground, and the principal cricket ground. The Inner
                    and Outer Domains on the shore of the harbour contain about 130 acres. The
                    former contains Government House, with its private garden and paddocks; the
                    Outer Domain is a public park. The beautiful botanic gardens occupy the
                    shore-line of Farm Cove, commanding the man-of-war anchorage. Hyde Park, the
                    original race-course of the city, is about 49 acres in extent. At the north
                    entrance is a statue of Prince Albert, and on its most elevated part is one of
                    Captain Cook. Prince Alfred Park, on the southern boundary of the city,
                    originally called Cleveland Paddocks, occupies nearly<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n843/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0843-0808"/> 18 acres, and in it is the original exhibition
                    building, now much used for concerts and festive gatherings. Belmore Park
                    occupies 10 acres, and Cook and Phillip Parks each about the same area. The Fort
                    Phillip reserve is a sort of acropolis, two of its rocky sides being escarped.
                    Here, at an elevation of 146 feet, stands the astronomical observatory. Grose
                    Farm, on the soutli-west of the city, was the site of one of the earliest
                    attempts at Government farming. It is an undulating and elevated piece of land,
                    and is divided amongst the university and the affiliated colleges of St Paul, St
                    John, and St Andrew, the Prince Alfred Hospital, and Victoria Park.</p>
                <p>The city started from the banks of the Tank stream at the head of Sydney Cove,
                    and the chief business part is still in the limited area lying between Darling
                    Harbour and the Domain and Hyde Park. The streets are irregular in width, some
                    of them narrow and close together, while those leading down to Darling Harbour
                    have a steep incline. Sydney has consequently more the look of an Old-World city
                    than any other in Australia, and in its lack of spacious promenades and open
                    squares and places, and in its poor opportunity for displaying its public
                    buildings, it contrasts unfavourably with the more symmetrically planned sister
                    cities of Australia. On the other hand, it has a charm which is all its own, as
                    the glimpses of the harbour and the shipping obtainable from so many points give
                    a delightful variety to the street vistas. The principal business street is
                    George Street, 2 miles long, flanked with handsome commercial buildings. In this
                    street are the post-office, the town-hall, the cathedral, and the main railway
                    station. Only second in importance is Pitt Street, which runs nearly parallel
                    with it as far as the railway station.</p>
                <p>The public and private buildings of Old Sydney are of a primitive order of
                    architecture, but they are rapidly disappearing as the city is being rebuilt.
                    With the exception of Government House, the university and affiliated colleges,
                    and the registrar-general’s office, all the non-ecclesiastical public buildings
                    are in a classical style. Of the modern public buildings the museum, the
                    post-office, the offices for the colonial secretary, the minister for public
                    works, and the minister for lands, and the custom-house are the finest. The
                    town-hall is a fine building, but a little too florid; the great hall, when
                    finished, will be the largest in Australia. The Anglican cathedral in George
                    Street is small. A Roman Catholic cathedral, on the east side of Hyde Park,
                    replaces an earlier one that was burnt down, and will, when completed, be the
                    finest ecclesiastical edifice in the city. The mint (an adaptation of an old
                    hospital) is an imperial establishment, the cost of which is defrayed by the
                    colonists. The annual value of the coinage from local gold is about £500,000,
                    and this coinage has imperial currency. All the large public buildings are
                    constructed of Sydney sandstone, which is abundant in quantity, though variable
                    in quality. The best comes from the quarries in Pyrmont.</p>
                <p>The length of streets, lanes, and public ways is about 100 miles. These are
                    mostly macadamized, but wood paving has lately come much into favour. The
                    saleyards for cattle and sheep (area 40 acres) are 7 miles off, at Homebush. The
                    gross city revenue from all sources is about £376,000. For municipal purposes
                    the city is divided into eight wards, each returning three aldermen, and for
                    parliamentary purposes into three electorates—east, west, and south—each
                    returning four members. In 1881 the city population was 105,000. It was in 1886
                    officially estimated at 125,000. The population of the suburbs was officially
                    estimated in 1884 at 150,000, making a total metropolitan population of 275,000.
                    Communication with the suburbs<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Paddington forms practically an eastern suburb of Sydney,
                    with which there is constant omnibus communication. Victoria barracks are
                    situated within its boundaries. Paddington is inhabited chiefly by the better
                    classes, and possesses a number of public and private schools. A municipal
                    constitution was granted it in April 1860. The population of the borough in 1881
                    was 9608.</p></note> is maintained to a large extent by steam tramways, entirely
                    in the hands of the Government. The whole district between Sydney and Parramatta
                    is practically suburban for 2 miles on each side of the railway. The fashionable
                    suburbs lie to the east of Sydney, the business extension of the city being more
                    to the westward. The southern side is largely devoted to manufacturing
                    operations, and population is rapidly extending in the direction of Botany Bay.
                    The north shore of the harbour is outside the city limits, and the communication
                    is by steam ferries. The north shore has deep water close in shore, but little
                    level ground, the land rising rapidly to an elevation of 300 feet. Up this
                    ascent the Government has constructed a cable tramway, and from the railway
                    between Newcastle and Sydney, which crosses the Parramatta river 2 miles below
                    the head of the navigation, there is to be a branch line of railway to the north
                    shore, opposite the city.</p>
                <p>Water was at first obtained from the so-called Tank stream; afterwards recourse
                    was had to a lagoon on the southern slope of the dividing ridge between Port
                    Jackson and Botany Bay, from which an artificial tunnel, known as Busby’s Bore,
                    brought the water into the city at the level of Hyde Park. When a further supply
                    was wanted the same watercourse was utilized, the works being constructed at the
                    point where it flowed into Botany Bay. A scheme is now (1886) in course of
                    execution to bring water from the Upper Nepean, at a point 63 miles from Sydney.
                    Two streams running in deep sandstone gorges are connected by a tunnel, and
                    their united waters are brought in an open conduit. From the nature of the
                    ground no large reservoir is possible near its source; but about 15 miles from
                    Sydney, at Prospect, near Parramatta, a dam thrown across a valley makes a
                    storage reservoir that will hold a year’s supply. From that point the water is
                    taken by open canal and piping to the existing reservoir in Crown Street, the
                    limited area at a higher level being supplied by pumping. The delivery into the
                    city will be over 150,000,000 gallons daily, and the cost of the whole works
                    will exceed £1,500,000.</p>
                <p>The old system of sewerage having several outfalls along the city front proved so
                    objectionable that a new system has been designed, and is in course of
                    execution, whereby the harbour will be preserved from all pollution. A great
                    drain is carried from the city to the ocean at a projecting headland north of
                    Bondi Bay known as Ben Buckler, where the sewage will go at once into deep water
                    with a southerly current. The mouth of the sewer, though exposed to the beat of
                    the ocean in very heavy weather, is 6 feet above high-water mark, and from that
                    point it rises with a uniform inclination of 1 in 109, and in a nearly straight
                    line, for a distance of 4 miles 25 chains. This main sewer, which throughout is
                    one continuous monolith in concrete, passes in tunnels under the rocky ridges,
                    and on concrete arches across the intervening flats. It diminishes in size from
                    8½ by 7½ feet to 5 feet 1 inch by 4 feet 1 inch, and at the upper end it
                    bifurcates to accommodate two separate districts. It is of an oblate, oviform
                    section, as nearly circular as is consistent with a minimum velocity of 2¼ feet
                    a second. It drains an area of 4282 acres, and is calculated to discharge all
                    the sewage when this area is populated as thickly as London, together with half
                    an inch of rain per day. The bulk of the storm water is to pass off by surface
                    drains. The sewage of the zone of land along the foreshore is to be lifted into
                    the main sewer. From the southern slope of Sydney another large sewer runs
                    southwards, and, crossing the mouth of Cook’s River by a siphon, discharges its
                    contents upon a sandy peninsula well suited for the purpose of a sewage
                    farm.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the port of Sydney is in the hands of a marine board, of
                    which three members are elected by the shipping interest, and three others and
                    the president are nominated by the Government. They have the control of the
                    pilot service, which is entirely a Government department. A new lighthouse has
                    recently been erected on the South Head cliff, fitted with a powerful electric
                    light, which is visible 27 miles off. The quarantine ground on North Head is
                    isolated from the adjacent watering-place of Manly Beach by a fence and a broad
                    belt of unoccupied land. Ships in quarantine anchor in a sheltered position off
                    the beach, where a hospital ship is also stationed.</p>
                <p>Port Jackson being the chief naval depot of Australasia and the headquarters of
                    the admiral’s station, the fortifications of the harbour have engaged the
                    attention of successive Governments. The inner line of defence constructed by
                    Sir William Denison has been superseded by more elaborate works. On the north
                    side of the harbour Middle Head, George’s Head, and Bradley’s Head have powerful
                    guns which cross fire with those on the South Head, completely commanding the
                    entrance to the channel. There is also a very effective torpedo service. Garden
                    Island, off the mouth of Woolloomooloo Bay, has been handed over to the imperial
                    Government as a naval depot; the man-of-war anchorage is close under its lee,
                    and the colonial Government has constructed all necessary wharfs and
                    store-houses. There is a Government dock at Cockatoo Island capable of
                    accommodating the largest vessels, with a machine-shop close by. Adjoining this
                    a new dock is being hewn out of the sandstone 600 feet in length and 108 feet
                    wide; the depth of water over the sill at spring tide is to be 32 feet, and at
                    neap tide 29 feet 6 inches, and the width at the entrance 84 feet. Mort’s Dock
                    and Engineering Company have a large dock at Waterview Bay capable of taking in
                    all the ordinary mail steamers. There is also a patent slip, which can take up
                    vessels of 1000 tons, and a second is in course of construction for vessels of
                    1500 tons. The graving-dock is 410 feet long. Besides this, there are other

                <p>Sydney is in the centre of a great coal-basin, the eastern part of which is
                    supposed to be under the sea; whether a workable seam exists under the city
                    itself, and, if so, at what depth, is at present undetermined, borings of 2000
                    feet having as yet failed to strike the coal. The seams crop out at Lake
                    Macquarie, north of Sydney, and dip to the south; they also rise to the surface
                    at the south of Sydney, where they dip to the north. Twenty-four miles south of
                    Sydney the seam has been found at a depth of 850 feet, and at<pb break="no"

                    of 600 feet. Coal is also brought into the city by railway from the Blue
                    Mountains and from the Mittagong district, but it is inferior in quality to that
                    mined on the coast.</p>
                <p>The abundance and cheapness of coal, as well as the natural and commercial
                    advantages of Sydney, have been favourable to certain lines of manufacturing
                    industry, notwithstanding the high price of labour. In addition to the
                    industries connected with shipping, those connected with the pastoral industry
                    have also been developed, such as tanning, glue-making, meat - preserving,
                    &amp;c. The large railway works have, under the patronage of the Government, led
                    to the manufacture of locomotives, and nearly all the rolling stock is made in
                    the colonies. Omnibuses, cabs, carriages, buggies, drays, and carts are made in
                    every variety and of excellent quality, as is also harness. Bootmaking is an
                    extensive business; there are also manufactories of tobacco, sugar, kerosene,
                    spirits, beer, tweed, paper, furniture, glass, pottery, and stoves, as well as a
                    great variety of minor industries.</p>
                <p>Public schools abound, with merely nominal fees. There is a high school for boys
                    and girls. The grammar-school, with an attendance of 400 boys, receives from
                    Government £1500 a year, with the free use of the buildings. To the handsome
                    university buildings a medical school is now being added. The great hall is the
                    finest Gothic building in Australasia. The university is a teaching as well as
                    examining institution, degrees being given in the four faculties of arts,
                    medicine, law, and science. The university, which is governed by a senate
                    elected by the graduates, has a Government endowment of £12,000 a year, and has
                    been enriched by several donations and bequests (amounting to £250,000, of which
                    about £180,000 by Mr Challis). To it are attached three denominational
                    affiliated colleges, one belonging to the Anglican Church, one to the Roman
                    Catholic, and one to the Presbyterian; to each the Government contributed the
                    land, £10,000 towards the building fund, and an annual stipend of £500 a year
                    for the principal. Technical education is conducted under the auspices of a
                    board supported entirely at the cost of the Government. The pupils already
                    number more than a thousand, and the attendance at the classes is steadily
                    increasing. There is a good school of arts, with 400 members, and a good
                    circulating library. The public free library is supported by the Government, and
                    to it is attached a lending branch. The Royal Society has a roll of 500 members,
                    meets periodically for the reading and discussion of scientific papers,
                    publishes its transactions, and lias a small library. The Linnaean Society is
                    also well supported, and a Geographical Society has lately been started. The
                    museum, in College Street, is managed by trustees and supported wholly at the
                    cost of the Government. There is a small museum attached to the university, to
                    which Mr Macleay has bequeathed his collection, which is especially rich in
                    natural history.</p>
                <p>Sydney has many charitable institutions. It has three hospitals, the newest and
                    largest, which is close to the university, having been built after the best
                    European models. There are three large lunatic asylums in the suburbs; the
                    latest is on the pavilion principle. The benevolent asylum, which is mainly
                    supported by the Government, gives a large amount of outdoor assistance, takes
                    in all waifs and strays, and acts as a lying-in hospital. Old men are provided
                    for in an institution at Liverpool. At Randwick is an asylum for destitute
                    children, which receives a large amount of Government support; and there are two
                    orphan asylums at Parramatta; but the state children are now being boarded out
                    under the auspices of a Government board. There are two soup-kitchens and
                    refuges, supported by private contributions, and also a charity organization
                    society. There is a home visiting and relief society, intended principally for
                    those who have known better days, and a prisoners’ aid society, besides numerous
                    friendly societies. All the churches are well represented, and to each is
                    attached one or more charitable agencies.</p>
                <p>The climate of Sydney is mild and moderately equable. It resembles closely the
                    climate of Toulon. The mean temperature is 62°·6 Fahr. and the extreme range of
                    the shade thermometer is from 106° to 36° Fahr. The sea-breeze which prevails
                    during the summer comes from the north-east, and, while it tempers the heat,
                    makes the air moist and induces languor. In winter the prevailing wind is from
                    the west, and the air is dry and bracing. The annual rainfall is 50 inches. The
                    hot north-west wind of summer sometimes sends the humidity down below 30°, and
                    once it has been as low as 16°. In the cool westerly winds of winter it seldom
                    falls to 55°, and never below 45°. The average humidity for the year is 74°. The
                    mean tide is 3 feet 3 inches. (A. GA. )</p>
