                <p>It would appear from a recent discovery by Mr R. B. Knowles<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">The Spending of the
                    Money of Robert Nowell,</hi> privately printed, 1877.</p></note> that the
                    relationship of the poet to the noble family of Spencer, if it existed at
                    all—and official names such as Spenser (Dispenser) or Stewart (Steward) carry no
                    proof of consanguinity—was remote, and that the poet’s kinsmen must be sought
                    among the humbler Spensers of north-east Lancashire. Robert Nowell, a London
                    citizen, left a sum of money to be distributed in various charities, and in the
                    account-books of his executors Mr Knowles has discovered among the names of
                    other beneficiaries “Edmund Spensore, scholar of the Merchant Taylor School, at
                    his going to Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.” The date of this benefaction is 28th
                    April 1569. As the poet is known to have been a sizar of Pembroke, the
                    identification is beyond dispute. Till this discovery it was not known where
                    Spenser received his school education. The speculations as to the poet’s
                    parentage started by the Nowell MS. are naturally more uncertain. Mr Knowles
                    found three Spensers in the books of the Merchant Taylors, and concluded that
                    the poorest of them, John Spenser, a “free journeyman” in the “art or mystery of
                    clothmaking,” might have been the poet’s father, but he afterwards abandoned
                    this theory. Mr Grosart, however, adheres to it, and gives a confident solution
                    of Mr Knowles’s difficulties. Nothing approaching certainty can be reached on
                    the point, which is not itself of much importance. The connexion of Spenser with
                    Lancashire is also supported by the Nowell MS. Several Spensers of that county
                    appear among the “poor kinsfolk” who profited by Nowell’s bounty.</p>
                <p>It is natural that a poet so steeped in poetry as Spenser should show his faculty
                    at a very early age; and there is strong reason to believe that verses from his
                    pen were published just as he left school at the age of sixteen or seventeen.
                    Certain pieces, translations from Du Bellay and Petrarch, afterwards included in
                    a volume of poems by Spenser published in 1591, are found in a miscellany, <hi
                    rend="italic">Theatre for Worldings,</hi> issued by a Flemish Protestant
                    refugee, John van der Noodt, on the 25th of May 1569. The translations from Du
                    Bellay appear in blank verse in the miscellany, and are rhymed in sonnet form in
                    the later publication, but the diction is substantially the same; the
                    translations from Petrarch are republished with slight variations. Poets were so
                    careless of their rights in those days and publishers took such liberties that
                    we cannot draw for certain the conclusion that would be inevitable if the facts
                    were of more modern date; but the probabilities are that these passages in Van
                    der Noodt’s <hi rend="italic">Theatre,</hi> although the editor makes no
                    acknowledgment, were contributed by the schoolboy Spenser. As the exercises of a
                    schoolboy writing before our poetic diction was enriched by the great
                    Elizabethans, they are remarkable for a sustained command of expression which
                    many schoolboys might ex-<pb break="no"

                    and more significant accomplishment when Surrey and Sackville were the highest
                    models in post-Chaucerian English.</p>
                <p>Little is known of Spenser’s Cambridge career, except that he was a sizar of
                    Pembroke Hall, took his bachelor’s degree in 1572, his master’s in 1576, and
                    left Cambridge without having obtained a fellowship. Mr Grosart’s inquiries have
                    elicited the fact that his health was not good,—college allowances while he was
                    in residence being often paid “Spenser aegrotanti.” One of the fellows of
                    Pembroke strongly influenced his destiny. This was Gabriel Harvey, a prominent
                    figure in the university life of the time, an enthusiastic educationist,
                    vigorous, versatile, not a little vain of his own culture and literary powers,
                    which had gained him a certain standing in London society. The revival and
                    advancement of English literature was a passion of the time, and Harvey was
                    fully possessed by it. His fancy for reforming English verse by discarding rhyme
                    and substituting unrhymed classical metres, and the tone of his controversy with
                    Thomas Nash, have caused him to be regarded as merely an obstreperous and
                    pragmatic pedant; but it is clear that Spenser, who had sense enough not to be
                    led astray by his eccentricities, received active and generous help from him and
                    probably not a little literary stimulus. Harvey’s letters to Spenser<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Letter-Book
                    of Gabriel Harvey,</hi> Camden Society.</p></note> throw a very kindly light on
                    his character.</p>
                <p>Three years after leaving Cambridge, in 1579, Spenser issued his first volume of
                    poetry, the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar.</hi> Where and how he spent
                    the interval have formed subjects for elaborate speculation. That most of it was
                    spent in the study of his art we may take for granted. That he lived for a time
                    in the “north parts” of England; that there or elsewhere he fell in love with a
                    lady whom he celebrates under the anagram of “Rosalind”; that his friend Harvey
                    urged him to return south, and introduced him to Sir Philip Sidney; that Sidney
                    took to him, discussed poetry with him, introduced him at court, put him in the
                    way of preferment,—are ascertained facts in his personal history. Mr Grosart
                    conjectures with considerable plausibility that he was in Ireland in 1577 in the
                    service of Sir Henry Sidney, Philip’s father, and returned to England with that
                    administrator in 1578.</p>
                <p>The interest of the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar</hi> is mainly personal
                    to Spenser. Its twelve poems continue to be read chiefly because they were the
                    first published essays of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen,</hi>
                    the poems in which he tried and disciplined his powers. They mark no stage in
                    the history of pastoral poetry. Spenser had too strong a genius not to make his
                    own individuality felt in any form that he attempted, and his buoyant dexterity
                    in handling various schemes of verse must always afford delight to the
                    connoisseur in such things. But a reader not already interested in Spenser, or
                    not already familiar with the artificial eclogue, would find little to attract
                    him in the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar.</hi> The poems need a special
                    education; given this, they are felt to be full of charm and power, a fresh and
                    vivid spring to the splendid summer of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen.</hi>
                    The diction is a studiously archaic artificial compound, partly Chaucerian,
                    partly North Anglian, partly factitious; and the pastoral scenery is such as may
                    be found in any country where there are sheep, hills, trees, shrubs, toadstools,
                    and running streams. That Spenser, having been in the north of England, should
                    have introduced here and there a touch of north country colour is natural
                    enough, but it is not sufficient to give a character to the poems as pastoral
                    poems. As such they follow continuously and do not violently break away from
                    Latin, Italian, and French predecessors, and Mr George Saintsbury is undoubtedly
                    right in indicating Marot as the most immediate model. At the same time one can
                    quite understand on historical grounds why the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd’s
                    Calendar</hi> was hailed with enthusiasm as the advent of a “new poet.” Not only
                    was it a complete work in a form then new to English literature, but the
                    execution showed the hand of a master. There had been nothing so finished, so
                    sustained, so masterful in grasp, so brilliant in metre and phrase, since
                    Chaucer. It was felt at once that the poet for whom the age had been waiting had
                    come. The little coterie of friends whose admiration the young poet had won in
                    private were evidently concerned lest the wider public should be bewildered and
                    repelled by the unfamiliar pastoral form and rustic diction. To put the public
                    at the right point of view the poems were published with a commentary by “E.
                    K.,”— supposed to be one Edward Kirke, who was an undergraduate with Spenser at
                    Pembroke. This so-called “glosse” explained the archaic words, revealed the
                    poet’s intentions, and boasted that, as in the case of Virgil, the pastoral
                    poetry of the “new poet” was but “a proving of the wings for higher and wider
                    flights.” The “new poet’s” name was withheld; and the identification of the
                    various “shepherds”—of Cuddie and Roffy and Diggon Davie, and the beauteous
                    golden-haired “widow’s daughter of the glen ”— was fortunately reserved to yield
                    delight to the ingenious curiosity of a later age.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Shepherds Calendar</hi> was published at Gabriel Harvey’s
                    instance, and was dedicated to Sir Philip Sidney. It was one out of many
                    poetical schemes on which the young poet was busy in the flush of conscious
                    power and high hopes excited by the admiration of the literary authorities whose
                    approval was then most to be coveted. His letters to Harvey and Harvey’s letters
                    to him furnish hints for a very engaging fancy picture of Spenser at this stage
                    of his life,—looking at the world through rose-coloured spectacles, high in
                    favour with Sidney and Leicester, dating his letters from Leicester House, gaily
                    and energetically discussing the technicalities of his art, with some provision
                    from his powerful friends—certain, but the form of it delightfully
                    uncertain,—going to court in the train of Leicester, growing pointed beard and
                    mustachios of fashionable shape, and frightening his ever-vigilant friend and
                    mentor Harvey by the light courtier-like tone of his references to women. The
                    studious pastoral poet from “north parts” had blossomed with surprising rapidity
                    in the image of the gay fortune-seeking adventurers who crowded the court of the
                    virgin queen in those stirring times. Some of the poems which he mentions to
                    Harvey as then completed or on the anvil—his <hi rend="italic">Dreams,</hi> his
                    <hi rend="italic">Nine Comedies,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Dying Pelican,</hi>
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Stemmata Dudleiana</hi> (singing the praises of the
                    noble family which was befriending him)—have not been preserved, at least in any
                    form that can be certainly identified. He had sent Harvey a portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faery Queen,</hi> which he was eager to continue; but Harvey did
                    not think much of it—a judgment for which Harvey is often ridiculed as a dull
                    pedant, as if we knew for certain that what was submitted to him was identical
                    with what was published ten years later.</p>
                <p>Spenser was appointed secretary to the lord-deputy of Ireland in 1580, and was
                    one of the band of adventurers who, with mixed motives of love of excitement,
                    patriotism, piety, and hopes of forfeited estates, accompanied Lord Arthur Grey
                    of Wilton to Ireland to aid in the suppression of Desmond’s rebellion. Regret is
                    sometimes expressed that the author of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen,</hi>
                    who ought to have been dreamy, meditative, gentle, and refined, should have been
                    found in such company, and should have taken part in the violent and bloody
                    scenes of Lord Grey’s two years’ attempt at “pacification.” But such things must
                    be judged with reference to the circumstances and the spirit of the time, and it
                    must be remembered that England was then engaged in a fierce struggle for
                    existence against the Catholic powers of the Continent. Of Lord Grey’s character
                    his secretary was an enthusiastic admirer, exhibiting him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> as Arthegal, the personification of justice; and
                    we know exactly what were his own views of Irish policy, and how strongly he
                    deplored that Lord Grey was not permitted to carry them out. Spenser’s <hi
                    rend="italic">View of the State of Ireland,</hi> drawn up after fourteen years’
                    experience, is not the work of a gentle dreamer, but of an energetic and shrewd
                    public official.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">View</hi> is not a descriptive work; there is nothing in
                    the style to indicate that it was written by a poet; it is an elaborate state
                    paper, the exposition in the form of a dialogue of a minutely considered plan
                    for the pacification of Ireland, written out of zeal for the public service for
                    the eyes of the Government of the day. A very thoroughgoing plan it is. After
                    passing in review the history and character of the Irish, their laws, customs,
                    religion, habits of life, armour, dress, social institutions, and finding “evil
                    usages” in every department, he propounds his plan of “reformation.” Reformation
                    can be effected only by the sword, by the strong hand. The interlocutor in the
                    dialogue holds up his hands in horror. Does he propose extermination? By no
                    means; but he would give the Irish a choice between submission and
                    extermination. The Government had vacillated too long, and, fearing the cost of
                    a thorough operation, had spent twice as much without<pb break="no"

                    Ireland 10,000 foot and 1000 horse, disperse them in garrisons—a complete scheme
                    of localities is submitted,—give the Irish twenty days to come in; if they did
                    not come in then, give no quarter afterwards, but hunt them down like wild
                    beasts in the winter time when the covert is thin; “if they be well followed one
                    winter, ye shall have little work to do with them the next summer”; famine would
                    complete the work of the sword; and in eighteen months’ time peace would be
                    restored and the ground cleared for plantation by English colonists. There must
                    be no flinching in the execution of this plan,—“no remorse or drawing back for
                    the sight of any such rueful object as must thereupon follow, nor for compassion
                    of their calamities, seeing that by no other means it is possible to recover
                    them, and that these are not of will but of very urgent necessity.” The
                    Government had out of foolish compassion drawn back before when Lord Grey had
                    brought the recalcitrant Irish to the necessary extremity of famine; the gentle
                    poet warns them earnestly against a repetition of the blunder.</p>
                <p>Such was Spenser’s plan for the pacification of Ireland, propounded not on his
                    own authority, but as having support in “the consultations and actions of very
                    wise governors and counsellors, whom he had sometimes heard treat thereof.” He
                    knew that it was “bloody and cruel but he contended passionately that it was
                    necessary for the maintenance of English power and the Protestant religion.
                    Commentary on the plan, which has been so much and so warmly discussed, would be
                    out of place here. The method was repugnant to the kindly nature of average
                    Englishmen; from the time of Lord Grey no English authority had the heart to go
                    through with it till another remorseless zealot appeared in the person of
                    Cromwell. That Cromwell knew the treatise of “the sage and serious Spenser,”
                    perhaps through Milton, is probable from the fact that the poet’s Irish estates
                    were secured to his grandson by the Protector’s intervention in 1657. These
                    estates had been granted to Spenser as his share in the redistribution of
                    Munster,—3000 acres of land and Kilcol-man castle, an ancient seat of the
                    Desmonds, in the north of the county of Cork. The elaborate and business-like
                    character of the <hi rend="italic">View</hi> shows that the poet was no
                    sinecurist, but received his reward for substantial political services. He
                    ceased to be secretary to the lord-deputy when Lord Grey was recalled in 1582;
                    but he continued in the public service, and in 1586 was promoted to the onerous
                    position of clerk to the council of Munster.</p>
                <p>Amidst all the distractions of his public life in Ireland, Spenser seems to have
                    proceeded steadily with the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Faery
                    Queen,</hi> translating his varied experience of men and affairs into the
                    picturesque forms of his allegory, and expressing through them his conception of
                    the immutable principles that ought to regulate human conduct. He had, as we
                    have seen, conceived a work of the kind and made a beginning before he left
                    England. The conception must have been very much deepened and widened and in
                    every way enriched by his intimate daily contact with the actual struggle of
                    conflicting individuals and interests and policies in a great crisis. Some four
                    or five years later, being asked in a mixed company of English officials in
                    Ireland (as recorded in Lodowick Bryskett’s <hi rend="italic">Discourse of Civil
                    Life)</hi> to give offhand a short sketch of “the ethical part of moral
                    philosophy” and the practical uses of the study, Spenser explained to these
                    simple-minded men that the subject was too intricate for an impromptu
                    exposition, but that he had in hand a work called the <hi rend="italic">Faery
                    Queen</hi> in which an ethical system would be exhibited in action. The respect
                    paid by his official brethren to Spenser as a man, “not only perfect in the
                    Greek tongue, but also very well read in philosophy, both moral and natural,” is
                    an interesting item in his biography. Some years later still, when Spenser was
                    settled at Kil-colman castle, Sir Walter Raleigh found him with three books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> completed, and urged him to come with
                    them to London. London accordingly he re visited in 1589, after nine years’
                    absence. There is a very pretty record of this visit in <hi rend="italic">Colin
                    Clout's Come Home Again,</hi> published in 1595, but written in 1591,
                    immediately after his return to Kilcolman. The incidents of the visit, by that
                    time matters of wistful memory, are imaged as a shepherd’s excursion from his
                    quiet pastoral life into the great world. Colin Clout calls round him once again
                    the masked figures of the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd’s Calendar,</hi> and
                    describes to them what he saw, how he fared, and whom he met at the court of
                    Cynthia, and how through the influence of “the Shepherd of the Ocean” he was
                    admitted at timely hours to play on his oaten pipe in the great queen’s
                    presence.</p>
                <p>How much is pure fiction and how much veiled fact in this picture cannot now be
                    distinguished, but it is undoubted that Spenser, though his chief patrons
                    Leicester and Sidney were now dead, was very graciously received by the great
                    world on his return to London. Not only did the queen grant him an audience, but
                    many ladies of the court, several of whom he afterwards honoured with
                    dedications, honoured him with their patronage. The first three books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Faery Queen,</hi> which were entered at Stationers’ Hall on the
                    1st December 1589, were published in 1590, and he was proclaimed at once with
                    remarkable unanimity by all the writers of the time as the first of living
                    poets.</p>
                <p>From the first week of its publication the literary world has continued unanimous
                    about the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen,</hi> except on minor points. None of
                    our great poets has been welcomed with such universal acclaim and upheld without
                    loss of favour through so many changes of fashion. When romanticism was at its
                    lowest ebb Pope read Spenser in his old age with as much delight as in his
                    boyhood. He speaks himself of having had his detractors, of having suffered from
                    the venomous tooth of the Blatant Beast, and he seems to have had in more than
                    ordinary share the poet’s sensitiveness to criticism; but the detractors or
                    indifferentists have generally been found among men who, like the lord high
                    treasurer Burghley, have no liking for poetry of any kind. The secret of
                    Spenser’s enduring popularity with poets and lovers of poetry lies specially in
                    this that he excels in the poet’s peculiar gift, the instinct for verbal music.
                    Shakespeare, or the author of the sonnet usually assigned to him, felt and
                    expressed this when he drew the parallel between “music and sweet poetry”—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">“Thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound</l>
                    <l part="N">That Phoebus’ lute, the queen of music, makes;</l>
                    <l part="N">And I in deep delight am chiefly drowned</l>
                    <l part="N">Whenas himself to singing he betakes.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>This is an early word in criticism of Spenser, and it is the last word about his
                    prime and unquestionable excellence,—a word in which all critics must agree.
                    Whether he had imagination in the highest degree or only luxuriant fancy, and
                    whether he could tell a story in the highest epic manner or only put together a
                    richly varied series of picturesque incidents, are disputable points; but about
                    the enchantment of his verse there can be no difference of opinion. It matters
                    not in the least that he gains his melody often by archaic affectations,
                    licences of diction that should make Dr Richard Morris “stare and gasp”; there,
                    however purchased, the marvellously rich music is. In judging of the structure
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> we must always remember that, long and
                    diffuse as it is, what we have is but a fragment of the poet’s design, and that
                    the narrative is regulated by an allegorical purpose; but, however intricate,
                    however confused, the reader may feel the succession of incidents to be, when he
                    studies the succession of incidents, it is only at the call of duty that he is
                    likely to occupy himself with such a study in reading Spenser.</p>
                <p>The ethical value of the allegory has been very variously estimated. The world
                    would probably never have divined that there was any allegory if he had not
                    himself drawn attention to it in a prose dedication and in doggerel headings to
                    the cantos. It was apparently at his friend Raleigh’s suggestion that the poet
                    condescended to explain his ethical purpose; otherwise it would have been as
                    problematical as the similar intention in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Idyls of the King</hi> before that intention was expressly declared. It is
                    almost to be regretted, as far as the allegory is concerned, that the friendly
                    “E. K.” was not employed to furnish a “glosse” to the <hi rend="italic">Faery
                    Queen</hi> as he had done to the <hi rend="italic">Shepherds Calendar.</hi>
                    Undoubtedly the peculiar “poetic luxury” of the <hi rend="italic">Faery
                    Queen</hi> can be enjoyed without any reference to the allegory; even Professor
                    Dowden, the most eloquent champion of Spenser’s claims as a "teacher,” admits
                    that it is a mistake to look for minute correspondence between outward symbol
                    and underlying sense, and that the poet is least enjoyable where he is most
                    ingenious. Still the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n418/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0418-0395"/> allegory governs the structure of the poem, and
                    Spenser himself attached great importance to it as determining his position
                    among poets. The ethical purpose is distinctive of the poem as a whole; it was
                    foremost in Spenser’s mind when he conceived the scheme of the poem, and present
                    with him as he built up and articulated the skeleton; it was in this respect
                    that he claimed to have “overpassed” his avowed models Ariosto and Tasso. If we
                    wish to get an idea of Spenser’s imaginative force and abundance, or to see his
                    creations as he saw them, we must not neglect the allegory. It is obvious from
                    all that he says of his own work that in his eyes the ethical meaning not only
                    heightened the interest of the marvellously rich pageant of heroes and heroines,
                    enchanters and monsters, but was the one thing that redeemed it from romantic
                    commonplace. For the right appreciation of many of the characters and incidents
                    a knowledge of the allegory is indispensable. For example, the slaughter of
                    Error by the Red Cross knight would be merely disgusting but for its symbolic
                    character; the iron Talus and his iron flail is a revolting and brutally cruel
                    monster if he is not regarded as an image of the executioner of righteous law;
                    the Blatant Beast, a purely grotesque and ridiculous monster to outward view,
                    acquires a serious interest when he is known to be an impersonation of malignant
                    detraction.</p>
                <p>After the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> Spenser seems to
                    have remained in London for more than a year, to enjoy his triumph. It might be
                    supposed, from what he makes the Shepherd of the Ocean say in urging Colin Clout
                    to quit his banishment in Ireland, that Raleigh had encouraged him to expect
                    some permanent provision in London. If he had any such hopes they were
                    disappointed. The thrifty queen granted him a pension of £50, which was paid in
                    February 1591, but nothing further was done for him. Colin Clout’s explanation
                    that the selfish scrambling and intriguing of court life were not suited to a
                    lowly shepherd swain, and that he returned to country life with relief, may be
                    pastoral convention, or it may have been an expression of the poet’s real
                    feelings on his return to Kilcolman, although as a matter of fact there seems to
                    have been as much scrambling for good things in Munster as in London. Certain it
                    is that he did return to Kilcolman in the course of the year 1591, having
                    probably first arranged for the publication of <hi rend="italic">Daphnaida</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Complaints. Daphnaida</hi> is a pastoral elegy on the
                    death of the niece of the mistress of the robes. The fact implied in the
                    dedication that he was not personally known to the lady has more than once
                    provoked the solemn remark that the poet’s grief was assumed. Of course it was
                    assumed; and it is hardly less obvious that sincerity of personal emotion, so
                    far from being a merit in the artificial forms of pastoral poetry, the essence
                    of which lies in its dreamy remoteness from real life, would be a blemish and a
                    discord. Any suggestion of the poet’s real personality breaks the charm; once
                    raise the question of the poet’s personal sincerity and the pastoral poem may at
                    once be thrown aside. The remark applies to all Spenser’s minor poetry,
                    including his love-sonnets; the reader who raises the question whether Spenser
                    really loved his mistress may have a talent for disputation but none for the
                    full enjoyment of hyperbolical poetry. <hi rend="italic">Complaints,</hi> also
                    published in 1591, is a miscellaneous collection of poems written at different
                    periods. The volume contained <hi rend="italic">The Ruins of Time; The Tears of
                    the Muses; Virgil’s Gnat</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Mother Hubbard’s Tale; The
                    Ruins of Rome; Muiopotmos;</hi> Visions <hi rend="italic">of the World's Vanity;
                    Bellay’s Visions · Petrarch’s Visions.</hi> Some of these pieces are
                    translations already alluded to and interesting only as the exercises of one of
                    our greatest masters of melodious verse; but two of them, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tears of the Muses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mother Hubbard’s Tale,</hi> have
                    greater intrinsic interest. The first is the complaint of the decay of learning
                    alluded to in <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night’s Dream,</hi> V. 1, 52—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">“The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</l>
                    <l part="N">Of Learning late deceased in beggary.”</l>
                </lg>
                <p>The lament, at a time when the Elizabethan drama was “mewing its mighty youth,”
                    was not so happy as some of Spenser’s political prophecies in his <hi
                    rend="italic">View of Ireland;</hi> but it is idle work to try to trace the
                    undercurrents and personal allusions in such an occasional pamphlet. <hi
                    rend="italic">Mother Hubbards Tale,</hi> a fable in Chaucerian couplets, shows a
                    keenness of satiric force not to be paralleled in any other of Spenser’s
                    writings, and suggests that he left the court in a mood very different from
                    Colin Clout’s.</p>
                <p>Spenser returned to London probably in 1595. He had married in the interval a
                    lady whose Christian name was Elizabeth,—Mr Grosart says Elizabeth Boyle. The
                    marriage, celebrated on the 11th of June 1594, was followed by a rapid
                    succession of publications. The first was a volume (entered at Stationers’ Hall,
                    19th November 1594, published 1595) containing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amoretti,</hi> a series of exquisite sonnets commemorative of the moods and
                    incidents of his courtship, and the magnificent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epithalamion,</hi> incomparably the finest of his minor poems. As in the case
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Complaints,</hi> the publisher for obvious reasons
                    issued this volume nominally without his authority. <hi rend="italic">Colin
                    Clout's Come Home Again</hi> was published in the same year, with a dedication
                    to Sir Walter Raleigh, dated 1591. Early in 1596 the second three books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> were entered in the register of Stationers’
                    Hall; and in the course of the same year were published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Four Hymns,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Prothalamion,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Astrophel,</hi> a pastoral lament for Sir Philip Sidney, which he
                    dedicated to the countess of Essex.</p>
                <p>That Spenser wrote more of the <hi rend="italic">Faery Queen</hi> during the last
                    two years of his life, and that the MS. perished in the sack of Kilcolman castle
                    by the rebels, may plausibly be conjectured, but cannot be ascertained. During
                    those years he would seem to have been largely occupied with political and
                    personal cares. He describes himself in the <hi rend="italic">Prothalamion</hi>
                    as a disappointed suitor at court. He drew up his <hi rend="italic">View of
                    Ireland</hi> in 1596 when he was in London, and from various circumstances it is
                    evident that he had hopes of some kind from the favour of Essex. The <hi
                    rend="italic">View</hi>, with its urgent entreaty that Essex should be sent to
                    Ireland, was entered at Stationers’ Hall in April 1598, but he did not obtain
                    leave to publish it. Burghley, who had long stood in his way, died in August of
                    that year, and next month Spenser was appointed sheriff of Cork. In October
                    Tyrone’s rebellion broke out, and Spenser’s house was sacked and burned. The
                    poet himself escaped, and in December was sent to London with despatches. Again
                    he ventured to urge upon the queen his plan for the thorough “reformation” of
                    Ireland. But his own end was near. On 16th January 1599 he died at Westminster,
                    ruined in fortune, if not heart-broken, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,
                    near his master Chaucer.</p>
                <p>There have been many editions of Spenser’s works. The most available and complete
                    is the Globe edition, with a carefully edited text by Dr R. Morris, and a memoir
                    by Professor J. W. Hales. Mr Grosart’s edition, with its keenly argumentative
                    biography and copious collection of variorum researches and critical opinions,
                    is printed for private circulation. (W. M. )</p>
