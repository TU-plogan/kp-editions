                    (1755-1834), subject painter, was born in London on August 17, 1755, the son of
                    a well-to-do innkeeper in Long Acre. Being a delicate child, he was sent at the
                    age of five to a relative in Yorkshire, and attended school at Acomb, and
                    afterwards at Tadcastle and at Ilford in Essex. Showing a turn for drawing he
                    was apprenticed to a draughtsman of patterns for brocaded silks in Spitalfields,
                    and during his leisure hours he attempted illustrations to the works of his
                    favourite poets. Some of these drawings were praised by Harrison, the editor of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Novelist’s Library,</hi> and, Stothard’s master having
                    died, he resolved to devote himself to art. In 1778 he became a student of the
                    Royal Academy, of which he was elected associate in 1791, full academician in
                    1794, and librarian in 1817. He married before he was thirty; and it is recorded
                    that, after attending the wedding ceremony, he spent the afternoon in quietly
                    drawing in the schools, and, on leaving, requested a fellow student to accompany
                    him “to a family party.” “Do come,” he said, “for I have this day taken unto
                    myself a wife.” He died in London on the 27th of April 1834.</p>
                <p>Among his earliest book illustrations are plates engraved for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ossian</hi> and for <hi rend="italic">Bell's Poets·,</hi> and in 1780 he became
                    a regular contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Novelist's Library,</hi> for
                    which he executed one hundred and forty-eight designs, including his eleven
                    admirable illustrations to <hi rend="italic">Peregrine Pickle</hi> and his
                    graceful subjects from <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi> and Sir <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charles Grandison.</hi> Soon his hands were full of work, for all commissions
                    were welcome to him. He contentedly designed plates for pocket-books, tickets
                    for concerts, illustrations to almanacs, portraits of popular players,—and into
                    even the slightest and most trivial sketches he infused a grace and distinction
                    which render them of value to the collectors of the present time. Among his more
                    important series are the two sets of illustrations to <hi rend="italic">Robinson
                    Crusoe,</hi> and the plates to <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>
                    (1788), to <hi rend="italic">The Rape of the Lock</hi> (1798), to the works of
                    Gessner (1802), to Cowper’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (1825), and to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Decameron·,</hi> while his figure-subjects in the superb
                    editions of Roger’s <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> (1830) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems</hi> (1834) prove that even in latest age his fancy was still unexhausted
                    and his hand hardly at all enfeebled. He is at his best in subjects of a
                    domestic or a gracefully ideal sort; the heroic and the tragic were beyond his
                    powers. The designs by Stothard have been estimated by Mr Wornum to number five
                    thousand, and of these about three thousand have been engraved. His oil pictures
                    are usually small in size, and rather sketchy in handling. Their colouring is
                    often rich and glowing, being founded upon the practice of Rubens, of whom
                    Stothard was a great admirer. He was a contributor to Boydell's <hi
                    rend="italic">Shakespeare Gallery,</hi> but his best-known painting is the
                    Procession of the Canterbury Pilgrims, the engraving from which, begun by
                    Schiavonetti and finished by Heath, attained an immense popularity. It was
                    followed by a companion work, the Flitch of Bacon, which was drawn in sepia for
                    the engraver, but was never carried out in colour.</p>

                    Intemperance, and the Descent of Orpheus in Hell (1799-1803); the mansion of
                    Hafod, North Wales, with a series of scenes from Froissart and Monstrelet
                    (1810); the cupola of the upper hall of the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh (now
                    occupied by the Signet Library), with Apollo and the Muses, and figures of
                    poets, orators, &amp;c. (1822); and he prepared designs for a frieze and other
                    decorations for St James’s Palace. He also designed the magnificent shield
                    presented to the duke of Wellington by the merchants of London, and executed
                    with his own hand a series of eight etchings from the various subjects which
                    adorned it.</p>
                <p>An interesting, but most indiscriminately eulogistic biography of Stothard, by
                    his daughter-in-law Mrs Bray, was published in 1851.</p>
