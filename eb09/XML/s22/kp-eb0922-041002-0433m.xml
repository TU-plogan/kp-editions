                    violinist and composer, was born at Brunswick on 25th April 1784, but spent his
                    childhood at Seesen, where in 1789 he began to study the violin, and worked so
                    industriously that at six years old he was able to take the leading part in
                    Kalkbrenner's trios. He received his general education at the Brunswick
                    grammar-school,—taking lessons on the violin from Kunisch and studying
                    composition under Hartung. The little he learned from the last-named professor
                    was the only theoretical instruction he ever received, for, as he himself tells
                    us, he taught himself to compose by studying the scores of Mozart. After playing
                    a concerto of his own at a school concert with marked success, he was placed for
                    a time under Maucourt, the leader of the duke’s band; and so rapid was his
                    progress that in 1798 he was able to start on his first artistic tour. This
                    proved a failure; but on his return to Brunswick the duke gave him an
                    appointment in his band, and defrayed the expense of his future education under
                    Franz Eck, in company with whom he visited St Petersburg and other European
                    capitals. His first violin concerto was printed in 1803. In that year Spohr
                    returned to Brunswick and resumed his place in the duke’s band. A visit to Paris
                    was prevented by the loss of his favourite violin,—a magnificent Guarnerius,
                    presented to him in Russia. Having played in Berlin, Leipsic, Dresden, and other
                    German towns, his increasing reputation gained for him in 1805 the appointment
                    of leading violinist at the court of the duke of Gotha. Soon after this he
                    married his first wife, Dorette Scheidler, a celebrated harpist. At Gotha he
                    composed his first opera, <hi rend="italic">Die Prüfung,</hi> but did<pb

                    rend="italic">Alruna</hi> was equally unfortunate, though it was rehearsed with
                    approval at Weimar in 1808. During this year Spohr accomplished one of the most
                    extraordinary musical exploits on record. Hearing that Talma was performing at
                    Erfurt before the reigning princes assembled for the famous congress, and
                    failing in his attempt to obtain admission to the theatre, he bribed a
                    horn-player to send him as his deputy; and, though he had never touched a horn
                    in his life, he learned in a single day to play it so well that in the evening
                    he was able to fulfil his self-imposed duty without exciting suspicion or
                    remark. Spohr’s third opera, <hi rend="italic">Der Zweikampf mit der
                    Geliebten,</hi> written in 1809, was successfully performed at Hamburg in the
                    following year. In 1811 he produced his (first) <hi rend="italic">Symphony in
                    Eb,</hi> and in 1812 composed his first oratorio, <hi rend="italic">Das jüngste
                    Gericht.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Literally</hi> The Last Judgment, <hi rend="italic">but not to be
                    confounded with the oratorio now so well known by that name in
                    England.</hi></p></note> It was while employed in the preparation of this work
                    that he first felt the inconvenience inseparable from an imperfect theoretical
                    education; and, with characteristic energy, he set about the diligent study of
                    Marpurg’s <hi rend="italic">Abhandlung von der Fuge.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1812 Sphor visited Vienna, where his splendid violin-playing created a
                    profound sensation, and he was induced to accept the appointment of leader of
                    the orchestra at the Theater na der Wien. He then began the preparation of his
                    greatest dramatic composition, <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi> which he completed
                    in 1813, though it was not performed until five years later. His strength as a
                    composer was now fully developed; and the fertility of his imagination enabled
                    him to produce one great work after another with astonishing rapidity. He
                    resigned his appointment at Vienna in 1815, and soon afterwards made a tour in
                    Italy, where he performed his eighth violin concerto, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scena Cantante nello Stilo Drammatico,—</hi> the finest of his compositions for
                    his favourite instrument. The performer was described by the leading critics of
                    the country as “the finest singer on the violin that had ever been heard.” On
                    Spohr’s return to Germany in 1817 he was appointed conductor of the opera at
                    Frankfort; and in that city in 1818 he first produced his dramatic masterpiece,
                    <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi> The favour with which this was received led to the
                    composition of <hi rend="italic">Zemire und Azor,</hi> a romantic piece founded
                    on the story of <hi rend="italic">Beauty and the Beast,</hi> which, though by no
                    means equal to its predecessor in merit, soon attained a much higher degree of
                    popularity. There can, indeed, be no doubt that <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>
                    suffered from the very first from the weakness of its miserable libretto. Had
                    the words been worthy of the music <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> would have taken
                    rank among the finest German operas in existence.</p>
                <p>Spohr first visited England in 1820, and on 6th March played his <hi
                    rend="italic">Scena Cantante</hi> with great success at the first Philharmonic
                    concert. At the third he produced a new <hi rend="italic">Symphony</hi> (No. 2)
                    <hi rend="italic">in D minor,</hi> written expressly for this occasion, which is
                    remarkable as the first on which the conductor’s <hi rend="italic">bâton</hi>
                    was used at a concert of the Philharmonic Society. Spohr’s new symphony met with
                    an enthusiastic reception, as did the earlier one (No. 1, in Eb), which was
                    played, together with his <hi rend="italic">Nonetto,</hi> at the last concert of
                    the series. Indeed he had a triumphant success both as composer and as <hi
                    rend="italic">virtuoso;</hi> and he on his side was delighted with the
                    performances of the Philharmonic orchestra. Before leaving London he gave a
                    farewell concert, at which Madame Dorette Spohr played on the harp for the last
                    time. Her health at this period was so delicate that she was recommended to
                    exchange her favourite instrument for the less fatiguing pianoforte; and Spohr,
                    with his accustomed facility, wrote a number of pieces for pianoforte and
                    violin, which the husband and wife played together with perfect artistic
                    sympathy. After supplementing his visit to England by a short sojourn in Paris,
                    Spohr returned to Germany and settled for a time in Dresden, where German and
                    Italian opera were flourishing side by side under the direction of Weber and
                    Morlacchi. His artistic relations with the composer of <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Freischütz</hi> were not altogether satisfactory; nevertheless Weber did not
                    hesitate to recommend him strongly to the elector of Hesse Cassel as
                    “kapellmeister.” Spohr entered upon his duties at Cassel on 1st January 1822,
                    and soon afterwards began the composition of his sixth opera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jessonda,</hi> which he produced in 1823. This work—which he himself always
                    regarded as one of his best productions—marks an important epoch in his career
                    as a dramatic composer. It was the first opera he ever wrote with accompanied
                    recitative throughout in place of the usual spoken dialogue; and by a remarkable
                    coincidence it was produced in the same year as Weber’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euryanthe,</hi> a work characterized by the same departure from established
                    custom. Unhappily Weber’s early death prevented him from making a second essay
                    in the same direction; but Spohr consistently carried out the idea in his later
                    operas, and always with marked success.</p>
                <p>Spohr’s appointment at Cassel gave him the opportunity of bringing out his new
                    works on a grander scale and with more careful attention to detail than he could
                    have hoped to attain in the service of a less generous patron than the elector.
                    And he never failed to use these privileges for the purpose of doing justice to
                    the works of other composers. Soon after his instalment in his new office
                    Mendelssohn, then a boy of thirteen, visited Cassel with his father;
                    notwithstanding the disparity of their years, a firm and lasting friendship
                    sprang up between the rising genius and the already famous composer, which
                    ceased only with Mendelssohn’s death in 1847; and in other similar cases Spohr
                    always proved himself ready to appreciate and foster the talent displayed by
                    others, though it must be admitted that as a critic he was very difficult to
                    please. The success of <hi rend="italic">Jessonda</hi> led him to produce in
                    1825 a seventh opera— <hi rend="italic">Der Berggeist—</hi> founded upon the old
                    German legend of Rübezahl, the ruling spirit of the Riesengebirge. Though less
                    popular than its predecessor, this fine work attained a very fair success. But a
                    far greater triumph awaited the composer at the Rhenish musical festival held at
                    Düsseldorf in 1826. On this occasion his oratorio <hi rend="italic">Die letzten
                    Dinge</hi> met with so enthusiastic a reception that it had to be repeated a few
                    days later for the benefit of a charity. This work, known in England as <hi
                    rend="italic">The Last Judgment,</hi> is undoubtedly the greatest of Spohr’s
                    sacred compositions, and is remarkable as the first oratorio in which the
                    romantic element is freely introduced, with marked success throughout, and
                    without detriment either to the solemnity of the subject or the sobriety of
                    style which has always been regarded as an indispensable characteristic of
                    sacred music of the highest order. In 1827 Spohr produced his eighth opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pietro von Abano,</hi> the plot of which depends for its chief
                    interest upon the resuscitation by the famous necromancer of a lady long since
                    dead and committed to the tomb. The work met with a fair, though not a lasting,
                    success; and the same may be said of a much finer opera, <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Alchymist,</hi> produced in 1830. Spohr’s next publication was of a very
                    different character. His <hi rend="italic">Violin School,</hi> produced in 1831,
                    is so useful as a code of instruction for advanced students that there is
                    probably no great violinist now living who has not been more or less indebted to
                    it for the perfection of his technique. It holds with regard to the violin a
                    position no less important than that which Cramer’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Studies</hi> has so long held in connexion with the pianoforte.</p>
                <p>The year 1833 Spohr spent in the preparation of a new<pb break="no"

                    Stunden,</hi> known in England as <hi rend="italic">Calvary</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">The Crucifixion—</hi> which was performed at Cassel on Good Friday
                    1835, and sung in English at the Norwich festival of 1839, under Spohr’s own
                    direction, with such unexampled success that he was accustomed to speak of this
                    event as the greatest triumph of his life. For the Norwich festival of 1842 he
                    composed <hi rend="italic">The Fall of Babylon,</hi> which also was a perfect
                    success. His last opera, <hi rend="italic">Die Kreuzfahrer,</hi> was produced at
                    Cassel in 1845. Of his nine symphonies the finest, <hi rend="italic">Die Weihe
                    der Tone,</hi> was produced in 1832. His compositions for the violin include
                    concertos, quartetts, duets, and other concerted pieces and solos, adapted for
                    the chamber and the concert room, and among these a high place is taken by four
                    double quartetts,—a form of composition of which he was both the inventor and
                    the perfecter. He was, indeed, very much inclined to explore new paths,
                    notwithstanding his attachment to classical form, and his freedom from prejudice
                    was proved by the care with which he produced Wagner’s <hi rend="italic">Flying
                    Dutchman</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tannhäuser</hi> at Cassel in 1842 and 1853,
                    in spite of the elector’s opposition. Spohr retained his appointment until 1857,
                    when, very much against his wish, he was pensioned off. In the same year he
                    broke his arm, but he was able to conduct <hi rend="italic">Jessonda</hi> at
                    Prague in 1858. This, however, was his last effort. He died at Cassel on 16th
                    October 1859. (<hi rend="smallcaps">w. s. r.</hi>)</p>
