                    of the great central plateau of middle Russia, which slowly rises towards the
                    south, and gently slopes in the north towards the great Oka depression of the
                    middle Volga. Its higher parts range from 750 to 1000 feet above the sea, and
                    form the Zheguleff range of hills, which compel the Volga to make its great bend
                    at Samara; while the numerous valleys and ravines which intersect it, and are
                    excavated to a depth of 700 to 800 feet, give quite a hilly aspect to several
                    parts of it, especially in the east, where it descends with abrupt crags towards
                    the broad valley of the Volga. In the west a broad depression, traversed by
                    numerous rivers and streams, extends along the left bank of the Sura. All
                    geological formations, from the Carboniferous upwards, are met with in Simbirsk.
                    The Volga flows for 300 miles along the eastern boundary, separating Simbirsk
                    from Samara. The shallow Sviyaga rises in the Samarskaya Luka Hills and flows
                    parallel to the Volga, at a distance of 2 to 20 miles, but in an opposite
                    direction. The Sura, also flowing northwards, waters the western part of
                    Simbirsk; it is navigable for more than 270 miles, and, as it is free from ice
                    earlier than the Volga and flows towards central Russia, goods are sometimes
                    transported by land to the Sura to be shipped on it when speedy transport is
                    desired. Its tributaries—the Barysh, Alatyr (100 miles), Piyana, and others—are
                    not navigable. The Usa (80 miles) and the Syzrañ (100 miles) flow east and join
                    the Volga below the Samara bend. A few lakes and marshes are met with in the
                    west of the government. The forests, although rapidly disappearing, still cover
                    3,894,800 acres, while of the remainder 5,930,600 acres are arable, 1,150,800
                    acres prairie and pasture land, and 605,600 acres uncultivable. In the north
                    excellent forests of timber cover large areas, but in the south they are rare.
                    The climate is severe, and the extremes are great. At Simbirsk the average
                    temperature is 38°∙7, but the thermometer sometimes reaches 114° F., and frosts
                    of - 47° F. are not uncommon; the average rain and snow fall is only 17∙6
                    inches. South of the Samara Hills the climate is much less severe, and
                    gardening, which is prosecuted with great difficulty in the north, flourishes
                    there.</p>
                <p>The population, which was but 1,192,510 in 1867, had reached 1,471,164 in 1882,
                    of whom only 100,740 lived in towns. The<pb break="no"

                    Russians, the remainder being Mordvinians (13 per cent.), Tchuvashes (9∙3 per
                    cent.), and Tartars (8∙3 per cent. ), with about 1000 Jews. The Mordvinians are
                    chiefly settled in the north-west, in Ardatoff and Alatyr (40 and 26 per cent.
                    of population), and on the Volga in Senghilei; the Tchuvashes make about
                    one-third of the population of the districts of Buinsk and Kurmysh, contiguous
                    to Kazan; the Tartars constitute about 35 per cent. in Buinsk and 18 per cent.
                    in Senghilei. Only the Tartars (about 100,000) are Mohammedans, the remainder
                    being Greek-Orthodox or Dissenters. As in other Volga governments, the villages
                    in Simbirsk are mostly large, many of them having from 3000 to 5000 inhabitants.
                    Agriculture, favoured by a fertile soil, is the chief occupation, grain being
                    exported or manufactured into spirit. Linseed and hempseed are cultivated for
                    exportation, as also kitchen-garden produce and some fruit. Bee-keeping is a
                    favourite and remunerative occupation with Mordvinians, and fishing (sturgeon)
                    is carried on in the Volga and the Sura. The timber-trade in the north and the
                    shipbuilding on the Sura are considerable sources of wealth; wooden sledges and
                    wheels are made and exported, as well as bags of lime-tree bast,— the last-named
                    industry giving occupation to whole villages. Other petty trades, also carried
                    on in conjunction with agriculture, are the manufacture of felts and felt hats,
                    linen stuffs (especially among the Mordvinians), cottons, boots, and small metal
                    wares. A characteristic feature of Simbirsk is the trade in wooden vessels,
                    which are exported to Vyatka, Perm, Orenburg, Samara, and the Don, and there
                    exchanged for cat, squirrel, and hare skins. Flour-mills are numerous. Watered
                    by the Volga and Sura, and moreover traversed in its southern portion by the
                    railway connecting Orenburg and Samara with Penza and Ryazan, by Batraki and
                    Syzran, the government has an active trade. Its exports, however, are much below
                    those of Samara and Saratoff. Batraki and Syzran are important centres of
                    traffic, the aggregate amount of merchandise entered and cleared by rail and
                    boat being respectively 2,435,000 and 2,000,000 cwts. (timber not included). The
                    chief ports of lading on the Sura are Alatyr, Promzino-Gorodische, and
                    Berezniki, each with exports valued at about 750,000 roubles. Corn, linseed,
                    woollen stuffs, timber, potash, and wooden wares are the principal articles of
                    trade.</p>
                <p>Simbirsk is very backward as regards education. There were in 1882 only 462
                    schools (17,795 boys and 2663 girls) and 8 secondary schools (497 male and 516
                    female pupils).</p>
                <p>The government is divided into eight districts, the chief towns of which, with
                    their populations in 1880, are—Simbirsk (36,600), Alatyr (15,000), Ardatoff
                    (4740), Buinsk (4130), Karsuñ (3740), Kurmysh (1930), Senghilei (3500), and
                    Syzran (24,500). Kotyakoff (580) and Tagai (2400) have municipal institutions.
                    The above-mentioned ports of lading are more important than most of the
                    towns.</p>
                <p>The first Russian settlers made their appearance in the Simbirsk region in the
                    14th century, but did not extend east of the Sura. Not till two centuries later
                    did they cross the Sura and the district begin to be peopled by refugees from
                    Moscow. The Zheguleff Mountains in the south still continuing to be a place of
                    refuge for the criminal and the persecuted, Simbirsk was founded in 1648, and a
                    palisaded earthen wall was built, running south-west of the new town, with small
                    forts extending to the Sura. The region thus protected was soon settled, and, as
                    the Russian villages advanced further south, Syzran was founded, and a second
                    line of small forts, extending also towards the Sura, was erected. The
                    colonizers settled rapidly, and the aboriginal Mordvinians soon adopted many of
                    their customs, so as to lose their ethnographical individuality, especially
                    within the last fifty years. Simbirsk received the name of an old Tartar
                    settlement, Sinbir, situated 9 miles south of the present town, on the opposite
                    bank of the Volga.</p>
