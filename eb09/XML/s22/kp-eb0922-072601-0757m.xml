                    are broken and irregular, in some cases deeply indented, and in the north-west,
                    at Cape Wrath, near Durness, at Whiten Head, and farther south at the island of
                    Handa there are ranges of wildly precipitous cliffs. Numerous islands stud the
                    larger inlets on this coast; the only ones inhabited in 1881 were Oldney with
                    four persons and Roan (in Kyle of Tongue) with forty-three; Handa, which had
                    eight inhabitants in 1871, had none in 1881. On the north coast the principal
                    sea lochs are the Kyle of Tongue, Loch Erriboll, and the Kyle of Durness, and on
                    the west coast Loch Inchard, Loch Laxford, the various branches of Eddrachillis
                    Bay, and Loch Inver. The eastern shore is low and comparatively regular, the
                    only inlets being Loch Fleet and Dornoch Firth. With the exception of the narrow
                    plain along the east coast, various stretches of low ground on the west coast,
                    and the low grounds adjoining the rivers and inland lochs, the surface consists
                    chiefly of a succession of irregular elevations of from 500 to over 3000 feet in
                    height. Much of the western district adjoining the coast from Cape Wrath
                    southwards is occupied by Archaean gneiss, forming a series of bare rounded
                    knolls. Resting unconformably on the gneiss are deposits of grits and
                    sandstones, generally regarded as of Cambrian age, rising into wild cliffs
                    between Cape Wrath and the Kyle of Durness. These are succeeded unconformably by
                    Silurian strata, specially developed in the neighbourhood of Durness and
                    Erriboll; in the former region they form a basin occupied chiefly by the
                    limestone series, containing a remarkable collection of fossils, and at
                    Erriboll, from which the strata at Durness are separated by a great dislocation,
                    they present a remarkable series of horizontal displacements. Towards the east
                    the gneiss is intermixed with granite and syenite, which cap the summits of a
                    few of the mountains. Outliers of Old Red Sandstone also occur in this eastern
                    mountainous region, sometimes in masses of coarse conglomerate. The highest
                    mountain summit in Sutherland is Benmore Assynt (3273 feet), the culminating
                    peak of a fine range of Silurian quartzites and limestone rocks lying to the
                    south-east of Loch Assynt, while to the south-west are the picturesque conical
                    summit of Canisp (2779 feet) and the curious Suilven (2399 feet) with its forked
                    top. The next highest and most picturesque series of mountain groups occurs in
                    the north-eastern region, south of the Kyle of Tongue,—Ben Hope, a rounded mass
                    with imposing precipices rising near Loch Hope to a height of 3040 feet, while
                    to the eastward is the picturesque Ben Loyal or Laoghal (2504 feet), formed of
                    granite, and south from it, near Loch Naver, the great bulk of Ben Klibreck
                    (3154 feet). Numerous other summits attain a height of over 2000 feet, but the
                    greater proportion of the mountainous region consists of elevated moorlands,
                    bleak and uninteresting, except when the heather assumes its purple tints in
                    autumn. In the lower region along the shores of Moray Firth the Old Red
                    Sandstone occurs resting unconformably on the crystalline series of rocks, and
                    is in turn succeeded by an interesting series of Jurassic strata, which, faulted
                    against the older formations, are exposed along the coast from Golspie to
                    Helmsdale. In this series, at Brora, some seams of coal have been worked, but
                    the presence of iron pyrites greatly lessens its value. Limestone is wrought in
                    various districts, and there are a number of quarries for building stone. Small
                    quantities of gold have been found in some places.</p>
                <p>Sutherland has a much greater proportion of its area occupied by water than any
                    other large county in Scotland, the parish of Assynt being completely
                    honeycombed with lochs and tarns. Loch Assynt, the largest of these, 10 miles in
                    length, and narrow and irregular in outline, is entitled to rank, from its
                    picturesque creeks and the grandeur of the adjoining mountain scenery, as the
                    most beautiful loch in Sutherland. Loch Shin, extending 17 miles throughout
                    nearly the whole of Lairg parish, from south-east to north-west, is towards the
                    centre overhung by mountain masses, but otherwise is without interest to any but
                    the angler. It is succeeded northwards by a series of lochs,—Griam, Merkland,
                    More, Stack, Garbadmore, Garbadbeg—extending through the centre of the parish of
                    Eddrachillis. Lochs Merkland and Griam occur, like Loch Shin, in the course of
                    the river Shin, a tributary of the Oykel, which last forms the southern boundary
                    of the county with Ross and falls into Dornoch Firth; Lochs More and Stack are
                    in the valley of the Laxford, running north-westward to Loch Laxford. The
                    Dionard or Grudie flows northwards to the Kyle of Durness, and the Hope, after
                    expanding into Loch Hope, about 10 miles in length, falls into Loch Erriboll.
                    The Borgie, which in its course forms Loch Loyal and falls into Torrisdale Bay;
                    the Naver, which flows from the loch of that name through a fertile strath to
                    the sea at Betty-hill of Farr; the Strathy; and the Halladale are the principal
                    other rivers flowing northwards. Those entering Moray Firth are the Oykel; the
                    Helmsdale, which reaches the sea at the town of that name; the Brora, which
                    receives various tributaries before it expands into Loch Brora, 3 miles from its
                    entrance into the sea at Brora; and the Fleet, flowing into Loch Fleet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> According to the agricultural returns of
                    1886 only 3110 acres out of 1,347,033 were in cultivation, less than a fortieth
                    part of the whole area. The best land is that adjoining Moray Firth, where
                    agriculture is in a very advanced condition. Along the river valleys there are,
                    however, many fertile patches. At the beginning of the 19th century the crofters
                    occupied almost every cultivable spot throughout the county; between 1811 and
                    1820 they were ejected from their holdings to the number of 15,000, and,
                    according to the statement of Hugh Miller, “compressed into a wretched selvage
                    of poverty and suffering that fringes the county on its eastern and western
                    shores.” The homes they left were, he says, “improved into a desert”; but in the
                    opinion of those who made the alteration these mountainous parts were as “much
                    calculated for the maintenance of stock as they were unfit for the habitation of
                    man.” The crofters in Sutherland are now (1887) chiefly confined to the western
                    seaboard, the number of crofts, all on the estates of the duke of Sutherland,
                    amounting, according to the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Crofters
                    Commission,</hi> to 1238, and representing a population of 6190. The general
                    agricultural condition of the county has been much improved by successive dukes
                    of Sutherland, aided by the liberality of the Government in the advancement of
                    money for the construction of roads and bridges; and within recent years large
                    reclamations have been made, in order to obtain a wider area for the growth of
                    fodder and turnips. The following table gives the number and acreage of various
                    classes of holdings in 1875, 1880, and 1885 :—</p>

                    10,000 acres each being Sir Charles W. A. Ross, 55,000; E. C. Sutherland-Walker,
                    20,000; Sir James Matheson, 18,490; and the executors of Gordon M'Leod, 11,000.
                    The total valued rental of the county in 1674 was only £27,193 Scots or £2266
                    sterling, while in 1885-86 it was £103,979.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The county is well supplied with roads
                    considering its mountainous character and its sparse population. Helmsdale
                    affords the means of export for a considerable amount of farm produce. The
                    Highland Railway enters the county at Inversion and after passing northwards to
                    Lairg turns eastwards to the coast, which it skirts to Helmsdale, whence it
                    turns north-westwards along the banks of the Helmsdale, bending afterwards
                    eastwards at Forsinard into Caithness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industries.—</hi> Various textile manufactures at one time
                    established in the county have been discontinued, the only important manufacture
                    now remaining being that of whisky at Clyne and Brora. Herring fishing
                    prosecuted from Helmsdale is an important industry, and the cod, ling, and other
                    deep-sea fishings engage a large number of boats aud men. There are valuable
                    salmon fisheries in several of the rivers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county contains 13
                    entire parishes and part of the parish of Reay, the remainder being in
                    Caithness. The county returns one member to parliament, and one is returned for
                    the Wick group of burghs. Dornoch, the only royal burgh, had but 497 inhabitants
                    in 1881, while Golspie had 1548 and Helmsdale 794. The population has not varied
                    greatly in numbers since the beginning of the 19th century. In 1801 the numbers
                    were 23,117, and in 1881 they were 23,370, a gradual decrease having taken place
                    since 1851, when the numbers reached 25,793. In 1881 there were 11,219 males and
                    12,151 females. Sutherland is the most sparsely peopled county in Scotland,
                    there being only 12 persons to the square mile, while the average for Scotland
                    is 125. Sutherland forms a joint sheriffdom with Ross and Cromarty, and a
                    sheriff-substitute resides at Dornoch. Small debt circuit courts are held at
                    Helmsdale, Tongue, Melvich, and Scourie, and justice of peace courts at Dornoch,
                    Golspie, Brora, and Helmsdale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The ancient Celtic inhabitants
                    were almost entirely expelled by the Scandinavian settlers who occupied the
                    county after its conquest by the Norse jarl Thorfinn in 1034. The remains of
                    Pictish towers are numerous, as are also stone circles. Of other antiquities
                    mention may be made of the vitrified fort on Dun Creich and of the extensive
                    remains of Dun Dornadilla in Durness parish. After the conquest of the district
                    by the Scottish kings, Sutherland was conferred on Hugh Freskin (a descendant of
                    Freskin of Moravia or Moray), whose son William in 1228 was created earl of
                    Sutherland by Alexander II. The nineteenth earl of Sutherland was created duke
                    in 1833. The seat of the ancient episcopal see of Sutherland and Caithness was
                    at Dornoch, where a cathedral was erected by Gilbert of Moravia (1222-1245), of
                    which the ancient tower, attached to the modern parish church, still
                    remains.</p>
