                    of the North-Eastern Railway, 20 miles south-south-east of Durham, and 4 miles
                    west-south-west of Middlesborough. The principal street is about a mile in
                    length. Of the ancient castle commanding the Tees, which was destroyed in 1652,
                    the last remains were removed in 1865. Among the principal public buildings are
                    the town-hall, with a clock-tower and spire, the borough hall (erected in 1852
                    at a cost of £32,000), the freemasons’ hall, the temperance hall, the theatre,
                    the exchange hall, the literary institute, the hospital, the dispensary, the
                    free library, and the blue-coat school. Stockton is a seaport of considerable
                    importance. The management of the Tees, vested in 1808 in the Tees Navigation
                    Company, was in 1852 vested in the Tees Conservancy Commissioners, incorporated
                    by Act of Parliament, under whose auspices the river has been greatly improved.
                    The trade of the port is chiefly with Holland and the ports of the Baltic, and
                    there is a considerable coasting trade with the Tyne ports and with Hull and
                    London. Its chief exports are iron manufactures, coal, coke, and agricultural
                    produce, the average annual value for the five years 1880-84 being about
                    &lt;£72,000. The principal imports are timber, iron, grain, and provisions, the
                    average annual value for the five years 1880-84 being about £240,000. In 1885
                    the number of vessels that entered the port was 649, of 149,628 tons, the number
                    that cleared 700, of 175,647 tons. The rapid increase of the town within the
                    last quarter of a century is largely owing to the development of the iron and
                    steel trade in the district. There are extensive steel works, blastfurnaces,
                    iron and brass foundries, and rolling-mills, and iron-shipbuilding is also an
                    important industry. There are also sailcloth works, potteries, breweries, and
                    brick and tile works. The population of the municipal borough (area 1189 acres)
                    in 1871 was 27,738, and in 1881 it was 41,015. The population of the
                    parliamentary borough (area 7157 acres) in the same years was 37,612 and 55,457.
                    The parliamentary borough includes the suburb of South Stockton on the opposite
                    side of the river, forming a separate urban sanitary district (area 1052 acres),
                    with a population in 1871 of 6794 and in 1881 of 10,665. It has a temperance
                    hall, a mechanics’ institute, and a national school, and its manufactures are
                    similar to those of Stockton.</p>
                <p>The place is of great antiquity, and is supposed to have been occupied by the
                    Romans. Before the Conquest the manor belonged to the see of Durham. It was
                    probably first incorporated by Bishop Hugh de Pudsey, who in the reign of
                    Richard I. occupied the castle. The castle, which was for a long time the
                    residence of the bishops, stood on the north bank of the Tees. The town was
                    destroyed by the Scots in 1322, but the castle seems to have escaped. During the
                    Civil War it was garrisoned for the king, but was afterwards delivered up to the
                    Parliamentary party, and in 1645 was held by the Scots. The town suffered
                    severely from inundations of the Tees in 1771, 1783, and 1822. Though Stockton
                    was placed under the Municipal Act of 1835 it remained divided into two parts,
                    the one called the “borough,” where the land was freehold, governed by the
                    corporation, and the other called the “town,” where the land was copyhold or
                    leasehold, held under the vicar and vestrymen, and outside the corporate
                    jurisdiction. To remedy this state of matters an “Extension and Improvement Act”
                    was passed in 1852. The town was enfranchised in 1867, and returns one
