                    customhouse and Egyptian Government offices present a good frontage to the sea,
                    and the principal houses are stately white structures, three stories high, not
                    unlike those of Jiddah. With these, however, are intermingled shapeless huts,
                    each with its courtyard walled in with mats. There are also the usual Greek
                    drinking-shops, with their dirty loungers in coats and fez-caps, and a short
                    street of coffeehouses and shops. The mosques are not remarkable. Passing
                    through the bazaar and turning to the right past the tomb of Sheikh 'Ali, one
                    comes to an open space at the head of the recent causeway which unites the
                    island to the mainland town of Al-Kaff (Al-Keif). The main street of Al-Kaff is
                    (or was before the recent war) the busy centre of life and movement, while the
                    side streets are occupied by smiths, forging lance-heads and knives; leather
                    workers, who drive a brisk trade in the amulets—passages of the Koran sewn up in
                    leather cases—which the natives wear on their arms or round their necks; and
                    hairdressers, greasing and powdering with the dust of a red wood the bushy locks
                    of the Hadendoa dandies. Beyond the town is a suburb of straw huts with their
                    simple furniture of a bedstead, a few dishes, and a rubbing stone for the millet
                    which with milk forms the chief food of the natives. Here too are the booths of
                    the silversmiths, who make bracelets, anklets, ear and nose rings, for the
                    women. The Hadendoa, a tall stalwart race, picturesquely draped in huge
                    wrappers, to which the women add a petticoat, are most numerous on the mainland.
                    The population of the island is mixed, with a large infusion of Arab blood. The
                    export trade of Suakin before the revolt of the Soudan yielded a customs revenue
                    of £60,000 a year, the chief articles besides the ivory, which was a Government
                    monopoly, being gum, cotton, sesame, senna, and hides. The total yearly trade
                    was estimated at a million sterling.</p>
                <p>The environs of Suakin, though not so absolutely desert as the opposite Arabian
                    coast, are less wooded than some points <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Sheikh
                    Barghút) which lie as conveniently for the inland trade. The island is without
                    water and the harbour indifferent; yet the settlement is ancient. Here as at
                    Massowah traders were presumably attracted by the advantages of an island site
                    which protected them from the nomads. The country inland from all this coast
                    belonged in the Middle Ages to the Boja (Bejah), a rude pastoral race who appear
                    to be identical with the Blemmyes of classical writers and of whom Hadendoa,
                    Bishárín, and Abábdah are the modern representatives. The trading places seem to
                    have been always in the hands of foreigners since Ptolemais Theron was
                    established by Ptolemy Philadelphus for intercourse with the elephant hunters.
                    After Islam many Arabs settled on the coast and mixed with the heathen Boja,
                    whose rule of kinship and succession in the female line helped to give the
                    children of mixed marriages a leading position (Makrízí, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Khiṭaṭ,</hi> i. 194 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>, translated in Burckhardt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Nubia,</hi> App. iii.). Thus in 1330 Ibn Batuta found a
                    son of the emir of Mecca reigning in Suakin over the Boja, who were his mother’s
                    kin. Maḳrízí says that the chief inhabitants were nominal Moslems and were
                    called Hadárib. The emir of the Ḥadarib was still sovereign of the mainland at
                    the time of Burckhardt’s visit (1814), though the island had an aga appointed by
                    the Turkish pasha of Jiddah. The place was settled by the Turks under Selim the
                    Great, but Turkish (or Egyptian) control over the mainland was not effective
                    till the Egyptian conquest of the Soudan. Till the suppression of the slave
                    trade, Suakin was an important slave port; of late years slaves have been
                    secretly run across the Red Sea from less frequented points on the coast. But
                    legitimate commerce was rapidly growing before the revolt of the Soudan, and the
                    port was visited by English, Egyptian, and Italian steamers.</p>
