                    Plover</hi></label>, a bird so called for reasons obvious to any one who has
                    seen it, since, though no bigger than a Snipe, the length of its legs (their
                    bare part measuring 8 inches), in proportion to the size of its body, exceeds
                    that of any other bird’s. The first name (a translation of the French <hi
                    rend="italic">Échasse,</hi> given in 1760 by Brisson) seems to have been
                    bestowed by Rennie only in 1831; but, recommended by its definiteness and
                    brevity, it has wholly supplanted the second and older one. The bird is the <hi

                    >Haematopus,</hi> notwithstanding the wonderful development of its legs and the

                <p>The very peculiar form of the Stilt naturally gave Buffon occasion (<hi

                    to lament the shortcomings of Nature in producing an animal with such “enormous
                    defects,”— its long legs in particular, he supposed, scarcely allowing it to
                    reach the ground with its bill. But he failed to notice the flexibility of its
                    proportionately long neck, and admitted that he was ill-informed as to its
                    habits. No doubt, if he had enjoyed even so slight an opportunity as occurred to
                    a chance observer (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 397), he would have
                    allowed that its structure and ways were in complete conformity, for the bird
                    obtains its food by wading in shallow water and seizing the insects that fly
                    over or float upon its surface or the small crustaceans that swim beneath, for
                    which purpose its slender extremities are, as might be expected, admirably
                    adapted. Widely spread over Asia, North Africa, and Southern Europe, the Stilt
                    has many times visited Britain—though always as a straggler, for it is not known
                    to breed to the northward of the Danube valley,—and its occurrence in Scotland
                    (near Dumfries) was noticed by Sibbald so long ago as 1684. It chiefly resorts
                    to pools or lakes with a margin of mud, on which it constructs a slight nest,
                    banked round or just raised above the level so as to keep its eggs dry (<hi
                    rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 360); but sometimes they are laid in a tuft of
                    grass. They are four in number, and, except in size, closely resemble those of
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Oystercatcher</hi> (vol. xviii. p. 111). The bird has
                    the head, neck, and lower parts white, the back and wings glossy black, the
                    irides red, and the bare part of the legs pink. In America the genus has two
                    representatives, one<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This species was made known to Ray by Sloane, who met with it in Jamaica,
                    where in his day it was called “Longlegs.”</p></note> (fig. 1) closely
                    resembling that just described, but rather smaller and with a black crown and
                    nape.</p>
                <p>This is <hi rend="italic">H. nigricollis</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mexicanus,</hi> and occurs from New England to the middle of South America,
                    beyond which it is replaced by 77. <hi rend="italic">brasiliensis,</hi> which
                    has the crown white. The Stilt inhabiting India is now recognized to be <hi
                    rend="italic">H. candidus,</hi> but Australia possesses a distinct species, <hi
                    rend="italic">H. novae-hollandiae,</hi> which also occurs in New Zealand, though
                    that country has in addition a species peculiar to it, <hi rend="italic">H.
                    novae-zelandiae,</hi> differing from all the rest by assuming in the
                    breeding-season an altogether black plumage. Australia, however, presents
                    another form, which is the type of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cladorhynchus,</hi> and differs from <hi rend="italic">Himantopus</hi> both in
                    its style of plumage (the male having a broad bay pectoral belt), in its shorter
                    tarsi, and in having the toes (though, as in the Stilt’s feet, three in number
                    on each foot) webbed.</p>
                <p>Allied in many ways to the Stilts, but differing in many undeniably generic
                    characters, are the birds known as Avosets,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This word is from the Bolognese <hi rend="italic"
                    >Avosetta,</hi> which is considered to be derived from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">avis—</hi> the termination expressing a diminutive of a graceful
                    or delicate kind, as <hi rend="italic">donnetta</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >donna</hi> (Prof. Salvadori <hi rend="italic">in epist.).</hi></p></note>
                    forming the genus <hi rend="italic">Recurvirostra</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>Their bill, which is perhaps the most slender to be seen in the whole Class,
                    curves upward towards the end, and has given the oldest known species two names
                    which it formerly bore in England,—“Cobbler’s-awl,” from its likeness to the
                    tool so called, and “Scooper,” because it resembled the scoop with which
                    mariners threw water on their sails. The legs, though long, are not
                    extraordinarily so, and the feet, which are webbed, bear a small hind toe.</p>
                <p>This species (fig. 2), the <hi rend="italic">R. avocetla</hi> of ornithology, was
                    of old time plentiful in England, though doubtless always restricted to certain
                    localities. Charleton in 1668 says that when a boy he had shot not a few on the
                    Severn, and Plot mentions it so as to lead one to suppose that in his time
                    (1686) it bred in Staffordshire, while Willughby (1676) knew of it as being in
                    winter on the eastern coast, and Pennant in 1769 found it in great numbers
                    opposite to Fossdyke Wash in Lincolnshire, and described the birds as hovering
                    over the sportsman’s head like Lapwings. In this district they were called
                    “Yelpers” from their cry;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> “Yarwhelp” <hi rend="smallcaps">(Godwit,</hi>
                    vol. x. p. 720) and “Yaup” or “Whaup” <hi rend="smallcaps">(Curlew,</hi> vol.
                    vi. p. 711). “Barker” and “Clinker” seem to have been names used in
                    Norfolk.</p></note> but whether that name was elsewhere applied is uncertain. At
                    the end of the last century they frequented Romney Marsh in Kent, and in the
                    first quarter of the present century they bred in various suitable spots in
                    Suffolk and Norfolk,—the last place known to have been inhabited by them being
                    Salthouse, where the people made puddings of their eggs, while the birds were
                    killed for the sake of their feathers, which were used in making artificial
                    flies for fishing. The extirpation of this settlement took place between 1822
                    and 1825 (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Stevenson, <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                    Norfolk,</hi> ii. pp. 240, 241).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The same kind of lamentable destruction has of late been
                    carried on in Holland and Denmark, to the extirpation probably of the species in
                    each country.</p></note> The Avoset’s mode of nesting is much like that of the
                    Stilt, and the eggs are hardly to be distinguished from those of the latter but
                    by their larger size, the bird being about as big as a <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lapwing</hi> (vol. xiv. p. 308), white, with the exception of its crown, the
                    back of the neck, the inner scapulars, some of the wing-coverts and the
                    primaries, which are black, while the legs are of a fine light blue. It seems to
                    get its food by working its bill from side to side in shallow pools, and
                    catching the small crustaceans or larvae of insects that may be swimming
                    therein, but not, as has been stated, by sweeping the surface of the mud or sand
                    —a process that would speedily destroy the delicate bill by friction. Two
                    species of Avoset, <hi rend="italic">R. americana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">R.
                    andina,</hi> are found in the New World; the former, which ranges so far to the
                    northward as the Saskatchewan, is distinguished by its light cinnamon-coloured
                    head, neck, and breast, and the latter, confined so far as known to the mountain
                    lakes of Chili, has no white in the upper parts except the head and neck.
                    Australia produces a fourth species, <hi rend="italic">R. novae-hollandiae</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">rubricollis,</hi> with a chestnut head and neck; but the
                    European <hi rend="italic">R. avocetta</hi> extends over nearly the whole of
                    middle and southern Asia as well as Africa.</p>
                <p>A recent proposal <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1886, pp. 224-239) to unite the
                    Avosets and Stilts in a single genus seems to have little to recommend it but
                    its novelty, and will hardly meet with acceptance by systematists. <hi
