                <p><label type="entry">SPOONBILL</label>. The bird now so called was formerly known
                    in England as the Shovelard or Shovelar, while that which used to bear the name
                    of Spoonbill, often amplified into Spoon-billed Duck, is the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Shoveler</hi> (see vol. xxi. p. 842) of modern days—the
                    exchange of names having been effected, as already stated <hi rend="italic"
                    >(loc. cit.)</hi> about 200 years ago, when the subject of the present
                    notice—the <hi rend="italic">Platalea leucorodia</hi> of Linnaeus as well as of
                    recent writers—was doubtless far better known than now, since it evidently was,
                    from ancient documents, the constant concomitant of Herons, and with them the
                    law attempted to protect it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    old statutes for the protection of birds than the fact that in 1534 the taking
                    of the eggs of Herons, Spoonbills (Shovelars), Cranes, Bitterns, and Bustards
                    was visited by a heavy penalty, while there was none for destroying the parent
                    birds in the breeding-season. All of the species just named, except the Heron,
                    have passed away, while there is strong reason to think that some at least might
                    have survived had the principle of the Levitical law (Deut. xxii. 6) been
                    followed.</hi></p></note> Mr Harting (<hi rend="italic">Zoologist,</hi> 1886,
                    pp. 81 <hi rend="italic">et seqj)</hi> has cited a case from the “Year-Book” of
                    14 Hen. VIII. (1523), wherein the then bishop of London (Cuthbert Tunstall)
                    maintained an action of trespass against the tenant of a close at Fulham for
                    taking Herons and “Shovelars” that made their nests on the trees therein
                    growing, and has also printed <hi rend="italic">{Zoologist,</hi> 1877, pp. 425
                    <hi rend="italic">et seq.)</hi> an old document showing that “Shovelars” bred in
                    certain woods in west Sussex in 1570. Nearly one hundred years later (<hi
                    rend="italic">circa</hi> 1662) Sir Thomas Browne, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Account of Birds found in Norfolk (Works,</hi> ed. Wilkin, iv. pp. 315, 316),
                    stated of the <hi rend="italic">“Platea</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shouelard</hi>” that it formerly “built in the Hernerie at Claxton and Reedham,
                    now at Trimley in Suffolk.” This last is the latest known proof of the breeding
                    of the species in England; but more recent evidence to that effect may be hoped
                    for from other sources. That the Spoonbill was in the fullest sense of the word
                    a “native” of England is thus incontestably shown; but for many years past it
                    has only been a more or less regular visitant, though not seldom in considerable
                    numbers, which would doubtless, if allowed, once more make their home there; but
                    its conspicuous appearance renders it an easy mark for the greedy gunner and the
                    contemptible collector. What may have been the case formerly is not known,
                    except that, according to Belon, it nested in his time (1555) in the borders of
                    Britanny and Poitou; but as regards north-western Europe it seems of late years
                    to have bred only in Holland, and there it has been deprived by drainage of its
                    favourite resorts, one after the other, so that it must shortly become merely a
                    stranger, except in Spain or the basin of the Danube and other parts of
                    south-eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>The Spoonbill ranges over the greater part of middle and southern Asia,<note

                    >Ornithologists have been in doubt as to the recognition of two species from

                    abundantly in India, as well as on some of the islands in the Red Sea, and seems
                    to be resident throughout Northern Africa. In Southern Africa its place is taken
                    by an allied species with red legs, <hi rend="italic">Ρ. cristata</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">tenuiroslris,</hi> which also goes to Madagascar. Australia has
                    two other species, <hi rend="italic">P. regio,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >melanorhynchus,</hi> with black bill and feet, and <hi rend="italic">P.
                    flaνipes,</hi> in which those parts are yellow. The very beautiful and wholly
                    different <hi rend="italic">P. ajaja</hi> is the Roseate Spoonbill of America,
                    and is the only one found on that continent, the tropical or juxta-tropical
                    parts of which it inhabits. The rich pink, deepening in some parts into crimson,
                    of nearly all its plumage, together with the yellowish green of its bare head
                    and its lake-coloured legs, sufficiently marks this bird; but all the other
                    species are almost wholly clothed in pure white, though the English has, when
                    adult, a fine buff pectoral band, and the spoon-shaped expanse of its bill is
                    yellow, contrasting with the black of the compressed and basal portion. Its legs
                    are also black. In the breeding season, a pendent tuft of white plumes further
                    ornaments the head of both sexes, but is longest in the male. The young of the
                    year have the primary quills darkcoloured.</p>
                <p>The Spoonbills form a natural group, <hi rend="italic">Plataleidse,</hi> allied,
                    as before stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ibis,</hi> vol. xii. p. 606), to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ibididae,</hi> and somewhat more distantly to the Storks (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Stork),</hi> —all belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pelargomorphse</hi> of Prof. Huxley. They breed in societies, not only of their
                    own kind, but in company with Herons, either on trees or in reed-beds, making
                    large nests in which are commonly laid four eggs, —white, speckled, streaked, or
                    blotched, but never very closely, with light red. Such breeding-stations have
                    been several times described, and among the more recent accounts of one of them
                    are those of Messrs Sclater and W. A. Forbes (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1877,
                    p. 412), and Mr Seebohm <hi rend="italic">{Zoologist,</hi> 1880, p. 457), while
                    a view of another has been attempted by Schlegel <hi rend="italic">{Vog.
                    Nederland,</hi> taf. xvii.). The latest systematic revision of the group is by
                    Dr Reichenow (<hi rend="italic">Journ, fur Ornithologie,</hi> 1877, pp.
                    156-159), but his views have not been wholly accepted in the present article.
