                    large seaport of Glamorganshire, South Wales, is finely situated in an angle
                    between lofty hills, on the river Tawe, near its mouth in the beautiful Swansea
                    Bay, a recess of the Bristol Channel, and on the Great Western, London and
                    North-Western, Midland, and Rhondda and Swansea Bay railway lines, 45 miles
                    west-north-west of Cardiff. Being for the most part of comparatively modern
                    growth, the streets are laid out with great regularity. Swansea retains few
                    traces of antiquity, and some of its more picturesque features have been
                    destroyed to make room for the construction of docks. Of the old castle,<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0764-0733"/> originally founded in 1099 by Henry Beauchamp,
                    earl of Warwick, to secure possession of his lands in the province of Gower, the
                    principal remains are the keep, built by Bishop Gower of St David’s after the
                    castle had been for some time in ruins, a range of arched dungeons lit by
                    loopholes, and the hall, now fitted up for use as a volunteer drill hall. There
                    are fragments of a wall with a Gothic window of the hospital of St David,
                    founded by Bishop Gower in 1331. The church of St Mary’s, founded by the same
                    bishop, was rebuilt in 1739, with the exception of the tower and chancel. The
                    modern public buildings include the guildhall, in the Italian style with
                    Corinthian pillars and pilasters, erected in 1846, and comprehending the
                    municipal offices, the crown and <hi rend="italic">nisi prius</hi> courts, the
                    council chamber, and the library of the Swansea and Neath Incorporated Law
                    Society; the royal institution of South Wales, established 1835, a building in
                    the Ionic style, and embracing a library, a lecture hall, and a museum of
                    geology, mineralogy, natural history, and antiquities; the free public library,
                    schools of art, and art gallery, a fine new building with about 30,000 volumes
                    (including the library of the Rev. Rowland Williams, one of the authors of <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays and Reviews)</hi> and a large number of beautiful
                    engravings; the grammar school, founded by Hugh Gore, bishop of Waterford, in
                    1682; the market (1830); the cattle market (1864); the Albert hall for concerts
                    (1864), with a smaller hall erected in 1881; the agricultural hall; the working
                    men’s club (1875); the Prince of Wales hall (1882); and two theatres. The
                    benevolent institutions include the general hospital, founded in 1817, and
                    rebuilt with the addition of two wings in 1878; the Cambrian institution for the
                    deaf and dumb, founded in 1847, and several times extended; the Swansea and
                    South Wales institute for the blind (1865); the nursing institution (1853); the
                    provident dispensary (1876); the eye hospital (1878); the industrial home
                    (1859); and the sailors’ home (1864). Swansea is specially well supplied with
                    parks and recreation grounds. They include Brynmill grounds between Parkwern and
                    Singleton (1872), 9 acres in extent, and containing a beautiful reservoir and
                    ornamental lawns; Cwmdonkin park, on the uplands, 13 acres, and commanding fine
                    views; the new recreation ground, formed in 1883, 11 acres, situated between
                    Brynmill and the Oystermouth road; Park Llewelyn, to the north of Swansea, 40
                    acres; and the St Helen’s Field, near the beach, about 20 acres, now being laid
                    out. The population of the municipal borough (area 4363 acres) in 1871 was
                    51,702, and in 1881 it was 65,597. The population of the parliamentary borough
                    in 1881 was 73,971. Its area then was 4777 acres, but in 1885, when Swansea
                    received independent representation, the area was diminished, the population of
                    this smaller area being 50,043 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Swansea owes its prosperity to its situation in the neighbourhood of extensive
                    collieries and to its possession of great natural advantages as a harbour. With
                    some exaggeration it has been called the “metallurgical centre of the world,”
                    but the title must at least be allowed in reference to copper, which is imported
                    to be smelted from all parts of the world. The smelting of copper, which has
                    been carried on in the district from the time of Elizabeth, is the distinctive
                    and most important industry of the town, the others including tinplate
                    manufacture, lead smelting, spelter and zinc manufacture, the extraction and
                    manufacture of silver, nickel, and cobalt, iron smelting, Siemens steel
                    manufacture, the manufacture of chemicals, of agricultural manure, and of patent
                    fuel, and the construction of railway carriages and waggons. In Swansea Bay
                    there are valuable oyster fisheries. The earliest harbour works on a large scale
                    were those of the South Dock Company, begun in 1847 and opened in 1859. This
                    dock, which has an area of about 13 acres, with a half-tide basin of 4 acres and
                    a lock 300 feet long by 60 feet wide, is used principally for the export of
                    coal. The north dock, completed in 1882, has an area of about 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /2 acres, in addition to several other smaller docks.
                    An important addition was made by the completion of the Prince of Wales Dock in
                    October 1881, with an area of 23 acres; and as yet this additional accommo
                    dation is more than sufficient for the trade of the port. In 1876 the number of
                    sailing and steam vessels that entered with cargoes and in ballast from foreign
                    countries, British possessions, and coastwise was 7799, of 1,068,062 tons; the
                    number that cleared being 7549, of 1,041,078 tons. In 1885 the entrances were
                    7447, of 1,461,248 tons, the clearances 7051, of 1,366,117 tons. The total
                    average value of the imports of foreign and colonial produce during the five
                    years ending 1885 was about £2,400,000, but has been decreasing; and the total
                    average value of the exports of the produce of the United Kingdom was about
                    £1,500,000, but has been steadily increasing, and has reached over £2,000,000.
                    There is a large trade with France, Portugal, Spain, and the Mediterranean
                    ports. There is also considerable trade with South Africa, and the trade is
                    greater with South than with North America. The exports consist chiefly of the
                    various manufactures of the town, especially tin plates, the direct trade in
                    which between Swansea and American ports has within the last two years attained
                    great importance; and the imports include chiefly metallic ores, timber, and
                    various kind of provisions. Shipbuilding and ship-repairing are carried on, but
                    the industry is of minor importance.</p>
                <p>Swansea owes its origin to the erection of the castle in 1099 by Henry Beauchamp,
                    earl of Warwick, who introduced into it a garrison of English and Flemish
                    colonists. The fortress was frequently assaulted in the 12th and 13th centuries,
                    and in 1260 was burned down by Llewelyn ab Grwfydd, last prince of North Wales.
                    During the insurrection of Owen Glendower against Henry IV. it was again
                    destroyed. Swansea was created a borough by a charter of King John, which is
                    said to be preserved among the records of the Tower of London. The earliest
                    charter in possession of the corporation is that granted by Henry III. in 1234,
                    conferring upon it freedom from toll pontage and other customs. Its privileges
                    were confirmed by Edward II. and Edward III. The town was during the Civil War
                    alternately in the hands of both parties, but in 1647 the castle was dismantled
                    by the Parliamentarians, after which Oliver Cromwell was made lord of Swansea,
                    of the signiory of Gower, and of the manor of Kelvey. The corporation now
                    consists of a mayor, 6 aldermen, and 18 councillors, and the borough has a
                    commission of the peace. From the reign of Henry VIII. it contributed along with
                    other boroughs to return a member to parliament. In 1658 it received a charter
                    from Cromwell permitting it to return a member for itself, but after the
                    Restoration it resumed its character as contributory. In 1832 it became the head
                    of a new district oi boroughs, and in 1885 it received separate representation,
                    while a portion of its area was also included in a district of boroughs to which
                    it gives the name. In the reign of Edward IV. the castle came by marriage to the
                    Somerset family, and it is held by the duke of Beaufort, whose title of Baron
                    Herbert of Gower dates from 1506.</p>
