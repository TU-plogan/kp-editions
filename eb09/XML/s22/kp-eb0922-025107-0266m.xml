                    his successor in the kingdom of Israel. The reign of Solomon has been sketched
                    in <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 405), and his relation to the
                    philosophical and proverbial literature of the Hebrews, the so-called <hi

                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Proverbs.</hi> The political system of Solomon fell
                    to pieces at his death, but the fame of his wisdom and splendour in succeeding
                    generations was all the greater that none of his successors at Jerusalem was in
                    a position to rival him. The many floating and fragmentary notes of various
                    dates that have found a place in the account of his reign in the book of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kings (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> show how much Hebrew
                    tradition was occupied with the monarch under whom the throne of Israel reached
                    its highest glory; and that time only magnified in popular imagination the
                    proportions of so striking a figure appears alike in the unfriendly picture of
                    Solomon in the Song of Solomon (originally, it would seem, sketched in the
                    Northern kingdom, however much it may have been retouched and overlaid by
                    additions of later date—see <hi rend="smallcaps">Canticles)</hi> and in the

                    placed in the mouth of the wise king who had tasted all that life can offer by
                    one of the latest writers of the Old Testament. In the apocryphal book of
                    Wisdom, again, the composition of an Egyptian Hellenist, who from internal
                    evidence is judged to have lived somewhat earlier than Philo, Solomon is
                    introduced uttering words of admonition, imbued with the spirit of Greek
                    philosophers, to heathen sovereigns. The so-called Psalter of Solomon, on the
                    other hand, a collection of Pharisee psalms written in Hebrew soon after the
                    taking of Jerusalem by Pompey, and preserved to us only in a Greek version, has
                    nothing to do with Solomon or the traditional conception of his person, and
                    seems to owe its name to a transcriber who thus distinguished these newer pieces
                    from the older “Psalms<pb break="no"

                    alike of magnificence and of wisdom (Matt. vi. 29; Luke xi. 31). But Jewish
                    legend was not content with this, and, starting from a false interpretation of
                    Eccles, ii. 8, gave him sovereignty over demons, to which were added (by a
                    perversion of 1 Kings iv. 33) lordship over all beasts and birds, and the power
                    of understanding their speech. These fables passed to the Arabs before the time
                    of Mohammed (Nábigha, i. 22), found a place in the Koran, and gave Solomon
                    (Suleimán) a lasting fame throughout the Moslem East. The story of Solomon, the
                    hoopoe, and the queen of Sheba in sur. xxvii. of the Koran closely follows the
                    second Targum to Esther i. 2, where the Jewish fables about him may be read at
                    large. Solomon was supposed to owe his sovereignty over demons to the possession
                    of a seal on which the “most great name of God” was engraved. See Lane, <hi
