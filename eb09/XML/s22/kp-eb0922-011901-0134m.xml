                    Flodden, and to make fierce attacks on Wolsey, and is supposed to have died in
                    1529. In general intellectual force, fierceness of invective, wildness of
                    buffoonery, and coarseness of language Skelton bears some likeness to Swift. But
                    he stands by himself as one of the most eccentric and paradoxical characters in
                    English literature. He began life apparently as the protegé of a pious, learned,
                    and literary lady, the mother of Henry VII., who founded St John’s College and
                    Christ’s College, Cambridge, and translated devotional works from the French. He
                    was himself one of the most notable scholars of his time, was appointed tutor to
                    Henry VIII., was<pb break="no"

                    officio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">propter merita</hi> is left to conjecture) as
                    “unum literarum Britanniarum lumen et decus,” was proclaimed <hi rend="italic"
                    >poeta laureatus</hi> by both universities, and frequently applied this title as
                    well as that of <hi rend="italic">orator regius</hi> to himself without
                    challenge. At about the age of forty he took orders, and was appointed rector of
                    Diss in Norfolk, where he seems to have spent the last twenty-five years of his
                    life. Yet this eminent scholar and churchman is the author of the oldest and the
                    best drinking song in the English language—the drinking song in <hi
                    rend="italic">Gammer Gurton's Needle,</hi> and of one of the coarsest poems in
                    any language— <hi rend="italic">The Tunning of Elinor Rumming.</hi> He is the
                    author of a satire against the clergy of his time— <hi rend="italic">Colin
                    Clout,—</hi> unsurpassed in pre-Reformation literature for direct and merciless
                    ridicule, and of a satire against the great cardinal when at the height of his
                    greatness— <hi rend="italic">Why come ye not to Court?—</hi> boiling over with
                    ferocious invective and insolent contempt. At the same time he had such a repute
                    for rough wit and irregularity of life that he became the hero of a book of
                    “merry tales.” These mythical tales were probably in the mind of the historian
                    who has described Skelton as a “ribald buffoon,” “a profligate and ill-living
                    wretch.” Whether the real Skelton deserved such epithets is doubtful; his verse
                    undoubtedly contains much that may fairly be described as ribaldry and
                    buffoonery. It has not a trace of the chivalrous spirit of Chaucer, and his most
                    characteristic form, known as Skeltonical verse, is wayward and
                    unconventional—adopted as if in mad defiance of regular metre. Still, as Skelton
                    himself claimed for it, “it has in it some pith.”</p>

                    show great power in the vivid description of character.</p>
