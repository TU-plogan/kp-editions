                    (1713-1768), one of the greatest of English humorists, was the son of an English
                    officer, and great-grandson of an archbishop of York. Nearly all our information
                    about the first forty-six years of his life before he became famous as the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> is derived from a short memoir

                    nothing but the barest facts, excepting three anecdotes about his infancy, his
                    school-days, and his marriage. The date of his birth coincides with the close of
                    the Marlborough wars. He was born at Clonmel, Ireland, on November 24, 1713, a
                    few days after the arrival of his father’s regiment from Dunkirk. The regiment
                    was then disbanded, but very soon after re-established, and for ten years the
                    boy and his mother moved from place to place after the regiment, from England to
                    Ireland, and from one part of Ireland to another. The familiarity thus acquired
                    with military life and character stood Sterne in good stead when he drew the
                    portraits of Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim, and the influence of the excitements,
                    shifts, and hardships of this life of vagabond gentility may also be traced in
                    his own character. To its hardening effect we may fairly refer some part of his
                    later reckless defiance of clerical proprieties and comical persistence in
                    self-conscious eccentricity. After ten years of wandering, he was fixed for
                    eight or nine years at a school near Halifax in Yorkshire. His father died when
                    he was in his eighteenth year, and he was indebted for his university education
                    to one of the members of his father’s family. His great-grandfather the
                    archbishop had been master of Jesus College, Cambridge, and to Jesus College he
                    was sent in 1732. He was admitted to a sizarship in July 1733, and took his B.A.
                    degree in 1736. One of his uncles was a prominent church dignitary in Yorkshire.
                    Young Sterne took orders, and through his influence obtained in 1738 the living
                    of Sutton, some 8 miles north of York. On his marriage three years afterwards he
                    was presented to the neighbouring living of Stillington, and did duty at both
                    places. He was also a prebendary of York.</p>
                <p>Sutton was Sterne’s residence for twenty uneventful years—years at least
                    concerning which his biography is silent. The only ascertained fact of
                    consequence is that he kept up an intimacy which had begun at Cambridge with
                    John Hall Stevenson, a witty and accomplished epicurean, owner of Skelton Castle
                    in the Cleveland district of Yorkshire. Skelton Castle is nearly 40 miles from
                    Sutton, but Sterne, in spite of his double duties, seems to have been a frequent
                    visitor there, and to have found in his not too strait-laced friend a highly
                    congenial companion. Stevenson’s various occasional sallies in verse and
                    prose—his <hi rend="italic">Fables for Grown Gentlemen,</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Crazy Tales,</hi> and his numerous skits at the political
                    opponents of Wilkes, among whose “macaronies” he numbered himself,—were
                    collected after his death, and it is impossible to read them without being
                    struck with their close family resemblance in spirit and turn of thought to
                    Sterne’s work, inferior as they are in literary genius. Without Stevenson Sterne
                    would probably have been a more decorous parish priest, but he would probably
                    never have written <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> or left any other
                    memorial of his singular genius. The two friends began to publish late in life
                    and in the same year. The first two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Tristram
                    Shandy</hi> were issued on the 1st of January 1760, and at once made a
                    sensation. York was scandalized at its clergyman’s indecency and indignant at
                    his caricature of a local physician; London was charmed with his audacity, wit,
                    and graphic unconventional power. He went to London early in the year to enjoy
                    his triumph, and found himself at once a personage in society,—was called upon
                    and invited out by lion-hunters, was taken to Windsor by Lord Rockingham, and
                    had the honour of supping with the duke of York.</p>
                <p>For the last eight years of his life after this sudden leap out of obscurity we
                    have a faithful record of Sterne’s feelings and movements in letters to various
                    persons, published after his death by his daughter. At the end of the famous
                    Sermon on Conscience in vol. ii. of <hi rend="italic">Tristram</hi> he had
                    intimated that, if this sample of Yorick’s pulpit eloquence was liked, “there
                    are now in the possession of the Shandy family as many as will make a handsome
                    volume at the world’s service—and much good may they do it.” Accordingly, when a
                    second edition of the first instalment of <hi rend="italic">Tristram</hi> was
                    called for in three months, two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> by
                    Yorick were announced. Although they had little or none of the eccentricity of
                    the history, they proved almost as popular. Sterne’s clerical character was far
                    from being universally injured by his indecorous freaks as a humorist: Lord
                    Faulconberg presented the author of <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> with
                    the living of Coxwold. To this new residence he went in high spirits with his
                    success, “fully determined to write as hard as could be,” seeing no reason why
                    he should not give the public two volumes of Shandyism every year and why this
                    should not go on for forty years. By the beginning of August he had another
                    volume written, and was “so delighted with Uncle Toby’s imaginary character that
                    he was become an enthusiast.” The author’s delight in this wonderful creation
                    was not misleading; it has been fully shared by every generation of readers
                    since. For two years in succession Sterne kept his bargain with himself to
                    produce two volumes a year. Vols. iii. and iv. appeared in December 1760; vols.
                    v. and vi. in January 1762. But his sanguine hopes of continuing at this rate
                    were frustrated by ill-health. He was ordered to the south of France; it was two
                    years and a half before he returned; and he came back with very little accession
                    of strength. His reception by literary circles in France was very flattering. He
                    was overjoyed with it. “ ’Tis <hi rend="italic">comme à Londres,</hi>” he wrote
                    to Garrick from Paris; “I have just now a fortnight’s dinners and suppers upon
                    my hands.” And again, “Be it known I Shandy it away fifty times more than I was
                    ever wont—talk more nonsense than ever you heard me talk in your days, and to
                    all sorts of people.” Through all his pleasant experiences of French society,
                    and through the fits of dangerous illness by which they were diversified, he
                    continued to build up his history of the Shandy family, but the work did not
                    progress as rapidly as it had done. Not till January 1765 was he ready with the
                    fourth instalment of two volumes; and one of them, vol. vii., leaving the Shandy
                    family for a time, gave a lively sketch of the writer’s own travels to the south
                    of France in search of health. This was a digression of a new kind, if anything
                    can be called a digression in a work the plan of which is to fly off at a
                    tangent whenever and wherever the writer’s whim tempts him. In the first volume,
                    anticipating an obvious complaint, he had protested against digressions that
                    left the main work to stand still, and had boasted—not without justice in a
                    Shandean sense —that he had reconciled digressive motion with progressive. But
                    in vol. vii. the work is allowed to stand still while the writer is being
                    transported from Shandy Hall to Languedoc. The only progress we make is in the
                    illustration of the buoyant and joyous temper of Tristram himself, who, after
                    all, is a member of the Shandy family, and was due a volume for the elucidation
                    of his character. Vol. viii. begins the long-promised story of Uncle Toby’s
                    amours with the widow Wadman. After seeing to the publication of this instalment
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tristram</hi> and of another set of sermons,—more
                    pronouncedly Shandean in their eccentricity,—he quitted England again in the
                    summer of 1765, and travelled in Italy as far as Naples. The ninth and last and
                    shortest volume of <hi rend="italic">Tristram,</hi> concluding the episode of
                    Toby Shandy’s amours, appeared in 1767. This despatched, Sterne turned to a new
                    project, which had probably been suggested by the ease and freedom with which he
                    had moved through the travelling volume in<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Sentimental Journey through France and Italy</hi> was intended to
                    be a long work: the plan admitted of any length that the author chose, but,
                    after seeing the first two volumes through the press in the early months of
                    1768, Sterne’s strength failed him, and he died in his London lodgings on the
                    18th of March, three weeks after the publication. The loneliness of his end has
                    often been commented on; it was probably due to its unexpectedness. He had
                    pulled through so many sharp attacks of his “vile influenza” and other lung
                    disorders that he began to be seriously alarmed only three days before his
                    death.</p>
                <p>Sterne’s character defies analysis in brief space. It is too subtle and
                    individual to be conveyed in general terms. For comments upon him from points of
                    view more or less diverse the reader may be referred to Thackeray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Humorists,</hi> Prof. Masson’s <hi rend="italic">Novelists,</hi>
                    and Mr H. D. Traill’s sketch in the “English Men of Letters” series. The fullest
                    biography is Mr Percy Fitzgerald’s. But the reader who cares to have an opinion
                    about Sterne should hesitate till he has read and re-read in various moods
                    considerable portions of Sterne’s own writing. This writing is so singularly
                    frank and unconventional that its drift is not at once apparent to the literary
                    student. The indefensible indecency and overstrained sentimentality are on the
                    surface; but after a time every repellent defect is forgotten in the enjoyment
                    of the exquisite literary art. In the delineation of character by graphically
                    significant speech and action, introduced at unexpected turns, left with happy
                    audacity to point their own meaning, and pointing it with a force that the
                    dullest cannot but understand, he takes rank with the very greatest masters. In
                    Toby Shandy he has drawn a character universally lovable and admirable; but
                    Walter Shandy is almost greater as an artistic triumph, considering the
                    difficulty of the achievement. Dr Ferriar, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustrations of Sterne</hi> (published in 1812), pointed out several
                    unacknowledged plagiarisms from Rabelais, Burton, and others; but it is only
                    fair to the critic to say that he was fully aware that they were only
                    plagiarisms of material, and do not detract in the slightest from Sterne’s
                    reputation as one of the greatest of literary artists. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps"
