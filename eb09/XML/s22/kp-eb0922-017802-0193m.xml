                    called “the father of English geology,” and among his acquaintances “Stratum
                    Smith,” will be generally remembered as the framer and author of the first
                    complete geological map of England and Wales, and as the discoverer of the
                    principle of the identification of strata by their included organic remains. He
                    was born at Churchill in Oxfordshire on 23d March 1769. Deprived of his father,
                    an ingenious mechanic, before he was eight years old, he depended upon his
                    father’s eldest brother, who was but little pleased with his nephew’s love of
                    collecting “pundribs” <hi rend="italic">(Terebratulae)</hi> and “pound-stones”
                    or “quoit-stones” (large <hi rend="italic">Echinites,</hi> frequently employed
                    as a pound weight by dairywomen), and had no sympathy with his propensity for
                    carving sundials on the soft brown “oven-stone” of his neighbourhood. William
                    became a mineral surveyor and civil engineer. In the former capacity he
                    traversed the Oolitic lands of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, the Lias clays
                    and red marls of Warwickshire, and other districts, studying their varieties of
                    strata and soils. In 1791 he surveyed an estate in Somersetshire and observed
                    the strata of the district. In 1793 he executed the surveys and completed the
                    levellings for the line of a proposed canal, in the course of which he confirmed
                    a previous supposition, that the strata lying above the coal were not
                    horizontal, but inclined in one direction—to the eastwards—so as to terminate
                    successively at the surface, and to resemble on a large scale the ordinary
                    disposition of the slices of bread and butter on a breakfast plate—an
                    illustration which he was wont to use on all occasions.</p>
                <p>On being appointed engineer to the Somerset Coal Canal in 1794, he was deputed to
                    make a tour of observation with relation to inland navigation. During this tour,
                    which occupied nearly two months, and extended over 900 miles, he carefully
                    examined the geological structure of the country, and corroborated his
                    preconceived generalization of a settled order of succession in the several
                    strata, a continuity of range at the surface, and a general declination
                    eastwards. Five years subsequently he prepared a tabular view of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Order of the Strata, and their embedded Organic Remains, in the
                    neighbourhood of Bath, examined and proved prior to 1799.</hi> From this period
                    to 1812 he was completing and arranging the data for his large <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geological Map of England and Wales, with part of Scotland,</hi> which appeared
                    in 1815, in fifteen sheets, engraved on a scale of 5 miles to 1 inch. The map
                    was reduced to smaller form in 1819; and from this date to 1822 separate county
                    geological maps were published in successive years, the whole constituting a <hi
                    rend="italic">Geological Atlas of England and Wales.</hi> In January 1831 the
                    Geological Society of London conferred on Smith the first Wollaston medal; and
                    the Government, at the request of several English geologists, conferred upon him
                    a life-pension of £100 per annum. The degree of LL.D. he received from Dublin,
                    at the meeting of the British Association in that city in 1835. At such meetings
                    he was nearly always<pb break="no"

                    commissioners to select building stone for the new Houses of Parliament. The
                    last years of his life were spent at Hackness (of which he made a good
                    geological map), near Scarborough, and in the latter town. His usually robust
                    health failed in 1839, and on 28th August of that year he died at Northampton.
                    He once said he was born on the Oolite, and should wish to be buried on it; and
                    so he was, at Northampton.</p>
