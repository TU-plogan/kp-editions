                    Warwickshire, near the Gloucestershire border, is pleasantly situated on the
                    Avon, and on the Great Western and Midland Railway lines, 26 miles south of
                    Birmingham and 8 south-west of Warwick. The Avon is crossed by a stone bridge of
                    fourteen arches, built by Sir Hugh Clopton in the<pb break="no"

                    bridge of nine arches, built of brick in 1826; and by a foot-bridge erected in
                    1867, at a cost of £500, on the site of a footbridge originally erected in 1599,
                    and rebuilt in 1812. The streets are wide and regular, crossing each other
                    generally at right angles, and, says J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, “with the
                    exception of a few diffused buildings, scarcely one of which is in its original
                    condition, there is no resemblance between the present town and the
                    Shakespearean borough” (compare article <hi rend="smallcaps">Shakespeare,</hi>
                    vol. xxi. pp. 741 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The church of the Holy Trinity
                    occupies the site of a Saxon monastery, which existed before 691, when the
                    bishop of Worcester received it in exchange from Ethelred, king of Mercia. It is
                    a fine cruciform structure, partly Early English and partly Perpendicular, with
                    a central tower and lofty octagonal spire. It was greatly improved in the reign
                    of Edward III. by John de Stratford, who rebuilt the south aisle. He also in
                    1332 founded a chantry for priests, and in 1351 Ralph de Stratford built for
                    John’s chantry priests “a house of square stone,” which came to be known as the
                    college, and in connexion with which the church became collegiate. The present
                    beautiful choir was built by Dean Balshall (1465-91), and in the reign of Henry
                    VII. the north and south transepts were erected. The mural monument of
                    Shakespeare, who is buried in the chancel, is of special interest from its
                    effigy of the poet, undoubtedly an authentic representation, though somewhat
                    altered and damaged by time. The foundation of the chapel of the guild of the
                    Holy Cross was laid by Robert de Stratford. The guild, to which both sexes were
                    admitted, was in existence early in the 13th century, and it was incorporated by
                    a charter from Edward III. in 1322. It was dissolved in 1547. The house in which
                    Shakespeare was born still stands,—although its external appearance is much
                    altered, —and an apartment is by immemorial tradition pointed out as his
                    birth-room. In 1597 Shakespeare purchased New Place for his residence (see vol.
                    xxi. p. 765). Shakespeare’s house was pulled down by Sir John Clopton in 1702,
                    and the large new mansion erected on its site was pulled down by Sir Francis
                    Gastrell in 1759. Chiefly through the exertions of J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps,
                    the site of New Place was purchased by public subscription, and in 1876 handed
                    over to the trustees of the birthplace. The old theatre, which had occupied part
                    of the ground, was taken down in 1872, and in 1877 a new memorial theatre was
                    erected at a cost of £30,000. The other principal buildings of the town are the
                    town-hall, originally erected in 1633, almost entirely rebuilt in 1767-68, after
                    having been severely injured by an explosion, and greatly altered in 1863 at a
                    cost of £2000; the market-house (1820); the corn exchange (1850); the children’s
                    hospital (1871); and the new hospital (1884). The Edward VI. grammar school,
                    where Shakespeare received his education, was founded in 1553. The town is
                    chiefly dependent on the agriculture of the neighbourhood. The population of the
                    borough in 1871 was 7183, and in 1881 (area extended in 1879 to 3865 acres) it
                    was 8054.</p>
                <p>There is no authentic mention of Stratford earlier than the 7th century. It
                    received a charter for a market in the reign of Richard I., but was not
                    incorporated till the reign of Edward VI. The charter of Charles II., granted in
                    his 26th year, remained the governing charter of the town till the passing of
                    the Municipal Act in 1835. The town suffered from a severe epidemic in 1564,
                    from inundations in 1588, and from fire in 1598.</p>
