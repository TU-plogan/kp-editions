                    partnership, because he was far inferior to Addison in purely literary gift, and
                    it is Addison’s literary genius that has floated their joint work above merely
                    journalistic celebrity; but the advantage was not all on Steele’s side, inasmuch
                    as his more brilliant coadjutor has usurped not a little of the merit rightly
                    due to him. Steele’s often-quoted generous acknowledgment of Addison’s services
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> has proved true in a somewhat different
                    sense from that intended by the writer :—“I fared like a distressed prince, who
                    calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid; I was undone by my auxiliary; when I
                    had once called him in I could not subsist without dependence on him.” The truth
                    is that in this happy alliance the one was the complement of the other; and the
                    balance of mutual advantage was much more nearly even than Steele claimed or
                    posterity has generally allowed.</p>
                <p>The famous literary pair were born in the same year, 1672,—Steele in Dublin, the
                    senior by less than two months. Steele’s father, who is said to have been a
                    lawyer, died before he had reached his sixth year, but the boy found a protector
                    in his maternal uncle, Henry Gascoigne, secretary and confidential agent to two
                    successive dukes of Ormonde. Through his influence he was nominated to the
                    Charterhouse in 1684, and there first met with Addison. Five years afterwards he
                    proceeded to Oxford, and was a postmaster at Merton when Addison was a demy at
                    Magdalen. Their schoolboy friendship was continued at the university, and
                    probably helped to give a more serious turn to Steele’s mind than his natural
                    temperament would have taken under different companionship. Addison’s reverend
                    father also took an interest in the warm-hearted young Irishman; but their
                    combined influence did not steady him sufficiently to keep his impulses within
                    the lines of a regular career; without waiting for a degree he volunteered into
                    the army, and served for some time as a cadet “under the command of the
                    unfortunate duke of Ormonde.” This escapade was made without his uncle’s
                    consent, and cost him, according to his own account, “the succession to a very
                    good estate in the county of Wexford in Ireland.” Still, he did not lack
                    advancement in the profession he had chosen. A poem on the funeral of Queen Mary
                    (1695), dedicated to Lord Cutts, colonel of the Coldstream Guards, brought him
                    under the notice of that nobleman, who took the gentleman trooper into his
                    household as a secretary, made him an officer in his own regiment, and
                    ultimately procured for him a captaincy in Lord Lucas’s fusiliers.</p>
                <p>His name was noted for promotion by King William, but the king’s death took place
                    before anything had been done for Captain Steele. He would seem to have remained
                    in the army, though never on active service, for several years longer.</p>
                <p>Steele probably owed the king’s favour to honest admiration of the excellent
                    principles of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero,</hi> his first prose
                    treatise, published in 1701. The “reformation of manners” was a cherished
                    purpose with King William and his consort, which they tried to effect by
                    proclamation and Act of Parliament; and a sensible well-written treatise,
                    deploring the irregularity of the military character, and seeking to prove by
                    examples—the king himself among the number—“that no principles but those of
                    religion are sufficient to make a great man,” was sure of attention. Steele
                    complained that the reception of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero</hi> by
                    his comrades was not so respectful; they persisted in trying him by his own
                    standard, and would not pass “the least levity in his words and actions” without
                    protest. The sensitive and hot-headed “hero” would seem to have been teased into
                    fighting a duel,—his first and last, for he wounded his antagonist dangerously,
                    and from that time was a staunch opponent of affairs of honour. His uneasiness
                    under the ridicule of his irreverent comrades had another curious result: it
                    moved him to write a comedy. “It was now incumbent upon him,” he says, “to
                    enliven his character, for which reason he writ the comedy called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Funeral</hi>." Although, however, it was Steele’s express
                    purpose to free his character from the reproach of solemn dulness, and prove
                    that he could write as smartly as another, he showed greater respect for decency
                    than had for some time been the fashion on the stage. The purpose, afterwards
                    more fully effected in his famous periodicals, of reconciling wit, good humour,
                    and good breeding with virtuous conduct was already deliberately in Steele’s
                    mind when he wrote his first comedy. It was produced and published in 1701, was
                    received on the stage with favour, and owing to its comparative purity helped,
                    along with <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero,</hi> to commend its author to
                    King William. In his next comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Lying Lover, or the
                    Ladies’ Friendship,</hi> produced two years afterwards, in 1703, Steele’s moral
                    purpose was directly avowed; and the play, according to his own statement, was
                    “damned for its piety.” <hi rend="italic">The Tender Husband,</hi> produced
                    eighteen months later (in April 1705), though not less pure in tone, was more
                    successful; in this play he gave unmistakable evidence of his happy genius for
                    conceiving and embodying humorous types of character, putting on the stage the
                    parents or grandparents of Squire Western, Tony Lumpkin, and Lydia Languish. It
                    was seventeen years before Steele again tried his fortune on the stage with <hi
                    rend="italic">The Conscious Lovers,</hi> the best and most successful of his
                    comedies, produced in 1722.</p>
                <p>Meantime the gallant captain had turned aside to another kind of literary work,
                    in which, with the assistance of his friend Addison, he obtained a more enduring
                    reputation. There never was a time when literary talent was so much sought after
                    and rewarded by statesmen. Addison had already been waited on in “his humble
                    lodgings in the Haymarket,” and advanced to office, when his friend the
                    successful dramatist was appointed to the office of gazetteer. This was in May
                    1707. It was Steele’s first connexion with journalism. The periodical was at
                    that time taking the place of the pamphlet as an instrument for working on
                    public opinion. <hi rend="italic">The Gazette</hi> gave little opening for the
                    play of Steele’s lively pen, his main duty, as he says, having been to “keep the
                    paper very innocent and very insipid”; but the position, made him familiar with
                    a new field of enterprise in which his inventive mind soon discerned materials
                    for a project of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n551/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0551-0528"/> his own. <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> made
                    its first appearance on the 12th of April 1709. It was partly a newspaper, a
                    journal of politics and society, published three times a week. Steele’s position
                    as gazetteer furnished him with special advantages for political news, and as a
                    popular habitué of coffee-houses he was at no loss for social gossip. But Steele
                    not only retailed and commented on social news, a function in which he had been
                    anticipated by Defoe and others; he also introduced into <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tatler</hi> as a special feature essays on general questions of manners and
                    morality. It is not strictly true that Steele was the inventor of the English
                    “essay,”—there were essayists before the 18th century, notably Cowley and
                    Temple; but he was the first to use the essay for periodical purposes, and he
                    and Addison together developed a distinct species, to which they gave a
                    permanent character and in which they had many imitators. As a humbler motive
                    for this fortunate venture Steele had the pinch of impecuniosity, due rather to
                    excess of expenditure than to smallness of income. He had £300 a year from his
                    gazetteership, £100 as gentleman usher to Prince George, £800 from the Barbados
                    estates of his first wife,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The name of this lady—a widow, Mrs Margaret Stretch—and some facts about her

                    “Dear Prue” of his charming letters. But Steele lived in considerable state
                    after this second marriage, and was reduced to the necessity of borrowing before
                    he started <hi rend="italic">The Tatler.</hi> The assumed name of the editor was
                    Isaac Bickerstaffe, but Addison discovered the real author in the sixth number,
                    and began to contribute in the eighteenth. It is only fair to Steele to state
                    that the success of <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> was established before
                    Addison joined him, and that Addison contributed to only forty-two of the two
                    hundred and seventy-one numbers that had appeared when the paper was stopped in
                    January 1711.</p>
                <p>Only two months elapsed between the stoppage of <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi>
                    and the appearance of <hi rend="italic">The Spectator,</hi> which was the organ
                    of the two friends from March 1, 1711 till December 6, 1712. Addison was the
                    chief contributor to the new venture, and the history of it belongs more to his
                    life. Nevertheless it is to be remarked as characteristic of the two writers
                    that in this as in <hi rend="italic">The Tatler</hi> Addison generally follows
                    Steele’s lead in the choice of subjects. The first suggestion of Sir Roger de
                    Coverley was Steele’s, although it was Addison that filled in the outline of a
                    good-natured country gentleman with the numerous little whimsicalities that
                    convert Sir Roger into an amiable and exquisitely ridiculous provincial oddity.
                    Steele had neither the fineness of touch nor the humorous malice that gives life
                    and distinction to Addison’s picture; the Sir Roger of his original hasty sketch
                    has good sense as well as good nature, and the treatment is comparatively
                    commonplace from a literary point of view, though unfortunately not commonplace
                    in its charity. Steele’s suggestive vivacity gave many another hint for the
                    elaborating skill of his friend.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi> was followed by <hi rend="italic">The
                    Guardian,</hi> the first number of which appeared on the 12th of March 1713. It
                    had a much shorter career, extending to only a hundred and seventy-five numbers,
                    of which Steele wrote eighty-two and Addison fifty-three. This was the last of
                    his numerous periodicals in which he had the assistance of the great essayist.
                    But he continued for several years to project journals, under great variety of
                    titles, some of them political, some social in their objects, most of them very
                    short-lived. Steele was a warm partisan of the principles of the Revolution,
                    ardent and earnest in his political as in his other convictions. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Englishman</hi> was started in January 1714, immediately after
                    the stoppage of <hi rend="italic">The Guardian,</hi> to assail the policy of the
                    Tory ministry. <hi rend="italic">The Lover,</hi> started some six weeks later,
                    was more general in its aims; but it gave place in a month or two to <hi
                    rend="italic">The Reader,</hi> a direct counterblast to the Tory <hi
                    rend="italic">Examiner. The Englishman</hi> was resuscitated for another volume
                    in 1715; and in the same year he projected in rapid succession three
                    unsuccessful ventures,— <hi rend="italic">Town Talk, The Tea Table,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Chit-Chat.</hi> Three years later he started his most famous
                    political paper, <hi rend="italic">The Plebeian,</hi> rendered memorable by the
                    fact that in it he had to contend against his old ally Addison. The subject of
                    controversy between the two life-long friends was Sunderland’s Peerage Bill.
                    Steele’s last venture in journalism was <hi rend="italic">The Theatre,</hi>
                    1719-20, the immediate occasion of which was the revocation of his patent for
                    Drury Lane. So ready was Steele in this kind of enterprise, which he could
                    always conduct single-handed, that apparently whenever he felt strongly on any
                    subject he at once started a journal to give vent to his feelings. Besides these
                    journals he wrote also several pamphlets on passing questions,—on the disgrace
                    of Marlborough in 1711, on the fortifications of Dunkirk in 1713, on the
                    “crisis” in 1714, <hi rend="italic">An Apology for himself and his Writings</hi>
                    (important biographically) in the same year, on the South Sea mania in 1720.</p>
                <p>The fortunes of Steele as a zealous Whig varied with the fortunes of his party.
                    He lost his gazetteership when the Tories came into power in 1710. Over the
                    Dunkirk question he waxed so hot that he threw up a pension and a
                    commissionership of stamps, and went into parliament as member for Stockbridge
                    to attack the ministry with voice and vote as well as with pen. But he had not
                    sat many weeks when he was expelled from the House for the language of his
                    pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">The Crisis,</hi> which was stigmatized as
                    seditious. The <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> already mentioned was his
                    vindication of himself on this occasion. With the accession of the house of
                    Hanover his fortunes changed. Honours and substantial rewards were showered upon
                    him. He was made a justice of the peace, deputy-lieutenant of Middlesex,
                    surveyor of the royal stables, governor of the royal company of comedians—the
                    last a lucrative post, and was also knighted (1715). After the suppression of
                    the Jacobite rebellion he was appointed one of the commissioners of forfeited
                    estates, and spent some two years in Scotland in that capacity. He obtained a
                    patent for a plan for bringing salmon alive from Ireland. Differing from his
                    friends in power on the question of the Peerage Bill in 1718, he was deprived of
                    some of his offices, but when Walpole became chancellor of the exchequer in 1721
                    he was reinstated. But with all his emoluments the imprudent, impulsive,
                    ostentatious, and generous Steele could never get clear of financial
                    difficulties, and he was obliged to retire from London in 1724 and live in the
                    country. He spent his last years on his wife’s estate of Llangunnor in Wales,
                    and, his health broken down by a paralytic seizure, died on the 1st of September
                    1729.</p>
                <p>A selection from Steele’s essays has been edited by Mr Austin Dobson, who
                    prefixes a careful and sympathetic memoir. Mr Dobson has since written a fuller
                    biography in Mr Lang’s series of <hi rend="italic">English Worthies.</hi> (W.
