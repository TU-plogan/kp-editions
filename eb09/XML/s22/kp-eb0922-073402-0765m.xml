                <p><label type="entry">SWEATING-SICKNESS</label>. A remarkable form of disease, not
                    known in England before, attracted attention at the very beginning of the reign
                    of Henry VII. It was known indeed a few days after the landing of Henry at
                    Milford Haven on August 7, 1485, as there is clear evidence of its being spoken
                    of before the battle of Bosworth on August 22. Soon after the arrival of Henry
                    in London on August 28 it broke out in the capital, and caused great mortality.
                    Two lord mayors successively and six aldermen, beside numerous other persons,
                    died in one week. At the end of October, however, the epidemic in London
                    suddenly ceased. In Oxford it had already begun at the end of August, and lasted
                    with great mortality for six weeks. In the course of the autumn it attacked
                    various places, and by the end of December had spread over all England. Then the
                    epidemic disappeared as suddenly as it came. This alarming malady soon became
                    known as the sweating-sickness. It was regarded as being quite distinct from the
                    plague, the pestilential fever, or other epidemics previously known, not only by
                    the special symptom which gave it its name, but also by its extremely rapid and
                    fatal course and by other characters to be noted presently.</p>
                <p>From 1485 nothing more was heard of it till 1507, when the second outbreak
                    occurred, which was much less fatal than the first (it is said because the
                    treatment was better understood) and attracted less notice. In 1517 was a third
                    and much more severe epidemic. It began in London in July, and lasted till the
                    middle of December. Many distinguished persons died, including Lord Clinton,
                    Lord Grey of Wilton, Andrea Ammonio, the king’s secretary, and others, with an
                    immense number of the common people. In Oxford and Cambridge it was also very
                    fatal, as well as in other towns, where in some cases half the population are
                    said to have perished. There is evidence of the disease having spread to Calais
                    and Antwerp, but with these exceptions it was confined to England.</p>
                <p>In 1528 the disease recurred for the fourth time, and with great severity. It
                    first showed itself in London at the end of May, and speedily spread over the
                    whole of England, though not into Scotland or Ireland. In London the mortality
                    was very great; the court was broken up, and Henry VIII. left London, frequently
                    changing his residence. When the epidemic ceased cannot be accurately stated,
                    nor have we any precise estimate of the mortality. The most remarkable fact
                    about this epidemic is that for the first and last time it spread over the
                    Continent. On the 25th July 1528 (English style) or 1529 (Roman style), when it
                    was beginning to decline in London, it suddenly appeared at Hamburg. The story
                    went that the infection was brought by a ship returning from England, the
                    sailors of which were suffering from the disease. However this may have been,
                    the disease spread rapidly, so that in a few weeks more than a thousand persons
                    died. In less than a week it had spread to Lübeck, and thus was the terrible
                    sweating-sickness started on a destructive course, during which it caused
                    fearful mortality throughout eastern Europe. France, Italy, and the southern
                    countries were spared. It spread much in the same way as cholera, passing, in
                    one direction, from north to south, arriving at Switzerland in December, in
                    another northwards to Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, also eastwards to Lithuania,
                    Poland, and Russia, and westwards to Flanders and Holland, unless indeed the
                    epidemic, which declared itself simultaneously at Antwerp and Amsterdam on the
                    morning of September 27, came from England direct. In each place which it
                    affected it prevailed for a short time only, —generally not more than a
                    fortnight. By the end of the year it had entirely disappeared, except in eastern
                    Switzerland, where it lingered into the next year;<note anchored="true"

                    “English sweat” has never appeared again, at least in the same form, on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>England was, however, destined to suffer from one more outbreak of the disease,
                    which occurred in 1551, and with regard to this we have the great advantage of
                    an account by an eye-witness, John Kaye or Caius, the eminent physician. It
                    first appeared at Shrewsbury on April 13, and, after spreading to other towns in
                    Wales and in the midland counties, broke out in London, causing in one week the
                    death of seven hundred and sixty-one persons. At the end of July it ceased in
                    London, but it went through the east of England to the north, until the end of
                    August, when it began to diminish. At the end of September it ceased altogether,
                    without affecting Scotland or Ireland. Nor did it apparently widely affect the
                    Continent, though Caius mentions its occurrence at Calais, and Brasavolus <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Morbo Gallico)</hi> speaks of the English sweating-sickness as
                    raging in Flanders in the year 1551, in which he wrote, causing the death of
                    several thousand persons, and lasting at least till September.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms.—</hi> The symptoms as described by Caius and others
                    were as follows. The disease began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension,
                    followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and
                    severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great prostration,—in
                    short, the usual symptoms of an acute febrile attack. In some cases the stomach
                    was affected, and there was vomiting, but according to Caius this happened only
                    in those who were full of food. The breathing was deep and frequent, the voice
                    like a moan. After the cold stage, which might last from half an hour to three
                    hours, followed the stage of heat and sweating. The characteristic sweat broke
                    out suddenly, and, as it seemed to those unaccustomed to the disease, without
                    any obvious cause. In some cases it was much more copious than in others, these
                    differences depending, according to Caius, mainly on age, clothing, food, and
                    other external circumstances, and also on the season, sweating being more
                    profuse in hot weather. With the sweat, or after that was poured out, came a
                    sense of heat, and with this headache and delirium, rapid pulse, and intense
                    thirst. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms. No<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0766-0735"/> eruption of any kind on the skin was generally
                    observed; Caius makes no allusion to such a symptom. In the later stages there
                    was either general prostration and collapse, or an irresistible tendency to
                    sleep, which was thought to be fatal if the patient were permitted to give way
                    to it. The malady was remarkably rapid in its course, being sometimes fatal even
                    in two or three hours, and some patients died in less than that time. More
                    commonly it was protracted to a period of twelve to twenty-four hours, beyond
                    which it rarely lasted. Those who survived for twenty-four hours were considered
                    safe.</p>
                <p>The disease, unlike the plague, was not especially fatal to the poor, but rather,
                    as Caius affirms, attacked the richer sort and those who were free livers
                    according to the custom of England in those days. <hi rend="italic">“They</hi>
                    which had this sweat sore with peril or death were either men of wealth, ease,
                    or welfare, or of the poorer sort, such as were idle persons, good ale drinkers,
                    and taverne haunters.”</p>
                <p>Relapses were not uncommon; but the statements sometimes made about the disease
                    attacking the same person several times seem to rest on a misunderstanding of
                    the original authorities. What is meant is that they had several, even twelve,
                    successive attacks of sweating. The disease was not thought to be transmitted by
                    contagion from one person to another. Nevertheless, in its spread, it appears,
                    like cholera, to have followed the main lines of human travel and
                    traffic,—passing with Richmond’s army to Bosworth, thence to London, and so on.
                    It would be difficult otherwise to explain why Calais should have been affected
                    and not the adjacent parts of France. Even the very circumstantial story of the
                    disease having been brought to Hamburg by a ship from England seems by no means
                    incredible, though it is doubted by some.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Causes.—</hi> Some attributed the disease to the English
                    climate, its moisture and its fogs, a view which was thought to be supported by
                    the occurrence of unusual rainfall and atmospheric moisture in the years of the
                    sweating-sickness. But it is plain that the English climate was much the same
                    before and after, and can hardly be regarded even as a predisposing cause,
                    certainly not as an explanation. Nor is there much evidence that the epidemic
                    years were distinguished for their humidity.</p>
                <p>In 1485, 1507, and 1517 the seasons were in no way remarkable. The year 1528
                    (1529 in Continental reckoning) was, however, certainly notable for excessive
                    moisture. In England eight weeks continuous rain began in April, and the harvest
                    was spoiled. In Germany the copious rainfall, and the cold fogs which endured
                    through the summer, gave the impression that the air of England had been carried
                    over to the Continent. In 1551 the outbreak of the sickness in Shrewsbury is
                    described as having been preceded by dense and stinking fogs, which arose from
                    the valley of the Severn and spread over other parts of England. The summer was
                    everywhere very hot, and in England moist as well. In Amsterdam a similar fog
                    announced the outbreak of the sickness in 1528. But we cannot attribute much
                    importance to these circumstances, since in other epidemics they were wanting,
                    and similar conditions have often occurred without any pestilence resulting.</p>
                <p>It was again attributed by some to the intemperate habits of the English people,
                    and to the frightful want of cleanliness in their houses and surroundings whieh
                    is noticed by Erasmus in a well-known passage, and about which Caius is equally
                    explicit. But causes such as these cannot, any more than climate, account for
                    the incidence in time of an epidemic, even if they do something towards
                    explaining its geographical range. Nor is there much evidence that the English
                    were worse in these respects than most European nations, though the native
                    country of Erasmus may have set an early example of cleanliness.</p>
                <p>Caius and some of the chroniclers make out that this special liability of
                    Englishmen to the sweating-sickness followed them even into foreign parts, so
                    that in Calais, Brabant, and Spain it affected the English only and not the
                    natives. This is puzzling and improbable, except so far that the English abroad
                    may have belonged to the same classes who mainly suffered at home. But a careful
                    examination of those statements shows that they referred either to Englishmen
                    who had left England while the disease was raging there and carried the
                    infection with them, or to merchants and others who were in direct communication
                    with home. This disease, like others introduced into a foreign country, did not
                    always take root there. But it did so sometimes, as, according to contemporary
                    evidence, was the case in Flanders in 1551. The statement also made that
                    foreigners in England were not affected likewise requires qualification, since
                    we know several instances of foreigners in London who died of it. On the whole,
                    no great importance can be attached to this supposed special liability of the
                    English physical constitution.</p>
                <p>From all this we must conclude that climate, season, and manner of life were not
                    adequate, either separately or collectively, to produce the disease, though each
                    may have acted sometimes as a predisposing cause. The sweating-sickness was in
                    fact, to use modern language, a specific infective disease, in the same sense as
                    plague, typhus, scarlatina, or ague. The origin of such diseases is not
                    explained by causes such as those above enumerated. We can only suppose that
                    they come into being by laws similar to those which have determined the
                    evolution of species of animals and plants. But when once their specific
                    distinctness is established they “breed true” and always present the same
                    characters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Probable Identity with Miliary Fever.—</hi> The important
                    question, however, arises—Did this specific disease exist before or has it
                    existed after the sixty-six years of its recognized history? or is it identical
                    with any other known disease called by another name? It is very unlikely that
                    any epidemic of so striking a disease should have existed before without having
                    been noticed, and there is certainly no record since of any outbreak precisely
                    similar. The only disease of modern times which bears any resemblance to the
                    sweating-sickness is that known as miliary fever (“Schweiss-friesel,” “suette
                    miliaire,” or “the Picardy sweat”), a malady which has been repeatedly observed
                    in France, Italy, and Southern Germany, but not in the United Kingdom. It is
                    characterized by intense sweating, and occurs in limited epidemics, not lasting
                    in each place more than a week or two (at least in an intense form). On the
                    other hand, the attack lasts longer than the sweating-sickness did, is always
                    accompanied by an eruption of vesicles, and is not usually fatal. It is
                    therefore evidently not the same as the English disease, though allied to it.
                    The first clearly described epidemic was in 1718 (though probably it existed
                    before), and the last in 1861. Between these dates some one hundred and
                    seventy-five epidemics have been counted in France alone. A single epidemic of a
                    disease which had a striking resemblance to the sweating-sickness was observed
                    in 1802 at Rottingen, a village in the district of Würzburg, Germany. Its access
                    was sudden; it affected chiefly robust persons; it was accompanied by profuse
                    perspiration, rheumatic pains, &amp;c., without any constant eruption. If death
                    resulted it was usually in twenty-four hours. The epidemic lasted some ten days,
                    and then entirely vanished. It may be considered as an extremely severe form of
                    miliary fever. Finally, Hirsch has drawn attention to certain cases of a
                    choleraic affection, observed first by Dr Murray in India (1839-40), which has
                    been described as a sweating-sickness. It has, however, more resemblance to
                    miliary fever than to the English sweat. A similar form of disease has been
                    described by some French physicians as “choléra cutané ou sudoral.” On a review
                    of the whole evidence, it would appear that the only disease which the
                    sweating-sickness much resembled was the miliary fever, of which it may
                    conceivably have been, like the Rottingen epidemic; a highly malignant form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Where did it Originate</hi> ?—Whether it really originated in
                    England is a question difficult to answer. Its appearance certainly coincided
                    with the arrival of a foreign army, consisting, as we know, largely of foreign
                    mercenaries, men of foul habits and irregular lives (whom the French king was
                    thought to have done his country a service by getting rid of), and crowded into
                    small vessels. Among such men any infective disease which arose would, by want
                    of cleanliness and overcrowding, be likely to be fostered into great intensity.
                    It is in accordance with the history of many epidemics to suppose that an
                    ordinary and not very fatal disease might under such circumstances assume a
                    malignant form.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    the case even with the oriental plague itself. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Plague.</hi></p></note> Now, supposing that the French soldiers brought with
                    them their native “Picardy sweat,” a malady local and not severe in its French
                    home, might not this have become developed into the formidable English
                    sweating-sickness? If so, its great destructiveness in England would also be in
                    great measure explained by its affecting a new population. For we find that any
                    exported epidemic disease is generally more fatal in a country which receives it
                    for the first time, among a population which offers a virgin soil to the
                    disease, than it was in the country where it was endemic, and where men were
                    inured to the infection. The notable exemption of northern France from the true
                    sweating-sickness would then have depended upon the population there being
                    already inured to a milder form of the same disease. As to southern France and
                    other countries of the south, they were evidently not adapted by climate to
                    receive the infection. If this be true, we need hardly expect to see the
                    sweating-sickness again. The sweat of Picardy may continue from time to time to
                    produce its comparatively slight epidemics; but the conditions which launched
                    the English sweat on its rapid career of destruction are unlikely to occur a
                    second time. The example of the Rottingen epidemic, which on a small scale was
                    scarcely less remarkable, may show, however, that such an event is not quite
                    impossible.</p>
