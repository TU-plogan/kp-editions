                    tapering at both ends. Its greatest length from north to south is 53 miles, and
                    its greatest breadth is 35 miles. The area is 748,433 acres—about 1170 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> Although the general aspect of the
                    county is that of a plain, it has been pronounced “rather a subalpine or hilly
                    district”; but its highest hill, Axe Edge, is only 1756 feet above the level of
                    the sea. In the north the land is undulating and very picturesque; the hills
                    here are the loftiest in the county, as Axe Edge, Cloud Thorpe, Mow Cop, and
                    other hillocks and mounds called “edges.” These are mostly composed of millstone
                    grit. In the south we have sandstone, gravel, limestone, and basalt, represented
                    respectively by Kinfare Edge, Barr and Cannock Chase, Sedgley, and Clent. The
                    principal rivers are the Trent, the Tame, the Sow, the Penk, the Stour, the
                    Blythe, the Tern, the Churnet, the Lyme, the Smestow, and the Manyfold; of these
                    the Trent is the most important. The Severn has a short part of its course
                    within the county, traversing the coal-field at Arley. The Dove separates
                    Staffordshire from Derbyshire. Several of the rivers are well supplied with
                    fish.</p>
                <p>Geologically the county is included in the New Red Sandstone district of England,
                    and is of the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic systems of formation. It is
                    rich in limestone and coal. According to Mr Garner <hi rend="italic">(Natural
                    History of the County of Stafford),</hi> the following is a summary of its
                    geological characters :—the Polley coal-field occupies 51 square miles; the
                    South Staffordshire coalfield (excluding about 11 miles of it situated in other
                    counties), 65; the Silurian limestone, &amp;c., in the south of the county, 16;
                    the Rowley basalt, 1; the Clent basalt, 2; the Arley coal-field, basalt,
                    cornstone, &amp;c., 7; the mountain limestone, 40; the Cheadle coal-field, 18;
                    the Chiddleton coal-field, 1; the Meerbrook coal-field, 4; the millstone grit,
                    100; the New Red Sandstone (marl, gravel, rock, sand, and peat), 825.</p>
                <p>The county is very rich in fossils. In the coal, the limestone, and the Silurian
                    deposits the remains of marine animals and plants are especially numerous. The
                    museums in several towns have good collections of corals, calamites, and ferns;
                    and probably the finest examples of trilobites and encrinites have been found in
                    this part of England. The teeth of the <hi rend="italic">Megalichthys</hi> have
                    been found in the coal strata, and the Dudley museum contains a specimen of <hi
                    rend="italic">M</hi>. <hi rend="italic">hibberti,</hi> nearly entire. The county
                    is very rich in mineral productions. In a single year 12,000,000 tons of coal
                    and 1,173,866 tons of iron have been obtained. The greatest quantity of iron is
                    raised in the north and of coal in the south. Of the places at which the various
                    products are found may be named—Birch Hills for anthracite coal; Hanley Green
                    for peacock coal; Longton for cannel coal; Wednesbury for haematite iron ore;
                    Langley Close for grey marble; the Rowley Hills for basalt. At Bilston casting
                    sand, at Kingswinford fire-clay and fire bricks, at Tutbury alabaster, at Powke
                    Hill black marble, and at Hemley Green red ochre are produced. In December 1885
                    an important discovery of coal was made near Dudley. Mr S. Blewitt has driven
                    from the Grace Mary pits about 250 yards towards the Ivy House estate, through
                    the igneous rocks, and come upon a large area of the best hard coal, about
                    thirty feet in thickness, and some thirty acres in area.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> As regards climate the county
                    shares the characteristics common to the midland district of England.
                    Agriculture, though not its distinctive feature, forms a very important item in
                    the industry and wealth of Staffordshire. The returns for 1886 furnish the
                    following report: in corn crops there were 94,273 acres; roots, artificial
                    grasses, &amp;c., 43,343; clover and grasses, 46,832; permanent pasture,
                    412,566; fallow, 7203; orchards, 1188; market gardens, 866; nursery grounds,
                    233; woods and plantations, 34,911. From the same returns we learn that the
                    number of horses employed in agriculture was 16,031; unbroken horses and brood
                    mares, 7802; cows in milk or in calf, 74,868; cattle under two years old,
                    56,224; two years and upward, 25,922; one-year-old sheep, 142,955; sheep under
                    one year, 106,950; and pigs, 48,569. The total number of proprietors in the
                    county was returned in 1873 as 43,371, possessing 638,084 acres, producing an
                    annual rental of £3,630,254. The estimated extent of waste or common land was
                    7809 acres. Of the owners 33,672 owned less than one acre each. Eight
                    proprietors were owners of more than 10,000 acres each, viz., Earl of Lichfield,
                    21,433; Earl of Shrewsbury, 18,954; Lord Hatherton, 14,901; Marquis of Anglesey,
                    14,344; Sir J. H. Crewe, 14,256; Duke of Sutherland, 12,744; Lord Bagot, 10,993;
                    Sir T. F. F. Boughey, 10,505.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The manufactures of Staffordshire are of a
                    very varied character. Almost everything which is made of iron is manufactured
                    in one town or another; and it would only be tedious to enumerate the almost
                    infinite variety of goods produced. Wolverhampton and Willenhall are famous for
                    locks, Cradley for nails, Oldbury for railway carriages, Walsall for spurs,
                    bits, and saddlery, Tipton for anchors, Smethwick for glass, Soho for steam
                    engines aud hydraulic jacks, Wednesfield for keys, Bilston for tinplate wares,
                    and Bloxwich for bits. Thanks to the labours of Josiah Wedgwood and Flaxman, the
                    pottery work of Staffordshire ranks among the most famous manufactures of the
                    kingdom, and Etruria is a household word wherever the admirable and artistic
                    Wedgwood ware is known. The ale produced at Burton-on-Trent finds a market in
                    almost every civilized country in the world, and in some that can scarcely be so
                    described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The county is admirably provided with
                    railways, canals, and tramways. The main roads are excellent, and are well
                    maintained and kept in capital condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The population in 1861 was
                    746,943; in 1871 858,326; and in 1881 981,013 (males 492,009, females 489,004),
                    an average of 1·31 persons to an acre. Staffordshire is in the Oxford circuit,
                    and is nearly all in the diocese of Lichfield. The seat of the bishopric and the
                    will courts are at Lichfield. The assize town is Stafford. There are five
                    hundreds, each having two divisions :—North Totmonslow (Leek) and South
                    Totmonslow (Cheadle), North Pirehill (Potteries) and South Pirehill (Stone),
                    North Offlow (Burton-on-Trent) and South Offlow (Walsall), East Cuttlestone
                    (Rugeley) and West Cuttlestone (Gnosall), North Seisdon (Sedgley) and South
                    Seisdon (Kinfare). The county has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided
                    into twenty-two petty and special sessional divisions; and there are 247 civil
                    parishes and sixteen poor law unions. The municipal boroughs number twelve:
                    —Burslem, population 26,522; Burton-on-Trent (partly in Derbyshire), 39,288;
                    Hanley, 48,361; Lichfield, 8349; Longton, 18,620; Newcastle-under-Lyme, 17,508;
                    Stafford, 19,977; Stoke-on-Trent, 19,261; Tamworth (partly in Warwickshire),
                    4891; Walsall 58,795; West Bromwich, 56,295; Wolverhampton, 75,766.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0466-0443"/> By the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1885, the
                    parliamentary representation of Staffordshire was arranged as follows:—seven
                    boroughs each returning one member, one borough returning three, and seven
                    county divisions with one member to each,—making seventeen members for the whole
                    county. The county divisions are named respectively Burton, Handsworth,
                    Kingswinford, Leek, Lichfield, North-West, and West. The following is a list of
                    the boroughs, with populations given by or based on the census of 1881
                    Wolverhampton (three members), 164,332; Hanley, 75,912; Newcastle-under-Lyme,
                    49,293; Stafford, 19,977; Stoke-on-Trent, 64,091; Walsall, 59,402; Wednesbury,
                    68,142; West Bromwich, 56,295.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Much antiquarian learning has
                    been employed in showing that Staffordshire was in early ante-Roman days famous
                    for the presence and power of the Druids. Cannock Chase has been described as
                    their headquarters in Britain; and Barr Beacon has been generally accepted as
                    one of their principal places of worship, of which Drood or Druid Heath by its
                    name still preserves the tradition. At the time of Caesar’s arrival in the
                    island this part of England was peopled by tribes whom the Roman authors
                    designate as Cornavii or Carnabii. The conquerors named the central part of the
                    country, which included Staffordshire, Flavia Caesariensis. Two of their most
                    famous roads, Watling Street and Icknield Street, passed through the county,
                    —the first-named from Fazeley through Wall <hi rend="italic">{Etοcctum)</hi> to
                    Wroxeter <hi rend="italic">{Uriconium),</hi> and the Icknield Street through
                    Birmingham to Wall, and by Burton-on-Trent to Derby. In Saxon times
                    Staffordshire formed part of the great kingdom of Mercia, which was remarkable
                    for the tenacity with which the people clung to their old faith and resisted the
                    introduction of Christianity. The new faith, however, prevailed over paganism,
                    and a cathedral was founded at Lichfield. Through the influence of Offa, Pope
                    Adrian in 786 made the see an independent archbishopric, but this honour was
                    only possessed for a short period. Mercia was frequently invaded by the Danes,
                    and several battles were fought in Staffordshire, notably at Tettenhall and
                    Wednesfield (Woden’s Field), and a large number of Danes settled in this part.
                    So rapidly did they occupy the laud that in 1016, when the Danish king Canute
                    divided his conquests into four earldoms, Mercia was believed to have as many
                    Danish as Saxon inhabitants. After the Norman Conquest the county was divided
                    among the Conqueror’s retainers, the barons De Torri, De Montgomery,
                    Fitz-Ansculf, and De Ferrers coming in for the lion’s share. Of after historical
                    events the most noted are the defeat and execution of the earl of Lancaster by
                    Edward II. in 1322, and the battle at Blore Heath in 1459, in which the Yorkists
                    were victorious over the Lancasterians. During the Civil War Lichfield cathedral
                    was besieged in 1643, and Lord Brook was killed by a shot fired from the
                    battlements of the great tower. Mary queen of Scots was imprisoned in Tutbury
                    Castle from 1569 to 1572. In 1745 Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, in his
                    attempt to win the crown of England, penetrated as far as Leek.</p>
                <p>Early British remains exist in various parts of the county; and a large number of
                    barrows have been opened in which human bones, urns, fibulae, stone hammers,
                    armlets, pins, pottery, and other articles have been found. In the neighbourhood
                    of Wetton no fewer than twenty-three barrows have been opened, and British
                    ornaments have been found in Needwood Forest. Several Roman camps also exist in
                    different parts. But of mediaeval times the chief legacy is the cathedral at <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lichfield (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> one of the most
                    beautiful in the kingdom. Of other interesting places the most worthy of notice
                    are Beaudesert, Bentley Hall, Chillington, Dudley Castle, Enville Hall,
                    Ingestre, Stafford Castle, Tamworth Castle, Tixall, and Wrottesley Hall. More
                    modern mansions are Ilam Hall, Alton Towers, Shugborough, Patteshull, Keele
                    Hall, and Trentham. Of famous personages belonging to the county are John Dudley
                    (duke of Northumberland), Cardinal Pole, Archbishop Sheldon, Col. John Lane,
                    General Harrison, Lord Anson, Earl St Vincent, Izaak Walton, Dr Samuel Johnson,
                    David Garrick, Josiah Wedgwood, Miss Seward, Mary Howitt.</p>
