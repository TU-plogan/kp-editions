                    between 26° 19' and 27° 16' N. lat. and 93° 21' and 95° 25' E. long., and
                    covering an area of 2855 square miles. It is bounded on the N. and E. by
                    Lakhimpur district, on the S. by independent Nágá territory, and on the W. by
                    the Nowgong and Nágá Hills districts. Sibságar consists of a level plain, much
                    overgrown with grass and jungle, and intersected by numerous tributaries of the
                    Brahmaputra. It is divided by the little stream Disai into two tracts, which
                    differ in soil and general appearance. The surface of the eastern portion is
                    very flat, the general level being broken only by the long lines of embankments
                    raised by the Aham kings to serve both as roadways and as a protection against
                    floods. The soil consists of a heavy loam of a whitish colour, which is well
                    adapted for rice cultivation. West of the Disai, though the surface soil is of
                    the same character, the general aspect is diversified by the protrusion of the
                    subsoil, which consists of a stiff clay abounding in iron nodules, and is
                    furrowed by frequent ravines and water-courses, which divide the cultivable
                    fields into innumerable small sunken patches or <hi rend="italic">holas.</hi>
                    The chief river is the Brahmaputra, which is navigable throughout the year by
                    steamers and large native craft. The navigable tributaries of the Brahmaputra
                    comprise the Dhaneswari, the Burí Dihing, the Disang, and the Dikhu, all flowing
                    in a northerly direction from the Nágá Hills. Included within the district is
                    the island of Maguli, which is said to have been formed by the silt brought down
                    by the Subansiri river from the Himálayas and deposited in the wide channel of
                    the Brahmaputra. Coal, iron, petroleum, and salt are found in the district. Wild
                    beasts of all kinds abound, including the elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, buffalo,
                    and deer. The climate, like that of the rest of the Assam valley, is
                    comparatively mild and temperate, and the average annual rainfall is about 94
                    inches.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population of Sibságar was 370,274 (males 195,194, females 175,080),
                    of whom Hindus numbered 339,663, Mohammedans 15,665, hill tribes 13,829, and
                    Christians 804. The only place of more than 5000 inhabitants is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sibságar</hi> (see below). Of the total area 359,225 acres were
                    under cultivation in 1883-84, besides 78,710 acres of forests. The staple
                    product is rice, which yields two crops in the year; tea is also extensively
                    grown, Sibságar being second only to Cachar among the tea-growing districts of
                    India; other crops include food-grains, pulses, oilseeds, sugar-cane, and
                    cinchona. The local industries are limited to the weaving of silk and cotton
                    cloth, the making of brass and bell-metal utensils, and coarse pottery. The
                    principal exports are tea, silk, mustard-seed, cotton, and jungle products; the
                    imports include salt, oil, opium, piece-goods, and miscellaneous hardware.</p>
                <p>On the decline of the Aham dynasty Sibságar, with the rest of the Assam valley,
                    fell into the hands of the Burmese. They were expelled by the British in 1823,
                    and in the following year the valley was annexed to British India. The British,
                    however, were indisposed to undertake the responsibilities of administration
                    beyond what seemed absolutely necessary. The country now forming Sibságar
                    district, together with the southern portion of Lakhimpur, was placed under the
                    rule of Raja Purandhar Sinh, on his agreeing to pay an annual tribute of £5000.
                    Owing to the raja’s misrule, Sibságar was reduced to a state of great poverty,
                    and, as he was unable to pay the annual tribute, the territories were resumed by
                    the Government of India, and in 1838 Sibságar was placed under the direct
                    management of a British officer. The tea industry soon brought back prosperity,
                    and the Sibságar peasants now rank among the most contented and wealthy in
                    Assam.</p>
