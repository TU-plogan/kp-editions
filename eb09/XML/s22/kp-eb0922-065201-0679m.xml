                    >Ardea helias,</hi> the first author to notice this form was Fermin, whose
                    account of it, under the name of “Sonnenvogel,” was published at Amsterdam in

                    ii. p. 192), but was vague and meagre. In 1772, however, it was satisfactorily
                    figured and described in Rozier’s <hi rend="italic">Observations sur la

                <p>few years later D’Aubenton figured it in his well-known series <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pl. Enl.,</hi> 782), and then in 1781 came Buffon (<hi rend="italic">H</hi>.
                    <hi rend="italic">N., Oiseaux,</hi> viii. pp. 169, 170, pl. xiv.), who, calling
                    it “Le Caurâle ou petit Paon des roses,” announced it as hitherto undescribed,
                    and placed it among the Rails. In the same year appeared the above-cited paper
                    by Pallas, who, notwithstanding his remote abode, was better informed as to its
                    history than his great contemporary, whose ignorance, real or affected, of his
                    fellow-countryman’s priority in the field is inexplicable; and it must have been
                    by inadvertence that, writing “roses” for “roseaux,” Buffon turned the colonial
                    name from one that had a good meaning into nonsense. In 1783 Boddaert, equally
                    ignorant of what Pallas had done, called it <hi rend="italic">Scolopax

                    he was followed by Latham <hi rend="italic">(Synopsis,</hi> iii. p. 156), by
                    whom it was introduced to English readers as the “Caurale Snipe.” Thus within a
                    dozen years this bird was referred to three perfectly distinct genera, and in
                    those days genera meant much more than they do now. Not until 1811 was it
                    recognized as forming a genus of its own. This was done by Illiger, whose
                    appellation <hi rend="italic">Buryρyga</hi> has been generally accepted.</p>
                <p>The Sun-Bittern is about as big as a small Curlew, but with much shorter legs and
                    a rather slender, slightly decurved bill, blunt at the tip. The wings are
                    moderate, broad, and rounded, the tail rather long and broad. The head is black
                    with a white stripe over and another under each eye, the chin and throat being
                    also white. The rest of the plumage is not to be described in a limited space
                    otherwise than generally, being variegated with black, brown, chestnut, bay,
                    buff, grey, and white—so mottled, speckled, and belted<pb break="no"

                    to resemble certain moths. The bay colour forms two conspicuous patches on each
                    wing, and also an antepenultimate bar on the tail, behind which is a subterminal
                    band of black. The irides are red; the bill is greenish olive; aud the legs are
                    pale yellow. As in the case of most South-American birds, very little is
                    recorded of its habits in freedom, except that it frequents the muddy and wooded
                    banks of rivers, feeding on small fishes and insects. In captivity it soon
                    becomes tame, and has several times made its nest and reared its young (which,
                    when hatched, are clothed with mottled down; <hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1866, p. 76, ρl. ix. fig. 1) in the Zoological Gardens (London),
                    where examples are generally to be seen and their plaintive piping heard. It
                    ordinarily walks with slow and precise steps, keeping its body in a horizontal
                    position, but at times, when excited, it will go through a series of fantastic
                    performances, spreading its broad wings and tail so as to display their
                    beautiful markings. This species inhabits Guiana and the interior of Brazil; but
                    in Colombia and Central America occurs a larger and somewhat differently
                    coloured form which is known as <hi rend="italic">E. major.</hi></p>
                <p>For a long while it seemed as if <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga</hi> had no near
                    ally, but, on the colonization of New Caledonia by the French, an extremely
                    curious bird was found inhabiting most parts of that island, to which it is
                    peculiar. This the natives called the Kagu, and it is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhinochetus jubatus</hi> of ornithology. Its original describers, MM. Jules
                    Verreaux and Des Murs, regarded it first as a Heron and then as a Crane <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rev. et Mag. de Zoologie,</hi> 1860, pp. 439-441, pl. 21; 1862,
                    pp. 142-144); but, on Mr George Bennett sending two live examples to the
                    Zoological Gardens, Mr Bartlett quickly detected in them an affinity to <hi
                    rend="italic">Eurypyga (Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1862, pp. 218, 219, pl. xxx.),
                    and in due time anatomical investigation showed him to be right. The Kagu,
                    however, would not strike the ordinary observer as having much outward
                    resemblance to the Sun-Bittern, of which it has neither the figure nor posture.
                    It is rather a long-legged bird, about as large as an ordinary Fowl, walking
                    quickly and then standing almost motionless, with bright red bill and legs,
                    large eyes, a full pendent crest, and is generally of a light slate-colour,
                    paler beneath, and obscurely barred on its longer wing-coverts and tail with a
                    darker shade. It is only when it spreads its wings that these are seen to be
                    marked and spotted with white, rust-colour, and black, somewhat after the
                    pattern of those of the Sun-Bittern. Like that bird too, the Kagu will, in
                    moments of excitement, give up its ordinary placid behaviour and execute a
                    variety of violent gesticulations, some of them even of a more extraordinary
                    kind, for it will dance round, holding the tip of its tail or of one of its
                    wings in a way that no other bird is known to do. Its habits in its own country
                    were described at some length in 1863 by M. Jouan (<hi rend="italic">Mém. Soc.
                    Sc. Nat. Cherbourg,</hi> ix. pp. 97 and 235), and in 1870 by M. Marie <hi
                    rend="italic">(Actes Soc. Linn. Bordeaux,</hi> xxvii. pp. 323-326), the last of
                    whom predicts the speedy extinction of this interesting form, a fate foreboded
                    also by the statement of Messrs Layard <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1882, pp.
                    534, 535) that it has nearly disappeared from the neighbourhood of the more
                    settled and inhabited parts.</p>
                <p>The internal and external structure of both these remarkable forms has been
                    treated in much detail by Prof. Parker in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> (1864, pp. 70-72) and <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> (vi.

                    Murie in the latter work (vii. pp. 465-492, pls. 56, 57), and the result of
                    their researches shows that they, though separable as distinct l·amilies, <hi

                    remarked that the eggs of both <hi rend="italic">Eurypyga</hi> and <hi

                    even than the figures published <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi>
