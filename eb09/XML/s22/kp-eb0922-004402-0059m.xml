                <p><label type="entry">SIERRA LEONE</label>, a British colony on the West Coast of
                    Africa, the capital of which, Freetown, lies in 8° 39' N. lat. and 13° 14' W.
                    long. It consists of Sierra Leone proper, part of the Quiah country to the east,
                    Tasso Island, &amp;c., in the Sierra Leone estuary, part of the Bullom country
                    to the north, the Los Islands to the north of the Mellicoury (Mellacorée) river,
                    the Banana Islands to the south of the main settlement, Sherbro (Sherboro)
                    Island and part of the Sherbro country, the Turner peninsula, W. E. Tucker’s
                    territory, and generally all the seaboard south to the mouth of the Manoh
                    (Manna) river, which is now recognized as the northern boundary of Liberia. The
                    British territory and protectorate are estimated to have an area of about 3000
                    square miles; and, though it has not all been formally annexed, the whole coast
                    region from the mouth of the Scarcies in 8° 55' N. lat. to that of the Manoh in
                    6° 55' may be considered as British, at least to the exclusion of any other
                    European sovereignty.</p>
                <p>Sierra Leone proper is a peninsula about 18 miles long from north-west to
                    south-east by about 12 broad. It lies between the Sierra Leone estuary on the
                    north and Yawry Bay on the south. Lengthwise it is traversed by a range of high
                    hills attaining a height of 3000 feet in the Sugar Loaf and nearly as much in
                    Mount Horton farther south. From the mainland the peninsula is physically
                    separated by the Bance or Bunce river (properly estuary), which receives the
                    Waterloo Creek and other small streams. Towards the east and south-east the
                    peninsula sinks to the level of the great alluvial zone which extends along the
                    larger portion of this district of the African coast. The hills seem to consist
                    of some kind of igneous rock (popularly misnamed granite) and of beds of red
                    sandstone, the disintegration of which has given a dark-coloured ferruginous
                    soil of moderate fertility. The “lofty green trees” which clothed the “mountain”
                    at the time of its discovery (Cadamosto) have for the most part been destroyed,
                    though Sugar Loaf is still timbered to the top and the peninsula is verdant with
                    abundant vegetation. The Negroes give so little attention to agriculture that
                    the local produce would not feed the population for three months. Among the
                    productions of the peninsula are cola nuts, ginger (in large quantities),
                    malagetta pepper, castor-oil, maize, cassava, ground nuts, and (in small
                    quantities) cotton. Native coffee was discovered in Quiah in 1796, and the
                    growing of Liberian coffee and cocoa has since 1880 been attempted with some
                    success.</p>
                <p>The rainfall of Sierra Leone, according to the Colonial Hospital observations at
                    Freetown, is from 150 to 169 inches per annum. The three months of January,
                    February, and March are practically rainless; the rains, commencing in April or
                    May, reach their maximum in July, August, and September, and rapidly diminish in
                    October, November, and December. It sometimes rains for thirty hours on end, but
                    generally twelve hours of rain are followed by twenty-four, thirty, or more
                    hours of clear and pleasant weather. At the barracks (150 feet higher than the
                    hospital) there are about 40 inches more rain, and at Kissy, 3 miles distant,
                    some 18 or 20 inches less. The annual temperature indoors is from 78° to 86°.
                    The highest reading for 1880 was 95° and the lowest 69°∙33. During the dry
                    season, when the climate is very much like that of the West Indies, there occur
                    terrible tornadoes and long periods of the harmattan,—a north-east wind, dry and
                    desiccating, and carrying with it those clouds of fine dust which the sailors
                    designate “smokes.” The dangers of the climate have long been exaggerated. The
                    low swampy regions are like those of other tropical countries, and Freetown,
                    being badly placed and carelessly kept, is too often a hotbed of malaria and
                    fever; but the higher districts are not the “white man’s grave.”</p>
                <p>According to the census of 1880, the population of the colony was as
                    follows:—peninsula of Sierra Leone with British Quiah, 53,862; Isles de Los,
                    1371; occupiers of factories on the Sierra Leone river paying rent to
                    Government, 52; island of Tasso, 828; British Sherbro (including Bonthe, Mocolo,
                    Mokate, Runtch, York Island, Yelbana, Victoria, Tasso, Bendu, and Jamaica),
                    4333,—total 60,446. But the census officials deem the actual population to be
                    much greater, that of British Sherbro, for example, being pretty certainly 8000
                    or 9000. Ethnographically Sierra Leone is almost “an epitome of Africa.” The
                    following are the more important races that can be distinctly
                    classified:—Mandingos, 1190; Timmanehs, 7443; Joloffs, 189; Baggas, 340; Mendis,
                    3088; Sherbros, 2882; Gallinas, 697; Limbas, 493; Susus (Soosoos), 1470; Fulahs,
                    225; Lokkos, 1454; Serrakulis, 129; Bulloms, 129; Krumen, 610. The direct
                    descendants of the liberated slaves now number 35,430. The Akus or people of
                    Yoruba and the Eboes from the eastern banks of the Niger are most easily
                    distinguished. The white residents number only 163, almost entirely a floating
                    population.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0060-0045"/> Most of the inhabitants depend upon trade, and
                    are collected at the north end of the peninsula, in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Freetown (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) and the neighbouring villages.
                    Freetown has a good supply of pure water, and great improvements in sanitation
                    have recently been effected. Among the villages in the peninsula may be
                    mentioned Kissy (founded in 1817), the seat of two hospitals for male and female
                    incurables, Gloster (1816), Bathurst (1818), Leopold (1817), Charlotte (1818),
                    Regent (1812), Leicester (1809).</p>
                <p>According to the census returns of 1880, there were in Sierra Leone 18,660
                    Episcopalians, 17,098 Wesleyans and Methodists, 2717 of Lady Huntingdon’s
                    connexion, and 369 Roman Catholics. Since 1861-62 there has been an independent
                    Episcopal Native Church; but the Church Missionary Society, which in 1804 sent
                    out the first missionaries to Sierra Leone and has spent about £500,000 on the
                    colony, still maintains certain educative agencies. Fourah Bay college, built by
                    the society on the site of General Turner’s estate (1 ½ miles east of Freetown)
                    and opened in 1828 with six pupils, one of whom was Bishop Crowther, was
                    affiliated in 1876 to Durham university, and has a high-class curriculum. Other
                    institutions are the grammar-school (1846), the Wesleyan high school, and the
                    Annie Walsh Memorial Female Institution.</p>

                <p>With the exception of the ginger, most of these products are brought down the
                    rivers from the interior, and the development of trade has been grievously
                    hampered by inter-tribal wars in non-British territory. A considerable falling
                    off is observable in those articles which require cultivation or labour, or are
                    bulky in transit. Cola nuts have steadily increased in quantity,—that part of
                    the Limba country where they are principally grown being in comparative peace.
                    The supply of india-rubber has decreased, partly through destruction of the
                    trees, partly through war in the Yonnie country. Gum copal is brought from the
                    northern rivers. The Mendi country sends a good deal of rice, which is also
                    grown largely in Sherbro. The total value of all the exports was on an average
                    for 1877-81 £382,620, and for 1882-83 £413,148. The corresponding figures for
                    the imports were £424,447 and £429,273.</p>
                <p>The most northerly territory belonging to the colony is the little group of the
                    Los Islands (Islas de los Idolos), about 80 miles northnorth-west of Freetown to
                    the south of Sangareah Bay. Tamara or Futabar to the west and Factory Island to
                    the east “enclose, like an atoll, an inner basin, in the centre of which lies
                    the much smaller Crawford Island.” The highest point is a knoll some 450 feet
                    above sea-level in Tamara. All these islands are richly clothed with palm trees
                    and flowering underwood. Factory Island is occupied by a French trading
                    settlement. At one time the islands were a great seat of the slave-trade and
                    about 1812-13 were garrisoned by British troops for the suppression of the
                    traffic. The climate was then found to be exceedingly fatal.</p>
                <p>The small island of Matakong, 25 miles south-east, is also British. On the
                    mainland the watershed between the Great Scarcies and the Mellicoury
                    (Mellacorée) has been adopted as the boundary between the French and English
                    protectorates or annexation-areas. The Great Scarcies river (Rio dos Carceres)
                    appears to take its rise in the highlands of the Futa-Jallon not far from the
                    sources of the Senegal, but its upper course has not been completely explored.
                    It is navigable for boats a long way inland, though the ascent from the sea is
                    interrupted by rapids a short distance above Kambia, an important Mohammedan
                    town. The Little Scarcies has its headwaters to the north-east of Falaba, a town
                    of the Sulima country, built in 1768 and visited by Laing (1822), Winwood Reade
                    (1869), and Zweifel and Moustier (1879). The Rokelle or Mabilé river, which
                    falls into the Sierra Leone estuary, is formed by the drainage of the Koranko
                    country. On a creek which reaches the estuary near the Rokelle mouth stands (at
                    the head of navigation) the important township of Port Lokko, a mission station
                    of the Church Missionary Society. The maritime country between the Scarcies and
                    Sierra Leone is called North Bullom (<hi rend="italic">j.e.,</hi> low land); the
                    tribe of the same name has been expelled from much of its territory by the Susus
                    (whose country is the unexplored tract to the south of 11° N. lat.) and the
                    Timmanehs (Timnis). At the angle of Yawry Bay lies the mouth of the Ribbi or
                    Kates river, and about 10 miles farther south is the common outflow of the
                    Kamaranka and the Bompé. At the south side of the bay the small cluster of
                    Plantain Islands corresponds to the Banana Islands on the north off Cape
                    Shilling, which were ceded to the British in 1819 and are noted for their
                    healthiness. Southward opens the broad estuary of the Sherbro (popularly river),
                    which lies between the island of Sherbro, annexed in 1862, and the territory of
                    the same name. The estuary receives the Bagru from the Manoh-Bagru country and
                    the Jong river, whose headstream, the Bampanna, rises far inland in the same
                    country as the Rokelle and has a breadth of 200 feet at Mayosso. From the sea
                    the Jong is navigable for steamers to Matonghbah (or Matubah). It is connected
                    by the Little Bûm Creek with the Great Bûm river, which passes through the Mendi
                    country and descends into the alluvial seaboard by rapids at Motappan. The Bûm
                    loses itself in a curious network of lagoons and creeks separated from the ocean
                    by the long low tract of Turner’s peninsula. The upper Kittam joins it from the
                    east, and by another creek communicates with the Palma or Cassi Lake (20 miles
                    long), which in its turn has a connexion with the Gallinas river (7° S. lat.).
                    On the narrow strip of land between the ocean and the lake lies Lavanna, an
                    important trading port, where a short line of railway has been laid down.
                    Parallel with the Gallinas flows the Moah or Sulimah river (falls at Whidaro),
                    at the mouth of which is the town of Sulimah; and about 10 miles farther east is
                    the Manoh river. The countries inland between the Manoh and the Sulimah are
                    Gbemna or Massaquoi, Soro, M’perri, Barrie, Cowrah, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Sierra Leone (in the original Portuguese form
                    Sierra Leona) was known to its native inhabitants as Romarong or the Mountain,
                    and received the current designation from the Portuguese discoverer Piedro de
                    Cintra (1462) on account of the lion-like roaring of the thunder on its
                    hill-tops. An English fort was built on the Sierra Leone estuary towards the
                    close of the 17th century, but was soon afterwards abandoned. In 1786 Dr
                    Smeathman proposed his scheme for founding on the peninsula a colony of
                    liberated African slaves; and in 1787 Captain Thompson, having purchased the
                    territory from Naimbana or King Tom of the Timmanehs, commenced the settlement
                    with 400 Negroes and 60 (Europeans. Owing mainly to the utter shiftlessness of
                    the settlers and partly to a hostile attack by a body of natives, this first
                    attempt proved a complete failure. In 1791 Falconbridge collected the surviving
                    fugitives and laid out a new settlement (Granville’s Town); and the promoters of
                    the enterprise—Granville Sharp, William Wilberforce, William Ludlam, Sir Richard
                    Carr Glynn, &amp;c., hitherto known as the St George’s Bay Company—obtained a
                    charter incorporating them as the Sierra Leone Company (31 Geo. III. c. 55). In
                    1792 Clarkson introduced into the colony 1200 Negroes from the Bahamas and Nova
                    Scotia. Afzelius the botanist and Nordenskjöld the mineralogist were sent out to
                    explore the capabilities of the country; but the latter soon after died at Port
                    Lokko (Port Logo). In 1794 the settlement, which had been again transferred to
                    Freetown, was plundered by the French. An attempt to found a similar colony on
                    Bulama (mouth of the Rio Grande) was a complete failure (Dalrymple and Beaver).
                    In 1800 the company was allowed to make laws not repugnant to those of England,
                    but in 1807 it was glad to transfer all its rights to the crown. Sydney Smith’s
                    jest that Sierra Leone had always two governors, one just arrived in the colony
                    and the other just arrived in England, is but a slight exaggeration. There were
                    eight changes between 1808 and 1824, and as many between 1865 and 1881. The
                    names of Zachary Macaulay. Sir Charles Macarthy, Sir Stephen J. Hill, Sir Arthur
                    Kennedy, Sir Samuel Rowe, and A. E. Havelock deserve to be mentioned. In 1825
                    General Turner concluded a treaty placing Turner’s peninsula, &amp;c., under
                    British protection; but effect was not given to it till 1881. In 1875 the mouths
                    of the Kates, Kamaranka, Bompé, and Cockboro were annexed, and in 1883 the
                    seaboard towards the Liberian frontier. British influence has been peacefully
                    advancing inland under Sir Samuel Rowe. In 1866 Sierra Leone was made the seat
                    of government of the new general government of the British settlements on the
                    West Coast of Africa (comprising Sierra Leone, Gambia, the Gold Coast, and
                    Lagos, each of which was to have a legislative council); but in 1874 the Gold
                    Coast and Lagos were raised to a separate government, and the Gambia alone
                    remains attached to Sierra Leone.</p>
