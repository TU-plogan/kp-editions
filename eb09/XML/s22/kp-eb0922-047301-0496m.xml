                <p>1. A <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat-Engine</hi> is a machine in which heat is employed
                    to do mechanical work. In all practical heat-engines, work is done through the
                    expansion by heat of a fluid which overcomes resistance as it expands—in
                    steam-engines by the expansion of water and water-vapour, in air-engines by the
                    expansion of hot air, in gas-engines by the expansion of a burnt mixture of air
                    and gas. One of the most simple and historically one of the oldest types of
                    heat-engines are guns, in which heat, generated by the combustion of an
                    explosive, does work in giving energy of motion to a projectile. But guns differ
                    so widely from all other types, both in their purpose and in their development,
                    that it is convenient to leave them out of account in treating of engines which
                    may serve as prime movers to other mechanism.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Early History of the Steam-Engine.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The earliest notices of heat-engines are found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pneumatica</hi> of Hero of Alexandria (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 130 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.). Two</hi> contrivances described there deserve mention.
                    One is the aeolipile, a steam reaction-turbine consisting of a spherical vessel
                    pivoted on a central axis and supplied with steam through one of the pivots. The
                    steam escapes by bent pipes facing tangentially in opposite directions, at
                    opposite ends of a diameter perpendicular to the axis. The globe revolves by
                    reaction from the escaping steam, just as a Barker’s mill is driven by escaping
                    water. Another apparatus described by Hero (fig. 1)<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From Greenwood’s·translation of Hero’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ρneumatica.</hi></p></note> is interesting as the prototype of a
                    class of engines which long after wards became practically important. A hollow
                    altar containing air is heated by a fire kindled on it; the air in expand ing
                    drives some of the water contained in a spherical vessel beneath the altar into
                    a bucket, which descends and opens the temple doors above by pulling round a
                    pair of vertical posts to which the doors are fixed. When the fire is
                    extinguished the air cools, the water leaves the bucket, and the doors close. In
                    another device a jet of water driven out by expanding air is turned to account
                    as a fountain.</p>
                <p>3. From the time of Hero to the 17th century there is no progress to record,
                    though here and there we find evidence that appliances like those described by
                    Hero were used for trivial purposes, such as organ-blowing and the turning of
                    spits. The next distinct step was the publication in 1601 of a treatise on
                    pneumatics by Giovanni Battista della Porta, in which he shows an apparatus
                    similar to Hero’s fountain, but with steam instead of air as the displacing
                    fluid. Steam generated in a separate vessel passes into a closed chamber
                    containing water, from which a pipe (open under the water) leads out. He also
                    points out that the condensation of steam in the closed chamber may be used to
                    produce a vacuum and suck up water from a lower level. In fact, his suggestions
                    anticipate very fully the engine which a century later became in the hands of
                    Savery the earliest commercially successful steam-engine.</p>
                <p>In 1615 Solomon de Caus gives a plan of forcing up water by a steam fountain
                    which differs from Della Porta’s only in having one vessel serve both as boiler
                    and as displacement-chamber, the hot water being itself raised.</p>
                <p>4. Another line of invention was taken by Giovanni Branca (1629), who designed an
                    engine shaped like a water-wheel, to be driven by the impact of a jet of steam
                    on its vanes, and, in its turn, to drive other mechanism for various useful
                    purposes. But Branca’s suggestion was unproductive, and we find the course of
                    invention revert to the line followed by Della Porta and De Caus.</p>
                <p>5. The next contributor is one whose place is not easily assigned. To Edward
                    Somerset, second marquis of Worcester, appears to be due the credit of making
                    the first useful steam-engine. Its object was to raise water, and it worked
                    probably like Della Porta’s model, but with a pair of displacement-chambers,
                    from each of which alternately water was forced by steam from an independent
                    boiler, or perhaps by applying heat to the chamber itself, while the other
                    vessel was allowed to refill. Lord Worcester’s description of the engine in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Century of Inventions</hi> (1663) is obscure, and no drawings
                    are extant. It is therefore difficult to say whether there were any distinctly
                    novel features except the double action; in particular it is not clear whether
                    the suction of a vacuum was used to raise water as well as the direct pressure
                    of steam. An engine of about two horse-power was in use at Vauxhall in 1656, and
                    the walls of Raglan Castle contain traces of another, but neither Worcester’s
                    efforts nor those of his widow were successful in securing the commercial
                    success of his engine.</p>
                <p>6. This success was reserved for Thomas Savery, who in 1698 obtained a patent for
                    a water-raising engine, shown in fig. 2. Steam is admitted to one of the oval
                    vessels A, displacing water, which it drives up through the check-valve B. When
                    the vessel A is emptied of water, the supply of steam is stopped, and the steam
                    al ready there is con densed by allowing a jet of cold water from a cistern
                    above to stream over the outer surface of the vessel. This pro duces a vacuum
                    and causes water to be sucked up through the pipe C and the valve D. Mean while,
                    steam has been displacing water from the other vessel, and is ready to be
                    condensed there. The valves B and D open only upwards. The supplementary boiler
                    and furnace E are for feeding water to the main boiler; E is filled while cold
                    and a fire is lighted under it; it then acts like the vessel of De Caus in
                    forcing a supply of feed-water into the main boiler F. The gauge-cocks G, G are
                    an interesting feature of detail. Another form of Savery’s engine had only one
                    displacement-chamber and worked intermittently. In the use of artificial means
                    to condense the steam, and in the application<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0497-0474"/> of the vacuum so formed to raise water by suction
                    from a level lower than that of the engine, Savery’s engine was probably an
                    improvement on Worcester’s; in any case it found what Worcester’s engine had
                    failed to find,—considerable employment in pumping mines and in raising water to
                    supply houses and towns, and even to drive waterwheels. A serious difficulty
                    which prevented its general use in mines was the fact that the height through
                    which it would lift water was limited by the pressure the boiler and vessels
                    could bear. Pressures as high as 8 or 10 atmospheres were employed—and that,
                    too, without a safety-valve—but Savery found it no easy matter to deal with
                    high-pressure steam; he complains that it melted his common solder, and forced
                    him, as Desaguliers tells us, “to be at the pains and charge to have all his
                    joints soldered with spelter.” Apart from this drawback the waste of fuel was
                    enormous, from the condensation of steam which took place on the surface of the
                    water and on the sides of the displacement-chamber at each stroke; the
                    consumption of coal, was, in proportion to the work done, some twenty times
                    greater than in a good modern steam-engine. In a tract called <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Miner's Friend,</hi> Savery alludes thus to the alternate heating and
                    cooling of the water-vessel: “On the outside of the vessel you may see how the
                    water goes out as well as if the vessel were transparent, for so far as the
                    steam continues within the vessel so far is the vessel dry without, and so very
                    hot as scarce to endure the least touch of the hand. But as far as the water is,
                    the said vessel will be cold and wet where any water has fallen on it; which
                    cold and moisture vanishes as fast as the steam in its descent takes place of
                    the water.” Before Savery’s engine was entirely displaced by its successor,
                    Newcomen’s, it was improved by Desaguliers, who applied to it the safety valve
                    (invented by Papin), and substituted condensation by a jet of cold water within
                    the vessel for the surface condensation used by Savery.</p>
                <p>7. So early as 1678 the use of a piston and cylinder (long before known as
                    applied to pumps) in a heat-engine had been suggested by Jean Heautefeuille, who
                    proposed to use the explosion of gunpowder either to raise a piston or to force
                    up water, or to produce, by the subsequent cooling of the gases, a partial
                    vacuum into which water might be sucked up. Two years later Huygens described an
                    engine in which the explosion of gunpowder in a cylinder expelled part of the
                    gaseous contents, after which the cooling of the remainder caused a piston to
                    descend under atmospheric pressure, and the piston in descending did work by
                    raising a weight.</p>
                <p>8. In 1690 Denis Papin, who ten years before had invented the safety-valve as an
                    adjunct to his “digester,” 'suggested that the condensation of steam should be
                    employed to make a vacuum under a piston previously raised by the expansion of
                    the steam. Papin’s was the earliest cylinder and piston steam-engine, and his
                    plan of using steam was that which afterwards took practical shape in the
                    atmospheric engine of Newcomen. But his scheme was made unworkable by the fact
                    that he proposed to use but one vessel as both boiler and cylinder.</p>
                <p>A small quantity of water was placed at the bottom of a cylinder and heat was
                    applied. When the piston had risen the fire was removed, the steam was allowed
                    to cool, and the piston did work in its down-stroke under the pressure of the
                    atmosphere. After hearing of Savery’s engine in 1705 Papin turned his attention
                    to improving it, and devised a modified form, shown in fig. 3, in which the
                    displacement-chamber A was a cylinder, with a floating diaphragm or piston on
                    the top of the water to keep the water and steam from direct contact with one
                    another. The water was delivered into a closed air-vessel B, from which it
                    issued in a continuous stream against the vanes of a water-wheel. After the
                    steam had done its work in the displacement-chamber it was allowed to escape by
                    the stop-cock C instead of being condensed. Papin’s engine was in fact a
                    non-condensing single-acting steam-pump, with steam-cylinder and pump-cylinder
                    in one. A curious feature of it was the heater D, a hot mass of metal placed in
                    the diaphragm for the purpose of keeping the steam dry. Among the many
                    inventions of Papin was a boiler with an internal fire-box,—the earliest example
                    of a construction that is now almost universal.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an account of Papin’s inventions, see his
                    <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters,</hi> by Dr E. Gerland, Berlin,
                    1881.</p></note></p>
                <p>9. While Papin was thus going back from his first notion of a piston-engine to
                    Savery’s cruder type, a new inventor had appeared who made the piston-engine a
                    practical success by separating the boiler from the cylinder and by using (as
                    Savery had done) artificial means to condense the steam. This was Newcomen, who
                    in 1705, with his assistant Cawley, gave the steam-engine the form shown in fig.
                    4. Steam admitted from the boiler to the cylinder allowed the piston to be
                    raised by a heavy counterpoise on the other side of the beam.</p>
                <p>Then the steam-</p>
                <p>valve was shut and a jet of cold water entered the cylinder and condensed the
                    steam. The piston was consequently forced down by the pressure of the at
                    mosphere and did work on the pump.,</p>
                <p>The next entry of steam expelled the condensed water from the cylinder through an
                    escape valve. The piston was kept tight by a layer of water on its upper
                    surface. Condensation was at first effected by cooling the outside of the
                    cylinder, but the accidental leakage of the packing water past the piston showed
                    the advantage of condensing by a jet of injection water, and this plan took the
                    place of surface condensation. The engine used steam whose pressure was little
                    if at all greater than that of the atmosphere; sometimes indeed it was worked
                    with the manhole lid off the boiler.</p>
                <p>10. About 1711 Newcomen’s engine began to be introduced for pumping mines; and in
                    1713 a boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves
                    of an engine he attended, made the engine selfacting by causing the beam itself
                    to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches. Potter’s rude device
                    was simplified in 1718 by Henry Beighton, who suspended from the beam a rod
                    called the plug-tree, which worked the valves by means of tappets. By 1725 the
                    engine was in common use in collieries, and it held its place without material
                    change for about three-quarters of a century in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0498-0475"/> all. Near the close of its career the atmospheric
                    engine was much improved in its mechanical details by Smeaton, who built many
                    large engines of this type about the year 1770, just after the great step which
                    was to make Newcomen’s engine obsolete had been taken by James Watt.</p>
                <p>Compared with Savery’s engine, Newcomen’s had (as a pumping-engine) the great
                    advantage that the intensity of pressure in the pumps was not in any way limited
                    by the pressure of the steam. It shared with Savery’s, in a scarcely less
                    degree, the defect already pointed out, that steam was wasted by the alternate
                    heating and cooling of the vessel into which it was led. Though obviously
                    capable of more extended uses, it was in fact almost exclusively employed to
                    raise water,—in some instances for the purpose of turning water-wheels to drive
                    other machinery. Even contemporary writers complain of its “vast consumption of
                    fuel,” which appears to have been scarcely smaller than that of the engine of
                    Savery.</p>
                <p>11. In 1763 James Watt, an instrument maker in Glasgow, while engaged by the
                    university in repairing a model of Newcomen’s engine, was struck with the waste
                    of steam to which the alternate chilling and heating of the cylinder gave rise.
                    He saw that the remedy, in his own words, would lie in keeping the cylinder as
                    hot as the steam that entered it. With this view he added to the engine a new
                    organ—an empty vessel separate from the cylinder, into which the steam should be
                    allowed to escape from the cylinder, to be condensed there by the application of
                    cold water either outside or as a jet. To preserve the vacuum in his condenser
                    he added a pump called the air-pump, whose function was to pump from it the
                    condensed steam and water of condensation, as well as the air which would
                    otherwise accumulate by leakage or by being brought in with the steam or with
                    the injection water. Then as the cylinder was no longer used as a condenser he
                    was able to keep it hot by clothing it with non-conducting bodies, and in
                    particular by the use of a <hi rend="italic">steam-jacket,</hi> or layer of hot
                    steam between the cylinder and an external casing. Further, and still with the
                    same object, he covered in the top of the cylinder, taking the piston-rod out
                    through a steam-tight stuffing-box, and allowed steam instead of air to press
                    upon the piston’s upper surface. The idea of using a separate condenser had no
                    sooner occurred to Watt than he put it to the test by constructing the apparatus
                    shown in fig. 5. There A is the cylinder, B a surface condenser, and C the
                    air-pump. The cylinder was filled with steam above the piston, and a vacuum was
                    formed in the sur face condenser B. On opening the stop-cock D the steam rushed
                    over from the cylinder and was condensed, while the piston rose and lifted a
                    weight. After seve ral trials Watt patented his im provements in 1769; they are
                    described in his specification in the following words, which, apart from their
                    immense historical interest, deserve careful study as a statement of principles
                    which to this day guide the scientific development of the steam-engine :—</p>

                    fire-engines, consists of the following principles :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“First,</hi> That vessel in which the powers of steam are to be
                    employed to work the engine, which is called the cylinder in common
                    fire-engines, and which I call the steam-vessel, must, during the whole time the
                    engine is at work, be kept as hot as the steam that enters it; first by
                    enclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that transmit heat
                    slowly; secondly, by surrounding it with steam or other heated bodies; and,
                    thirdly, by suffering neither water nor any other substance colder than the
                    steam to enter or touch it during that time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Secondly,</hi> In engines that are to be worked wholly or
                    partially by condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in vessels
                    distinct from the steam-vessels or cylinders, although occasionally
                    communicating with them; these vessels I call condensers; and, whilst the
                    engines are working, these condensers ought at least to be kept as cold as the
                    air in the neighbourhood of the engines, by application of water or other cold
                    bodies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Thirdly,</hi> Whatever air or other elastic vapour is not
                    condensed by the cold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the
                    engine, is to be drawn out of the steam-vessels or condensers by means of pumps,
                    wrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Fourthly,</hi> I intend in many cases to employ the expansive
                    force of steam to press on the pistons, or whatever may be used instead of them,
                    in the same manner in which the pressure of the atmosphere is now employed in
                    common fire-engines. In cases where cold water cannot be had in plenty, the
                    engines may be wrought by this force of steam only, by discharging the steam
                    into the air after it has done its office. . . .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Sixthly,</hi> I intend in some cases to apply a degree of cold
                    not capable of reducing the steam to water, but of contracting it considerably,
                    so that the engines shall be worked by the alternate expansion and contraction
                    of the steam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Lastly,</hi> Instead of using water to render the pistons and
                    other parts of the engine air and steam tight, I employ oils, wax, resinous
                    bodies, fat of animals, quicksilver and other metals in their fluid state.”</p>
                <p>The fifth claim was for a rotary engine, and need not be quoted here.</p>
                <p>The “common fire-engine” alluded to was the steam-engine, or, as it was more
                    generally called, the “atmospheric” engine of Newcomen. Enormously important as
                    Watt’s first patent was, it resulted for a time in the production of nothing
                    more than a greatly improved engine of the Newcomen type, much less wasteful of
                    fuel, able to make faster strokes, but still only suitable for pumping, still
                    single-acting, with steam admitted during the whole stroke, the piston, as
                    before, pulling the beam by a chain working on a circular arc. The condenser was
                    generally worked by injection, but Watt has left a model of a surface condenser
                    made up of small tubes, in every essential respect like the condensers now used
                    in marine engines.</p>
                <p>12. Fig. 6 is an example of the Watt pumping-engine of this period. It should be
                    noticed that, although the top of the cylinder is closed and steam has ac cess
                    to the upper side of the piston, this is done only to keep the cylinder and
                    piston warm. The engine is still single-acting; the steam in the upper side
                    merely plays the part which was played in Newcomen’s engine by the atmosphere;
                    and it is the lower end of the cylinder alone that is ever put in communication
                    with the condenser.</p>
                <p>There are three valves, — the</p>
                <p>“steam” valve <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the “equilibrium” valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> and the “exhaust” valve <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> At the beginning of
                    the down-stroke <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is opened to produce a vacuum below the
                    piston and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n499/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0499-0476"/> opened to admit steam above it. At the end of the
                    downstroke <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are shut and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is opened. This puts the two sides in equilibrium, and
                    allows the piston to be pulled up by the pump-rod P, which is heavy enough to
                    serve as a counterpoise. C is the condenser, and A the air-pump, which
                    discharges into the hot well H, whence the supply of the feed-pump F is
                    drawn.</p>
                <p>13. In a second patent (1781) Watt describes the “sun-and-planet” wheels and
                    other methods of making the engine give continuous revolving motion to a shaft
                    provided with a fly-wheel. He had invented the crank and connecting-rod for this
                    purpose, but it had meanwhile been patented by one Pickard, and Watt, rather
                    than make terms with Pickard, whom he regarded as a plagiarist of his own ideas,
                    made use of his sun-and-planet motion until the patent on the crank expired. The
                    reciprocating motion of earlier forms had served only for pumping; by this
                    invention Watt opened up for the steam-engine a thousand other channels of
                    usefulness. The engine was still single-acting; the connecting rod was attached
                    to the far end of the beam, and that carried a counterpoise which served to
                    raise the piston when steam was admitted below it.</p>
                <p>14. In 1782 Watt patented two further improvements of the first importance, both
                    of which he had invented some years before. One was the use of double action,
                    that is to say, the application of steam and vacuum to each side of the piston
                    alternately. The other (invented as early as 1769) was the use of steam
                    expansively, in other words the plan (now used in all engines that aim at
                    economy of fuel) of stopping the admission of steam when the piston had made
                    only a part of its stroke, and allowing the rest of the stroke to be performed
                    by the expansion of the steam already in the cylinder. To let the piston push as
                    well as pull the end of the beam Watt devised his so-called parallel motion, an
                    arrangement of links connecting the piston-</p>
                <p>rod head with the beam in such a way as to guide the rod to move in a very nearly
                    straight line. He further added the throttle-valve, for regulating the rate of
                    admission of steam, and the centrifugal gover nor, a double conical pendulum,
                    which con trolled the speed by acting on the throttle-</p>
                <p>valve. The stage of de velopment reached at this time is illus trated by the en
                    gine of fig. 7 (from</p>
                <p>Stuart’s <hi rend="italic">History of</hi><hi rend="italic">the
                    Steam-Engine),</hi> which shows the parallel motion <hi rend="italic">pp,</hi>
                    the governor <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> the throttle-valve <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> and a pair of steam and exhaust valves at each end of the cylinder.
                    Among other inventions of Watt were the “indicator,” by which diagrams showing
                    the relation of the steam-pressure in the cylinder to the movement of the piston
                    are automatically drawn; a steam tilt-hammer; and also a steam locomotive for
                    ordinary roads,—but this invention was not prosecuted.</p>
                <p>In partnership with Matthew Boulton, Watt carried on in Birmingham the
                    manufacture and sale of his engines with the utmost success, and held the field
                    against all rivals in spite of severe assaults on the validity of his patents.
                    Notwithstanding his accurate knowledge of the advantage to be gained by using
                    steam expansively he continued to employ only low pressures—seldom more than 7
                    lb per square inch over that of the atmosphere. His boilers were fed, as
                    Newcomen’s had been, through an open pipe which rose high enough to let the
                    column of water in it balance the pressure of the steam. He introduced the term
                    “horse-power” as a mode of rating engines, defining one horse-power as the rate
                    at which work is done when 33,000 lb) are raised one foot in one minute. This
                    estimate was based on trials of the work done by horses; it is excessive as a
                    statement of what an average horse can do, but Watt purposely made it so in
                    order that his customers might have no reason to complain on this score.</p>
                <p>15. In the fourth claim in Watt’s first patent, the second sentence describes a
                    non-condensing engine, which would have required steam of a higher pressure.
                    This, however, was a line of invention which Watt did not follow up, perhaps
                    because so early as 1725 a non-condensing engine had been described by Leupold
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarum.</hi> Leupold’s proposed engine is
                    shown in fig. 8, which makes its action sufficiently clear. Watt’s aversion to
                    high-pressure steam was strong, and its influence on steam-engine practice long
                    sur vived the expiry of his patents.</p>
                <p>So much indeed was this the case that the terms “high-</p>
                <p>pressure” and “non-condens ing” were for many years synonymous, in contra
                    distinction to the “low-</p>
                <p>pressure” or condensing engines of Watt. This nomenclature no longer holds; in
                    modern practice many condensing engines use as high pressures as non-condensing
                    engines, and by doing so are able to take advantage of</p>
                <p>Watt’s great invention of expansive working to a degree which was impossible in
                    his own practice.</p>
                <p>16. The introduction of the non-condensing and, at that time, relatively
                    high-pressure engine, was effected in England by Trevithick and in America by
                    Oliver Evans about 1800. Both Evans and Trevithick applied their engines to
                    propel carriages on roads, and both used for boiler a cylindrical vessel with a
                    cylindrical flue inside— the construction now known as the Cornish boiler. In
                    partnership with Bull, Trevithick had previously made direct-acting
                    pumping-engines, with an inverted cylinder set over and in line with the
                    pump-rod, thus dispensing with the beam that had been a feature in all earlier
                    forms. But in these “Bull” engines, as they were called, a condenser was used,
                    or, rather, the steam was condensed by a jet of cold water in the exhaust-pipe,
                    and Boulton and Watt successfully opposed them as infringing Watt’s patents. To
                    Trevithick belongs the distinguished honour of being the first to use a
                    steam-carriage on a railway; in 1804 he built a locomotive in the modern sense,
                    to run on what had formerly been a horse-tramway in Wales, and it is noteworthy
                    that the exhaust steam was discharged into the funnel to force the furnace
                    draught, a device which, 25 years later, in the hands of George Stephenson, went
                    far to make the locomotive what it is to-day. In this connexion it may be added
                    that as early as 1769 a steam-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n500/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0500-0477"/> carriage for roads had been built by Cugnot in
                    France, who used a pair of single-acting high-pressure cylinders to turn a
                    driving axle step by step by means of pawls and ratchet-wheels. To the
                    initiative of Evans may be ascribed the early general use of high-pressure steam
                    in the United States, a feature which for many years distinguished American from
                    English practice.</p>
                <p>17. Amongst the contemporaries of Watt one name deserves special mention. In 1781
                    Jonathan Hornblower constructed and patented what would now be called a compound
                    engine, with two cylinders of different sizes. Steam was first admitted into the
                    smaller cylinder, and then passed over into the larger, doing work against a
                    piston in each. In Hornblower’s engine the two cylinders were placed side by
                    side, and both pistons worked on the same end of a beam overhead. This was an
                    instance of the use of steam expansively, and as such was earlier than the
                    patent, though not earlier than the invention, of expansive working by Watt.
                    Hornblower was crushed by the Birmingham firm for infringing their patent in the
                    use of a separate condenser and air-pump. The compound engine was revived in
                    1804 by Woolf, with whose name it is often associated. Using steam of fairly
                    high pressure, and cutting off the supply before the end of the stroke in the
                    small cylinder, Woolf expanded the steam to several times its original volume.
                    Mechanically the double-cylinder compound engine has this advantage over an
                    engine in which the same amount of expansion is performed in a single cylinder,
                    that the sum of the forces exerted by the two pistons in the compound engine
                    varies less throughout the action than the force exerted by the piston of the
                    single-cylinder engine. This advantage may have been clear to Hornblower and
                    Woolf, and to other early users of compound expansion. But another and probably
                    a more important merit of the system lies in a fact of which neither they nor
                    for many years their followers in the use of compound engines were aware—the
                    fact that by dividing the whole range of expansion into two parts the cylinders
                    in which these are separately performed are subject to a reduced range of
                    fluctuation in their temperature. This, as will be afterwards pointed out,
                    limits to a great extent a source of waste which is present in all
                    steam-engines, the waste which results from the heating and cooling of the metal
                    by its alternate contact with hot and cooler steam. The system of compound
                    expansion is now used in nearly all large engines that pretend to economy. Its
                    introduction forms the only great improvement which the steam-engine has
                    undergone since the time of Watt; and we are able to recognize it as a very
                    important step in the direction set forth in his “first principle,” that the
                    cylinder should be kept as hot as the steam that enters it.</p>
                <p>18. Woolf introduced the compound engine somewhat widely about 1814, as a pumping
                    engine in the mines of Cornwall. But here it met a strong competitor in the
                    high-pressure single-cylinder engine of Trevithick, which had the advantage of
                    greater simplicity in construction. Woolf’s engine fell into comparative disuse,
                    and the singlecylinder type took a form which, under the name of the Cornish
                    pumping engine, was for many years famous for its great economy of fuel. In this
                    engine the cylinder was set under one end of a beam, from the other end of which
                    hung a heavy rod which operated a pump at the foot of the shaft. Steam was
                    admitted above the piston for a short portion of the stroke, thereby raising the
                    pump-rod, and was allowed to expand for the remainder. Then an equilibrium
                    valve, connecting the space above and below the piston, as in fig. 6, was
                    opened, and the pump-rod descended, doing work in the pump and raising the
                    engine piston. The large mass which had to be started and stopped at each stroke
                    served by its inertia to counterbalance the unequal pressure of the steam, for
                    the ascending rods stored up energy of motion in the early part of the stroke,
                    when the steam pressure was greatest, and gave out energy in the later part,
                    when expansion had greatly lowered the pressure. The frequency of the stroke was
                    controlled by a device called a cataract, consisting of a small plunger pump, in
                    which the plunger, raised at each stroke by the engine, was allowed to descend
                    more or less slowly by the escape of fluid below it through an adjustable
                    orifice, and in its descent liberated catches which held the steam and exhaust
                    valves from opening. A similar device controlled the equilibrium valve, and
                    could be set to give a pause at the end of the piston’s down-stroke, so that the
                    pump cylinder might have time to become completely filled. The Cornish engine is
                    interesting as the earliest form which achieved an efficiency comparable with
                    that of good modern engines. For many years monthly reports were published of
                    the “duty” of these engines, the “duty” being the number of footpounds of work
                    done per bushel or (in some cases) per cwt. of coal. The average duty of engines
                    in the Cornwall district rose from about 18 millions of foot-pounds per cwt. of

                    the Fowey Consols engine, which in 1835 was stated to have a duty of 125
                    millions. This (to use a more modern mode of reckoning) is equivalent to the
                    consumption of only a little more than 1¾ lb of coal per horse-power per hour—a
                    result surpassed by very few engines in even the best recent practice. It is
                    difficult to credit figures which, even in exceptional instances, place the
                    Cornish engine of that period on a level with the most efficient modern
                    engines—in which compound expansion and higher pressure combine to make a much
                    more perfect thermodynamic machine; and apart from this there is room to
                    question the accuracy of the Cornish reports. They played, however, a useful
                    part in the process of steam-engine development by directing attention to the
                    question of efficiency, and by demonstrating the advantage to be gained by high
                    pressure and expansive working, at a time when the theory of the steam-engine
                    had not yet taken shape.</p>
                <p>19. The final revival of the compound engine did not occur until about the middle
                    of the century, and then several agencies combined to effect it. In 1845
                    M‘Naught introduced a plan of improving beam engines of the original Watt type,
                    by adding a high-pressure cylinder whose piston acted on the beam between the
                    centre and the fly-wheel end. Steam of higher pressure than had formerly been
                    used, after doing work in the new cylinder, passed into the old or low-pressure
                    cylinder, where it was further expanded. Many engines whose power was proving
                    insufficient for the extended machinery they had to drive were “M'Naughted” in
                    this way, and after conversion were found not only to yield more power but to
                    show a marked economy of fuel. The compound form was selected by Mr Pole for the
                    pumping engines of Lambeth and other waterworks about 1850; in 1854 John Elder
                    began to use it in marine engines; in 1857 Mr Cowper added a steam-jacketed
                    intermediate reservoir for steam between the high and low pressure cylinders,
                    which made it unnecessary for the low-pressure piston to be just beginning when
                    the other piston was just ending its stroke. As facilities increased for the use
                    of high-pressure steam, compound expansion became more and more general, its
                    advantage becoming more conspicuous with every<pb break="no"

                    few large land engines and scarcely any marine engines that do not employ it. In
                    marine practice, where economy of fuel is a much more important factor in
                    determining the design than it is on land, the principle of compound expansion
                    has lately been greatly extended by the introduction of triple and even
                    quadruple expansion engines, in which the steam is made to expand successively
                    in three or in four cylinders. Even in the building of locomotive engines, where
                    other considerations are of more moment than the saving of coal, the system of
                    compound expansion is beginning to find a place.</p>
                <p>The growth of compound expansion has been referred to at some length, because it
                    forms the most distinctive improvement which the steam-engine has undergone
                    since the time of Watt. For the rest, the progress of the steam-engine has
                    consisted in its adaptation to particular uses, in the invention of features of
                    mechanical detail, in the recognition and application of thermodynamical
                    principles, and in improved methods of engineering construction by which it has
                    profited in common with all other machines. These have in particular made
                    possible the use of steam of eight or ten times the pressure of that employed by
                    Watt.</p>
                <p>20. The adaptation of the steam-engine to railways, begun by Trevithick, became a
                    success in the hands of George Stephenson, whose engine the “Rocket,” when tried
                    along with others on the Stockton and Darlington road in 1829, not only
                    distanced its competitors but settled once and for all the question whether
                    horse traction or steam traction was to be used on railways. The principal
                    features of the “Rocket” were an improved steam-blast for urging the combustion
                    of coal and a boiler (suggested by Booth, the secretary of the railway) in which
                    a large heating surface was given by the use of many small tubes through which
                    the hot gases passed. Further, the cylinders, instead of being vertical as in
                    earlier locomotives, were set in at a slope, which was afterwards altered to a
                    position more nearly horizontal. To these features there was added later the
                    “link motion,” a contrivance which enabled the engine to be easily reversed and
                    the amount of expansion to be readily varied. In the hands of George Stephenson
                    and his son Robert the locomotive took a form which has been in all essentials
                    maintained by the far heavier locomotives of to-day.</p>
                <p>21. The first practical steamboat was the tug “Charlotte Dundas,” built by
                    William Symmington, and tried in the Forth and Clyde Canal in 1802. A Watt
                    double-acting condensing engine, placed horizontally, acted directly by a
                    connecting-rod on the crank of a shaft at the stern, which carried a revolving
                    paddle-wheel. The trial was successful, but steam towing was abandoned for fear
                    of injuring the banks of the canal. Ten years later Henry Bell built the
                    “Comet,” with side paddlewheels, which ran as a passenger steamer on the Clyde;
                    but an earlier inventor to follow up Symmington’s success was the American
                    Robert Fulton, who, after unsuccessful experiments on the Seine, fitted a
                    steamer on the Hudson in 1807 with engines made to his designs by Boulton and
                    Watt, and brought steam navigation for the first time to commercial success.</p>
                <p>22. The early inventors had little in the way of theory to guide them. Watt had
                    the advantage, which he acknowledges, of a knowledge of Black’s doctrine of
                    latent heat; but there was no philosophy of the relation of work to heat until
                    long after the inventions of Watt were complete. The theory of the steam-engine
                    as a heat-engine dates from 1824, when Carnot published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu,</hi> and showed that heat does work
                    only by being let down from a higher to a lower temperature. But Carnot had no
                    idea that any of the heat disappears in the process, and it was not until the
                    doctrine of the conservation of energy was established in 1843 by the
                    experiments of Joule that the theory of heat-engines began a vigorous growth.
                    From 1849 onwards the science of thermodynamics was developed with extraordinary
                    rapidity by Clausius, Rankine, and Thomson, and was applied, especially by
                    Rankine, to practical problems in the use of steam. The publication in 1859 of
                    Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of the Steam Engine</hi> formed an epoch in
                    the history of the subject by giving inventors a new basis, outside of mere
                    empiricism, from which they could push on the development of the steam-engine.
                    Unfortunately, however, for its bearing on practice, the theory of the
                    steam-engine was to a great extent founded on certain simplifying assumptions
                    which experience has notv shown to be far from correct. It was assumed that the
                    cylinder and piston might be treated as behaving to the steam like
                    non-conducting bodies,—that the transfer of heat between the steam and the metal
                    was negligibly small. Rankine’s calculations of steam-consumption, work, and
                    thermodynamic efficiency involve this assumption, except in the case of
                    steam-jacketed cylinders, where he estimates that the steam in its passage
                    through the cylinder takes just enough heat from the jacket to prevent a small
                    amount of condensation which would otherwise occur as the process of expansion
                    goes on. If the transfer of heat from steam to metal could be overlooked, the
                    steam which enters the cylinder would remain during admission as dry as it was
                    before it entered, and the volume of steam consumed per stroke would correspond
                    with the volume of the cylinder up to the point of cut-off. It is here that the
                    actual behaviour of steam in the cylinder diverges most widely from the
                    behaviour which the theory assumes. When steam enters the cylinder it finds the
                    metal chilled by the previous exhaust, and a portion of it is at once condensed.
                    This has the effect of increasing, often very largely, the volume of boiler
                    steam required per stroke. As expansion goes on the water that was condensed
                    during admission begins to be re-evaporated from the sides of the cylinder, and
                    this action is often prolonged into the exhaust. In a later chapter the effect
                    which this exchange of heat between the metal of the cylinder and the working
                    fluid produces on the economy of the engine will be discussed, and an account
                    will be given of experimental means by which we may examine the amount of steam
                    that is initially condensed and trace its subsequent re-evaporation. It is now
                    recognized that any theory which fails to take account of these exchanges of
                    heat fails also to yield even comparatively correct results in calculating the
                    relative efficiency of various steam pressures or various ranges of expansion.
                    But the exchanges of heat are so complex that there seems little prospect of
                    submitting them to any comprehensive theoretical treatment, and we must rather
                    look for help in the future development of engines to the scientific analysis of
                    experiments with actual machines. Much careful work of this kind has already
                    been done by Hirn and others, and there is room for much more. Questions
                    relating to the influence (on heat-engine economy) of speed, of pressure, of
                    ratio of expansion, of jacketing, of compound expansion, or of superheating must
                    in the main be settled by an appeal to experiment,—experiment guided and
                    interpreted at every step by reference to the principles of thermodynamics and
                    the theory of steam.</p>

                    Heat-Engines.</hi></p>
                <p>23. A heat-engine acts by taking in heat, converting a part of the heat received
                    into mechanical energy, which appears as the work done by the engine, and
                    rejecting the remainder, still in the form of heat. The theory of heat-engines
                    comprises the study of the amount of work done, in its relation to the heat
                    supplied and to the heat rejected. The theory is based on the two laws of
                    thermodynamics, which may be stated here as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">When mechanical energy is
                    produced from heat, 1 thermal unit of heat goes out of existence for every 772
                    foot-pounds of work done; and, conversely, when heat is produced by the
                    expenditure of mechanical energy, 1 thermal unit of heat comes into existence
                    for every 772 foot-pounds of work spent.</hi></p>
                <p>The “thermal unit” is the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 lb of water
                    1 degree Fahr. when at its temperature of maximum density. The equivalent
                    quantity of work, 772 footpounds, was determined by the experiments of Joule,
                    and is called Joule’s equivalent. Later researches by Joule and others have
                    indicated that this number is probably too small; it should perhaps be as much
                    as 774 foot-pounds. Joule’s original value is still generally used by engineers;
                    and as it enters into many published tables it may conveniently be adhered to
                    until its accuracy is more definitely disproved. Since a definite number of
                    foot-pounds are equivalent to 1 thermal unit, we may, if we please, express
                    quantities of work in thermal units, or quantities of heat in foot-pounds; the
                    latter practice will frequently be found useful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">It is impossible for a
                    self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency, to convey heat from one
                    body to another at a higher temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>This is the form in which the second law has been stated by Clausius. Another
                    statement of it, different in form but similar in effect, has been given by
                    Thomson. Its force may not be immediately obvious, but it will be shown below
                    that it introduces a most important limitation of the power which any engine has
                    of converting heat into work. So far as the first law shows, there is nothing to
                    prevent the whole heat taken in by the engine from changing into mechanical
                    energy. In consequence of the second law, however, no heat-engine converts, or
                    can convert, more than a small fraction of the heat supplied to it into work; a
                    large part is necessarily rejected as heat. The ratio</p>
                <p>Heat converted into work Heat taken in by the engine is a fraction always much
                    less than unity. This ratio is called the <hi rend="italic">efficiency</hi> of
                    the engine considered as a heat-engine.</p>
                <p>24. In every heat-engine there is a <hi rend="italic">working substance</hi>
                    which takes in and rejects heat, thereby suffering changes of form, or more
                    commonly of volume, and does work by overcoming resistance to these changes of
                    form or volume. The working substance may be gaseous, liquid, or solid. We can,
                    for example, imagine a heat-engine in which the working substance is a long
                    metallic rod, arranged to act as the pawl of a ratchet-wheel with fine teeth.
                    Let the rod be heated so that it elongates sufficiently to drive the wheel
                    forward through the space of one tooth. Then let the rod be cooled (say by
                    applying cold water), the wheel being meanwhile held from returning by a
                    separate click or detent. The rod, on cooling, will retract so as to engage
                    itself with the next succeeding tooth, which may then be driven forward by
                    heating the rod again, and so on. To make it evident that such an engine would
                    do work, we have only to suppose that the ratchet-wheel carries round with it a
                    drum by which a weight is wound up. We have, then, a complete heat-engine, in
                    which the working substance is a solid rod, which receives heat by being brought
                    into contact with some source of heat at a comparatively high temperature,
                    transforms a small part of this heat into work, and rejects the remainder to
                    what we may call a receiver of heat, at a comparatively low temperature. The
                    greater part of the heat may be said simply to pass through the engine, from the
                    source to the receiver, <hi rend="italic">becoming degraded as regards
                    temperature</hi> as it goes. We shall see presently that this is typical of the
                    action of all heat-engines; when they are doing work, the heat which they reject
                    is rejected at a temperature lower than that at which it is taken in. They
                    convert some heat into work only by letting down a much larger quantity of heat
                    from a high to a relatively low temperature. The action is analogous to that of
                    a water-wheel, which does work by letting down water from a high to a lower
                    level, but with this important difference that in the transfer which occurs in
                    heat-engines an amount of heat disappears which is equivalent to the work
                    done.</p>
                <p>25. In almost all actual heat-engines the working substance is a fluid. In some
                    it is air, in some a mixture of several gases. In the steam-engine the working
                    fluid is a mixture (in varying proportions) of water and steam. With a fluid for
                    working substance, work is done by changes of volume only; its amount depends
                    solely on the relation of pressure to volume during the change, and not at all
                    on the form of the vessels in which the change takes place. Leta diagram be
                    drawn (fig. 9) in which the relation of the intensity of pressure to the volume
                    of any supposed working substance is graphically exhibited by the line ABC,
                    where AM, CN are pressures and AP, CQ are volumes, then the work done by the
                    substance in expanding from A to C is the area of the figure MABCN, And
                    similarly, if the substance be compressed from</p>
                <p>C back to its original volume in such a manner that the line CDA represents the
                    relation of pressure and volume during compression, the work done <hi
                    rend="italic">upon</hi> the substance is the figure NCDAM. Taking the two
                    operations together, we find that the substance has done a net amount of work
                    equal to the area of the shaded figure ABCDA, or ∫P <hi rend="italic">d</hi> V.
                    This is an example and a generalization of the method of representing work which
                    Watt introduced by his invention of the indicator; the figure ABCDA may be
                    called the indicator diagram of the supposed action.</p>
                <p>26. Generally in heat-engines the working substance returns periodically to the
                    same state of temperature, pressure, volume, and physical condition. When this
                    has occurred the substance is said to have passed through a complete cycle of
                    operations. For example, in a condensing steam-engine, water taken from the
                    hot-well is pumped into the boiler; it then passes into the cylinder as steam,
                    passes thence into the condenser, and thence again into the hot-well; it
                    completes the cycle by returning to the same condition as at first. In other
                    less obvious cases, as in that of the non-condensing steam-engine, a little
                    consideration will show that the cycle is completed, not indeed by the same
                    portion of working substance being returned to the boiler, but by an equal
                    quantity of water being fed to it, while the steam which has been discharged
                    into the atmosphere cools to the temperature of the feed. In the theory of
                    heat-engines it is of the first importance to consider (as was first done by
                    Carnot in 1824) the cycle of operations performed by the working substance as a
                    complete whole. If we stop short of the completion of a cycle matters are
                    complicated by the fact that the substance is in a state different from its
                    initial state, and may therefore have changed its stock of internal energy.
                    After a complete cycle, on the other hand, we know at once that, since the
                    condition is the same, the internal energy of the substance is the same as at
                    first, and therefore—</p>
                <p>Heat taken in = work done + heat rejected.</p>
                <p>27. It will serve our purpose best to approach the theory of heat-engines by
                    considering, in the first instance, the action of an engine in which the working
                    substance is any one of the so-called permanent gases, or a mixture of them,
                    such as air. The word permanent, as applied to a gas, can now<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Since the liquefaction of
                    hydrogen and other gases by MM. Cailletet and Pictet.</p></note> be understood
                    only as meaning that the gas is liquefied with difficulty—either by the use of
                    extremely low temperature or extremely high pressure or both. So long as gases
                    are under conditions of pressure and temperature widely different from those
                    which produce liquefaction, they conform very approximately to certain simple
                    laws—laws which may be regarded as <hi rend="italic">rigorously</hi> applicable
                    to ideal substances called <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> gases. After stating
                    these laws briefly we shall examine the efficiency of a heat-engine using a gas
                    in a certain manner as working substance, and then show that the conclusion so
                    derived has a general application to all heat-engines whatsoever. In this
                    procedure there is no sacrifice of generality, and a part of the process is of
                    independent service in the discussion of actual air-engines.</p>
                <p>28. The laws of the permanent gases are the following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 1 (Boyle). <hi rend="italic">The volume of a given
                    mass of gas varies</hi><hi rend="italic">inversely as the pressure, the
                    temperature being kept constant.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, if V be the volume of 1 lb of a gas in cubic feet, and P the pressure in
                    pounds per square foot, so long as the temperature is unchanged—</p>
                <p>P∞ V <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi>, or PV=constant.</p>
                <p>For air the value of the constant is 26220 when the temperature is 32° F.</p>
                <p>29. <hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 2 (Charles). <hi rend="italic">Under constant
                    pressure equal volumes of different gases increase equally for the same
                    increment of temperature. Also, if a gas be heated under constant pressure,
                    equal increments of its volume correspond very nearly to equal intervals of
                    temperature as determined by the scale of a mercury thermometer.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, let us take, say, 493 cubic inches of hydrogen, also of oxygen, of air,
                    &amp;c., all at 32° F., and, keeping each at a constant pressure (not
                    necessarily the same for all), heat all so that their temperature rises 1° F. We
                    shall find that each has expanded by sensibly the same amount and now occupies
                    494 cubic inches. And further, if we heat any one through another 1 F. to 34 F.,
                    we shall find that its volume is now 495 cubic inches, and so on. Thus for any
                    gas, kept at constant pressure, if the volume was<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n503/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0503-0480"/> 493 at 32° F., it would be 492 at 31° F.,</p>
                <p>461 at 0° F., and finally 0 at -461°F., provided the same law were to hold at
                    indefinitely low temperatures. This we may assume to be the case with a perfect
                    gas, although any actual gas would change its physical state long before so low
                    a temperature were reached.</p>
                <p>This result may be concisely expressed by saying that if we reckon temperature,
                    not from the ordinary zero but from a point 461° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s
                    scale, the volume of a given quantity of a gas, kept at constant pressure, is
                    proportional to the temperature reckoned from that zero. Temperatures so
                    reckoned are called absolute temperatures, and the point - 461° F. is called the
                    absolute zero of temperature. Denoting any temperature according to the ordinary
                    scale by <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the corresponding absolute temperature by
                    τ, we have</p>
                <p>τ = <hi rend="italic">t</hi> + 461 on the Fahrenheit scale, and τ = <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> +274 on the Centigrade scale.</p>
                <p>Charles’s law shows that if temperatures be measured by thermometers in which the
                    expanding substance is air, hydrogen, oxygen, or any other permanent gas, and,
                    if those intervals of temperature be called equal which correspond to equal
                    amounts of expansion, then the indications of these thermometers always agree
                    very closely with each other, and also agree, though less closely, with the
                    indications of a mercury thermometer. We shall see later that the theory of
                    heat-engines affords a means of forming a thermometric scale which is
                    independent of the properties, as to expansion, of any substance, and that this
                    scale coincides with the scale of a perfect gas thermometer, a fact which
                    justifies the use of the term absolute, as applied to temperatures measured by
                    the expansion of a gas.</p>
                <p>30. Combining laws 1 and 2, we have, for a given mass of any gas,</p>
                <p>PV= <hi rend="italic">cτ</hi>, where c is a constant depending on the specific
                    density of the gas and on the units in which P and V are measured. In what
                    follows we shall assume that P is measured in pounds per square foot, that V is
                    the volume of 1 lb in cubic feet, and that <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> is the
                    absolute temperature in Fahrenheit degrees. In air, with these units,</p>
                <p>PV = 53·18 <hi rend="italic">τ</hi>.</p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 3 (Regnault). <hi rend="italic">The specific
                    heat ai constant pressure is constant for any gas.</hi></p>
                <p>By specific heat at constant pressure is meant the heat taken in by 1 lb of a
                    substance when its temperature rises 1° F., while the pressure remains
                    unchanged—the volume of course increasing. The law states that this quantity is
                    the same for any one gas, no matter what be the temperature, or what the
                    constant pressure, at which the process of heating takes place.</p>
                <p>32. Another important quantity in the theory of heat-engines is the specific heat
                    at constant volume, that is, the heat taken in by 1 lb of the substance when its
                    temperature rises 1° F. while the volume remains unchanged—the pressure of
                    course increasing. We shall denote specific heat at constant pressure by K <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> p</hi> and specific heat at constant volume by K <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> v</hi>. Let 1 lb of a gas be heated at constant

                    volume at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Heat is taken in, and external work is
                    done by the expansion of the gas, namely—</p>
                <p>Heat taken in = K <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi>,(τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>).</p>
                <p>Work done = P(V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>)=
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- τ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi>).</p>
                <p>The difference between these quantities, or (K <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    p</hi>- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>)(τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>), is the amount by which the stock of internal energy
                    possessed by the gas has increased during the process. We shall see presently
                    that this gain of internal energy would have been the same had the gas passed in
                    any other manner from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>33. <hi rend="smallcaps">Law</hi> 4 (Joule). <hi rend="italic">When a gas expands
                    without doing external work, and without taking in or giving out heat, its
                    temperature does not change.</hi></p>
                <p>To prove this, Joule connected a vessel containing compressed gas with another
                    vessel that was empty, by means of a pipe with a closed stop-cock. Both vessels
                    were immersed in a tub of water and were allowed to assume a uniform
                    temperature. Then the stop-cock was opened, the gas expanded without doing
                    external work, and finally the temperature of the water in the tub was found to
                    have undergone no change. The temperature of the gas was unaltered, and no heat
                    had been taken in or given out by it.</p>
                <p>34. Since the gas had neither gained nor lost heat, and had done no work, its
                    internal energy was the same at the end as at the beginning of the experiment.
                    The pressure and volume had changed, but the temperature had not. We must
                    therefore conclude that the internal energy of a given mass of a gas depends
                    only on its temperature, and not upon its pressure or volume; in other words, a
                    change of pressure and volume not associated with a change of temperature does
                    not alter the internal energy. Hence in any change of temperature the change of
                    internal energy is independent of the relation of pressure to volume throughout
                    the operation. Now we have seen above that the quantity</p>
                <p>(K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi>,- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>)(τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>)</p>
                <p>measures the gain of internal energy when 1 lb of a gas has its temperature
                    changed from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in
                    one particular way, namely, at constant pressure. Hence this same quantity also
                    measures the gain of internal energy when 1 lb of a gas has its temperature
                    changed from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in
                    any manner whatsoever.</p>
                <p>35. Next consider the case of 1 lb of a gas heated from τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> at constant volume. The heat taken in
                    is</p>
                <p>K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v</hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>).</p>
                <p>Since no work is done, this is all gain of internal energy, and is therefore (§
                    34) equal to</p>
                <p>(K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi>- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>)(τ <hi

                <p>Hence in any gas</p>

                <p>36. We shall now return to the consideration of diagrams like that of § 25, which
                    exhibit the action of a working substance by curves showing the relation of P to
                    V during expansion or compression. In most of the instances which occur in the
                    theory of heat-engines such curves may be exactly or approximately represented
                    by equations of the form</p>
                <p>PV <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> =constant, where the index <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> has various numer ical values. Let AB, fig. 10, be a curve
                    of expansion (of any substance) in which PV <hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi> is constant, from pressure P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and volume V

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, which may be called the ratio of expansion.</p>
                <p>Still another form of the above expression for the work done is <hi

                <p>37. Applying this result to the case of an expanding gas, we have</p>
                <p>Work done = <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-τ <hi

                <p>The loss of internal energy during expansion is, by § 34,</p>

                    1</hi>- τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) ∕ (γ-1), by § 35.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that the mode of expansion is such that the loss of internal energy
                    is equal to the external work done, then <hi rend="strikethrough">⅛</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript strikethrough"> lξ</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">t</hi><hi

                    and the law of expansion is</p>
                <p>PV <hi rend="superscript"> γ</hi> = constant.</p>
                <p>The same formula applies when a gas is being compressed in such a manner that the
                    work spent upon the gas is equal to the gain of internal energy by the gas.</p>
                <p>38. This mode of expansion (or compression) is termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >adiabatic.</hi> It occurs when the working substance is neither gaining nor
                    losing heat by conduction or radiation or internal chemical action. It would be
                    realized if we had a substance expanding or being compressed, without chemical
                    change, in a cylinder which (with the piston) was a perfect non-conductor of
                    heat. In adiabatic<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n504/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0504-0481"/> expansion the external work is done entirely at
                    the expense of the substance’s stock of internal energy. Hence in the adiabatic
                    expansion of a gas the temperature falls, and in adiabatic compression it rises.
                    To find the change of temperature in a gas when expanded or compressed
                    adiabatically we have only to combine the equations</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> v <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> v- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> w</hi> a∏d^-n, and we find</p>
                <p>τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∕V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) <hi rend="superscript"
                    > γ-1</hi>.</p>
                <p>It is clear from the above that if, during expansion, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is
                    less than γ the fluid is taking in heat, and if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is
                    greater than γ the fluid is rejecting heat.</p>
                <p>39. Another very important mode of expansion or compression is that called <hi
                    rend="italic">isothermal,</hi> in which the temperature of the working substance
                    is kept constant during the process.</p>
                <p>In the case of a gas the curve of isothermal expansion is a rectangulaχ∙
                    hyperbola, having the equation</p>
                <p>PV=constant= <hi rend="italic">cτ.</hi></p>
                <p>When a gas expands (or is compressed) isothermally at temperature τ from V <hi

                    expression is involved it is convenient to remember that log <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ε</hi>, the hyperbolic logarithm, of any number is 2∙3026
                    times the common logarithm of the number.</p></note></p>
                <p>During isothermal expansion or compression a gas suffers no change of internal
                    energy (by § 34, since τ is constant). Hence during isothermal expansion a gas
                    must take in an amount of heat just equal to the work it does, and during
                    isothermal compression it must reject an amount of heat just equal to the work
                    spent upon it. The expression cτlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> con sequently measures, not only the work done by or upon
                    the gas, but also the heat taken in during isothermal expan sion or given out
                    during isothermal compression. In the diagram, fig. 11, the line AB is an
                    example of a curve of isothermal expansion for a perfect gas, called for brevity
                    an isothermal line, while AC is an adiabatic line starting from the same point
                    A.</p>
                <p>40. We shall now consider the action of an ideal engine in which the working
                    substance is a perfect gas, and is caused to pass through a cycle of changes
                    each of which is either isother mal or adiabatic. The cycle to be described was
                    first exa mined by Carnot, and is spoken of as Carnot’s cycle of opera tions.
                    Imagine a cylindeι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> and piston composed of a
                    perfectly non - conducting material, except as regards the bottom of the
                    cylinder, which is a conductor. Imagine also a hot body or indefinitely ca
                    pacious source of heat A, kept always at a tempera ture τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, a perfectly non conducting cover B, and a cold body or indefinitely
                    capacious receiver of heat C, kept always at a temperature τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which is lower than τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. It
                    is supposed that A, B, or C can be applied to the bottom of the cylinder. Let
                    the cylinder contain 1 lb of a perfect gas, at temperature τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, volume V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>, and
                    pressure P <hi rend="italic                     subscript"> a</hi> to begin
                    with. The suffixes refer to the points on the indicator diagram, fig- 12.</p>
                <p>(1) Apply A, and allow the piston to rise. The gas expands isothermally at τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, taking heat from A and doing work. The pressure
                    changes to P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi> and the volume to V <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> b</hi>.</p>
                <p>(2) Remove A and apply B. Allow the piston to go on rising. The gas expands
                    adiabatically, doing work at the expense of its internal energy, and the
                    temperature falls. Let this go on until the temperature is τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, The pressure is then P <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    c</hi>, and the volume V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c</hi>.</p>
                <p>(3) Remove B and apply C. Force the piston down. The gas is compressed
                    isothermally at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, since the smallest increase of
                    temperature above τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> causes heat to pass into C.
                    Work is spent upon the gas, and heat is rejected to C. Let this be continued
                    until a certain point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (fig. 12) is reached, such that
                    the fourth operation will complete the cycle.</p>
                <p>(4) Remove C and apply B. Continue the compression, which is now adiabatic. The
                    pressure and temperature rise, and if the point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> has
                    been properly chosen, when the pressure is restored to its original value P <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>, the temperature will also have risen to its
                    original value τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. [In other words, the third
                    operation must be stopped when a point <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is reached such
                    that an adiabatic line drawn through <hi rend="italic">d</hi> will pass through
                    <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>] This completes the cycle.</p>
                <p>To find the proper place at which to stop the third operation, we have, by § 38,
                    τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∕τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = (V <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> c</hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi>) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> γ-1</hi> in the second operation, and again τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∕τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =(V <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> d</hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> γ-1</hi> in the fourth operation. Hence V <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> c</hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi> = V <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> d</hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>, and V <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> b</hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>, the
                    ratio of isothermal expansion, is equal to V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c</hi>
                    ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi>, the ratio of isothermal compression. For
                    brevity we shall denote either of these last ratios by <hi rend="italic"
                    >r.</hi></p>
                <p>41. The following are the transfers of heat to and from the working fluid, in
                    successive stages of the cycle :—</p>
                <p>(1) Heat taken in from A = <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi> (by § 39).</p>
                <p>(2) No heat taken in or rejected.</p>
                <p>(3) Heat rejected to C= <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi> (by § 39).</p>
                <p>(4) No heat taken in or rejected.</p>
                <p>Hence, by the first law of thermodynamics, the net external work done by the gas
                    is <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>; and the efficiency of the engine (§ 23) is cHl ~ T <hi rend="subscript"

                <p>This is the fraction of the whole heat given to it which an engine following
                    Carnot’s cycle converts into work. The engine takes in an amount of heat, at the
                    temperature of the source, proportional to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; it
                    rejects an amount of heat, at the temperature of the receiver, proportional to τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. It works within a range of temperature extending
                    from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, by
                    letting down heat from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> (§ 24), and in the process it converts into work a fraction of that heat,
                    which fraction will be greater the lower the temperature τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> at which heat is rejected is below the temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> at which heat is received.</p>
                <p>42. Next let us consider what will happen if we reverse Carnot’s cycle, that is
                    to say, if we force this engine to act so that the same indicator diagram as
                    before is traced out, but in the direction opposite to that followed in § 40.
                    Starting as before from the point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and with the gas at τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, we shall require the following four operations
                    :—</p>
                <p>(1) Apply B and allow the piston to rise. The gas expands adiabatically, the
                    curve traced is <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> and when <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    reached the temperature has fallen to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>(2) Remove B and apply C. Allow the piston to go on rising. The gas expands
                    isothermally at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, taking heat from C, and the
                    curve <hi rend="italic">dc</hi> is traced.</p>
                <p>(3) Remove C and apply B. Compress the gas. The process is adiabatic. The curve
                    traced is <hi rend="italic">cb,</hi> and when <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    reached the temperature has risen to τ <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>.</p>
                <p>(4) Remove B and apply A. Continue the compression, which is now isothermal, at τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Heat is now rejected to A, and the cycle is
                    completed by the curve <hi rend="italic">ba.</hi></p>
                <p>In this process the engine is not doing work; on the contrary, work is spent upon
                    it equal to the area of the diagram, or <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> — τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) log <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Heat is taken in from C in the
                    first operation, to the amount <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Heat is
                    rejected to A in the fourth operation, to the amount <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi>. In the first and third operations there is no transfer of heat.</p>
                <p>The action is now in every respect the reverse of what it was before. The same
                    work is now spent upon the engine as was formerly done by it. The same amount of
                    heat is now given to the hot body A as was formerly taken from it. The same
                    amount of heat is now taken from the cold body C as was formerly given to it, as
                    will be seen by the following scheme :—</p>

                <p>The reversal of the work has been accompanied by an exact reversal of each of the
                    transfers of heat.</p>
                <p>43. An engine in which this is possible is called, from the thermodynamic point
                    of view, a <hi rend="italic">reversible</hi> engine. In other words, a
                    reversible heat-engine is one which, if forced to trace out its indicator
                    diagram reversed in direction, so that the work which would be done by the
                    engine, when running direct, is actually spent upon it, will reject to the
                    source of heat the same quantity of heat as, when running direct, it would take
                    from the source, and will take from the receiver of heat the same quantity as,
                    when running direct, it would reject to the receiver. By “the source of heat” is
                    meant the hot body which acts as source, and by “the receiver” is meant the cold
                    body which acts as receiver, when the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0505-0482"/> engine is running direct. Carnot’s engine is one
                    example of a reversible engine. The idea of thermodynamic reversibility is
                    highly important, for the reason that no heat-engine can be more efficient than
                    a reversible engine, if both take in and reject heat at the same pair of
                    temperatures.</p>
                <p>44. To prove this, let it be supposed that we have two engines M and N, of which
                    N is reversible in the above sense, and that we have a hot body A capable of
                    acting as a source of heat, and a cold body C capable of acting as a receiver of
                    heat. The engine M is set to work as a heat-engine, taking heat from A and
                    rejecting heat to C. To prove that M cannot be more efficient than the
                    reversible engine N, we shall assume that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more
                    efficient, and trace the consequences of that assumption.</p>
                <p>Let M, working direct, be coupled so as to work N reversed; if we suppose that
                    the engines are without mechanical friction, and can be coupled up without loss
                    of power, the work represented by the indicator diagram of M is spent on N, and
                    N will therefore reject to A an amount of heat which we will call <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Qa</hi> and take from B an amount of heat which we will call
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Qb. Now,</hi> since N is reversible, if it worked direct,
                    taking <hi rend="smallcaps">Qa</hi> from A, it would do the same amount of work
                    as, in the supposed circumstances, is spent upon it. Hence, if M is more
                    efficient than N it is taking from A an amount of heat <hi rend="italic"
                    >less</hi> than <hi rend="smallcaps">Qa,</hi> and consequently also is giving to
                    B an amount of heat correspondingly less than Q <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>. The
                    joint effect, therefore, of M working direct and N working reversed is that the
                    heat taken from A by M is less than the heat given to A by N, while the heat
                    given to B by M is less (to an equal extent) than the heat taken from B by N.
                    The consequence is that the hot body A is gaining heat on the whole, and the
                    cold body B is losing an equal amount of heat; in other words, with the
                    continued action of the double system heat passes, in indefinitely large
                    quantity, from a cold body to a hot body, by means of an agency which, it is to
                    be observed, is purely self-acting, for if we suppose there is no mechanical
                    friction the system requires no help from without. Now this result is, by the
                    second law of thermodynamics (§ 23), contrary to all experience; and we are
                    forced to conclude that the assumption that M is more efficient than the
                    reversible engine N, when both take in and reject heat at the same two
                    temperatures, is false. Hence, with given temperatures of source and receiver of
                    heat no engine is more efficient than a reversible engine.</p>
                <p>Next, let M and N both be reversible and both work between the same limits, but
                    be different in any other respect. Then by the foregoing argument M cannot be
                    more efficient than N, neither can N be more efficient than M. Hence all
                    reversible heat-engines taking in and rejecting heat at the same temperatures
                    are equally efficient.</p>
                <p>45. These results imply that reversibility, in the thermodynamic sense, is the
                    criterion of what may be called perfection in a heat-engine. A reversible engine
                    is perfect in the sense that it cannot be improved on as regards efficiency: no
                    other engine, taking in and rejecting heat at the same temperatures, will
                    convert into work a greater fraction of the heat which it takes in. Moreover, if
                    this criterion be satisfied, it is as regards efficiency a matter of complete
                    indifference what is the nature of the working substance, or what, in other
                    respects, is the mode of the engine’s action.</p>
                <p>46. Further, since all engines that arc reversible are equally efficient,
                    provided they work between the same temperatures, an expression for the
                    efficiency of one will apply equally to all. Now, the engine whose efficiency we
                    have found in § 41 is one example of a reversible engine. Hence its
                    efficiency</p>
                <p>(τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)∕τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is the efficiency of any reversible heat-engine
                    whatsoever taking in heat at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and rejecting heat
                    at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. And, as no engine can be more efficient than
                    one that is reversible, this expression is the measure of <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfect efficiency.</hi> We have thus arrived at the immensely important
                    conclusion that no heat-engine can convert into work a greater fraction of the
                    heat which it receives than is expressed by the excess of the temperature of
                    reception above that of rejection divided by the absolute temperature of
                    reception.</p>
                <p>47. Briefly recapitulated, the steps of the argument by which this result has
                    been reached are as follows. After stating the experimental laws to which gases
                    conform, we examined the action of a heat-engine in which the working substance
                    took in heat when at the temperature of the source and rejected heat when at the
                    temperature of the receiver, the change of temperature from one to the other of
                    these limits being accomplished by adiabatic expansion and adiabatic
                    compression. Taking a special case in which this engine had for its working
                    substance a perfect gas, we found that its efficiency was (τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)∕ τ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> (§ 41). We also observed that it was, in the thermodynamic sense, a
                    reversible engine (§ 43). Then we found, by an application of the second law of
                    thermodynamics, that no heat-engine can have a higher efficiency than a
                    reversible engine, when taking in and giving out heat at the same two
                    temperatures τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>;
                    this was shown by the fact that a contrary assumption leads to a violation of
                    the second law (§ 44). Hence, we concluded that all reversible heat-engines
                    receiving and rejecting heat at the same temperatures τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> respectively are equally efficient,
                    and hence that the efficiency (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) ∕τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, already determined
                    for one particular reversible engine, measures the efficiency of any reversible
                    engine, and is a limit of efficiency which no engine whatever can exceed.</p>
                <p>48. Tho second law of thermodynamics, on which (along with the first law) this
                    conclusion rests has been given in many different forms. The statement of it in
                    § 23 is that of Clausius, and is very similar to that of Sir W. Thomson.
                    Rankine, to whom with Thomson and Clausius is due the development of the theory
                    of heat-engines from the point at which Carnot left it, has stated the second
                    law in a form which is neither easy to understand, nor obvious, as an
                    experimental result, when understood. His statement runs :—</p>
                <p>“If the absolute temperature of any uniformly hot substance he divided into any
                    number of equal parts, the effects of those parts in causing work to be
                    performed are equal.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    243.</p></note></p>
                <p>To make this intelligible we may suppose that any quantity <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> of heat from a source at temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    taken by the first of a series of perfect heat-engines, and that this engine
                    rejects heat at a temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> less than τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by a certain interval ∆τ. Let the heat so rejected by
                    the first engine form the heat supply of a second perfect engine working from τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> through an equal
                    interval ∆τ; let the heat which it in turn rejects form the heat-supply of a
                    third perfect engine working again through an equal interval from τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; and so on. The
                    efficiencies of the several engines are (by § 46) — , — , — , &amp;c. The

                    Rankine’s statement is to be understood as meaning that each of the equal
                    intervals into which any range of temperature may be divided is equally
                    effective in allowing work to be produced from heat when heat is made to pass,
                    doing work in the most efficient possible way, through all the intervals from
                    the top to the bottom of the range.</p>
                <p>49. A point of much theoretical interest may be noted in passing. In place of
                    measuring temperature, as we have done, by the expansion of a perfect gas, a
                    scale of temperature might be formed thus. Starting from any one temperature,
                    let a series of intervals be taken such that a series of reversible engines,
                    each working with one of the intervals for its range, in the manner described in
                    § 48 (so that the heat rejected by the first forms the supply of the second, and
                    so on), will each do the same amount of work; then <hi rend="italic">call these
                    intervals equal.</hi> This gives a scale of temperature (originally suggested by
                    Sir W. Thomson) which is truly absolute in the sense of being independent of the
                    properties of any substance; it coincides, as is evident from § 48, with the
                    scale we have been using, in which equal intervals of temperature are defined as
                    those corresponding to equal amounts of expansion of a perfect gas under
                    constant pressure; and it coincides approximately with the scale of a mercury
                    thermometer when that is graduated to read from the absolute zero by the
                    addition of a suitable constant (§ 29).</p>
                <p>50. The availability of heat for transformation into work depends essentially on
                    the range of temperature through which the heat is let down from the hot source
                    to the cold body into which heat is rejected; it is only in virtue of a
                    difference of temperature between bodies that conversion of any part of their
                    heat into work becomes possible. If τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are the highest and lowest temperatures of the range
                    through which a heat-engine works, it is clear that the maximum of efficiency
                    can be reached only when the engine takes in all its heat at τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and rejects at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> all that
                    is rejected. With respect to every portion of heat taken in and rejected the
                    greatest ideal efficiency is</p>
                <p>_ Temperature of reception - temperature of rejection Temperature of
                    reception</p>
                <p>Any heat taken in at a temperature below τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> or
                    rejected at a temperature above τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will have less
                    availability for conversion into work than if taken in at τ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> and rejected at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and hence, with a given
                    pair of limiting temperatures, it is essential to maximum efficiency that uo
                    heat be taken in by the engine except at the top of the range, and no heat
                    rejected except at the bottom of the range. Further, as we have seen in § 45,
                    when the temperatures at which heat is received and rejected are assigned, an
                    engine attains the maximum of efficiency if it be reversible,</p>
                <p>51. It is therefore important to inquire more particularly what kinds of action
                    are reversible in the thermodynamic sense. A little consideration will show that
                    a transfer of heat from the source or to the receiver is reversible only when
                    the working substance is at sensibly the same temperature as the source or the
                    receiver, as the case may be, and an expansion is reversible only when it occurs
                    by the gradual displacement of some part of the containing envelope in such a
                    manner that the expanding fluid does external work on the envelope, and does not
                    waste energy to any sensible extent in setting itself in motion. This excludes
                    what may be termed free expansion,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n506/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0506-0483"/> such as that of the gas in Joule’s experiment, §
                    33, and it excludes also what may be called imperfectly-resisted expansion, such
                    as would occur if the fluid were allowed to expand into a closed chamber in
                    which the pressure was less than that of the fluid, or if the piston in a
                    cylinder rose so fast as to cause, through the inertia of the expanding fluid,
                    local variations of pressure throughout the cylinder.</p>
                <p>To make a heat-engine, working within given limits of temperature, as efficient
                    as possible we must therefore strive—(1) to take in no heat except at the
                    highest temperature, and to reject no heat except at the lowest temperature; (2)
                    to secure that the working substance shall, when receiving heat, be at the
                    temperature of the body from which the heat comes, and that it shall, when
                    giving up heat, be at the temperature of the body to which heat is given up; (3)
                    to avoid free or imperfectly-resisted expansion. If these conditions are
                    fulfilled the engine is a perfect heat-engine.</p>
                <p>The first and second of these conditions are satisfied if in the action of the
                    engine the working substance changes its temperature from τ <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> by adiabatic expansion, and from τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by adiabatic
                    compression, thereby being enabled to take in and reject heat at the ends of the
                    range without taking in or rejecting any by the way. This is the action in
                    Carnot's engine (§ 40).</p>
                <p>52. But if we can cause the working substance to deposit heat in some body within
                    the engine while passing from τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, in such a manner that the transfer of heat from the
                    substance to this body is reversible (satisfying the second condition above),
                    then when we wish the working substance to pass from τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> we may reverse this transfer and so
                    recover the heat that was deposited in this body. This alternate storing and
                    restoring of heat may then take the place of adiabatic expansion and
                    compression, in causing the temperature of the working substance to pass from τ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and from τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> respectively. The
                    alternate storing and restoring is an action occurring wholly within the engine,
                    and is therefore distinct from the taking in and rejecting of heat by the
                    engine.</p>
                <p>53. In 1827 Robert Stirling designed an apparatus, called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >regenerator,</hi> by which this process of alternate storing and restoring of
                    heat could be actually performed. For the present purpose it will suffice to
                    describe the regenerator as a passage through which the working fluid can travel
                    in either direction, whose walls have a very large capacity for heat, so that
                    the amount alternately given to or taken from them by the working fluid causes
                    no more than an insensible rise or fall in their temperature. The temperature of
                    the walls at one end of the passage is τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and this
                    tapers continuously down to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> at the other end.
                    When the working fluid at temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> enters the
                    hot end and passes through, it comes out at the cold end at temperature τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, having stored in tho walls of the regenerator an
                    amount of heat which it will pick up again when passed through in the opposite
                    direction. During the return journey its temperature rises from τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The process is
                    strictly reversible, or rather would be so if the regenerator had an unlimited
                    capacity for heat, if no conduction of heat took place along its walls from the
                    hot to the cold end, and if no loss took place by conduction or radiation from
                    its external surface.</p>
                <p>54. Using air as the working substance, and employing his regenerator, Stirling
                    made an engine (to be described later) which, allowing for practical
                    imperfections, is the earliest example of a truly reversible engine. The cycle
                    of operations in Stirling’s engine is substantially this :—</p>
                <p>(1) Air (which has been heated to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by passing
                    through the regenerator) is allowed to expand isothermally through a ratio <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> taking in heat from a furnace and raising a piston. Heat
                    taken in (per lb of air) = <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> log <hi rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
                <p>(2) The air is caused to pass through the regenerator from the hot to the cold
                    end, depositing heat and having its temperature lowered to τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, without change of volume. Heat stored in regenerator =
                    K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>). The pressure of course falls.</p>
                <p>(3) The air is then compressed isothermally to its original volume at τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in contact with a refrigerator (or receiver of heat).
                    Heat rejected = <hi rend="italic">c</hi> τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> log <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ε</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>.</p>
                <p>(4) The air is again passed through the regenerator from the cold to the hot end,
                    taking up heat and having its temperature raised to τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>. Heat restored by the regenerator=K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi>

                <p>The indicator diagram of the action is shown in fig. 13, and a diagram of the
                    engine is given in chap. XIV. Stirling’s engine is important, not as a
                    present-day heat-engine (though it has recently been revived in small forms
                    after a long interval of disuse), but because it is typical of the only mode,
                    other than Carnot’s plan of adiabatic expansion and compression, by which the
                    action of a heat-engine can be made reversible. Valuable as the regenerator has
                    proved in metallurgy and other industrial processes, its actual application to
                    heat-engines has hitherto been very limited. An other way of using it in
                    air-engines was designed by Ericsson, and attempts have been made by C. W.
                    Siemens and F. Jenkin to apply it to steam-engines and to gas-engines. But
                    almost all actual engines, in so far as they can be said to approach the
                    condition of reversibility, do so, not by the use of the regenerative principle,
                    but by more or less nearly adiabatic expansion and compression after the manner
                    of Carnot’s ideal engine.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Properties of Steam and Theory of the
                    Steam-Engine.</hi></p>
                <p>55. We have now to consider the action of heat-engines in which the working
                    substance is water and water-vapour or steam. The properties of steam are most
                    conveniently stated by referring in the first instance to what happens when
                    steam is formed <hi rend="italic">under constant pressure.</hi> This is
                    substantially the process which occurs in the boiler of a steam-engine when the
                    engine is at work. To fix the ideas we may suppose that the vessel in which
                    steam is to be formed is a long upright cylinder fitted with a piston which may
                    be loaded so that it exerts a constant pressure on the fluid below. Let there
                    be, to begin with, at the foot of the cylinder a quantity of water (which for
                    convenience of numerical statement we shall take as 1 lb), at any temperature
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>; and let the piston press
                    on the surface of the water with a force of P lb per square foot. Let heat now
                    be applied to the bottom of the cylinder. As it enters the water it will produce
                    the following effects in three stages :—</p>
                <p>(1) The temperature of the water rises until a certain temperature <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is reached, at which steam begins to be formed. The value
                    of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> depends on the particular pressure P which the
                    piston exerts. Until the temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is reached there
                    is nothing but water below the piston.</p>
                <p>(2) Steam is formed, more heat being taken in. The piston (which is supposed to
                    exert a constant pressure) rises. No further increase of temperature occurs
                    during this stage, which continues until all the water is converted into steam.
                    During this stage the steam which is formed is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >saturated.</hi> The volume which the piston encloses at the end of this stage,—
                    the volume, namely, of 1 lb of saturated steam at pressure P (and temperature
                    <hi rend="italic">t),—</hi> will be denoted by V in cubic feet.</p>
                <p>(3) If after all the water is converted into steam more heat be allowed to enter,
                    the volume will increase and the temperature will rise. The steam is then said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">superheated.</hi></p>
                <p>56. The difference between saturated and superheated steam may be expressed by
                    saying that if water (at the temperature of the steam) be mixed with steam some
                    of the water will be evaporated if the steam is superheated, but none if the
                    steam is saturated. Any vapour in contact with its liquid and in thermal
                    equilibrium is necessarily saturated. When saturated its properties differ
                    considerably, as a rule, from those of a perfect gas, but when superheated they
                    approach those of a perfect gas more and more closely the farther the process of
                    superheating is carried, that is to say, the more the temperature is raised
                    above <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the temperature of saturation corresponding to
                    the given pressure P.</p>
                <p>57. The temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at which steam is formed depends on
                    the value of P. Their relation was determined with great care by Regnault, in a
                    series of classical experiments on which our knowledge of the properties of
                    steam chiefly depends.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    .</hi></p></note> The pressure of saturated steam rises with the temperature at
                    a rate which increases rapidly in the upper regions of the scale. This will be
                    apparent from the first and second columns of Table II., given on next page,
                    which is compiled from Rankine’s reduction of Regnault’s results. The first
                    column gives the temperature on the Fahr. scale; the second gives the
                    corresponding pressure in pounds per square inch. Rankine has also expressed the
                    relation of temperature and pressure in saturated steam by the following formula
                    (which is applicable with other constants to other vapours<note anchored="true"

                    and τ is the absolute temperature in Fahr. degrees. For most purposes, however,
                    it is more convenient to find the pressure corresponding to a given temperature,
                    or the temperature corresponding to a given pressure, from the table by

                    saturated steam at each pressure. This is a quantity the direct experimental
                    measurement of which is of very great difficulty. It may, however, be
                    calculated, from a knowledge of other properties of steam, by a process which
                    will be described later (§ 75). The values of V given in the table were
                    determined by Rankine by means of this process; they agree fairly well with such
                    direct observations of the density of steam as have been hitherto<pb break="no"

                <p>59. We have next to consider the supply of heat. During the first stage, until
                    the temperature rises from its initial value <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> to <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the temperature at
                    which steam begins to form under the given pressure, heat is required only to
                    warm the water. Since the specific heat of water is nearly constant, the amount
                    of heat taken in during the first stage is approximately <hi rend="italic"
                    >t-t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> thermal units or J(<hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi>- <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>)
                    foot-pounds, J being Joule’s equivalent (§ 23), and this expression for it will
                    generally serve with sufficient accuracy in practical calculations. More
                    exactly, however, the heat taken in is somewhat greater than this, for
                    Regnault's experiments show that the specific heat of water increases slightly
                    as the temperature rises. In stating the amount of heat required for this first
                    stage, <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> must be taken
                    as a known temperature; for convenience in numerical statement the temperature
                    32° F. is usually chosen as an arbitrary starting-point from which the reception
                    of heat is to be reckoned. We shall employ the symbol <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    to designate the heat required to raise 1 lb of water from 32° F. to the
                    temperature <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at which steam begins to form. The value of
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in thermal units is given, approximately, by the
                    equation <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = <hi rend="italic">t</hi>-32.</p>
                <p>More exact values, which take account of the variation in the specific heat of
                    water, will be found in the last column of Table II. During the first stage,
                    sensibly all the heat supplied goes to increase the stock of internal energy
                    which the fluid possesses, the amount of external work which is done by the
                    expansion of the fluid being negligible.</p>
                <p>60. The heat taken in during the second stage is what is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">latent heat</hi> of steam, and is denoted by L. Of it a part is
                    spent in doing external work,—namely, P multiplied by the excess of the volume
                    of the steam over the volume of the water,—and the remainder is the difference
                    of internal energy between 1 lb of steam at <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and 1 lb of
                    water at <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> The volume of 1 lb of water, at such
                    temperatures as are usual in steam-engines, is nearly 0∙017 cubic feet. We may
                    therefore write the external work (in foot-pounds) done during the production of
                    1 lb of steam under constant pressure P,—</p>
                <p>External work = P(V-0∙017).</p>
                <p>61. Adding together the heat taken in during the first and second stages we have
                    a quantity designated by H and called the <hi rend="italic">total heat</hi> of 1
                    lb of saturated steam:—</p>
                <p>H= <hi rend="italic">h</hi> + L.</p>
                <p>Regnault’s values of H are very accurately expressed (in thermal units) by the
                    formula</p>
                <p>H = 1082 + 0∙305 <hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
                <p>They are given in the fourth column of Table II. A similar formula gives
                    approximate values of L, exact enough for use in practical calculations,—</p>
                <p>L=1114-0∙7 <hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
                <p>The total heat of formation of 1 lb of steam, when formed under constant pressure

                <p>62. Of the whole latent heat of steam, L, the part Γ(V -0∙017) is, as has been
                    said above, spent in doing external work. The remainder (in foot-pounds)—</p>
                <p>JL-P(V-0∙0l7)—</p>
                <p>is the change of internal energy which the substance undergoes during
                    evaporation. This quantity, for which it is convenient to have a separate
                    symbol, will be denoted by <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> in thermal units, or J <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ</hi> in foot-pounds. In dealing with the heat required to
                    produce steam we adopted the state of water at 32° F. as an arbitrary
                    starting-point from which to reckon the reception of heat. In the same way it is
                    convenient to use this arbitrary starting-point in reckoning what may be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">internal energy</hi> of the substance, which is the excess
                    of the heat taken in over the external work done by the substance during its
                    reception of heat. Thus the internal energy I of 1 lb of saturated steam at
                    pressure P is equal to the total heat H, less that part of the total heat which
                    is spent in doing external work, or (in foot-pounds)</p>
                <p>JI = JH-P(V-0∙0I7), or I = L + <hi rend="italic">h</hi>- P(V-0∙017)∕J = <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> + <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi>.</p>
                <p>The notion of internal energy is useful in calculating the heat taken in or
                    rejected by steam during any stage of its expansion or compression in an engine.
                    When a working substance passes from one condition to another, its gain or loss
                    of heat is determined by the equation</p>
                <p>Heat taken in = increase of internal energy + external work.</p>
                <p>Any of the terms of this equation may be negative; the last term is negative when
                    work is done, not by, but upon the substance.</p>
                <p>63. The same equation gives the means of finding the amount of heat required to
                    form steam under any assigned conditions, in place of the condition assumed at
                    the beginning of this chapter, where the formation of steam under constant
                    pressure was considered. Whatever be the condition as to pressure under which
                    the process of formation is carried on, the total heat required is the sum of
                    the internal energy of the steam when formed and the work done by the substance
                    during the process. Thus in general</p>
                <p>Heat of formation = I + J <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> ∫P <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> V, the limits of integration being the final volume of the steam and the
                    original volume of the water. When steam is formed in a closed vessel of
                    constant volume no external work is done; the heat of formation is then equal to
                    the internal energy, and is less than the total heat of formation (H) of steam,
                    when formed at a constant pressure equal to the pressure reached in the vessel,
                    by the quantity P(V-0·017).</p>
                <p>64. In calculations which relate to the action of steam in engines we have
                    generally to deal, not with <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> saturated steam, but with
                    <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> steam, or steam whieh either carries in suspension,
                    or is otherwise mixed with, a greater or less proportion of water. In every such
                    mixture the steam and water have the same temperature, and the steam is
                    saturated. The dryness of wet steam is measured by the proportion <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> of dry steam in each pound of the mixed substance. When
                    that is known it is easy to determine the other physical constants: thus—</p>
                <p>Latent heat of 1 lb of wet steam <hi rend="italic">= qL;</hi></p>
                <p>Total heat of 1 lb of wet steam <hi rend="italic">=h + q</hi> L <hi rend="italic"

                    temperature corresponding to saturation at the actual pressure. When much
                    superheated, steam behaves like a<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0508-0485"/> perfect gas, and may be called “steam gas.” It
                    then follows the equation PV=85∙5τ, and the specific heat at constant pressure,
                    K <hi rend="italic                     subscript"> p</hi>, is 871 foot-pounds or
                    0·48 thermal unit. At very low temperatures steam approximates closely to the
                    condition of a perfect gas when very slightly superheated, and even when
                    saturated; at high temperatures a much greater amount of superheating is
                    necessary to bring about an approach to the perfectly gaseous state. The total
                    heat required for the production of superheated steam under any constant
                    pressure, when the superheating is sufficient to bring the steam to the state of
                    steam gas, may therefore be reckoned by taking the total heat of saturated steam
                    at a low temperature and adding to it the product of K <hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> p</hi>, into the excess of temperature above that. Thus Rankine,
                    treating saturated steam at 32° F. as a gas, gives the formula</p>
                <p>H'=1092 + 0∙48(<hi rend="italic">t</hi> '-32)</p>
                <p>to express the heat of formation (under any constant pressure) of superheated
                    steam, at any temperature <hi rend="italic">t'</hi> which is so much above the
                    temperature of saturation corresponding to the actual pressure that the steam
                    may be treated as a perfect gas. Calculated from its chemical composition, the
                    density of steam gas should be 0·622 times that of air at the same pressure and
                    temperature. The value of γ or K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi> ∕K <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> v</hi> for steam gas is 1·3. These formulas, dealing as
                    they do with steam which is so highly superheated as to be perfectly gaseous,
                    fail to apply to high-pressure steam that is heated but little above its
                    temperature of saturation. The relation of pressure to volume and temperature in
                    the region which lies between the saturated and the perfectly gaseous states has
                    been experimented on by Hirn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>66. The expansion of volume which occurs during the conversion of water into
                    steam under constant pressure—the second stage of the process described in §
                    55—is isothermal. From what has been already said it is obvious that steam, or
                    any other saturated vapour, can be expanded or compressed isothermally only when
                    wet, and that evaporation (in the one case) or condensation (in the other) must
                    accompany the process. Isothermal lines for a working substance which consists
                    of a liquid and its vapour are straight lines of uniform pressure.</p>
                <p>67. The form of adiabatic lines for substances of the same class depends not only
                    on the particular fluid, but also· on the proportion of liquid to vapour in the
                    mixture. In the case of steam, it has been shown by Rankine and Clausius that if
                    steam initially dry be allowed to expand adiabatically it becomes wet, and if
                    initially wet (unless very wet<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    text) that, when a mixture of steam and water expands adiabatically, steam
                    condenses if the proportion of steam be, roughly, over 50 per cent., but water
                    is evaporated if the proportion of steam be less than about 50 per cent. The
                    exact proportion depends on the initial pressure.</p></note>) it becomes wetter.
                    A part of the steam is condensed by the process of adiabatic expansion, at first
                    in the form of minute particles suspended throughout the mass. The temperature
                    and pressure fall; and, as that part of the substance which remains uncondensed
                    is saturated, the relation of pressure to temperature throughout the expansion
                    is that which holds for saturated steam. The following formula, proved by
                    Rankine<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Steam-Engine,</hi> § 281.</p></note> and Clausius<note

                    75), serves to calculate the extent to which condensation takes place during
                    adiabatic expansion, and so allows the relation of pressure to volume to be
                    determined.</p>

                    actual engine is by no means adiabatic, on account of the transfer of heat which
                    goes on between the working fluid and the metal of the cylinder and piston. When

                <p>68. We are now in a position to study the action of a heat-engine employing steam
                    as the working substance. To simplify the first consideration as far as
                    possible, let it be supposed that we have, as before, a long cylinder composed
                    of non-conducting material except at the base, and fitted with a non-conducting
                    piston; also a source of heat A at some temperature τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>; a receiver of heat, or, as we may now call it, a condenser C, at a lower
                    temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; and a non-conducting cover B (as in
                    § 40). Then we can perform Carnot’s cycle of operations as follows. To fix the
                    ideas, suppose that there is 1 lb of water in the cylinder to begin with, at the
                    temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>:—</p>
                <p>(1) Apply A, and allow the piston to rise. The water will take in heat and be

                <p>The indicator diagram for the cycle is given in fig. 14, as calculated by the
                    help of the equations in § 67 and of Table II. for a particular example, in
                    which <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 90 lb per square
                    inch (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = 781), and the expansion is continued down
                    to the pressure of the atmosphere, 147 lb per square inch (τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> =673). Since the process is reversible, and since heat
                    is taken in only at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and rejected only at τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the efficiency is (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- τ

                    used to check the calculation of the diagram.</p>
                <p>69. If the action here described could be realized in practice, we should have a
                    thermodynamically perfect steam-engine using saturated steam. The fraction of
                    the heat supplied to it which such an engine would convert into work would
                    depend simply on the temperature, and therefore on the pressure, at which the
                    steam was produced and condensed. The temperature of condensation is limited by
                    the consideration that there must be an abundant supply of some substance to
                    absorb the rejected heat; water is actually used for this purpose, so that τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> has for its lower limit the temperature of the
                    available water-supply.</p>
                <p>To the higher temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and pressure P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> no limit can be set except such as is brought about in
                    practice by the mechanical difficulties, with regard to strength and to
                    lubrication, which attend the use of high-pressure steam. By a very special
                    construction of engine and boiler Mr Perkins has been able to use steam with a
                    pressure as high as 500 lb per square inch; with engines of the usual
                    construction the value ranges from 190 lb downwards.</p>
                <p>If the temperature of condensation be taken as 60° F., as a lower limit, the
                    efficiency of a perfect steam-engine, using saturated steam, would depend on the
                    value of P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the absolute pressure of production of
                    the steam, as follows :—</p>
                <p>For perfect steam-engine, with condensation at 60° F.,</p>
                <p>P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in lb per square inch being 40 80 120 160 200</p>
                <p>Highest ideal efficiency = ·284 ·326 ·350 ·368 ·381</p>
                <p>But it must not be supposed that these values of the efficiency are actually
                    attained, or are even attainable. Many causes conspire to prevent steam-engines
                    from being thermodynamically perfect, and some of the causes of imperfection
                    cannot be removed. These numbers will serve, however, as a standard of
                    comparison in judging of<pb break="no"

                    forth the advantage of high-pressure steam from the thermodynamic point of
                    view.</p>
                <p>70. As a contrast to the ideally perfect steam-engine of § 68 we may next
                    consider a cyclic action such as occurred in the early engines of Newcomen or
                    Leupold, when steam was used non-expansively,—or rather, such an action as would
                    have occurred in engines of this type had the cylinder been a perfect
                    non-conductor of neat. Let the cycle of operations be this: —</p>
                <p>(1) Apply A and evaporate the water as before at P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.
                    Heat taken in = L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p>(2) Remove A and apply C. This at once condenses a part of the steam, and reduces
                    the pressure to P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>(3) Compress at P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, in contact with C, till
                    condensation is complete, and water at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is
                    left.</p>
                <p>(4) Remove B and apply A. This heats the water again to τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and completes the cycle.</p>
                <p>Heat taken in= <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>The indicator diagram for this series of operations is shown in fig. 15.</p>
                <p>Here the action is not reversible. To calculate the efficiency, we have <hi
                    rend="underline">Work done</hi><hi rend="subscript"> =</hi><hi rend="underline"
                    >(P</hi><hi rend="subscript underline"> 1</hi><hi rend="underline">- P</hi><hi

                <p>Heat taken in J(L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + Λ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>-∕⅛)</p>
                <p>The values of this will be found to range from 0·067 to 0·072 for the values of P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which are stated in § 69, when the temperature of
                    condensation is 60° F.</p>
                <p>71. In the ideal engine represented in fig. 14 the functions of boiler, cylinder,
                    and condenser are combined in a single vessel; but after what has been said in
                    chap. II. it is scarcely necessary to remark that, provided the working
                    substance passes through the same cycle of operations, it is indifferent whether
                    these are performed in several vessels or in one. To approach a little more
                    closely the conditions that hold in practice, we may think of the engine which
                    performs the cycle of § 70 as consisting of a boiler A (fig. 16) kept at τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, a non-conducting cylin der and piston B, a surface con
                    denser C kept at τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and a feed-pump</p>
                <p>D which restores the condensed water to the boiler. Then for every pound of steam
                    supplied and used non-expansively as in § 70, we have work done on the piston
                    =(P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; but an amount of work has to be ex pended in driving
                    the feed-</p>
                <p>pump =(P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) 0·017.</p>
                <p>Deducting this, the net work done per lb of steam is the same as before, and the
                    heat taken in is also the same. An indicator diagram taken from the cylinder
                    would give the area <hi rend="italic">efgh</hi> (fig. 17), where <hi
                    rend="italic">oe</hi> = P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ef</hi> = V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">oh</hi> = P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; an indicator diagram taken from the pump would give
                    the negative area <hi rend="italic">hjie,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ei</hi>
                    is the volume of the feed-water, or 0·017 cub. ft.</p>
                <p>The difference, namely, the shaded area, is the diagram of the complete cycle
                    gone through by each pound of the working substance. In experimental
                    measurements of the work done in steam-engines, only the action whieh occurs
                    within the cylinder is shown on the indicator diagram. From this the work spent
                    on the feed-pump is to be subtracted in any accurate determination of the
                    thermodynamic efficiency. If the feed-water is at any temperature τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> other than that of the condenser as assumed in § 70, it
                    is clear that the heat taken in is H <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> instead of H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>72. We have now to inquire how nearly, with the engine of fig. 16 (that is to
                    say, with an engine in which the boiler and condenser are separate from the
                    cylinder), we can approach the reversible cycle of § 68. The first stage of that
                    cycle corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">admission</hi> of steam from the
                    boiler into the cylinder. Then the ]∣oint known as the point of <hi
                    rend="italic">cut-off</hi> is reached, at which admission ceases, and the steam
                    already in the cylinder is allowed to expand, exerting a diminishing pressure on
                    the piston. This is the second stage, or the stage of <hi rend="italic"
                    >expansion.</hi> The process of expansion may be carried on until the pressure
                    falls to that of the condenser, in which case the expansion is said to be
                    complete. At the end of the expansion <hi rend="italic">release</hi> takes
                    place, that is to say, communication is opened with the condenser. Then the
                    return stroke begins, and a period termed the <hi rend="italic">exhaust</hi>
                    occurs, that is to say, steam passes out of the cylinder, into the condenser,
                    where it is condensed at pressure P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which is felt
                    as a <hi rend="italic">back pressure</hi> opposing the return of the piston. So
                    far, all has been essentially reversible, and identical with the corresponding
                    parts of Carnot’s cycle.</p>
                <p>But we cannot complete the cycle as Carnot's cycle was completed. The existence
                    of a separate condenser makes the fourth stage, that of adiabatic compression,
                    impracticable, and the best we can do is to continue the exhaust until
                    condensation is com plete, and then return the condensed water to the boiler by
                    means of the feed-pump.</p>
                <p>It is true that we may, and in actual practice do, stop the exhaust before the
                    return stroke is complete, and compress that portion of the steam which remains
                    below the piston, but this does not materially affect the thermodynamic
                    efficiency; it is done partly for mechanical reasons, and partly to avoid loss
                    of power through clearance (see chap. IV. ). In the present instance it is
                    supposed that there is no clearance, in which case this compression is out of
                    the question. The indicator diagram given by a cylinder in which steam goes
                    through the action described above is shown to scale in fig. 18 for a particular
                    example, in which it is supposed that 1 cubic foot of dry saturated steam is
                    admitted at an absolute pressure of 90 lb per square inch, and is expanded
                    twelve times, or down to a pressure of 5·4 lb per square inch, at which pressure
                    it is discharged to the condenser.</p>
                <p>As we have assumed the cylinder to be non-conducting, and the steam to be
                    initially dry, the expansion follows the law PV <hi rend="superscript">
                    1·135</hi> = constant. The advantage of expansion is obvious, that part of the
                    diagram which lies under the curve being so much clear gain.</p>
                <p>73. To calculate the efficiency, we have Work done per lb during admission = P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>;</p>

                <p>74. These expressions refer to complete expansion. When the expansion is
                    incomplete, as it generally is, the expression given above for the work done
                    during expansion still applies if we take P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to be
                    the pressure at the end of expansion, while the work spent on the steam during
                    the back-stroke is P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and that spent on the feed-pump is (P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi>)0·017, P <hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> b</hi> being the back pressure. Incomplete expansion is
                    illustrated by the dotted line in fig. 18.</p>
                <p>It is easy, by the aid of §§ 64 and 67 to extend these calculations to cases
                    where the steam, instead of being initially dry, is supposed to have any
                    assigned degree of wetness. The efficiency which is calculated in this way,
                    which for the present purpose may be called the theoretical efficiency
                    corresponding to the assumed conditions of working, is always much less than the
                    ideal efficiency of a perfect engine, since the cycle we are now dealing with is
                    not reversible. But even this theoretical efficiency, short as it falls of the
                    ideal of a perfect engine, is far greater than can be realized in practice when
                    the same boiler and condenser temperatures are used, and the same ratio of
                    expansion. The reasons for this will bo briefly considered in the next chapter;
                    at present the fact is mentioned to guard the reader from supposing that the
                    results which the above formulas give apply to actual engines.</p>
                <p>75. The results of § 68 have been turned to account by Rankine and Clausius for
                    the purpose of deducing the density of steam from other properties which admit
                    of more exact direct measurement. Let the perfect steam-engine there described
                    work through a very small interval of temperature ∆τ between two temperatures τ
                    and τ - ∆τ. The efficiency is ∆τ∕τ, and the work done (in foot-lbs. ) is JL∆τ∕τ.
                    The indicator diagram is now reduced to a long narrow strip, whose length is V
                    -0·017 and its breadth ∆P, the difference in pressure between steam at
                    temperatures τ and τ-∆τ. Hence the work done is also ∆P(V - 0·017), and
                    therefore</p>

                    Steam in the Cylinder.</hi></p>
                <p>76. In fig. 18 we have what may be called a first approximation to the
                    theoretical indicator diagram of a steam-engine. In the action then described it
                    was assumed—(1) that the steam supplied was dry and saturated, and had during
                    admission the full (uniform) pressure of the boiler P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>; (2) that there was no transfer of heat to or from the steam except in
                    the boiler and in the condenser;</p>
                <p>(3) that after more or less complete expansion all the steam was discharged by
                    the return stroke of the piston, during which the back pressure was the
                    (uniform) pressure in the condenser P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; (4) that the
                    whole volume of the cylinder was swept through by the piston. It remains to be
                    seen how far these assumptions are untrue in practice, and how far the
                    efficiency is affected in consequence.</p>
                <p>The actual conditions of working differ from these in the following main
                    respects, some of which are illustrated by the practical indicator diagram of
                    fig. 19, which is taken from an actual engine.</p>
                <p>77. Owing to the resistance of the ports and passages, and to the inertia of the
                    steam, the pressure within the cylinder is less than P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> during admission and greater than P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> during
                    exhaust.</p>
                <p>Moreover P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are
                    themselves not absolutely uniform, and P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is greater
                    than the pressure of steam at the temperature of the condenser, on account of
                    the presence of air in the condenser.</p>
                <p>During admission the pressure of steam in the cylinder is less than the boiler
                    pressure by an amount which increases as the piston advances, on account of the
                    increased velocity of the piston’s motion and the consequent increased demand
                    for steam. When the ports and passages offer much resistance the steam is
                    expressively said to be throttled or “wire-drawn.” Wire-drawing of steam is in
                    fact a case of imperfectly-resisted expansion (§ 51). The steam is dried by the
                    process to a small extent, and if initially dry it becomes superheated. In an
                    indicator diagram wire-drawing causes the line of admission to lie below a line
                    drawn at the boiler pressure, and to slope downwards. In fairly good practical
                    instances the mean absolute pressure during admission is about nine-tenths of
                    the pressure in the boiler.</p>
                <p>In the same way, during the exhaust the actual back pressure exceeds the pressure
                    in the condenser (shown by a dotted line in fig. 19) by an amount depending on
                    the freedom with which the steam makes its exit from the cylinder. In condensing
                    engines with a good vacuum the actual back pressure is from 3 to 5 lb per square
                    inch, and in non-condensing engines it is 16 to 18 lb in place of the mere 14·7
                    lb which is the pressure of the atmosphere. The excess of back pressure may be
                    greatly increased by the presence of water in the cylinder. The effects of
                    wire-drawing do not stop here. The valves open and close more or less slowly;
                    the points of cut-off and release are therefore not absolutely sharp, aud the
                    diagram has rounded corners at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> in place of the sharp angles which mark those events in fig. 18. For
                    this reason release is allowed in practice to occur a little before the end of
                    the forward stroke, hence the toe of the diagram takes a form like that shown in
                    fig. 19. The sharpness of the cut-off, and to a less extent the sharpness of the
                    release, depends greatly on the kind of valves and valve-gear used; valves of
                    the Corliss type (to be described later), which are noted for the suddenness
                    with which admission of steam is stopped, have the merit amongst others of
                    producing a very sharply defined diagram.</p>
                <p>78. When the piston is at either end of its stroke there is a small space left
                    between it and the cylinder cover. This space, together with the volume of the
                    passage or passages leading thence to the steam and exhaust valves, is called
                    the <hi rend="italic">clearance.</hi> It constitutes a volume through which the
                    piston does not sweep, but which is nevertheless filled with steam when
                    admission occurs, and the steam in the clearance forms a part of the whole steam
                    which expands after the supply from the boiler is cut-off. If AC be the volume
                    swept through by the piston up to release, OA the volume of the clearance, and
                    AB the volume swept through during admission, the apparent ratio of expansion is
                    AC∕AB, but the real ratio is (OA + AC)∕ (OA + AB).</p>
                <p>Clearance must obviously be taken account of in any calculation of curves of
                    expansion. It is conveniently allowed for in indicator diagrams by shifting the
                    line of no volume back through a distance corresponding to the clearance (fig.
                    20). In actual engines OA is from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> to <hi rend="subscript"> 1/50</hi> of the volume of
                    the cylinder.</p>
                <p>79. Clearance affects the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine chiefly by
                    altering the consumption of steam per stroke, and its influence depends
                    materially on the <hi rend="italic">compression</hi> (§ 72). If during the back
                    stroke the process of exhaust is discontinued before the end, and the remaining
                    steam is compressed, this cushion of steam will finally fill the volume of the
                    clearance; and by a proper selection of the point at which compression begins
                    the pressure of the cushion may be made to rise just up to the pressure at which
                    steam is admitted when the valve opens. This may be called complete compression,
                    and when it occurs the existence of clearance has no direct effect on the
                    consumption of steam nor on the efficiency; the whole fluid in the cylinder may
                    then be thought of as consisting of two parts,—a permanent cushion which is
                    alternately expanded and compressed without net gain or loss of work, and the
                    working part proper, which on admission fills the volume AB (fig. 20), and which
                    enters and leaves the cylinder in each stroke. But if compression be incomplete
                    or absent there is, on the opening of the admission valve, an inrush of steam to
                    fill up the clearance space. This increases the consumption to an extent which
                    is only partly counterbalanced by the increased area of the diagram, and the
                    result is that the efficiency is reduced. The action is, in fact, a case of
                    unresisted expansion (§ 51), and consequently tends, so far as its direct
                    effects go, to make the engine less than ever reversible. It is to be noted,
                    however, that by such unresisted expansion the entering steam is dried to some
                    extent, and this helps in a measure to counteract the cause of loss which will
                    be described below. Compression has the mechanical advantage that it obviates
                    the shock which the admission of steam would otherwise cause, and that by giving
                    the piston work to do while its velocity is being rapidly reduced it reduces
                    those stresses in the mechanism which are due to the inertia of the
                    reciprocating parts.</p>
                <p>80. The third and generally by far the most important element of difference
                    between the action of a real engine and that of our hypothetical engine is that
                    alluded to at the end of chap. I., the difference which proceeds from the fact
                    that the cylinder and piston are not non-conductors. As the steam fluctuates in
                    temperature there is a complex give-and-take of heat between it and the metal it
                    touches, and the effects of this, though not very conspicuous on the indicator
                    diagram, have an enormous influence in reducing the efficiency by increasing the
                    consumption of steam. Attention was drawn to this action by Mr D. K. Clark as
                    early as 1855 (<hi rend="italic">Railway Machinery,</hi> or art. <hi

                    the results of his experiments on locomotives were confirmed some years later by
                    Mr Isherwood’s trials of the engines of the United States steamer “Michigan.”
                    Rankine in his classical work on the steam-engine notices the subject only very
                    briefly, and takes no account of the action of the cylinder walls in his
                    calculations. Its importance has now been established beyond dispute, notably by
                    the experiments of Messrs Loring and Emery on the engines of certain revenue
                    steamers of the United States,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    analysis of engine tests. In the next chapter some account will be given of how
                    steam-engines are experimentally examined and how (following Him) we may deduce
                    the exchanges of heat which occur between the steam and the cylinder throughout
                    the stroke. The following is, in general terms, what experiments with actual
                    engines show to take place.</p>
                <p>81. When steam is admitted at the beginning of the stroke, it finds the metallic
                    surfaces of the cylinder and piston chilled by having been in contact with
                    low-pressure steam during the exhaust of the previous stroke. A portion of it is
                    therefore liquefied, and, as the piston advances, more and more of the chilled
                    cylinder surface is exposed and more and more of the hot steam is condensed. At
                    the end of the admission, when communication with the boiler is eut off, the
                    cylinder consequently contains a film of water spread over the exposed surface,
                    in addition to saturated steam. The boiler has therefore been drawn upon for a
                    supply greater than that corresponding to the volume of steam in the admission
                    space. The importance of this will be obvious from the fact, demonstrated by
                    experiment, that the steam which is thus condensed during admission frequently
                    amounts to 30 and even 50 per cent. of the whole quantity that comes over from
                    the boiler.</p>
                <p>82. Then, as expansion begins, more cold metal is uncovered, and some of the
                    remaining steam is condensed upon it. But the pressure of the steam now falls,
                    and the layer of water which has been previously deposited begins to be
                    re-evaporated as soon as the temperature of the expanding steam falls below that
                    of the liquid layer. On the whole, then, the amount of water present will
                    increase during the earliest part of the expansion, but a stage will soon be
                    reached when the condensation which occurs on the newly exposed metal is
                    balanced by re-evaporation of older portions of the layer. The percentage of
                    water present is then a maximum; and from this point onwards the steam becomes
                    more and more dried by re-evaporation of the layer.</p>
                <p>83. If the amount of initial condensation has been small this<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0511-0488"/> re-evaporation may be complete before release
                    occurs. Very usually, however, there is still an undried layer at the end of the
                    forward stroke, and the process of re-evaporation continues during the return
                    stroke, while exhaust is taking place. In extreme cases, if the amount of
                    initial condensation has been very great, the cylinder walls may fail to become
                    quite dry even during the exhaust, and a residue of the layer of condensed water
                    may either be carried over as water into the condenser, or, if the exhaust
                    valves are so badly arranged as to prevent its discharge, this unevaporated
                    residue may gather in the cylinder, requiring perhaps the drain-cocks to be left
                    open to allow of its escape. When any water is retained in this way the initial
                    condensation is enormously increased, for the hot steam then meets not only cold
                    metal but cold water. The latter causes much condensation, partly because of its
                    high specific heat, and partly because it is brought into intimate mixture with
                    the entering steam.</p>
                <p>84. Apart, however, from this extreme case, whatever water is re-evaporated
                    during expansion and exhaust takes heat from the metal of the cylinder, and so
                    brings it into a state that makes condensation inevitable when steam is next
                    admitted from the boiler. Mere contact with low-pressure steam during the
                    exhaust stroke would cool the metal but little; the cooling which actually
                    occurs is due mainly to the re-evaporation of the condensed water. Thus if an
                    engine were set in action, after being heated beforehand to the boiler
                    temperature, the cylinder would be only slightly cooled during the first exhaust
                    stroke, and little condensation would occur during the next admission. But the
                    metal would be more cooled in the subsequent expansion and exhaust, since it
                    would part with heat in re-evaporating this water. In the third admission more
                    still would be condensed, and so on, until a permanent régime would be
                    established in which condensation and re-evaporation were exactly balanced. The
                    same permanent régime is reached when the engine starts cold.</p>
                <p>85. The wetness of the working fluid to which the action of the walls of the
                    cylinder gives rise is essentially superficial. A film of water forms on the
                    walls, but except for this the body of the steam remains dry, until (by
                    adiabatic or nearly adiabatic expansion) it becomes wet throughout its volume.
                    The water formed by the act of expansion takes form as a mist diffused
                    throughout the steam, and on it the sides of the cylinder exert practically no
                    influence. This latter wetness is in fact increasing while the substance, as a
                    whole, is getting dried by the re-evaporation of the liquid film. During
                    expansion the working substance may be regarded as made up of two parts,—a core
                    of steam, which is expanding adiabatically but is at the same time receiving
                    additions to its amount in the form of saturated steam from the liquid layer,
                    and a liquid layer which is turning into steam.</p>
                <p>86. From a thermodynamic point of view all initial condensation of the steam is
                    bad, for, however early the film be re-evaporated, this can take place only
                    after its temperature has cooled below that of the boiler. The process
                    consequently involves a misapplication of heat, since the substance, after
                    parting with high temperature heat, takes it up again at a temperature lower
                    than the top of its range. This causes a loss of efficiency (chap. II.), and the
                    loss is greater the later in the stroke re-evaporation occurs. The heat that is
                    drawn from the cylinder by re-evaporation of the condensed film becomes less and
                    less effective for doing work as the end of the expansion is approached, and
                    finally, whatever evaporation continues during the back stroke is an unmitigated
                    source of waste. The heat it takes from the cylinder does no work; its only
                    effect, indeed, is to increase the back pressure by augmenting the volume of
                    steam to be expelled. A small amount of initial condensation reduces the
                    efficiency of the engine but little; a large amount causes a much more than
                    proportionally larger loss.</p>
                <p>87. The action of the cylinder walls is increased by any loss of heat which the
                    engine suffers by radiation and conduction from its external surface. The
                    entering steam has then to give up enough heat to provide for this waste, as
                    well as enough to produce the subsequent re-evaporation of the condensed film.
                    The consequence is that more steam is initially condensed. The loss of
                    efficiency due to this cause will therefore be greater in an unprotected
                    cylinder than in one which is well lagged or covered with nonconducting
                    material. On the other hand, if the engine have a steam-jacket the deleterious
                    action of the walls is reduced. The working substance is then on the whole
                    gaining instead of losing heat by conduction during its passage through the
                    cylinder. The jacket accelerates the process of re-evaporation and tends to make
                    it finish at a point in the stroke when the temperature of the steam is still
                    comparatively high. When the process is complete the cylinder walls give up very
                    little additional heat to the steam during the remainder of the expansion and
                    exhaust, for conduction and radiation between dry steam and the metal of the
                    cylinder are incompetent to cause any considerable exchange of heat. The
                    earlier, therefore, that evaporation is complete the less is the metal chilled,
                    and the less is the subsequent condensation. Moreover, after this stage in the
                    stroke has passed, a steam-jacket continues to give heat to the metal during the
                    remainder of the double stroke, and so warms it to a temperature more nearly
                    equal to that of the boiler steam before the next admission takes place.</p>
                <p>88. Thus a steam-jacket, though in itself a thermodynamically imperfect
                    contrivance, inasmuch as its object is to supply heat to the working substance
                    at a temperature lower than the source, acts beneficially by counteracting, to
                    some extent, the more serious misapplication of heat which occurs through the
                    alternate cooling and heating of the cylinder walls. The heat which a jacket
                    communicates to working steam often increases the power of an engine to an
                    extent far greater than corresponds to the extra supply of heat which the jacket
                    itself requires. Besides its thermodynamic effect a jacket has the drawback that
                    it increases waste by external radiation, since.it both enlarges the area of
                    radiating surface and raises its temperature; notwithstanding this, however,
                    many experiments have shown that in large and especially in slow-running
                    engines, the influence of a steam-jacket on the efficiency is, in general, good;
                    and this is to be ascribed to the fact that it reduces, though it does not
                    entirely remove, the evils of initial condensation. To be effective, however,
                    jackets must be well drained and kept full of “live” steam, instead of being, as
                    many are, traps for condensed water or for air.</p>
                <p>89. It is interesting to notice, in general terms, the effects which certain
                    variations of the conditions of working may be expected to produce on the loss
                    that occurs through the action of the cylinder walls. Initial condensation will
                    be increased by anything that augments the range of temperature through which
                    the inner surface of the cylinder fluctuates in each stroke, or that exposes a
                    larger surface of metal to the action of a given quantity of steam, or that
                    prolongs the contacts in which heat is exchanged. The influence of time is
                    specially important; for it must be borne in mind that the whole action depends
                    on the rate at which heat is conducted into the substance of the metal. The
                    changes of temperature which the metal undergoes are in every case mainly
                    superficial; the alternate heating and cooling of the inner surface initiates
                    waves of high and low temperature in the iron whose effects are sensible only to
                    a small depth; and the faster the alternate states succeed each other the more
                    superficial are the effects. In an engine making an indefinitely large number of
                    strokes per minute the cylinder sides would behave like non-conductors and the
                    action of the working substance would be adiabatic.</p>
                <p>We may conclude, then, that in general an engine running at a high speed will
                    have a higher thermodynamic efficiency than the same engine running at a low
                    speed, all the other conditions of working being the same in both cases.</p>
                <p>Again, as regards range of temperature, the influence of the cylinder walls will
                    be greater (other things being equal) with high than with low pressure steam,
                    and in condensing than in non-condensing engines. On the other hand, high
                    pressure has the good effect of reducing the surface of metal exposed to the
                    action of each pound of steam.</p>
                <p>In large engines the action of the walls will be less than in small engines,
                    since the proportion of wall surface to cylinder volume is less. This conclusion
                    agrees with the well-known fact that no small engines achieve the economy that
                    is easily reached with larger forms, especially with large marine engines, which
                    eclipse all others in the matter of size.</p>
                <p>Cylinder condensation is increased when the ratio of expansion is increased, all
                    the other circumstances of working being left unaltered. The metal is then
                    brought into more prolonged contact with low-temperature steam. The volume of
                    admission is reduced to a greater extent than the surface that is exposed to the
                    entering steam, since that surface includes two constant quantities, the surface
                    of the cylinder cover and of the piston. For these and perhaps other reasons, we
                    may conclude that with an early cutoff the initial condensation is relatively
                    large; and this conclusion is amply borne out by experiment. An important result
                    is that increase of expansion does not, beyond a certain limit, involve increase
                    of thermodynamic efficiency; when that limit is passed the augmentation of waste
                    through the action of the cylinder walls more than balances the increased
                    economy to which, on general principles, expansion should give rise, and the
                    result is a net loss. With a given engine, boiler pressure, and speed, a certain
                    ratio of expansion will give maximum efficiency. But the conditions on which
                    this maximum depends are too complex to admit of theoretical solution; the best
                    ratio can be determined only by experiment. It may even happen that an engine
                    which is required to work at a specified power will give better results, in
                    point of efficiency, with moderate steam-pressure and moderate expansion, than
                    with high steam-pressure and a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> early cut-off.</p>
                <p>90. The effect of increased expansion in augmenting the action of the sides and
                    so reducing the efficiency, when carried beyond a certain moderate grade, is
                    well illustrated by the American and Alsatian experiments alluded to above. The

                <p>Here a maximum of efficiency lies between the extreme grades of expansion to
                    which the test extends. In the American experiments the best results were ob
                    tained with even more moderate ratios of expansion. The compound engines of the
                    United States revenue steamer “Bache,” when tested with steam in the jacket of
                    the large cylinder, with the boiler pressure nearly uniform at 80 lb by gauge,
                    or 95 lb per square inch absolute, and the speed not greatly varied, gave the
                    results shown in Table IV. Here the efficiency is very little affected by a
                    large variation in the cut-off, but when the ratio of expansion becomes
                    excessive a distinct loss is incurred.</p>
                <p>Experiments with engines, in the conditions which hold in ordinary practice, show
                    that it is not unusual to find 20 or 30 per cent. of the steam that comes over
                    from the cylinder condensed during admission. In favourable cases the amount is
                    less than this; occasionally, on the other hand, the amount condensed is as much
                    as half, or even more than half, the whole steam supply.</p>
                <p>91. The action of the cylinder walls is reduced—(1) by jacketing, (2) by
                    superheating, and (3) by using compound expansion. The advantage of the
                    steam-jacket has been already mentioned. In high-speed engines its beneficial
                    effect is necessarily small, and in certain cases the benefit may be even more
                    than neutralized by the drawbacks which have been alluded to above (§ 88). In
                    general, however, the steam-jacket forms a valuable means of reducing the
                    wasteful action of the cylinder walls, especially when the ratio of expansion is
                    considerable. Experiments made with and without a jacket, on the same engine,
                    have shown that jacketing may increase the efficiency by 20 or 25 per cent. When
                    a jacket is working properly it uses, in a single-cylinder engine, 4 or 5 per
                    cent., and in a compound engine 8 to 12 per cent., of the whole steam
                    supply.</p>
                <p>92. Superheating the steam before its admission reduces the amount of initial
                    condensation, by lessening the quantity of steam needed to give up a specified
                    amount of heat, and this in its turn lessens the subsequent cooling by
                    re-evaporation. That it has a marked advantage in this respect has been
                    experimentally demonstrated by Hirn. On general thermodynamic grounds
                    superheating is good, because it extends the range of temperature through which
                    the working substance is carried. In modern practice superheating (to any
                    considerable extent) is seldom attempted. It occurs to a small extent whenever
                    dry steam is throttled, and a slight superheating is occasionally given to steam
                    in its passage from the high-pressure to the low-pressure cylinder of a compound
                    engine. In former years superheated steam was a common feature of marine
                    practice, but serious practical difficulties caused engineers to abandon its use
                    and to seek economy rather by increasing the initial pressure and using compound
                    expansion. In those days, however, the theoretical advantage of superheating was
                    less understood than it is now. The economy of fuel which its employment would
                    probably secure is so great as to warrant a fresh and energetic attempt to
                    overcome the mechanical difficulties of construction and lubrication that have
                    hitherto stood in the way.</p>
                <p>93. The most important means of preventing cylinder condensation from becoming
                    excessive is the use of compound expansion. If the vessels were non-conductors
                    of heat it would be, from the thermodynamic point of view, a matter of
                    indifference whether expansion was completed in a single vessel or divided
                    between two or more, provided the passage of steam from one to the other was
                    performed without introducing unresisted expansion (§ 51). But with actual
                    materials the compound system has the important merit that it subjects each
                    cylinder to a greatly reduced range of temperature variation. For this reason
                    the amount initially condensed in the high-pressure cylinder is greatly less
                    than if admission were to take place at once into the low-pressure cylinder and
                    the whole expansion were to be performed there. Further, the steam which is
                    re-evaporated from tho first cylinder during its exhaust does work in the
                    second, and it is only the re-evaporation that occurs during the exhaust from
                    the second cylinder that is absolutely wasteful. The exact advantage of this
                    division of range, as compared with expansion (through the same ratio) in a
                    single cylinder, would be hard to calculate; but it is easy to see in a general
                    way that an advantage is to be anticipated, and (though there are isolated
                    instances to the contrary) experience bears out this conclusion. In large
                    engines, working with high pressure, much expansion, and a slow stroke, the fact
                    that compound engines are in general more efficient than single engines cannot
                    be doubted. Additional evidence to the same effect is furnished when a compound
                    engine is tested first with compound expansion and then as a simple engine with
                    the same grade of expansion in the large cylinder alone. Thus in the American
                    experiments the compound engine of the “Bache” when worked as a simple engine
                    used 24 lb of steam per I.H.P. per hour, as compared with about 20 lb when the
                    engine worked compound, with the same boiler pressure, the same total expansion,
                    and steam in the jacket in both cases. The necessity’ for compounding, if
                    efficiency is to be secured, becomes greater with every increase of boiler
                    pressure. So long as the initial pressure is less than about 100 lb per square
                    inch (absolute) it suffices to reduce the range of temperature into two parts by
                    employing two-cylinder compound engines; with the higher pressures now common in
                    marine practice triple and even quadruple expansion is being introduced.</p>
                <p>The action of the cylinder walls would be greatly reduced if it were practicable
                    to use a non-conducting material as an internal lining to the cylinder and to
                    the exposed surfaces of the piston. No cure for the evils of initial
                    condensation would be so effectual as this; and in view of the economy of heat
                    which would result, it is a matter of some surprise that the use of a
                    non-conducting lining has not received more serious attention.</p>
                <p>94. The principal reasons have now been named which make the actual results of
                    engine performance differ from the results which would be obtained if the steam
                    conformed in every respect to the simple theory stated in chap. III. It remains
                    to state, very shortly, a few of the results of recent practice as to the actual
                    efficiency of steam-engines considered as heat-engines.</p>
                <p>The performance of a steam-engine, as regards economy in its consumption of heat,
                    may be stated in a number of ways. In some of these the engine alone is treated
                    as an independent machine; in others the engine, boiler, and furnace are
                    considered as a whole.</p>
                <p>The performance of the engine alone is best expressed by stating either (1) the
                    thermodynamic “efficiency” or (2) the number of thermal units used per
                    horse-power per minute. These terms require a short explanation. The
                    “efficiency” of a heat-engine has already been defined as the ratio of the work
                    done to the heat supplied. The “work done” ought in strictness to be reckoned as
                    the net work done by the working substance in passing through a complete cycle
                    of operations; it should therefore be determined by subtracting from the work
                    which the substance does in the cylinder the work which is spent upon the
                    substance in the feed-pump. The latter is a comparatively small quantity, and
                    engineers generally neglect it in their calculations of thermodynamic
                    efficiency. In making comparison, however, between the efficiency which is
                    actually realized and the efficiency of a perfect engine or of an engine working
                    under any assumed conditions, account should be taken of the negative work done
                    in the feed-pump. Account should also in strictness be taken of that part of the
                    work spent in driving the air-pump which is done upon the working substance, as
                    distinguished from the water of injection. The “heat supplied” is the total heat
                    of the steam delivered to the engine, less the heat contained in the
                    corresponding amount of feed-water. This quantity depends on the amount of steam
                    used, on the temperature of the feed, on the boiler pressure, and on the extent
                    to which the boiler “primes.” Priming is the delivery by the boiler of water
                    mixed with the steam. Except where there is actual superheating the steam supply
                    is always more or less wet; in a badly designed or overworked boiler large
                    volumes of water may be carried over with the steam, but in a good boiler of
                    adequate size the amount of priming is less (often much less) than 5 per cent.
                    of the whole supply. The effect of priming is, of course, to reduce the supply
                    of heat per lb of the working substance.</p>
                <p>One horse-power is the mechanical equivalent of 42·75 thermal units per minute.
                    The relation between the above two methods of stating engine performance is
                    therefore expressed by the equation</p>
                <p>Efficiency= <hi rend="superscript"> 42·75</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> Number of
                    T.U. per I.H.P. per minute</hi> ·</p>
                <p>Another very common mode is to give the number of pounds of steam supplied per
                    horse-power per hour. This is unsatisfactory’, even as a method of stating the
                    comparative economy of different engines, or of one engine in different
                    conditions, for several reasons. It ignores variations in boiler pressure, in
                    feed-water temperature, and in the dryness of the supply’, although each of
                    these things affects the amount of heat required for the production of a pound
                    of steam. But the total heat of production of dry steam does not vary greatly
                    within the limits of practical pressures; moreover, since (in condensing
                    engines) feed-water is generally taken from the hot-well, its temperature does
                    not differ much from that of the air-pump discharge, or (say·), 100° F. Finally,
                    in many comparative trials the amount of priming is nearly if not quite
                    constant. Hence it happens that this mode of statement often furnishes a fairly
                    accurate test of the economy of engines, and it<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n513/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0513-0490"/> has the advantage of putting results in a way
                    that is easy to understand and remember.</p>
                <p>95. None of these modes of statement include the efficiency of the boiler and
                    furnace. The performance of a boiler is most usually expressed by giving the
                    number of pounds of water at a stated temperature converted into steam at a
                    stated pressure by the combustion of 1 lb of coal. The temperature commonly
                    chosen is 212° F., and the water is supposed to be evaporated under atmospheric
                    pressure; the result may then be stated as so many pounds of water evaporated
                    from and at 212° F. per 1 lb of coal. But the term “efficiency” may also be
                    applied to a boiler and furnace (considered as one apparatus) in the sense of
                    the ratio between the heat that is utilized and the potential energy that is
                    contained in the fuel. This ratio is, in good boilers, about 0·7. Thus, for
                    example, 1 lb of Welsh coal contains about 15,500 thermal units of potential
                    energy, an amount which is equal to the heat of production (L) of about 16 lb of
                    steam from and at 212°. In practice, however, 1 lb of coal serves to evaporate
                    only about 11 lb of water under these conditions, or about 9·5 lb when the
                    feed-water enters at 100° F. and the absolute pressure is 100 lb per square
                    inch.</p>
                <p>The efficiency of the engine multiplied by that of the furnace and boiler gives a
                    number which expresses the ratio between the heat converted into work and the
                    potential energy of the fuel,—a number which is, in other words, the efficiency
                    of the system of engine, boiler, and furnace considered as a whole. Instead,
                    however, of expressing this idea by the use of the term efficiency, engineers
                    are more usually in the habit of stating the performance of the complete system
                    by giving the number of pounds of coal consumed per horse-power per hour. It
                    must be borne in mind that this quantity depends on the performance of the
                    boiler as much as on that of the engine, and that the difference in thermal
                    value between one kind of coal and another makes it, at the best, a rough way of
                    specifying economy. It is, however, an easy quantity to measure; and to most
                    users of engines the size of the coal-bill is a matter of greater interest than
                    any results of thermodynamic analysis. Still another expression for engine
                    performance, similar to this last, is the now nearly obsolete term “duty,” or
                    number of foot-pounds of work done for every 1 cwt. of coal consumed. Its
                    relation to the pounds of coal per horse-power per hour is this—</p>
                <p>Duty= <hi rend="superscript"> 112 × 33000 × 60</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    Number of lbs. of coal per I.H.P. per hour</hi> ·</p>
                <p>A good condensing engine of large size, supplied by good boilers, consumes about
                    2 lb of coal per horse-power per hour; its duty is then about 110 millions.</p>
                <p>96. To illustrate the subject of this chapter more fully the following summary is
                    given of the results of tests of pumping engines by Mr J. G. Mair, described in
                    two excellent papers in <hi rend="italic">Min. Pro. Inst. Civ. Eng.</hi> (vols.
                    lxx. and lxxix.). The first group (Table V.) refers to single cylinder beam
                    rotative engines, all of the same type, working at about 120 horse-power (in all
                    except the last trial there were steam-jackets in use) :—</p>

                <p>In these engines, which ran at the slow speed of about 20 revolutions per minute,
                    the influence of steam jacketing was very marked. In the trials made with
                    jackets in action, the percentage of water present at cut-off’, when plotted in
                    relation to the ratio of expansion, gives a diagram which is sensibly a straight
                    line; by drawing this line it may be seen that with an expansion of 3·8 in a
                    similar jacketed cylinder there would be about 25 per cent. of initial
                    condensation instead of the much greater amount (37 per cent.) which the absence

                <p>98. In all these operations the taking of indicator diagrams forms a principal
                    part. The indicator, invented by Watt and improved by M‘Naught and by Richards,
                    consists of a small steam cylinder, fitted with a piston which slides easily
                    within it and is pressed down by a spiral spring of steel wire. The cylinder of
                    the indicator is connected by a pipe below this piston to one or other end of
                    the cylinder of the engine, so that the piston of the indicator rises and falls
                    in response to the fluctuations of pressure which occur in the engine cylinder.
                    The indicator piston actuates a pencil, which rises and. falls with it and
                    traces the diagram on a sheet of paper fixed to a drum that is caused to rotate
                    back and forth through a certain arc, in unison with the motion of the engine
                    piston. In M''Naught's indicator the pencil is directly attached to the
                    indicator piston, in Richards’s the pencil is moved by means of a system of
                    links so that it copies the motion of the piston on a magnified scale. This has
                    the advantage that an equally large diagram is drawn with much less movement of
                    the piston, and errors which are caused by the piston’s inertia are consequently
                    reduced. In high-speed engines especially it is important to minimize the
                    inertia of the indicator piston and the parts connected with it. In Richards’s
                    indicator the linkage employed to multiply the piston’s motion is an arrangement
                    similar to the parallel motion introduced by Watt as a means of guiding the
                    piston-rod in beam engines (see § 188). In several recent forms of indicator
                    lighter linkages are adopted, and other changes have been made with the object
                    of fitting the instrument better for highspeed work. One of these modified forms
                    of Richards’s indicator (the Crosby) is shown in fig. 21. The pressure of steam
                    in the engine cylinder raises the piston P, compressing the spring S and causing
                    the pencil Q to rise in a nearly straight line through a distance proportional,
                    on a magnified scale, to the com pression of the spring and therefore to the
                    pressure of the steam. At the same time the drum D, which carries the paper,
                    receives motion through the cord C from the crosshead of the en gine. Inside
                    this drum there is a spiral spring which becomes wound up when the cord is
                    pulled, and serves to turn the drum in the reverse direction during the back
                    stroke. The cap of the indicator cylinder has holes in it which admit air freely
                    to the top of the piston, aud the piston has room to descend, extending the
                    spring S, when the pressure of the steam is less than that of the atmosphere.
                    The spring is easily taken out and replaced by a more or less stiff one when
                    higher or lower pressures have to be dealt with.</p>
                <p>99. To register correctly, an indicator must satisfy two conditions: (1) the
                    motion of the piston must be proportional to the change of steam pressure in the
                    engine cylinder; and (2) the motion of the drum must be proportional to that of
                    the engine piston.</p>
                <p>The first of these requires that the pipe which connects the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0514-0491"/> indicator with the cylinder should be short and
                    of sufficient bore, and that it should open in the cylinder at a place where the
                    pressure in it will not be affected by the kinetic action of the inrushing
                    steam. Frequently pipes are led from both ends of the cylinder to a central
                    position where the indicator is set, so that diagrams may be taken from either
                    end without shifting the instrument; much better results are obtained,
                    especially when the cylinder is long, by using a pair of indicators, each fixed
                    with the shortest possible connecting pipe, or by taking diagrams successively
                    from the two ends of the cylinder with a single instrument set first at one end
                    and then at the other. The general effect of an insufficiently free connexion
                    between the indicator and the engine cylinder is to make the diagram too small.
                    The first condition is also invalidated to some extent by the friction of the
                    indicator piston, of the joints in the linkage, and of the pencil on the paper.
                    The piston must slide very freely; nothing of the nature of packing is
                    permissible, and any steam that leaks past it must have a free exit through the
                    cover. The pencil pressure must not exceed the minimum which is necessary for
                    clear marking. By careful use of a well-made instrument the error due to
                    friction in the piston and connected parts need not be serious. Another source
                    of disturbance is the inertia of these parts, which tends to set them into
                    oscillation whenever the indicator piston suffers a comparatively sudden
                    displacement. These oscillations, superposed upon the legitimate motions of the
                    piston, give a wavy outline to parts of the diagram, especially when the speed
                    is great and when the last-named source of error (the friction) is small. When
                    they appear on the diagram a continuous curve should be drawn midway between the
                    crests and hollows of the undulations. To keep them within reasonable compass in
                    high-speed work a stiff spring must be used aud an indicator with light parts
                    should be selected. Finally, to secure accuracy in the pencil’s movement, the
                    strain of the spring must be kept well within the limit of elasticity, so that
                    the strain may be as nearly as possible proportional to the steam pressure. Care
                    must be taken that the spring is graduated to suit the temperature (about 212°
                    F.) to which it is exposed when in use; its stiffness at this temperature is
                    about 3 per cent. less than when cold.</p>
                <p>With regard to the motion of the drum, it is, in the first place, necessary to
                    have a reduciug mechanism which will give a sufficiently accurate copy, on a
                    small scale, of the engine piston’s stroke. Many contrivances are used for this
                    purpose; in some a rigorous geometrical solution of the problem is aimed at, in
                    others a close approximation only. Fig. 22 shows a good form of indicator gear.
                    A pendulum rod AB is pinned at one end to the crosshead A (the end of the
                    piston-rod) of the engine. Its upper end is carried by a pin which is free to
                    turn and slide in the fixed slot B. A cord from an intermediate point C leads
                    over pulleys to the indicator drum. The pendulum rod should be much longer than
                    the piston stroke, and the cord should lead off for a considerable distance in
                    the direction sketched, at right angles to the mean position of the rods.</p>
                <p>The accuracy of the drum’s motion does not, however, depend merely on the
                    geometrical condition of the gear. It depends also on the rigidity of the parts,
                    and especially on the stretching of the cord. The elasticity of the cord will
                    cause error if it is not maintained in a state of uniform tension throughout the
                    double stroke, and this error will be greater the longer and the more extensible
                    the cord is. Hence short cords are to be preferred; and fine wire, which
                    stretches much less, may often be substituted for cord with great advantage. The
                    stretching of the cord is perhaps the most serious and least noticed source of
                    error the indicator is subject to in ordinary practice. The tension of the cord
                    varies for three reasons,—the inertia of the drum, the varying resistance of the
                    drum spring, aud the friction of the drum, which has the effect of increasing
                    the tension during the forward stroke and of reducing it during the back stroke.
                    This last cause of variation can be minimized only by good construction and
                    careful use of the instrument; but the other two causes can be made to
                    neutralize one another almost completely. Since the motion is nearly simple
                    harmonic, the acceleration of the drum varies in a nearly uniform manner from
                    end to end of the stroke. The resistance of the drum spring also varies
                    uniformly; and it is therefore only necessary to adjust the stiffness of the
                    drum spring so that the increase in its resistance as the motion of the drum
                    proceeds may balance the decrease in the force that the cord has to exert in
                    setting the drum into motion. This adjustment will secure an almost uniform
                    tension in the cord throughout the whole stroke; it must, of course, be altered
                    to suit different engine speeds. The indicator plays so important a part in the
                    testing of heat-engines, whether for practical or scientific purposes, that no
                    pains should be spared to avoid the numerous and serious sources of error to
                    which it is liable through faulty construction or unintelligent use.<note

                    by dividing the area of the diagram by the length of its base. This gives a mean
                    height, which, interpreted on the scale of pressures, is the mean effective
                    pressure in pounds per square inch. This has to be multiplied by the effective
                    area of the piston in square inches and by the length of the piston stroke in
                    feet, to find the work done per stroke in foot-pounds on that side of the piston

                    by a planimeter or calculated by the use of Simpson’s rule. A less accurate
                    plan, frequently followed, is to divide the diagram by lines drawn at the middle
                    of strips of equal width, as in figs. 23 and 24, aud to take the mean pressure
                    as the average height of these lines.</p>
                <p>101. Space admits of no more than a few illustrations of actual indicator
                    diagrams. Fig. 23 is a diagram taken from an antiquated non-condensing engine
                    working without ex pansion. The line AB has been drawn at a height which
                    represents the boiler pressure, in order to show the loss of pressure in
                    admission.</p>
                <p>The line CD is drawn at atmospheric pressure by the indicator itself. In this
                    engine ad mission continues till the end of the forward stroke, and as a result
                    the back pressure is great, especially during the first stage of the exhaust.
                    The diagram shows a slight amount of oscillation produced by the sudden
                    admission of steam. This feature, however, is better illustrated by fig. 24,
                    which is another diagram taken from the same engine, at the same boiler
                    pressure, but with the steam much throttled.</p>
                <p>Fig. 25 shows a pair of diagrams taken from a condensing engine in which the
                    distribution of steam is effected by a common slide valve (chap. VIII.). The two
                    diagrams refer to opposite ends of the cylinder and are taken on the same paper
                    by the plan already alluded to (§ 99) of fixing the indi cator about midway
                    between the ends of the cylinder, with a pipe leading from it to each end. Steam
                    is cut off at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a'</hi>, release
                    occurs at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> and compression
                    begins at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c'.</hi></p>
                <p>The gradual closing of the slide valves throttles the steam considerably before
                    the cut-off is complete. The line of no pressure EF is drawn 14·7 lb per square
                    inch below CD, which is the atmospheric line; and the line of no volume AE or BF
                    is drawn (for each end of the cylinder) at a distance (from the end of the
                    diagram) equal to the volume of the clearance.</p>
                <p>Fig. 26 is a diagram taken from a Corliss engine working with a large ratio of
                    expansion. The Corliss valve-gear, which will be described in chap. IX., causes
                    the admission valve to close suddenly, and consequently defines the point of
                    cut-off’ pretty sharply in the diagram. Through this point a dotted curve has
                    been drawn (by aid of the equation PV <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> =
                    const., § 67), which is the curve that would be followed if the expansion were
                    adiabatic. In drawing this curve it has been assumed that at the end of
                    admission the steam contains 25 per cent. of water. The actual curve first falls
                    below and then rises above this adiabatic curve, in consequence of the continued
                    condensation which takes place during the early stages of the expansion and the
                    re-evaporation of condensed water during later stages (§ 82). Fig. 27 is another
                    diagram from a Corliss engine, running light, and with the condenser not in
                    action. Diagrams of this kind are often taken when engines are first erected,
                    for the purpose of testing the setting of the valves. Other indicator diagrams,
                    for compound engines, will be given in chap. VI.<pb break="no"

                    is occasionally used which integrates the two coordinates which it is the
                    business of the indicator diagram to represent, and exhibits the power developed
                    from stroke to stroke by the progressive movement of an index round a dial.</p>
                <p>102. In tests of thermodynamic efficiency we may measure either the heat supplied
                    or the heat rejected, and compare it with the work done. The heat supplied is on
                    the whole capable of more exact measurement, but in any case a determination of
                    the heat rejected furnishes a valuable check on the accuracy of the result. The
                    trial must be continued for a period of some hours at least, during which the
                    engine and boiler are to be kept working as uniformly as possible in all
                    respects. The power is determined by taking indicator diagrams at short
                    intervals. The heat supplied is found by noting the amount of feed-water
                    required to keep the waterlevel in the boiler constant during the trial, the
                    temperature of the feed, aud the pressure of the steam. The only uncertainty
                    which attaches to the measurement of heat-supply is due to priming. Every pound
                    of water that passes over unevaporated to the engine takes less heat by the
                    amount L (§ 60) than if it went over in the state of steam. To measure the
                    degree of wetness in steam is a matter of some difficulty; it may be done by
                    passing the steam into a known quantity of cold water, so as to condense it, and
                    observing the rise of temperature which has taken place when the whole quantity
                    of water present has increased by a measured amount.</p>
                <p>If L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the latent heat of steam at the boiler

                <p>To this must be added, in the case of a jacketed engine, the heat supplied to the
                    jacket, a quantity which depends on the amount of steam condensed there, and
                    also on whether the water that gathers in the jacket is drained back into the
                    boiler or allowed to escape into the hot-well.</p>
                <p>The heat rejected by an engine fitted with an injection condenser is made up of
                    the following parts :—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) heat rejected in the condensed
                    water, less the heat returned to the boiler in the feed (if the feed is directly
                    drawn from the hot-well without giving the water time to cool sensibly, this
                    quantity vanishes; in a jacketed engine this item must include the heat rejected
                    in the jacket drains); (ό) heat used in warming the condenser water from the
                    temperature of injection to the temperature of the air-pump discharge; (c) heat
                    rejected in air and vapour from the air-pump; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) heat
                    lost by radiation, conduction to supports, and aerial convection,—or, more
                    properly, the excess of this heat over the heat developed within the engine by
                    the friction of piston, valves, &amp;c. Of these quantities, (<hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>) is found without difficulty from a knowledge of the amount of the
                    feed-water, its temperature, the temperature of the air-pump discharge, and
                    amount and temperature of water drained from the jacket; (5) is measured by
                    gauging the whole discharge from the pump, deducting from it the amount returned
                    to the boiler as feedwater, and measuring its temperature and that of the
                    injection water; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) does not admit of direct
                    measurement; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) may be approximately estimated for a
                    jacketed engine by filling the jacket with steam while the engine is out of
                    action, and observing the amount of steam condensed in the jacket during a long
                    interval, through radiation, &amp;c., from the external surface.</p>
                <p>In calculating the supply of heat by the boiler it is convenient to take the
                    temperature 32° F. as a starting point from which to reckon what may be termed
                    the gross supply, and then to deduct from this the heat which is restored to the
                    boiler in the feed-water. The difference, which may be called the net supply, is
                    the true consumption of heat, and is to be used in calculating the efficiency of
                    the engine. A similar convention may be followed in dealing with the heat
                    rejected.</p>
                <p>103. This subject is most easily made intelligible by help of a numerical
                    example. For this purpose the following data of an actual engine-test have been
                    taken from one of Mr Mair’s papers<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    differ only to a small and unimportant extent from those stated by Mr Mair. The
                    engine under trial was a compound beam engine, steam-jacketed, with an
                    intermediate receiver between the cylinders. The cylinders were 21 inches and 36
                    inches in diameter, and the stroke 5½ feet. The total ratio of expansion was

                <p>The efficiency of the engine is <hi rend="superscript"> 227</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1551</hi> or 0·146. The efficiency of a perfect engine working
                    between the same limits of temperature, 308° F. and 50° F., would be 0·335.</p>
                <p>104. When it is desired to deduce from the test of an engine not only the
                    thermodynamic efficiency but also the amount of initial condensation and the
                    subsequent changes of wetness which the working fluid undergoes during
                    expansion, it is necessary to know, in addition to the above data, the volume of
                    cylinder and clearance, the relation of pressure to volume during the several
                    stages of the stroke, and the whole amount of working substance present in the
                    cylinder. This last is a quantity whose precise value is not easily ascertained.
                    Assuming that the point at which compression begins can be distinguished on the
                    diagram, we have the pressure and the volume of the steam that is afterwards
                    compressed into the clearance space. From its pressure and volume we can infer
                    its amount, if only its degree of dryness be known. The assumption usually made
                    is that at the beginning of compression the steam shut up in the cylinder is
                    dry. This assumption is to a certain extent supported by the fact that
                    re-evaporation has been going on during expansion and exhaust; in good engines
                    it is probably not far from the truth, though there are cases where, owing to
                    excessive initial condensation and to the exhaust ports being badly situated for
                    draining the cylinder, water may accumulate in considerable quantities. Except
                    in extreme cases of this kind, however, the assumption that the steam is dry
                    when compression begins does not introduce an error which can seriously affect
                    the subsequent calculations. Having found the quantity shut up in the clearance,
                    we add to it the quantity delivered from the boiler per single stroke, to find
                    the whole quantity of working substance in the cylinder. The substance is, and
                    continues, a mixture in varying proportions of steam and water. Its volume may
                    practically be taken as the volume of the dry steam it contains, the volume of
                    the water being comparatively small. Taking any point of the stroke, and
                    measuring the pressure and the volume there, we can say how much steam (at that
                    pressure) would be required to fill the volume which the mixture then occupies.
                    This quantity will always be less than the actual amount of the mixture; and the
                    difference between them is the amount of water that is present. This calculation
                    is of special interest at two places in the stroke—the point of cut-off and the
                    point of release.</p>
                <p>105. To illustrate it we may continue the numerical example quoted above. In the
                    high-pressure cylinder of the engine to which the test refers the volume at the
                    beginning of compression (including clearance) was 1·52 cubic feet. The
                    pressure, just before compression began, is shown by the indicator diagram (of
                    which fig. 28 is a copy) to have been 14·8 lb per square inch. At this pres sure
                    the density (or mass of 1 cubic foot)</p>
                <p>of steam is 0·038 lb. Hence (on the above assumption that the steam was then
                    dry)</p>
                <p>the quantity shut up in the clearance was l∙52×0∙038 = 0∙058 lb.</p>
                <p>The amount delivered to the cylinder per single stroke (or half revolution) was
                    0·604 lb). The whole quantity of working substance present from the end of the
                    admission to the beginning of the exhaust was therefore 0·662 lb.</p>
                <p>At the point of cut-off the pressure is shown by the diagram to have been 64 lb
                    per square inch (absolute), and the volume, including clearance, was 2·92 cubic
                    feet. The density of steam for this<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0516-0493"/> pressure is 0·151 lb per cubic foot. Hence, out
                    of the whole mixture, the amount of steam was 2·92 × 0·151 = 0·440 lb. The water
                    present at the point of cut-off was therefore 0·662 - 0·440 or 0·222 lb. This is
                    33·5 per cent. of the whole amount of the mixture, and shows (after allowing for
                    the priming water) that about 32 per cent. of the steam admitted was condensed
                    on admission.</p>
                <p>Next, to find the amount of water present at the end of the expansion. The
                    diagram shows that at this point the pressure was 15·2 lb per square inch and
                    the volume 13·235 cubic feet. Steam of this pressure has a density of 0·0392 lb
                    per cubic foot. The quantity of steam at release was therefore 13·235 × 0·0392,
                    or 0·519 lb, and the quantity of water 0·662 - 0·519 = 0·143 lb. It appears
                    therefore that re-evaporation from the cylinder walls during expansion reduced
                    the amount of water present by 0·079 lb, so that the percentage of water fell
                    from 33·5 at the point of cut-off to 21·6 at the point of release. The same
                    method of calculation can obviously be applied to any other point in the
                    expansion curve, and can be extended to the low-pressure cylinder of an engine
                    which (like the one in this example) is compound. The amount of dry steam
                    present at the point of release is sometimes spoken of as the “steam accounted
                    for by the indicator diagram.”</p>
                <p>106. Having completed this analysis of the working-substance, we may proceed to
                    find the quantity of heat whieh it gives to or takes from the walls of the
                    cylinder during any stage of its action, by considering the changes of internal
                    energy whieh the working substance undergoes, along with the external work done,
                    from stage to stage. If we write <hi rend="italic">m</hi> for the amount of
                    steam and <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> for the amount of water present in the
                    cylinder at any one stage, the internal energy of the mixture is (§ 62)</p>

                <p>Let the value of this quantity be denoted by I <hi rend="subscript"> A</hi> at
                    any one stage in the expansion or compression of the mixture, such as the point
                    of cut-off A, and by I <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b</hi> at a later stage,
                    such as the point of release B, the corresponding volumes of the whole mixture

                    rend="smallcaps">V</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b</hi> respectively. Then
                    in passing from the first condition to the second the substance loses <hi

                    b</hi> the process is adiabatic; otherwise the amount of heat taken up (from the

                <p>If A is the point of cut-off and B that of release, the quantity so calculated is
                    the heat taken up from the cylinder walls during the whole process of expansion.
                    The calculation applies equally, however, in determining the heat taken up
                    during any stage of the process. When this has a negative value heat has been
                    given up by the substance to the cylinder walls. In the numerical example which
                    has been cited above the internal energy of the mixture at the beginning of
                    expansion was 540 thermal units. At the end of expansion the internal energy was
                    584 thermal units. Between these points the indicator diagram (fig. 28) shows
                    that the work done was equivalent to 55 thermal units. 44 + 55 = 99 units of
                    heat were therefore taken from the cylinder walls during the process of
                    expansion. A similar calculation, applied to the compression curve, shows that
                    in that part of the operation heat was given up to the cylinder walls. During
                    compression W is of course negative, since work is then spent upon the
                    steam.</p>
                <p>107. During admission and also during exhaust another item enters into the
                    account,—the amount of the working substance is then undergoing change. To find
                    the heat given up by the steam during admission we have first to calculate (by
                    the method already described) the internal energy of the mixed steam and water
                    that is shut into the clearance space at the end of the previous stroke; this
                    may be called <hi rend="smallcaps">I</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">
                    d</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">.</hi> The steam which then enters brings with it an
                    additional amount of internal energy which we may calculate from a knowledge of
                    the quantity of steam, its pressure at admission, and its dryness. Let I <hi
                    rend="subscript"> o</hi> denote this additional supply of internal energy. At
                    the end of admission the state of the mixture is known from the indicator
                    diagram; hence its internal energy <hi rend="smallcaps">I</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> a</hi> may be found. The work done during admission,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">W</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> da</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">,</hi> is also determined from the diagram. Then we have, for
                    the heat given up by the steam during admission, <hi rend="smallcaps">Q</hi><hi

                <p>In attempting to apply the same method of calculation to determine the heat taken
                    up from the cylinder walls during exhaust <hi rend="smallcaps">(Q</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">),</hi> we are met by
                    the difficulty that we do not know the state, as regards dryness, of the mixture
                    during its expulsion from the cylinder. We may, however, estimate the value of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Q</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc</hi> as follows.
                    Let <hi rend="smallcaps">Q</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> cd</hi> and <hi

                    the heat which the cylinder loses (per single stroke) by radiation (less the
                    heat produced by piston and valve friction), and Q <hi rend="subscript"> J</hi>
                    the heat which it gains by condensation of steam in the jacket, if there is one.
                    Then, as the cylinder neither gains nor loses heat on the whole, after a uniform

                    bc</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">,</hi> which is taken up by the steam from the
                    cylinder walls during exhaust, is a part of the heat deposited there during
                    admission. It has passed through the cylinder without contributing in the
                    smallest degree to the work of the engine. Probably for this reason it is
                    treated by some writers as a quantity whieh measures the wasteful influence of
                    the cylinder walls. This, however, is not strictly the case. The magnitude of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Q</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc</hi> is certainly
                    in some sense an index of the extent to which the alternate heating and cooling
                    of the metal causes inefficiency; it is so much heat absolutely lost, and lost
                    by the action of the walls. [In the high-pressure cylinder of a compound engine
                    this loss is, of course, absolute only as regards that cylinder; the heat
                    represented by Q <hi rend="subscript"> BC</hi> assists in the work of the
                    low-pressure cylinder.] But besides this loss there is another which the walls
                    cause by taking heat from the steam on admission and restoring it during the
                    later stages of expansion. That part of the heat abstracted during admission
                    which is restored before the point of release does not appear in <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi> nevertheless it is a source of inefficiency. With steam
                    that is dry at the end of the expansion the value of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Q</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc</hi> is almost negligible; still the
                    cylinder walls may cause a very sensible loss by abstracting heat from the hot
                    steam as it enters and restoring it as the mixture expands. The quantity which

                    accuracy with which the indicator diagram not only gives a measure of the work
                    done by the engine under test, but shows the relation of pressure to volume at
                    each stage in the process. Engine tests of a complete kind have now been made
                    and discussed by a number of independent observers, working with widely
                    different data. The results are in good general agreement. They demonstrate the
                    influence of the sides beyond question, showing that 30 per cent. is no unusual
                    amount of water to be present in the mixture at the point of cut-off, even in
                    compound engines of the best types; that half of this water, or even more, is
                    frequently found at the end of expansion; and that the heat denoted above by <hi

                    10 to 20 per cent. of the whole heat supplied.<note anchored="true"

                <p>110. An engine employed to drive other machinery delivers to it an amount of
                    power less than the indicated power by an amount which is wasted in overcoming
                    the friction of piston and piston-rod, slides, valves, journals, &amp;c. The
                    efficiency of the mechanism is the ratio of the “effective” or “brake”
                    horse-power to the indicated horse-power. It may be tested by measuring the
                    power delivered by the engine when at work, either by using a transmission
                    dynamometer or by substituting an absorption dynamometer for the mechanism
                    usually driven. In the case of a pumping engine the efficiency of the engine and
                    pumps together may be determined by observing the actual work done in raising
                    water or in delivering a measured volume against a known pressure. Attempts are
                    sometimes made to find the amount of power wasted in engine friction by testing
                    the indicated power needed to drive the engine against no other resistance than
                    its own friction. This, however, fails to show the power which will be spent in
                    overcoming friction when the engine runs under ordinary conditions, since the
                    pressures at the slides, the journals, and elsewhere are then widely different
                    from what they are when the engine is running without load. Experiments with
                    large engines show that the efficiency of the mechanism may, in favourable
                    cases, be 0·85 or even 0·9 <hi rend="italic">; in</hi> small engines, or in
                    large engines running under light loads, it is generally much less than this.<pb

                    Expansion.</hi></p>
                <p>111. In the original form of compound engine, invented by Hornblower and revived
                    by Woolf, steam passed directly from the first to the second cylinder; the
                    exhaust from the first and admission to the second went on together throughout
                    the whole of the back stroke. This arrangement is possible only when the high
                    and low pressure pistons begin and end their strokes together, that is to say,
                    when their movements either coincide in phase or differ by half a revolution.
                    Engines of the “tandem” type satisfy this condition—engines, namely, whose high
                    and low pressure cylinders are in one line, with one piston-rod common to both
                    pistons. Engines in which the high and low pressure cylinders are placed side by
                    side, and act either on the same crank or on cranks set at 180° apart, may also
                    discharge steam directly from one to the other cylinder; the same remark applies
                    to beam engines, whether of the class in which both pistons act on one end of
                    the beam, or of the class introduced by M'Naught, in which the high and low
                    pressure cylinders stand on opposite sides of the centre. By a convenient usage
                    which is now pretty general the name “Woolf engine” is restricted to those
                    compound engines which discharge steam directly from the high to the low
                    pressure cylinders without the use of an intermediate receiver.</p>
                <p>112. An intermediate receiver becomes necessary when the phases of the pistons in
                    a compound engine do not agree. With two cranks at right angles, for example, a
                    portion of the discharge from the high-pressure cylinder occurs at a time when
                    the low-pressure cylinder cannot properly receive steam. The receiver is in some
                    cases an entirely independent vessel connected to the cylinders by pipes; very
                    often, however, a sufficient amount of receiver volume is afforded by the valve
                    casings and the steam-pipe which connects the cylinders. The receiver, when it
                    is a distinct vessel, is frequently jacketed.</p>
                <p>The use of a receiver is of course not restricted to engines in which the “Woolf”
                    system of compound working is impracticable. On the contrary, it is frequently
                    applied with advantage to beam and tandem compound engines. Communication need
                    not then be maintained between the high and low pressure cylinders during the
                    whole of the stroke; admission to the low-pressure cylinder is stopped before
                    the stroke is completed; the steam already admitted is allowed to expand
                    independently; and the remainder of the discharge from the high-pressure
                    cylinder is compressed into the intermediate receiver. Each cylinder has then a
                    definite point of cut-off, and by varying these points the distribution of work
                    between the two cylinders may be adjusted at will. In general it is desirable to
                    make both cylinders of a compound engine contribute equal quantities of work. If
                    they act on separate cranks this has the effect of giving the same value to the
                    mean twisting moment on both cranks.</p>
                <p>113. Wherever a receiver is used, care should be taken that there is no
                    unresisted expansion into it; in other words, the pressure in the receiver
                    should be equal to that in the high-pressure cylinder at the moment of release.
                    If the receiver pressure is less than this there will be what is termed a “drop”
                    in the steam pressure between the high-pressure cylinder and the receiver, which
                    will show itself in an indicator diagram by a sudden fall at the end of the
                    high-pressure expansion. This “drop” is, from the thermodynamic point of view,
                    irreversible, and therefore wasteful. It can be avoided by selecting a proper
                    point of cut-off in the low-pressure cylinder. When there is no “drop’’the
                    expansion that occurs in a compound engine has precisely the same effect in
                    doing work as the same amount of expansion in a simple engine would have,
                    provided the law of expansion be the same in both and the waste of energy which
                    occurs by the friction of ports and passages in the transfer of steam from one
                    to the other cylinder be negligible. The work done in either case depends merely
                    on the relation of pressure to volume throughout the process; and so long as
                    that relation is unchanged it is a matter of indifference whether the expansion
                    be performed in one vessel or in more than one. It has, however, been fully
                    pointed out in chap. IV. that in general a compound engine has a thermodynamic
                    advantage over a simple engine using the same pressure and the same expansion,
                    inasmuch as it reduces the exchange of heat between the working substance and
                    the cylinder walls and so makes the process of expansion more nearly adiabatic.
                    The compound engine has also a mechanical advantage which will be presently
                    described. The ultimate ratio of expansion in any compound engine is the ratio
                    of the volume of the low-pressure cylinder to the volume of steam admitted to
                    the high-pressure cylinder. Fig. 29 illustrates the combined action of the two
                    cylinders in a hypothetical compound engine of the Woolf type, in which for
                    simplicity the effect of clearance is neglected and also the loss of pressure
                    which the steam undergoes in transfer from one to the other cylinder. ABCD is
                    the indicator diagram of the high-pressure cylinder. The exhaust line CD shows a
                    falling pressure in consequence of the increase of volume which the steam is
                    then undergoing through the advance of the low-pressure piston. EFGH is the
                    diagram of the low-pressure cylinder drawn alongside of the other for
                    convenience in the construction which follows. It has no point of cut-off; its
                    admission line is the continuous curve of expansion EF, which is the same as the
                    high-pressure exhaust line CD, but drawn to a different scale of volumes. At any
                    point K, the actual volume of the steam is KL + MN. By drawing OP equal to KL +
                    MN, so that OP represents the whole volume, and repeating the same construction
                    at other points of the diagram, we may set out the curve QPR, the upper part of
                    which is identical with BC, and so complete a single diagram which exhibits the
                    equivalent expansion in a single cylinder.</p>
                <p>In a tandem compound engine of the receiver type the diagrams resemble those
                    shown in fig. 30. During CD (which corresponds to FG) expansion is taking place
                    into the large or low-pressure cylinder. D and G mark the point of cut-off in
                    the large cylinder, after which GH shows the independent expansion of the steam
                    now shut within the large cylinder, and DE shows the compression of steam by
                    continued discharge from the small cylinder into the receiver. At the end of the
                    stroke the receiver pressure is OE, and this must be the same as the pressure at
                    C, if there is to be no “drop.” Diagrams of a similar kind may be sketched
                    without difficulty for the case of a receiver engine with any assigned phase
                    relation between the pistons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An intermediate receiver lias the thermodynamic advantage
                    that it reduces the range of temperature in the high-pressure cylinder, and so
                    helps to prevent initial condensation of the steam. This will he made obvious by
                    a comparison of fig. 29 and fig. 30. The lowest temperature reached in the
                    high-pressure cylinder is that corresponding to the pressure at D, and is
                    materially higher in fig. 30 than in fig. 29.</p></note></p>
                <p>114. By making the cut-off take place earlier in the large cylinder we increase
                    the mean pressure in the receiver; the work done in the small cylinder is
                    consequently diminished. The work done in the large cylinder is correspondingly
                    increased, for the total work (depending as it does on the initial pressure and
                    the total ratio of expansion) is unaffected by the change. The same adjustment
                    serves, in case there is “drop,” to remove it. By selecting a suitable ratio of
                    cylinder volumes to one another and to the volume of the receiver, and also by
                    choosing a proper point for the low-pressure cut-off, it is possible to secure
                    absence of drop along with equality in the division of the work between the two
                    cylinders.</p>
                <p>To determine that point of cut-off in the low-pressure cylinder which will
                    prevent drop when the ratio of cylinder and receiver volumes is assigned is a
                    problem most easily solved by a graphic process. The process consists in drawing
                    the curve of pressure during admission to the low-pressure cylinder until it
                    meets the curve of expansion which is common to both cylinders.<note

                    (where for the sake of simplicity the effects of clearance are neglected) AB
                    represents the admission line and BC the expansion line in the small cylinder.
                    Release occurs at C, and from C to D steam is being taken by the large
                    cylinder.</p>
                <p>D corresponds to the cutoff in the large cylinder, which is the point to be
                    found. From D to E steam is being compressed into the receiver. To avoid drop
                    the receiver pressure at E is to be the same as the pressure at C. E is
                    therefore known, and may be employed as the starting-point in drawing a curve EF
                    which is the admission line of the low-pressure diagram EFGHI. This line is
                    drawn by considering at each point in the low-pressure piston’s stroke what is
                    then the whole volume of the steam. The place at which EF intersects the
                    continuous expansion curve BCG determines the proper point of cut-off. The
                    sketch (fig. 31) refers to the case of a tandem receiver engine; but the process
                    may also be applied to an engine with any assumed phase relation between the
                    cranks. Fig. 32 shows a pair of theoretical indicator diagrams determined in the
                    same way for an engine with cranks at right angles, the high-pressure crank
                    leading. In using the graphic method any form may be assigned to the curve of
                    expansion. Generally this curve may be treated without serious inaccuracy as a
                    common hyperbola, in which the pressure varies inversely as the volume.</p>
                <p>115. If this simple relation between pressure and volume be assumed, it is
                    practicable to find algebraically the low-pressure cutoff which will give no
                    drop, with assigned ratios of cylinder and<pb break="no"

                    of a tandem engine, or of an engine with parallel cylinders whose pistons move
                    together or in opposition—we may proceed thus. Since the point of cut-off to be
                    determined depends on volume ratios we may for brevity treat the volume of the
                    small cylinder as unity. Let R be the ratio to it of the receiver’s volume, and
                    L that of the low-pressure cylinder. Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the
                    required fraction of the stroke at which cut-off is to occur in the large
                    cylinder; and let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the pressure at release from the
                    small cylinder. As there is to be no drop, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is also the

                <p>In some compound engines a pair of high-pressure cylinders discharge into a
                    common receiver; in some a pair of low-pressure cylinders are fed from a
                    receiver which takes steam from one high-pressure cylinder, or in some instances
                    from two. With these arrangements the pressure in the receiver may be kept much
                    more nearly constant than is possible with the ordinary two-cylinder type.</p>
                <p>116. An important mechanical advantage belongs to the compound engine in the fact
                    that it avoids the extreme thrust and pull which would have to be borne by the
                    piston-rod of a single-cylinder engine working at the same power with the same
                    initial pressure and the same ratio of expansion. If all the expansion took
                    place in the low-pressure cylinder, the piston at the beginning of the stroke
                    would be exposed to a thrust much greater than the sum of the thrusts on the two
                    pistons of a compound engine in which a fair proportion of the expansion is
                    performed in the small cylinder. Thus in the tandem engine of fig. 29 the
                    greatest sum of the thrusts will be found to amount to less than two-thirds of
                    the thrust which the large piston would be subjected to if the engine were
                    simple. The mean thrust throughout the stroke is of course not affected by
                    compounding; only the range of variation in the thrust is reduced. The effort on
                    the crank-pin is consequently made more uniform, the strength of the parts may
                    be reduced, and the friction at slides and journals is lessened. The advantage
                    in this respect is obviously much greater when the cylinders are placed side by
                    side, instead of tandem, and work on cranks at right angles. As a set-off to its
                    advantage in giving a more uniform effort, the compound engine has the drawback
                    of requiring more working parts than a simple engine with one cylinder. But in
                    many instances—as in marine engines—two cranks and two cylinders are almost
                    indispensable, to give a tolerably uniform effort and to get over the dead
                    points; and the comparison should then be made between a pair of simple
                    cylinders and a pair of compounded cylinders. Another point in favour of the
                    compound engine is that, although the whole ratio of expansion is great, there
                    need not be a very early cut-off in either cylinder; hence the common
                    slide-valve, which is unsuited to give an early cut-off, may be used in place of
                    a more complex arrangement. The mechanical advantage of the compound engine has
                    long been recognized, and had much to do with its adoption in the early days of
                    high-pressure steam.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>117. Indicator diagrams taken from compound engines show that the transfer of
                    steam from one cylinder to another is never, under the most favourable
                    conditions, performed without loss of energy. Fig. 33 shows a pair of diagrams
                    from the two cylinders of a tandem Woolf engine, in which the steam passed as
                    directly as possible from the small to the large cylinder. The diagrams are
                    drawn to the same scale of <hi rend="italic">stroke</hi> and therefore to
                    different scales of <hi rend="italic">volume,</hi> and the low-pressure diagram
                    is turned round so that it may fit into the high-pressure diagram. There is some
                    drop at the high-pressure release, and, apart from this, there is a loss through
                    friction of the passages, which shows itself by the admission line to the large
                    cylinder lying below the exhaust line from the small one.</p>
                <p>118. Fig. 31 is a pair of diagrams taken from a compound tandem receiver engine
                    running at 50 revolutions per minute, with cylinders 30 inches and 52 inches in
                    diameter, and with a 6-feet stroke. The ratio of cylinder volumes is therefore 3
                    to 1. The capacity of the receiver is nearly 1½ times that of the small
                    cylinder. There is a comparatively early cut-off in both cylinders, and a nearly
                    complete absence of drop.</p>
                <p>The small cylinder, however, does more work than the large one, in the ratio of
                    nearly 3 to 2.</p>
                <p>Fig. 35 shows the same pair of diagrams combined by drawing both to the same
                    scale of volume and of pressure, and by setting out each by an amount equal to
                    the clearance space from the line of no volume. This makes the expansion curve
                    in each diagram represent correctly the relation of the pressure to the absolute
                    volume of the expanding steam. The broken line is a continuous curve of <hi
                    rend="italic">adiabatic</hi> expansion, drawn from the point of high-pressure
                    cut-off, on the assumption that the steam then contained about 25 per cent. of
                    condensed water. If the expansion were actually adiabatic, and if there were no
                    loss in the transfer of the steam, the expansion curves for both cylinders would
                    fall into this line.</p>
                <p>119. Fig. 36 exhibits, in the same manner as fig. 35, a set of diagrams taken by
                    Mr Kirk from the triple expansion engines of the S.S. “Aberdeen.” Each diagram
                    is set out from the line of no volume by a distance which represents the
                    clearance in the corresponding cylinder. The boiler pressure is 125 lb per
                    square inch. The cylinders are 32 inches, 46 inches, and 70 inches in diameter,
                    and the stroke is 4½ feet. The cranks make 120° with each other. The means of
                    the diagrams for the two ends of each cylinder have been used in drawing this
                    and the next figure, a practice which should be followed in drawing combined
                    diagrams of the kind here ex emplified.</p>
                <p>120. Fig. 37</p>
                <p>shows in the same way a set of diagrams taken by Mr Brock from the <hi
                    rend="italic">quadruple</hi> expansion engines of the S.S. “Lohara” (by Messrs
                    Denny &amp; Co.). Here the boiler pressure was 154 lb by gauge, or 169 lb
                    absolute, the cylinders were 24 inches, 34inches, 48 inches, and 68 inches in
                    diameter, the stroke was 4 feet, and the number of revolutions</p>
                <p>65 per minute.</p>
                <p>121. In all of these cases a continuous curve, shown by a broken line, has been
                    drawn to represent the result of adiabatic expansion, on the same assumption as
                    before—that the steam contains about 25 per cent. of water at the point of
                    cut-off in the<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n519/mode/1up"

                    then be taken as PV <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    9</hi> = constant (§ 67). In the absence of data regarding the wetness of the
                    steam this assumption may be considered fair.</p>
                <p>122. Lastly, fig. 38 shows a pair of diagrams, treated in the same manner, for a
                    two-cylinder compound engine with cranks at right angles to each other, the
                    high-pressure crank being 90° in advance. During the back stroke of the
                    high-pressure piston there is at first compression into the receiver until the
                    large cylinder opens; the high-pressure diagram consequently takes a peculiar
                    form, which should be compared with the diagram already given for a tandem
                    engine (§ 118). In this example there is a considerable amount of drop and also
                    of loss between the two cylinders.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Production of Steam.—Boilers.</hi></p>
                <p>123. The first step in the production of steam is to convert the potential energy
                    of fuel into actual heat; the second step is to transfer the heat to water in
                    the boiler. The efficiency of furnace and boiler is the ratio which the amount
                    of heat taken up by the water bears to the whole potential energy of the fuel.
                    In good boilers this efficiency is about 0·7. The loss is due partly to
                    incomplete combustion of the fuel and partly to incomplete transfer of heat from
                    the products of combustion to the boiler water. Under the first head may be
                    classed—(1) waste of fuel in the solid state by bad stoking, and (2) waste of
                    fuel in the gaseous and smoky states by imperfect combustion. Under the second
                    head are comprised—(1) waste by external radiation and conduction, and (2) waste
                    by heat contained in the hot gases which escape by the chimney, due <hi
                    rend="italic">(a)</hi> to their still high temperature and (<hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>) to the fact that they contain as one of the products of combustion
                    steam-gas which passes away uncondensed. Loss of heat by the hot gases is the
                    most important source of waste. Not only are the actual products of combustion
                    rejected at a high temperature, but along with them goes the nitrogen of the air
                    whose oxygen has been used, and also a quantity of additional air which is
                    needed to dilute the products in order that combustion may be fairly complete.
                    Roughly speaking, about 12 lb of air are required to supply oxygen enough for
                    the combustion of 1 lb of coal. Over and above this quantity, about 12 lb more
                    generally pass through the furnace as air of dilution. In furnaces with forced
                    draught, in which the consumption of coal per square foot of grate surface is
                    much more rapid, the air of dilution may be reduced to half or less than half of
                    this quantity, though to some extent at the expense of completeness in the
                    combustion.</p>
                <p>124. The extent to which heat is taken from the hot gases depends on the <hi
                    rend="italic">heating surface</hi> through which heat passes into the water. The
                    heating surface is made up of the surface of the furnace or combustion-chamber,
                    so far as that is brought into contact with the water, and of the flues or tubes
                    through which the hot gases pass on their way to the chimney. Its efficiency
                    depends on the conductivity of the metal, on the difference in temperature
                    between the gases on one side and the water on the other, and on the freedom
                    with which steam, when formed, can escape from the surface. Differences in
                    specific conductivity and in thickness of metal affect the result less than
                    might be expected, on account of the resistance which is offered to the passage
                    of heat through the film of scale and also through the film of water vapour
                    which forms on the metallic surface.</p>
                <p>By extending the heating surface sufficiently the hot gases may be deprived of
                    heat to an extent which is only limited by the temperature of the boiler water.
                    This temperature, however, need not form a limit, for after leaving the boiler
                    the gases may be further cooled by being brought into contact with a vessel
                    termed a feed-water heater, through whieh the feed-water passes on its way to
                    the boiler. Even with a feed-water heater, however, the temperature of the hot
                    gases is never, in practice, reduced so low as that of the boiler.</p>
                <p>125. In nearly all land engines and most marine engines the draught is produced
                    by means of a chimney, which acts in virtue of the column of air within it being
                    specifically lighter than the air outside, so that the pressure within the
                    chimney at its base is less than the atmospheric pressure at the same level
                    outside. The composition of tire chimney gases is such that they are heavier
                    than air at the same temperature, and to make them sufficiently lighter to cause
                    a draught they must retain a certain considerable portion of their heat. On the
                    other hand, if they are left too hot the mass of air drawn through the furnace
                    is actually diminished, since then the chimney gases are so much expanded that
                    the increased volume of the draught does not compensate for its diminished
                    density. With a given chimney and furnace the maximum draught is obtained when
                    the gases escape at a temperature about that of melting lead; by making the
                    chimney more capacious a lower temperature will suffice to give the same
                    draught, and this will of course increase the efficiency of the boiler.</p>
                <p>126. In place of using a chimney draught depending merely on the temperature of
                    the rejected hot gases, the air required for combustion and dilution may be
                    forced through the furnace either by producing a partial vacuum in the chimney
                    or by supplying air to the grate at a pressure higher than that of the
                    atmosphere. In locomotives, for example, a partial vacuum is produced in the
                    chimney by means of a blast of exhaust steam from the engine; aud in many naval
                    and a few mercantile steamers a forced draught is produced by having a closed
                    stokehole or a closed ashpit, whieh is supplied with air at a pressure above
                    that of the atmosphere by the use of a blowing fan.</p>
                <p>If heat were thoroughly extracted from the products of combustion, a forced
                    draught would be more efficient, from the thermodynamic point of view, than a
                    chimney draught, for a chimney is in fact an extremely inefficient heat-engine,
                    and requires a very large amount of heat to be expended in order to effect the
                    comparatively trifling work of maintaining the draught. But where forced draught
                    has been substituted for chimney draught this has hitherto been done for the
                    purpose of increasing not the efficiency but the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> of
                    boilers. The motive has been to burn more coal per square foot of grate surface
                    and so to evaporate more water with a boiler of given weight. This is
                    incompatible with very high efficiency. When more coal is burnt by forcing the
                    draught it is true that the products of combustion have a higher temperature
                    (since less air is required for dilution) and the effectiveness of the heating
                    surface is therefore increased. But the heating surface has more hot gas to deal
                    with, and the result is that the boiler is less efficient than when the draught
                    is not forced. The same efficiency could be secured, with forced draught, by
                    increasing the heating surface to a sufficient extent; and a still greater
                    efficiency could be realized if the heating surface were still further enlarged
                    so that the gases left the flues at a temperature lower than would be needful if
                    the draught depended on the lightness of the chimney’s contents. The most
                    efficient boiler would be one in which the draught was forced by mechanical
                    means, and the gases were then cooled as far as possible by contact with a very
                    extensive heating surface, first in the boiler itself and then in a feed-water
                    heater. None of the forced draught boilers that have hitherto been introduced
                    have a heating surface so large as to make them more efficient than good
                    chimney-draught boilers (in which the rate of combustion is much slower),
                    although the heating surface bears a much larger ratio to the grate area than is
                    usual with chimney draughts.</p>
                <p>127. Most modern boilers are internally fired; that is to say, the furnaces are
                    more or less completely enclosed within the boiler. Externally fired boilers are
                    for the most part much less efficient than internally fired boilers; they are,
                    however, used to a considerable extent where fuel is specially cheap or where
                    the waste heat of other furnaces is to be utilized. Their usual form is that of
                    a horizontal cylinder with convex ends; the strength both of the main shell and
                    the ends is derived from their curvature, and no staying is necessary. The
                    heating surface is entirely external and is of very limited extent.</p>
                <p>In large stationary boilers the forms known as the “Lancashire” (or double flue)
                    and the “Cornish” (or single flue) are most common.</p>
                <p>Figs. 39 and</p>

                <p>In the Cornish boiler there is one internal flue, at the front end of which is
                    the furnace. The hot gases pass through the flue to the back; they then return
                    to the front end by two external side flues<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0520-0497"/> (A, A, fig. 40), and finally pass to the back
                    again by an underneath flue B. The arrangement in the Lancashire boiler is the
                    same, except that there are two internal flues, each with its own furnace. The
                    shell is made up of rings of riveted plates, larger and smaller in diameter
                    alternately to allow the circumferen tial seams to be made without bending the
                    edges. The flue is made up of a series of welded rings, joined to each other by
                    a flanged joint with a stiffening ring. This form of joint was in troduced by Mr
                    Adam son to stiffen the flue against collapse un der external pressure.</p>
                <p>Other joints, designed with the same object, are shown in figs. 42</p>
                <p>and 43. The grate is made up of firebars, sloping down towards the back, where
                    they terminate at the “bridge” of fire-brick (C, fig. 39). Beyond the bridge the
                    flue is crossed by a number of tapered “Galloway” tubes D, D, which increase the
                    heating surface, promote circulation of the water, and stiffen the flue. The end
                    plates are strengthened by gusset stays</p>
                <p>E, E, riveted to them and to the circumference of the shell by means of
                    angle-irons. The gusset-stays do not extend so far in as to the circumference of
                    the flue (fig. 40), in order that the end plates may retain enough flexibility
                    to allow the flue to expand aud contract under change of temperature. To provide
                    for unequal expansion is one of the most important points in the design of
                    boilers; when it is neglected the boiler is subjected to a racking action which
                    induces leakage at joints and tends to rupture the plates. For this reason the
                    flue is attached to the boiler shell at the ends only, so that it may be free to
                    take an upward camber in consequence of the greater heating of the upper
                    side.</p>
                <p>Mild steel is now very generally used for boiler plates, being superior even to
                    the best Yorkshire iron in the qualities of ductility and tensile strength. The
                    following particulars refer to the Lancashire boiler of fig. 41, which may be
                    taken as representative of a large number of stationary boilers.</p>
                <p>128. The shell is 28 feet long and 7 feet in diameter, and is made up of 9 rings,
                    each of two semi-cylindrical plates. The shell plates are <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> inch thick; their edges are planed and
                    fullered, and the rivet holes are drilled. The longitudinal seams, which break
                    joint from ring to ring, are lap-joints double-riveted; the circular seams are
                    single-riveted. Each end plate is a solid piece of steel ⅜ inch thick; the front
                    plate is attached to the shell by riveting to an angle ring; the back plate is
                    flanged. The flues are each 2 feet 9½</p>
                <p>inches in diameter, made up of rings of steel <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> inch thick; the longitudinal joints are welded and
                    the circular joints are flanged and strengthened with stiffening rings. The
                    flues are tapered somewhat at the back end to facilitate expansion, and are
                    attached to the end plates by welded angle-rings. Each flue contains 5 Gallo way
                    tubes, tapering from 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /2 inches diameter at top
                    to 5½ inches at bottom. On the top of the boiler is the manhole, covered with a
                    cast-iron plate; also a nozzle for the steam-pipe and two others for
                    safety-valves. One of the safety-valves is connected with a float so that it
                    opens if the water-level becomes too low. At the bottom, in front, is another
                    nozzle for the blow-out tap; and in the front plate below the flues is another
                    manhole. Feed-water is supplied by a pipe which enters through the front plate
                    on one side, near the top of the water, and extends for a considerable dis tance
                    along the boiler, distributing the water by holes throughout the length. A pipe
                    at the same level on the other side serves to collect scum. The fire doors are
                    provided with sliding shutters by means of which the amount of air admitted
                    above the fire may be regulated. On the top of each fur nace is fitted a fusible
                    plug which melts if the furnace crown becomes overheated. No separate steam dome
                    is used; the steam is collected by an "anti-priming” pipe shown in fig. 44,
                    which also illustrates the stop-</p>
                <p>valve by which the delivery of steam from the boiler is started or stopped at
                    will. On the front plate are a pair of glass gauge-</p>
                <p>tubes for showing the water-level, and a Bourdon pres sure-gauge. This last
                    important fit ting consists of a bent tube of oval section, one end of which is
                    closed and free to move while the other is open to the steam and is fixed. The
                    pres sure within the tube tends to straighten it, and the extent to which this
                    takes place is shown by a pointer which travels over a circular dial. A common
                    lever safety-valve is shown in fig. 45. In other forms the valve is kept down by
                    a weight directly applied to it, or by means of springs. Spring safety-valves
                    are liable to the objection that when the valve opens the load on it increases;
                    to remedy this, forms have been proposed in which the spring acts through a bent
                    lever in such a way that when the strain on it increases the leverage at which
                    it acts is re duced. If the spring is of reasonable length, however, the
                    objection is not seri ous.</p>
                <p>129. A modification of the Lancashire type — the “Galloway” boiler — is shown in
                    sectional elevation in fig. 46. In it the two flues are joined beyond the bridge
                    into a single flue, of the form shown in the figure, which is traversed by
                    numerous Galloway tubes and is also fitted with water-pockets at its sides.</p>
                <p>130. In other types of boiler an extensive heating surface is obtained by the use
                    of a large number of small tubes through which the hot gases pass. This
                    construction is universal in locomotive and marine boilers. It is applied in
                    some instances to boilers of the ordinary cylindrical form by making small tubes
                    take the place of that part of the flue or flues which lies behind the bridge,
                    or by using small tubes as channels through which the gases return from back to
                    front after passing through the main flue. Another form of tubular boiler is an
                    externally fired horizontal cylinder fitted with tubes which carry the hot gases
                    from the back to the front.<pb break="no"

                    connexion with small engines. Examples are shown in figs. 47-49. Fig. 48 is an
                    ordinary vertical boiler filled with cross tubes of the Galloway type. Fig.</p>
                <p>47 (by Messrs Davey, Paxman, &amp; Co.) is a boiler with curved water tubes, each
                    of which has fitted in the top a loose cap whose function is to deflect the
                    stream of water which circulates up the tubes. Fig. 49 is a form of multitubular
                    boiler by the same makers, in which the hot gases escape at the side after
                    passing from the smoke-box through horizontal tubes grouped in circular arcs. In
                    all these boilers the grate is at the foot, and the fire-door is at a mouthpiece
                    in the side of the boiler near the base. In other forms of vertical boiler the
                    heating surface is increased by water tubes (fig. 50) which hang from the crown
                    of the fire-box, closed at the lower end but fitted internally with smaller
                    tubes which are open at the bottom. Water circulates down the inner tubes and up
                    between them and the outer. Tubes of this kind (called Field tubes) are used in
                    fire-engine boilers and in other cases where it is necessary to get up steam
                    with the least possible delay. Vertical boilers of large size are sometimes used
                    for utilizing the waste heat of iron furnaces.</p>
                <p>132. A great variety of boilers have been designed in which the firing is
                    external, and the water space consists of groups of tubes or other small
                    sections whose outer surface is exposed to heat. Boilers of this type are called
                    sectional or tubulous boilers, in distinction to tubular boilers, or boilers
                    with tubes in which the hot gases circulate. A successful example of the
                    tubulous or sectional type is the Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boiler, which
                    consists of a series of in-</p>
                <p>on the inside of the shell plates. A sloping bridge of fire-brick partially
                    separates the upper part of the fire-box from the lower and prevents the flame
                    from striking the tubes too directly. Under the grate is an ashpan, to whieh the
                    supply of air is regulated by a damper in front. The fire-door opens inwards,
                    and can be set more or less open, to regulate the amount of air admitted above
                    the fire. On top of the barrel is a steam-dome, from which tho steam supply is
                    taken through a pipe S traversing the forward part of the steam space and
                    passing down to the valve-chest through the smoke-box. The stop-valve or
                    “regulator” R is situated in tho smoke-box, and is worked by a rod through the
                    boiler from tho cab at the back. Above the fire-box end of the shell are a pair
                    of Ramsbottom safety-valves, V, V—two valves pressed down by a single spring
                    attached to the middle of a cross bar, which is prolonged to form a hand lever
                    by which the valves may be lifted. In front of the forward tube-plate is the
                    smoke-box, containing the blast-pipe B by which the exhaust steam is used to
                    produce a partial vacuum and so force a draught through the furnace.</p>
                <p>134. Instead of stiffening the fire-box roof by the use of girder stays, the plan
                    is sometimes followed of staying it directly to tho shell above. The outer shell
                    above the fire-box is generally cylindrical; but to facilitate this method of
                    staying it is sometimes made flat. This construction is not unusual in American
                    locomotive boilers, another feature of which is that the grate is made clined
                    welded tubes up which water circulates. These are joined at their ends by
                    cast-iron connecting boxes to one another and to a horizontal drum on the top in
                    which the mixture of steam and water which rises from the tube undergoes
                    separation. At the lowest point of the boiler is another drum for tho collection
                    of sediment. Root’s boiler is another in which water is heated by circulating
                    through inclined tubes exposed to the fire; it differs from the above form
                    chiefly in having the water-level below the top of the tube. Harrison’s boiler
                    is a group of small globular vessels of cast-iron strung like beads on rods
                    which tie them together. Sectional boilers may be constructed without difficulty
                    to bear pressures greatly in excess of those for which other types are suited.
                    Mr Perkins has employed a tubulous boiler to deliver steam at a pressure of 500
                    lb per square inch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    arranged as a dome over the fire. Feedwater is pumped slowly through the coil,
                    and turns to steam before it reaches the end.</p>
                <p>133. The locomotive boiler consists of a nearly rectangular firebox, enclosed
                    above and on the sides by water, and a cylindrical part called the barrel
                    extending horizontally from the fire-box to the front part of the locomotive and
                    filled with numerous tubes. Figs. 51 and 52 show in longitudinal and transverse
                    section a boiler of the London and North Western Railway, which may be taken as
                    typical of modern English practice.</p>
                <p>The barrel is 10 feet long and a little more than 4 feet in diameter, and is made
                    up of three rings of steel plates, <hi rend="superscript"> 13</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 32</hi> inch thick, arranged telescopically. It contains 198
                    brass tubes, each 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> /8 inches in external
                    diameter. The front tube-plate in which the tubes terminate is of steel 3/ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> inch thick; it is stayed to the back tube-plate by the
                    tubes themselves, and the upper part of the front tube-plate is also tied by
                    longitudinal rods to the back end-plate. The fire-box is of copper ½ inch thick.
                    It is nearly rectangular, with a horizontal grate. (A grate sloping down in
                    front is often preferred.) Round its sides, front, and back (except where the
                    fire-door interrupts) is a water space about 3 inches wido, which narrows
                    slightly towards the bottom. The flat sides of the fire-box are tied to the flat
                    sides of the shell by copper stay-bolts, 4 inches apart, which are secured by
                    screwing them into both plates and riveting over the ends. The roof of the
                    fire-box is stiffened by a number of girders on the top, to which the plates are
                    secured by short bolts. The girders are themselves hung from the top of tho
                    shell above them by slings which are secured to angle-irons riveted much larger
                    than in English practice, for the purpose of burning anthracite coal. An extreme
                    instance is furnished by the Wooton engines of tho Philadelphia and Reading
                    Railroad, which burn small coal of poor quality in a fire-box 9⅜ feet long by 8
                    feet wide, extending over the trailing wheels of the engine. In some cases the
                    fire-box is divided by a sloping partition of plates with water between, which
                    crosses tho fire-box diagonally from front to back and has in its centre an
                    opening resembling a fire-door mouthpiece to allow the products of combustion to
                    pass. In others the fire-bridge is supported by water tubes, and water tubes are
                    also used as grate-bars. This is done rather to promote circulation of the water
                    than to give heating surface. The practice of American and English locomotive
                    engineers differs widely as regards the materials of construction. American
                    shells are of mild steel, English shells gene-<pb break="no"

                    English practice the fire-boxes are of copper and the tubes of brass; in America
                    the fire-boxes are of mild steel and the tubes of wrought-iron.<note

                <p>The locomotive type of boiler is used for stationary engines of the portable,
                    semi-portable, and semi fixed types, and also to a limited extent for marine
                    engines in cases were lightness is of special advantage.</p>
                <p>135. So long as marine engines used steam of a pressure less than about 35 lb per
                    square inch the marine boiler was generally a chambers, and return tubes above
                    the flues. In one variety, called the double-ended boiler, there are furnaces at
                    both ends of the shell, each pair leading to a combustion-chamber in the centre
                    that is common to both, or to separate central chambers with a water space
                    between them.</p>
                <p>Figs. 53 and 54 show with some completeness a double-ended marine boiler of the
                    most modern construction for high-pressure steam. At each end there are three
                    furnaces in flues made of welded corrugated steel plates. The use of corrugated
                    plates for flues, introduced by Mr Fox, makes thin flues able to resist
                    collapse, and allows the flues to accommodate themselves easily to changes of
                    temperature. One combustion-chamber is common to each pair of furnaces. It is
                    strengthened on the top by girder stays and on the sides by stay-bolts to the
                    neighbouring chamber and to the shell. The tubes are of iron, and a certain
                    number of them are fitted with nuts so that they serve as stays between the
                    tube-plate of the combustion-chamber and the front of the boiler. The upper part
                    of the front plate is tied to the opposite end of the boiler by long stays. The
                    uptakes from both ends converge to the funnel base above the centre of the
                    boiler’s length. The boiler shown is one of a pair, which lie side by side in
                    the vessel, the uptake at each end being common to both. Each boiler has a
                    steam-dome, from which the steam-pipe leads to the engine; this consists of a
                    small cylindrical vessel, with flat ends tied together by a central stay. Short
                    pipes connect the dome near each end with the steam space of the main shell. The
                    boilers of figs. 53 and 54, which are by Messrs Gourlay Brothers of Dundee, work
                    at a pressure of 165 lb per square inch above the atmosphere, and are used with
                    triple expansion engines. The shell is 12¼ feet in diameter, and 16½ feet long.
                    The plates are of mild steel 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> inches thick round the shell and 1 inch in the ends.

                    inch thick, and the corrugated flues ½ inch. The longitudinal seams are
                    treble-riveted, with inside and outside covering plates. The circumferential
                    seams are lap-joints double-riveted. There are 127 tubes at each end, 46 of
                    which are stay-tubes. The tubes are of iron, 3½ inches in external diameter.
                    Above these are 18 longitudinal steel box with flat sides, elaborately stayed,
                    with a row of internal furnaces near the bottom opening into a spacious
                    combustion-chamber enclosed within the boiler at the back, and a set of return
                    tubes leading from the upper part of the chamber to the front of the boiler,
                    where the products of combustion entered the uptake and passed off to the
                    funnel. The use of higher pressures has made this form entirely obsolete. The
                    normal marine boiler is now a short circular horizontal cylinder of steel with
                    flat ends, with internal furnaces in cylindrical flues, internal combustion-</p>
                <p>stays 2¾ inches in diameter. The steam-dome is a cylinder 2⅜ feet in diameter and
                    8 feet long, stayed by a central 3½-inch rod of steel. The short fire-box stays
                    are also of steel 1½ inches in diameter, of 7¾ inches pitch, and are secured by
                    nuts and washers at both ends. The central combustion-chamber has a round and
                    unstayed roof.</p>
                <p>The top of each side combustion - chamber is stayed by three steel girders 8 <hi

                    is an oval, with round top and bottom and flat sides. The combustion-chambers
                    are sometimes made with rounded tops, which are tied to the back plate by
                    gusset-stays and angle-irons. In naval practice the tubes are frequently of
                    Muntz metal in place of iron. Another form of boiler, used to a considerable
                    Navy extent in the British navy, is a long horizontal cylinder with two type.<pb

                    combustion-chamber about the middle of the length. From this a set of tubes

                    uptake is situated.</p>

                    Mr Thornycroft aud others, especially for torpedo boats. This form gives much
                    greater heating surface than others in proportion to its weight, and allows,
                    especially when worked with forced draught, a large amount of power to be got
                    from a small boiler. It is probable that, if any further rise is to occur in the
                    steam pressure used in marine engines, comparable to that which has occurred
                    during the last two or three years, the present normal marine boiler will give
                    place to a form more nearly resembling the locomotive type.</p>
                <p>137. Boilers are usually fed either by a feed-pump driven by the engine, or by a
                    distinct auxiliary engine called a “donkey,” or by an injector. The <hi
                    rend="italic">injector,</hi> invented by the late M. Giffard, and now very
                    generally used on locomotive and other boilers, is illustrated in fig. 56. Steam
                    enters from the boiler at A and blows through an annular orifice B, the size of
                    which is regulated by the handle C. The feed-water flows in at D, and meeting
                    the steam at B causes it to condense.</p>
                <p>This produces a vacuum at B, and consequently the water rushes in with great
                    velocity, and streams down through the combining nozzle I, its velocity being
                    augmented by the im pact of steam on the back of the column. In the lower part
                    of the nozzle E the stream expands; it there fore loses velocity, and, by a
                    well-</p>
                <p>known hydrodynamic principle, gains pressure, until at the bottom its pres sure
                    is so great that it enters the boiler through a check-valve which opens only in
                    the direction of the stream.</p>
                <p>The escape orifice F and the overflow pipe G allow the injector to start into
                    action, by providing a channel through which steam and water may escape be fore
                    the stream acquires enough energy to force its way into the boiler. The opening
                    for admitting water between</p>
                <p>D and B is regulated by the wheel H.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">exhaust-steam injector</hi> works by steam from the exhaust
                    of non-con densing engines, instead of boiler steam. The steam orifice is then
                    larger in proportion to the other parts, and the steam supply more liberal. In
                    <hi rend="italic">self-starting injectors</hi> an arrangement is provided by
                    which overflow will take place freely until the injector starts into action and
                    then the openings are automatically adjusted to suit delivery into the boiler.
                    One plan of doing this is to make the combining nozzle under the steam orifice
                    in a piece which is free to slide in the outer casing. Until the injector starts
                    it lies at some distance from the steam orifice, and allows free overflow; but
                    when the vacuum forms it rises, in consequence of pressure at the base. In
                    self-adjusting injectors this rise of the combining nozzle is made use of to
                    contract the water-way round the steam orifice. In another form of self-starting
                    injector one side of the combining nozzle is in the form of a hinged flap,
                    opening backwards to allow overflow, but closing up when a vacuum is formed and
                    the injector starts into action.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    large marine boilers is another apparatus in which the principle of the injector
                    is made use of, with the object of promoting circulation of the water during the
                    time steam is being raised. It consists of a series of nozzles, with
                    water-inlets between them, through which water is drawn by means of a central
                    jet of steam supplied from a donkey boiler.</p>
                <p>138. In stationary engine boilers the feed-water is frequently heated by the
                    products of combustion before these reach the chimney, in what is virtually an
                    extension of the boiler itself. Green’s economizer is a contrivance for this
                    purpose, in which the water passes through tubes whose outer surface is exposed
                    to the hot gases and kept clear of deposited soot by the continuous action of a
                    mechanical scraper. In locomotives and other non-condensing engines a portion of
                    the exhaust steam is frequently made use of to heat the feed-water. When an
                    exhaust-steam injector is employed it serves the purpose of a feed-water heater
                    as well as that of a feed-pump. Besides increasing the efficiency of the boiler
                    by utilizing what would otherwise be waste heat, a feed-water heater has the
                    advantage that by raising the temperature of the water it removes air, and also,
                    in the case of hard water, causes lime and other substances held in solution to
                    be deposited in the heater instead of being carried into the boiler, where they
                    would form scale. In Weir’s feed-heater for marine engines the temperature of
                    the feed-water is raised to about 200° Fahr. by injecting steam from the
                    intermediate receiver.</p>
                <p>139. In stationary and marine boilers the steam, after leaving the boiler, is
                    frequently taken through a <hi rend="italic">separator,</hi> the function of
                    which is to separate the dry steam from particles of water held in suspension.
                    Steam is led round a sharp corner, and the water particles thrown off by
                    centrifugal force collect in a <hi rend="italic">trap</hi> below, from which
                    they are discharged by a pipe which is kept open so long as the trap contains
                    water, but is closed by a valve at the foot when the trap is empty. Traps are
                    also fitted in many cases to steam-pipes for the purpose of returning condensed
                    water to the boiler.</p>
                <p>140. To prevent corrosion in boilers it is very usual to introduce blocks of zinc
                    in metallic connexion with the shell. These are set in the water space,
                    preferably at places where corrosion has been found specially liable to occur.
                    Their function is to set up a galvanic action, in which zinc plays the part of
                    the negative element, and is dissolved while the metal of the shell is kept
                    electro-positive. Otherwise there would be a tendency for difference of electric
                    quality between different parts of the shell to set up galvanic actions between
                    the parts themselves, by which some parts, being negative to others, would be
                    attacked. The zinc raises the potential of the whole shell enough to make all
                    parts positive.</p>
                <p>141. Allusion has already been made to the system which is universal in
                    locomotive boilers of forcing the draught by a blast of exhaust steam in the
                    chimney. A jet of boiler steam is occasionally used in marine furnaces for the
                    same purpose; but of late years the system which has found most favour is to box
                    in the stokehole and keep the air in it at a pressure of from 1 to 3 inches of
                    water by the use of blowing fans. This system has been applied largely in naval
                    practice, with the result that the power of the boiler is increased in the ratio
                    of about 3 to 2, or even more, as compared with its power under chimney draught.
                    The efficiency of the boiler is, in general, slightly but not very materially
                    reduced. An ordinary marine boiler bums 16 to 20lb of coal per hour per square
                    foot of grate with natural draught, and 30 lb or more with forced draught. In
                    torpedo-boat boilers of the locomotive type the consumption has in some cases
                    been forced to more than 100 lb.</p>
                <p>In Mr Howden’s system of forced draught the stokehole is open, and air is
                    supplied by a blowing fan to a reservoir formed by enclosing the ashpit and also
                    to another reservoir from which it gets access to the grate above and through
                    the fire-door. On its way to the reservoir the air is heated by passing across a
                    part of the uptake in which the hot gases from the furnace are led through
                    tubes. This method of restoring to the furnace what would otherwise be waste
                    heat forms an interesting alternative to the method of restoring heat to the
                    boiler by passing the hot gases through a feed-water heater; it is in fact an
                    application to boiler furnaces of the regenerative principle alluded to in chap.
                    II.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The methods and

                <p>142. Many appliances have been devised for the mechanical supply of coal to
                    boiler furnaces, but these have hitherto taken the place of hand-firing to only
                    a very limited extent. In Juckes’s furnace the fire-bars are in short lengths,
                    jointed by pins to form a continuous chain or web, which rests on rollers and is
                    caused to travel slowly in the direction of the furnace’s length by pin-wheels
                    round which the web is carried at the front and back. Coal is allowed to drop
                    continually on the travelling grate from a hopper in front of the furnace. A
                    more usual form of mechanical stoker is a reciprocating shovel or ram, supplied
                    from a coal-hopper, which throws or pushes a small quantity of coal into the
                    fire at each stroke. Along with this devices are employed for making the grate
                    self-cleansing, by giving alternate fire-bars a rocking or sliding motion
                    through a limited range. In Mr Crampton’s dust-fuel furnace the coal is ground
                    to powder and fed by rollers into a pipe from which it is blown into the furnace
                    by an air-blast. The mixture of fuel and air is so intimate that the excess of
                    air required for dilution is only one-fifth of the amount required for
                    combustion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> 1869.</p></note> A similar advantage
                    attends the use of gaseous fuel, and of liquid fuel that is blown into the
                    furnace in the form of spray.</p>
                <p>143. The use of liquid fuel for boilers has of late acquired considerable
                    importance in connexion with the discovery of crude petroleum, in large
                    quantity, at Baku on the Caspian Sea. The petroleum refuse which is left after
                    distilling paraffin from the crude oil forms an exceedingly cheap fuel, with a
                    calorific value per lb about one-third greater than that of coal. It has now
                    superseded coal in the steamers of the Caspian, and has been largely employed
                    for locomotives in the south-eastern part of Bussia. The oil is injected in the
                    form of spray near the foot of the fire-box by a steam jet arranged in such a
                    way that air will be drawn into the furnace along with the petroleum. In the
                    arrangement for burning petroleum used in Russian locomotives by Mr T. Urquhart
                    the flame impinges on a structure of fire-brick, built in the fire-box<pb

                    combustion to diffuse themselves throughout the combustion-chamber. This guards
                    against too intense action on the metallic surfaces, and at the same time serves
                    as a reservoir of heat to rekindle the flame if combustion is intermittent. In
                    getting up steam an auxiliary boiler is used to supply the jet.<note

                    Motions.</hi></p>
                <p>144. In early steam-engines the distribution of steam was effected by means of
                    conical valves, worked by tappets from a rod which hung from the beam. The
                    slide-valve, the invention of which in the form now known as the long D-slide is
                    credited to Murdoch, an assistant of Watt, came into general use with the
                    introduction of locomotives, and is now employed, in one or other of many forms,
                    in the great majority of engines.</p>
                <p>The common or locomotive slide-valve is illustrated in fig. 57. The seat, or
                    surface on which the valve slides, is a plane surface formed on or fixed to the
                    side of the cylinder, with three portsor openings, which extend across the great
                    er part of the cylin der’s width. The central opening is the exhaust-port
                    through which the steam escapes; the others, or steam ports, which are narrower,
                    lead to the two ends of the cylin der respectively.</p>
                <p>The valve is a box-shaped cover which slides over the seat, and the whole is en
                    closed in a cham ber called the valve - chest, to which steam from the boiler is
                    ad mitted. When the valve moves a sufficient distance to either side of the
                    central posi tion, steam enters one end of the cylinder from the valve-chest and
                    escapes from the other end of the cylinder through the cavity of the valve into
                    the exhaust-port. The valve is generally moved by an eccentric on the
                    engine-shaft (fig. 58), which is mechanically equivalent to a crank whose radius
                    is equal to the eccentricity, or distance of O, the centre of the shaft, from P,
                    the centre of the eccentric sheave. The sheave is encircled by a strap forming
                    the end of the eccentric rod, and the rod is connected by a pin-joint to the
                    valverod, which comes out of the valve-chest through a steam-tight stuffing-box.
                    The eccentric rod is generally so long that the motion of the valve is sensibly
                    the same as that which it would receive were the rod infinitely long.</p>
                <p>Thus if a circle (fig. 59) be drawn to represent the path of the eccentric centre
                    during a revolu tion of the engine, and a perpendicular PM be drawn from any
                    point P on a diameter AB, the distance CM is the displacement of the valve from
                    its middle position at the time when the eccentric centre is at P. AB is the
                    whole travel of the valve.</p>
                <p>145. If the valve when in its middle position did not overlap the steam ports
                    (fig. 60), any movement to the right or the left would admit steam, and the
                    admission would continue until the valve had returned to its middle position,
                    or, in other words, for half a revolution of the engine. Such a valve would not
                    serve for expansive working, and as re gards the relative po sition of the crank
                    and eccentric it would have to be set so that its middle position coincided with
                    the extreme position of the piston; in other words, the eccentric radius would
                    make a right angle with the crank. Expansive working, however, becomes possible
                    when we give the valve what is called “lap,” by making it project over the edges
                    of the steam ports, as in fig. 61, where <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is the
                    “outside lap” and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is the “inside lap.” Admission of
                    steam (to either side) then begins only when the displacement of the valve from
                    its middle position exceeds the amount of the outside lap, aud continues only
                    until the valve has returned to the same distance from its middle position.
                    Further, exhaust begins only when the valve has moved past the middle by a
                    distance equal to <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and continues until the valve has
                    again returned to a distance <hi rend="italic">i</hi> from its middle position.
                    Thus on the diagram of the eccentric’s travel (fig. 62) we find, by setting off
                    <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> on the two sides of the
                    centre, the posi tions <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cl</hi> of the eccentric radius at which the four events of ad mission,
                    cut-off, release, and compres sion occur for one side of the piston.</p>
                <p>As to the other side of the piston, it is only necessary to set off <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> to the right and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> to the left of
                    the centre, but for the sake of clearness we may confine our attention to one of
                    the two sides.</p>
                <p>Of the whole revolution, the part from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is the arc of steam admission, from <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> to c is the arc of expansion, from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> the arc of exhaust, and from <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the arc of compression. The relation of these, however,
                    to the piston’s motion is still undefined. If the eccentric were set in advance
                    of the crank by an angle equal to AC <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, the opening of
                    the valve would be coincident with the beginning of the piston’s stroke. It is,
                    however, desirable, in order to allow the steam free entry, that the valve be
                    already some way open when the piston stroke begins, and thus the eccentric may
                    be set to have a position C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ' at the beginning of the
                    stroke. In that case the valve is open at the beginning of the stroke to the
                    extent <hi rend="italic">mm',</hi> which is called the “lead.” The amount by
                    which the angle between C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ' (the eccentric) and CA (the
                    crank) exceeds a right angle is called the <hi rend="italic">angular
                    advance,</hi> this being the angle by which the eccentric is set in advance of
                    the position it would occupy if the primitive arrangement without lap were
                    adopted. The quantities lap, lead, and angular advance (ϕ) are connected by the
                    equation outside lap + lead=half travel × cos <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi></p>
                <p>An effect of lead is to cause <hi rend="italic">preadmission,</hi> that is to
                    say, admission before the end of the back stroke, which, together with the
                    compression of steam left in the cylinder when the exhaust port closes, produces
                    the mechanical effect of “cushioning,” to which reference has already been made.
                    To examine the distribution of steam throughout the piston’s stroke, we may now
                    draw a circle to represent the path of the crank pin (fig. 63, where the dotted
                    lines have been added to show the assumed configuration of piston,
                    connecting-rod, and crank) and transfer to it from the former diagram the
                    angular positions <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    at which the four events occur. To facilitate this transfer the diagrams of
                    eccentric path and of crank-pin path may by a suitable choice of scales be drawn
                    of the same actual size. Then by projecting these points on a diameter which
                    represents the piston’s path, by circular arcs drawn with a radius equal to the
                    length of the con necting-rod, we find <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the position of
                    the piston at which admission occurs during the back stroke, also <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> and r, the position at cut-off and re lease, during the
                    stroke which takes place in the direction of the arrow, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >s,</hi> the point at which compression begins. It is obviously unnecessary to
                    draw the two circles of figs. 62 and</p>
                <p>63 separately; the single diagram</p>
                <p>(fig. 64) contains the solution of the steam distribution with a slide-valve
                    whose laps, travel, and angular advance are known, the same circle serving, on
                    two scales, to show the motion of the crank and of the eccentric.</p>
                <p>146. A method of representing graphically the relations of valve and piston
                    motion, sometimes convenient in dealing with valve-gears of a more complex
                    character than the single eccentric, is to set off the valve’s and the piston’s
                    simultaneous displacement at right angles to each other, as in fig. 65, the
                    valve's motion being exaggerated by using a coarser scale for it than for that
                    of the piston. The result is an oval curve, from which the events in the<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"

                    lines AB and CD parallel to the piston’s path and distant from it by the amount
                    of the outside and inside lap respectively.</p>
                <p>Then <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the
                    corresponding points <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> determine the four events as in former diagrams. Fig. 65 shows at a
                    glance the amount of steam-opening at any part of the period of admission.</p>
                <p>AE is the lead. The events for the other side of the piston are determined by
                    drawing AB above and CD below the middle line.</p>
                <p>147. The graphic construction most usually employed in slide-valve investigations
                    is the ingenious diagram published by Dr G. Zeuner in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Civilingenieur</hi> in 1856.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Zeuner, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Valve Gears,</hi>
                    transl. by M. Müller, 18G8.</p></note> On the line AB (fig. 66), which
                    represents the travel of the valve, let a pair of circles (called valve-</p>
                <p>circles) be drawn, each with diameter equal to the half travel. A radius vector
                    CP, drawn in the direction of the eccentric at any instant, is cut by one of the
                    circles at Q, so that CQ represents the corresponding displace ment of the valve
                    from its middle position.</p>
                <p>That this is so will be seen by drawing PM (as in fig. 59) and joining QB, when
                    it is obvious that CQ = CM, which is the displacement of the valve. The line AB
                    with the circles on it may now be turned back through an angle of 90°+ θ (θ
                    being the angular advance), so that the valve-circles take the position shown to
                    a larger scale in fig. 67. This makes the direction of CQ (the eccentric)
                    coincide on the paper with the simultaneous direction of the crank, and hence to
                    find the displacement of the valve at any position of the crank we have only to
                    draw CQ in fig. 67 parallel to the crank, when CQ represents the displacement of
                    the valve to the scale on which the diameter of each valve circle represents the
                    half-travel of the valve. CQ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is the valve
                    displacement at the beginning of the stroke shown by the arrow. Draw circular
                    arcs <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> with C as centre
                    and with radii equal to the outside lap <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and the inside
                    lap <hi rend="italic">i</hi> respectively. C <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the
                    position of the crank at which preadmission occurs. The lead is <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> Q <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>,
                    The greatest steam opening is <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> B. The cut-off occurs when the crank has the direction C <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the position of the crank at
                    release, and <hi rend="italic">Cd</hi> marks the end of the exhaust.</p>
                <p>148. In this diagram radii drawn from C mark the angular positions of the crank,
                    and their intercepts by the valve circles determine the corresponding
                    displacement of the valve. It remains to find the corresponding displacement of
                    the piston.</p>
                <p>For this Zeuner employs a supplementary graphic construction, shown in fig. 68.
                    Here <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a'b</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi> represents the connecting rod, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bc</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b'c</hi> the crank. With centre <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> and radius <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> a circle <hi rend="italic">ap</hi>
                    is drawn, and with centre <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and radius <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> another circle <hi rend="italic">aq.</hi> Then for any position of the
                    crank, as <hi rend="italic">cb',</hi> the intercept <hi rend="italic">pq</hi>
                    between the circles is easily seen to be equal to <hi rend="italic">aa',</hi>
                    and is therefore the distance by which the piston has moved from its extreme
                    position at the beginning of the stroke. In practice this diagram is combined
                    with that of fig. 67, by drawing both about the same centre and using different
                    scales for valve and piston travel. A radius vector drawn from the centre
                    parallel to the crank in any position then shows the valve’s displacement from
                    the valve’s middle position by the intercept CQ of fig. 67, and the piston’s
                    displacement from the beginning of the piston’s motion by the intercept <hi
                    rend="italic">pq</hi> of fig. 68.</p>
                <p>149. In all the figures which have been sketched the events refer to the front
                    end of the cylinder, that is the end nearest to the crank (see fig. 63). To
                    determine the events of steam distribution at the back end, the lap circles
                    shown by dotted lines in fig. 67 must also be drawn, <hi rend="italic">Ca</hi> ’
                    being the outside lap for the back end, and C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> ' the
                    inside lap. These laps are not necessarily equal to those at the other end of
                    the valve. From fig. 65 it is obvious that, especially with a short
                    connecting-rod, the cut-off and release occur earlier and the compression later
                    at the front than at the back end if the laps are equal, and a more symmetrical
                    steam distribution can be produced by making the inside lap greater and the
                    outside lap less on the side which leads to the front end of the cylinder. On
                    the other hand, an unsymmetrical distribution may be desirable, as in a vertical
                    engine, where the weight of the piston assists the steam during the down-stroke
                    and resists it during the up-stroke, and this may be secured by a suitable
                    inequality in the laps.</p>
                <p>150. By varying the ratio of the laps <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> to the travel of the valve, we produce effects on the steam
                    distribution which are readily traced in the oval diagram of fig. 65 or in the
                    other figures. Reduction of travel (which is equivalent to increase of both o
                    and <hi rend="italic">i)</hi> gives later preadmission, earlier cut-off, later
                    release, and earlier compression; the ratios of expansion and of compression are
                    both increased. The effect of a change in the angular advance is more easily
                    seen by reference to Zeuner’s diagram, which shows that to increase θ
                    accelerates all the events and causes a slight increase in the ratio of
                    expansion.</p>
                <p>151. In designing a slide-valve the breadth of the steam ports in the direction
                    of the valve’s motion is determined with reference to the volume of the exhaust
                    steam to be discharged in a given time, the area of the ports being generally
                    such that the mean velocity of the steam during discharge is less than 100 feet
                    per second. The travel is made great enough to keep the cylinder port fully open
                    during the greater part of the exhaust; for this purpose it is 2½ or 3 times the
                    breadth of the steam port. To facilitate the exit of steam the inside lap is
                    always small, and is often wanting or even <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi>
                    During admission the steam port is rarely quite uncovered, especially if the
                    outside lap is large and the travel moderate. Large travel has the advantage of
                    giving freer ingress and egress of steam, with more sharp ly-defined cut off,
                    compression, and release, but this advantage is secured at the cost of more work
                    spent in moving the valve and more wear of the faces. To lessen the necessary
                    travel without reducing the area of steam ports, double-and eveu treble-ported
                    valves are often used. An example of a double-ported valve is shown in fig. 85.
                    Fig. 69 shows the Trick valve, an ingenious device for the same purpose.</p>
                <p>152. The eccentric must stand in advance of the crank by the angle 90° + θ, as in
                    fig. 70, where CK is the crank, and CE the corresponding position of the
                    eccentric when the engine is running in the direction of the arrow <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> To set the engine in gear to run in the opposite direction
                    (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</p>
                <p>it is only necessary to shift the eccentric into the position CE', when it will
                    still be 90°+ 0 in advance of the crank. In the older engines this reversal was
                    effected by temporarily disengaging tho eccentric-rod from the valve-rod,
                    working the valve by hand until the crank turned back through an angle equal to
                    ECE', the eccentric meanwhile remaining at rest, and then re-engaging the gear.
                    The eccentric sheave, instead of being keyed to the shaft, was driven by a stop
                    fixed to the shaft, which abutted on one or other of two shoulders projecting
                    from the sheave. In some modern forms of reversing gear means are provided for
                    turning the eccentric round on the shaft, but the arrangement known as the
                    link-motion is now the most usual gear in locomotive, marine, winding, and other

                <p>153.. In the link-motion two eccentrics are used, and the ends of their rods are
                    connected by a link. In Stephenson’s link-motion— the earliest and still the
                    most usual form—the link is a slotted bar or pair of bars curved to the same
                    radius as the eccentric rods (fig. 71), and capable of being shifted up or down
                    by a suspension rod.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0526-0503"/> The valve-rod ends in a block which slides within
                    the link, and when the link is placed so that this block is nearly in line with
                    the forward eccentric rod (R, fig. 71) the valve moves in nearly the same way as
                    if it were driven directly by a single eccentric. This is the position of “full
                    forward gear.” In “full backward gear,” on the other hand, the link is pulled up
                    until the block is in nearly a line with the backward eccentric rod R'. The
                    link-motion thus gives a ready means of reversing the engine,—but it does more
                    than this. By setting the link in an intermediate position the valve receives a
                    motion nearly the same as that which would be given by an eccentric of shorter
                    radius and of greater angular advance, and the effect is to give a distribution
                    of steam in which the cut-off is earlier than in full gear, and the expansion
                    and compression are greater. In mid gear the steam distribution is such that
                    scarcely any work is done in the cylinder. The movement of the link is effected
                    by a hand lever, or by a screw, or (in large engines) by an auxiliary
                    steam-engine. A usual arrangement of hand lever, sketched in fig. 71, has given
                    rise to the phrase “notching up,” to describe the setting of the link to give a
                    greater degree of expansion.</p>
                <p>154. In Gooch’s link-motion (fig. 72) the link is not moved up in shifting from
                    forward to backward gear, but a radius rod between the valve-rod and the link
                    (which is curved to suit this radius rod) is raised or lowered—a plan which has
                    the advantage that the lead is the same in all gears. In Allan’s motion
                    (fig.</p>
                <p>73) the change of gear is effected partly by shifting the link and partly by
                    shifting a radius rod, and the link is straight.</p>
                <p>155. The movement of a valve driven by a link-motion may be very fully and
                    exactly analysed by drawing with the aid of a template the positions of the
                    centre line of the link corresponding to a number of successive positions of the
                    crank. Thus, in fig. 74, two circular arcs passing through <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> ' are drawn with E and E' as centres and
                    the eccentric rods are radii. These are loci of two known points of the link,
                    and a third locus is the circle <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in which the point of
                    suspension must lie. By placing on the paper a template of the link, with these
                    three points marked on it, the position of the link is readily found, and by
                    repeating the process for other positions of the eccentrics a diagram of
                    positions (fig. 74) is drawn for the assigned state of the gear. A line AB drawn
                    across this diagram in the path of the valve’s travel determines the
                    displacements of the valve, and enables the oval diagram to be drawn (as in fig.
                    65), which is shown to a larger scale in another part of fig. 74. The example
                    refers to Stephenson’s link-motion in nearly full forward gear; with obvious
                    modification the same method may be used in the analysis of Gooch’s or Allan’s
                    motion. The same diagram determines the amount of slotting or sliding motion of
                    the black in the link. In a well-designed gear this sliding is reduced to a
                    minimum for that position of the gear in which the engine runs most usually. In
                    marine engines the suspension-rod is generally connected to the link at the end
                    of the link next the forward eccentric, to reduce this sliding when the engine
                    is in forward gear. A less laborious, but less accurate, solution of link-motion
                    problems is reached by the use of what is called the equivalent eccentric—an
                    imaginary eccentric, which would give the valve nearly the same motion as it
                    gets from the joint action of the actual eccentrics. The following ride for
                    finding the equivalent eccentric, in any state of gear, is due to Mr M'Farlane
                    Gray:—</p>
                <p>Connect the eccentric centres E and E' (fig. 75) by a circular arc whose radius =
                    <hi rend="superscript"> EE' × length of eccentric rod</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2 ×</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ee'</hi></p>
                <p>Then, if the block is at any point B, take</p>
                <p>EF such that EF: EE':: <hi rend="italic">eB: ed.</hi> CF then represents the
                    equivalent eccentric both in radius and in angular position. If the rods of the
                    link-motion are crossed instead of open,—an arrangement seldom used,—the arc
                    EFE' is to be drawn convex towards C.</p>
                <p>156. Many forms of gear for reversing and for varying expansion have been devised
                    with the object of escaping the use of two eccentrics, and of obtaining a more
                    perfect distribution of steam than the link-motion can often be made to give.
                    Hackworth’s gear, the parent of several others, has a single eccentric E (fig.
                    76) opposite the crank, with an eccentric-rod EQ, whose mean position is
                    perpendicular to the travel of the valve.</p>
                <p>The rod ends in a block Q, which slides on a fixed inclined guide-bar or link,
                    and the valve-rod receives its motion through a connecting rod from an
                    intermediate point P of the eccentric-rod, the locus of which is an ellipse. To
                    reverse the gear the guide-</p>
                <p>bar is tilted over to the position shown by the dotted lines, and inter mediate
                    inclinations give various degrees of expan sion without altering the lead. The
                    steam distribu tion is excellent, and the cut-off is sharper than in the usual
                    link-motion, but an objection to the gear is the wear of the sliding-block and
                    guide. In Bremme’s or Marshall’s form this objection is obviated with some loss
                    of sym metry in the valve’s motion by constraining the motion of the point Q,
                    not by a sliding-guide, but a suspension-link, which makes the path of Q a
                    circular arc instead of a straight line; to reverse the gear the centre of sus
                    pension R of this link is thrown over to the posi tion R' (fig. 77). In the
                    example sketched P is beyond Q, but P may be between Q and the crank</p>
                <p>(as in fig. 76), in which case the eccentric is set at 180° from the crank.</p>
                <p>This gear has been applied in a number of marine engines. In Joy’s gear, which is
                    extensively used in locomotives, no eccen tric is required; and the rod
                    corresponding to the eccentric rod in Hack- . .</p>
                <p>worth’s gear receives its motion from a point in the connecting rod by the
                    linkage shown in fig. 78, and is either suspended, as in Marshall’s form, by a
                    rod whose suspension centre R is thrown over to reverse the motion, or
                    constrained, as in Hackworth s, by a slot-guide whose inclination is reversed.
                    Fig. 79 shows Joy's gear as<pb break="no"

                    and it is curved to allow for the obliquity of the valve connecting-rod AE. C is

                <p>The reversing gears of Walschaert, Brown, and Kitson also dispense with

                    was (before reversal) the exhaust side of the valve and connect the exhaust to
                    what was the steam side. This is done by means of a separate reversing valve
                    through which the steam and exhaust pipes pass.</p>
                <p>157. When the distribution of steam is effected by the slide-valve alone the arc
                    of the crank’s motion during which compression occurs is equal to the arc during
                    which expansion occurs, and for this reason the slide-valve would give an
                    excessive amount of compression if it were made to cut off the supply of steam
                    earlier than about half-stroke. Hence, where an early cut-off is wanted it is
                    necessary either to use an entirely different means of regulating the
                    distribution of steam, or to supplement the slide-valve by another valve,—called
                    an expansion-valve, usually driven by a separate eccentric,—whose function is to
                    effect the cut-off, the other events being determined as usual by the
                    slide-valve. Such expansion-valves belong generally to one or other of two
                    types. In one the expansion-valve cuts off the supply of steam to the chest in
                    which the main valve works. This may be done by a disk or double-beat valve (§
                    163), as in the Proëll gear mentioned in § 175 below, or by a slide-valve
                    working on a fixed seat (furnished with one or more ports), which forms the back
                    or side of the main valve-chest. Valves of this last type are usually made in
                    the “gridiron” or many-ported form to combine large steam-opening with small
                    travel. Expansion-valves working in a fixed seat may be arranged so that the
                    ports are either fully open (fig. 80) or closed (fig. 81) when the valve is in
                    its middle position. In the latter case the expansion-valve eccentric is set in
                    line with or oppo site to the crank, if the en gine is to run in either
                    direction with the same grade of expansion. Cut-off then occurs at P, fig. 82,
                    when the shaft has turned through an angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> from the
                    beginning of the stroke. The expansion valve reopens at Q, and the slide-valve
                    must therefore have enough lap to cut off earlier than 180° <hi rend="italic"
                    >-φ</hi> from the beginning of the stroke, in order to prevent a second admis
                    sion of steam to the cylinder. In the valve of fig. 80 the expansion eccentric
                    is set at right angles to the crank, if the action is to be the same in both
                    directions. If not, these angles may be deviated from, and in this way a more
                    rapid travel at the instant of cut-off may be secured for one direction of
                    running.</p>
                <p>158. The other and much commoner type of expansion-valve is one sliding on the
                    back of the main slide-valve, which is provided with through ports which the
                    expansion-</p>
                <p>valve opens and closes. Fig. 83 shows one form of this type. Here the resultant
                    rela tive motion of the expansion-valve and main-valve has to be considered. If
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> a</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> b</hi> (fig. 84) are
                    the eccentrics working the main and expansion valves respectively, then CR drawn
                    equal and parallel to ME</p>
                <p>is the <hi rend="italic">resultant</hi> eccentric which determines the motion of
                    the expansion-valve rela tively to the main-valve. Cut-off occurs at</p>
                <p>Q, when the shaft has turned through an angle <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> which
                    brings the resultant eccentric into the direction CQ and makes the relative
                    displacement of the two valves equal to the distance <hi rend="italic">l.</hi>
                    Another form of this valve (corresponding to fig. 81) cuts off steam at the
                    inside edges of the expansion-slides.</p>
                <p>159. Expansion-valves furnish a convenient means of <hi rend="italic"
                    >varying</hi> the expansion, which may be done by altering their lap, travel, or
                    angular advance. Alteration of lap, or rather of the distance <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> in the figures, is often effected by having the expansion-valve in two
                    parts (as in fig. 83) and holding them on one rod by right-and lefthanded screws
                    respectively; by turning the valve-rod the parts are made to approach or recede
                    from each other. In large valves the adjustment is more conveniently made by
                    vary ing the travel of the valve, which is done by con necting it to its
                    eccentric through a link which serves as a lever of variable length.</p>
                <p>160. To relieve the pressure of the valve on the seat, large slide-valves are
                    generally fitted with a steam-tight ring, which excludes steam from the greater
                    part of the back of the valve. The ring fits steam-tight into a recess in the
                    cover of the steam-chest, and is pressed by springs against the back of the
                    valve, which is planed smooth to slide under the ring. Fig. 85 shows a relief
                    ring of this kind fitted on the back of a large double-ported slide-valve for a
                    marine engine. Another plan is to fit the ring into a recess on the back of the
                    valve, and let it slide on the inside of the steam-chest cover. Steam is thus
                    excluded from the space within the ring, any steam that leaks in being allowed
                    to escape to the condenser (or to the intermediate receiver when the arrangement
                    is fitted to the high-pressure cylinder of a compound engine). A flexible
                    diaphragm has also been used, instead of a recess, to hold the ring.</p>
                <p>161. The pressure of valves on cylinder faces is still more completely obviated
                    by making the back of the valve similar to its face, and causing the back to
                    slide in contact with the valve-chest cover, which has recesses corresponding to
                    the cylinder ports. This arrangement is most perfectly carried out in the piston
                    slide-valves now very largely used in the high-pressure cylinders of marine
                    engines. The piston slide-valve may be described as a slide-valve<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n528/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0528-0505"/> in which the valve face is curved to form a
                    complete cylinder, round whose whole circumference the ports extend. The pistons
                    are packed like ordinary cylinder pistons by metallic rings, and the ports are
                    crossed here and there by diagonal bars to keep the rings from springing out as
                    the valve moves over them. Figs. 86 and 87 show two forms of piston valve
                    designed by Mr Kirk for the supply of high-pressure steam to large marine
                    engines. P, P are the cylinder ports in each.</p>
                <p>Fig. 85 illustrates an arrangement common in all heavy slide-valves whose travel
                    is vertical—the <hi rend="italic">balance-piston,</hi> which is pressed up by
                    steam on its lower side and so equilibrates the weight of the valve, valve-rod,
                    aud connected parts of the mechanism.</p>
                <p>162. The slide-valve sometimes takes the form of a disk revolving or oscillating
                    on a fixed seat, and sometimes of a rocking cylinder (fig. 88). This last kind
                    of sliding motion is very usual in stationary engines fitted with the Corliss
                    gear, which will be described in the next chapter, in which case four distinct
                    rocking slides are commonly employed to effect the steam distribution, one
                    giving admission and one giving exhaust at each end of the cylinder (see fig.
                    127).</p>
                <p>163. In many stationary engines <hi rend="italic">lift</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >disk</hi> valves are used, worked by tappets, cams, or eccentrics. Lift valves
                    are generally of the Cornish or double-beat type (fig. 89), in which equilibrium
                    is secured by the use of two conical faces which open or close together.</p>
                <p>In Cornish pumping engines, which retain the single action of</p>
                <p>Watt’s early engine, three double beat valves are used, as steam-</p>
                <p>valve, equilibrium-valve, and ex haust-valve respectively. These are closed by
                    tappets on a rod moving with the beam, but are opened by means of a device
                    called a cataract, which acts as follows.</p>
                <p>The cataract is a small pump with a weighted plunger, discharging fluid through a
                    stop-cock which can be adjusted by hand when it is desired to alter the speed of
                    the engine. The weighted plunger is raised by a rod from the beam, but is free
                    in its descent, so that it comes down at a rate depending on the extent to which
                    the stopcock is opened. When it comes down a certain way it opens the steam and
                    exhaust valves, by liberating catches which hold them closed; the “out-door”
                    stroke then begins and admission continues until the steam-valve is closed: this
                    is done directly by the motion of the beam, which also, at a later point in the
                    stroke, closes the exhaust. Then the equilibrium-valve is opened, and the
                    “in-door” stroke takes place, during which the plunger of the cataract is
                    raised. When it is completed, the piston pauses until the cataract causes the
                    steam-valve to open and the next “out-door” stroke begins. By applying a
                    cataract to the equilibrium-valve also, a pause is introduced at the end of the
                    “out-door” stroke. Pauses have the advantage of giving the pump time to fill and
                    of allowing the pump-valves to settle in their seats without shock.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Governing.</hi></p>
                <p>164. To make an engine run steadily an almost continuous process of adjustment
                    must go on, by which the amount of work done by the steam in the cylinder is
                    adapted to the amount of external work demanded of the engine. Even in cases
                    where the demand for work is sensibly uniform, fluctuations in boiler-pressure
                    still make regulation necessary. Generally the process of government aims at
                    regularity of speed; occasionally, however, it is some other condition of
                    running that is maintained constant, as when an engine driving a dynamo-electric
                    machine is governed by an electric regulator to give a constant difference of
                    potential between the brushes.</p>
                <p>The ordinary methods of regulating are either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to alter
                    the pressure at which steam is admitted by opening or closing more or less a
                    throttle-valve between the boiler and the engine, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                    to alter the volume of steam admitted to the cylinder by varying the point of
                    cut-off. The former plan was introduced by Watt and is still common, especially
                    in small engines. From the point of view of heat economy it is wasteful, since
                    the process of throttling is essentially irreversible, but this objection is to
                    some extent lessened by the fact that the wire-drawing of steam dries or
                    superheats it, and consequently reduces the condensation which it suffers on
                    coming into contact with the chilled cylinder walls. On the other hand, to
                    hasten the cut-off involves a gain rather than a loss of efficiency unless the
                    ratio of expansion is already very great. The second plan of regulating is much
                    to be preferred, especially when the engine is subject to large variations of
                    load, and is very generally followed in stationary engines of the larger
                    types.</p>
                <p>165. Within certain limits regulation by either plan can be effected by hand, but
                    for the finer adjustment of speed some form of automatic governor is necessary.
                    Speed governors are commonly of the <hi rend="italic">centrifugal</hi> type: a
                    pair of masses revolving about a spindle which is driven by the engine are kept
                    from flying out by a certain controlling force. When an increase of speed occurs
                    this controlling force is no longer able to keep the masses revolving in their
                    former path; they move out until the controlling force is sufficiently
                    increased, and in moving out they act on the regu lator of the engine, which may
                    be a throttle-valve or some form of automatic expansion gear. In the conical
                    pendu lum governor of Watt (fig. 90) the re volving masses are balls attached to
                    a vertical spindle by links, and the con trolling force is furnished by the
                    weight of the balls, which, in receding from the spindle, are obliged to rise.
                    When the speed exceeds or falls short of its normal value they move out or in,
                    and so raise or lower a collar C which is in connexion by a lever with the
                    throttle-valve. The suspension-links may be hung from a cross-bar (figs. 94, 95)
                    instead of being pivoted in the axis of the spindle.</p>
                <p>166. In a modified form of Watt’s governor, known as Porter’s, or the loaded
                    governor, a supplementary controlling force is given by placing a weight on the
                    sliding collar (fig. 91). This is equivalent to increasing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >weight</hi> of the balls without altering their <hi rend="italic">mass.</hi> In
                    other governors the controlling force is wholly or partly produced by springs.
                    Fig. 92 shows a governor by Messrs Tangye in which the balls are controlled
                    partly by their own weight and partly by a spring, the tension of which is
                    regulated by turning the cap A.</p>
                <p>167. In whatever way the revolving masses are controlled, the controlling force
                    may be treated as a force F acting on each ball in the direction of the radius
                    towards the axis of revolution. Then, if M be the mass of the ball, <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> the number of revolutions per second, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> the radius of the ball’s path, the governor will revolve in equilibrium
                    when F = 4π <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi> M (in absolute units), or <hi

                    rend="italic subscript"> r</hi></p>
                <p>In order that the configuration of the governor should be stable, F must increase
                    more rapidly than r, as the balls move outwards. In the simple conical pendulum
                    governor, any of the three forms shown in figs. 93, 94, and 95, where the balls
                    have no load to raise but their own weight, the controlling force F is the
                    resultant of T, the tension in the link, and M <hi rend="italic">g</hi>, the
                    weight of the ball (fig. 96). Let the height of the pendulum, that is, the
                    distance above the plane of the balls of the point where the suspending-link, or
                    the link produced, cuts the axis, be called <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> Then F:M

                    would be possible for any one value of <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> It is obvious
                    that neither this governor nor any other <hi rend="italic">stable</hi> governor
                    maintains a strictly constant speed in the engine which it controls. If the
                    boiler pressure or the demand for work is changed, a certain amount of permanent
                    displacement of the balls is necessary to alter the steam supply, and the balls
                    can retain their displaced position only by virtue of a permanent change in the
                    speed. The maximum range of speed depends on that amount of change of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> which suffices to alter the configuration of the governor
                    from the position which gives no steam-supply to the position which gives full
                    steam-supply; and the governor is said to be sensitive if this range is a small
                    fraction of <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                <p>168. If the governor is loaded, let M' be the amount of the load per ball, and
                    <hi rend="italic">q</hi> the velocity ratio of the vertical movement of the load
                    to the vertical movement of the ball. Then <hi rend="italic">q</hi> M' <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> is the equivalent increase in the weight of each ball. The
                    effect of the load is to increase the controlling force F from M <hi

                    >q</hi> M') <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> ∕ <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, and the speed
                    at which the governor must now turn, to maintain any assigned height <hi

                <p>The speed of the loaded governor must therefore be greater than th <hi
                    rend="underline">at of an</hi> unloaded governor of the same height in the ratio
                    √(M + <hi rend="italic">q</hi> M') to ∖∕M.</p>
                <p>The sensibility is then the same as that of an unloaded governor of the same
                    height <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> but the loaded governor has an important
                    advantage in another respect—namely, its <hi rend="italic">power</hi> or
                    capability of overcoming frictional resistance to a change of configuration.
                    This quality in a governor is increased whenever the controlling force F is
                    increased, whether by the addition of a load or by the use of springs.</p>
                <p>For let <hi rend="italic">f</hi> be the frictional resistance to be overcome per
                    ball, resolved as a force resisting the displacement of each ball in the
                    direction of the radius <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Then if <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> be the speed normal to any configuration this speed must change by a
                    certain amount Δ <hi rend="italic">n</hi> before friction is overcome and the
                    balls begin to be displaced. The controlling force is now F <hi rend="italic"
                    >+f</hi> when the balls are moving outwards, and F - <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    when the balls are moving inwards. Hence n + Δn= <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                <p>From this, if <hi rend="italic">Bn</hi> be small compared with <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> we have Δn∕n= <hi rend="italic">f</hi> ∕2F.</p>
                <p>Thus, when a given amount of frictional resistance is to be overcome before the
                    governor can act, the limits within which this friction allows the speed to vary
                    are less the greater is the controlling force F. A loaded governor is more
                    powerful in this respect than an unloaded governor of the same configuration in
                    the proportion in which F is greater—namely, as M + <hi rend="italic">q</hi> M'
                    is to M. A loaded governor may therefore have much lighter revolving masses
                    without loss either of sensibility or of power.</p>
                <p>169. The same results are applicable to governors in which the controlling force
                    is supplied by springs as well as by gravity, or by springs alone. To find tho
                    configuration which the governor will assume at any particular speed, or the
                    speed corresponding to a particular configuration, it is only necessary to
                    determine the whole controlling force F per ball acting along the radius towards
                    the axis for various values of <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Let a curve <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> (fig. 97) be drawn showing the relation of F to <hi

                    rend="italic">n.</hi> Or, if that is given, and the value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> is to be found, the line Oc produced will determine C, and then n <hi

                    frictional resistance <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is known, an additional pair of
                    curves drawn above and below <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> with ordinates F + <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and F - <hi rend="italic">f</hi> respectively, serve to
                    show the additional variations in speed which are caused by friction. The
                    governor is stable throughout its whole range when the curve <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> has a steeper gradient than any line drawn from O to meet it.</p>
                <p>170. By § 167 it is evident that, if, when the balls are displaced, the
                    controlling force F changes proportionally to the radius <hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> the speed is constant. In other words, the equilibrium of the governor
                    is then neutral; it can revolve in equilibrium at one, and only at one, speed.
                    At this speed it assumes, indifferently, any one of its possible configurations.
                    The slightest variation of speed drives it to the extremity of its range; hence
                    its sensibility is indefinitely great. Such a governor is called <hi
                    rend="italic">isochronous.</hi> A gravity governor is isochronous when <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> is constant for all positions of the balls (since <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> ∞ √ <hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    g</hi> ∕ <hi rend="italic subscript"> h</hi>). This will be the case if the
                    balls are constrained to move in a parabolic path (fig. 98), it being a property
                    of the parabola that the subnormal QM, which is <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> is
                    constant. A useful approximation to the same condition, through a limited range,
                    is secured in Farcot’s governor by the device of hanging the balls by crossed
                    links from the distant ends of a T piece (fig. 95). If each centre of suspension
                    were at the centre of curvature of a parabolic arc which coincided with the
                    actual circular locus of the balls at the position of normal speed, the governor
                    would be sensibly isochronous at that speed; by taking the centres of suspension
                    rather nearer the axis, a suitable margin of stability is se cured, but the
                    governor is still nearly enough isochronous to be exceedingly sensitive.<note

                <p>99), where the balls move in a nearly horizontal direction, and gravity has
                    little to do with the control, the governor can be made isochronous by screwing
                    down the spring, so ∣ that the initial force exerted by the spring is to its
                    increase by displacement of the balls as the initial radius of the balls’ path
                    is to the increase of radius by displacement.</p>
                <p>When the initial force is increased beyond this the governor becomes
                    unstable.</p>
                <p>In fig. 97 the condition of isochronism is secured when the line <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> coincides with a straight line through O.</p>
                <p>171. In practice no governor can be absolutely isochronous. It is indispensable
                    to leave a small margin of stability for the sake of preventing violent change
                    in the supply of steam, especially when there is much frictional resistance to
                    be overcome by the governor, or where the influence of the governor takes much
                    time to be felt by the engine. An over-sensitive governor is liable to fall into
                    a state of oscillation called <hi rend="italic">hunting.</hi> When an alteration
                    of speed begins to be felt, however readily the governor alters its form, the
                    engine’s response is more or less delayed. If the governor acts by closing a
                    throttle-valve, the engine has still a capacious valve-chest on which to draw
                    for steam. If it acts by changing the cut-off, its opportunity is passed if the
                    cut-off has already occurred, and the control only begins with the next stroke.
                    This lagging of effect is specially felt in compound engines, where that portion
                    of the steam which is already in the engine continues to do its work for nearly
                    a whole revolution after passing beyond the governor’s control. The result of
                    this storage of energy in an engine whose governor is too nearly isochronous is
                    that, whenever the demand for power suddenly falls, the speed rises so much as
                    to force the governor into a position of over-control, such that the supply of
                    steam is no longer adequate to meet even the reduced demand for power. Then the
                    speed slackens, and the same kind of excessive regulation is repeated in the
                    opposite direction. A state of forced oscillation is consequently set up. The
                    effect is aggravated by the momentum which the governor balls acquire in being
                    displaced, and also, to a very great degree, by the friction of the governor and
                    the regulating mechanism. Hunting is to be avoided by giving the governor a fair
                    degree of stability, by reducing as far as possible the static frictional
                    resistances, and by introducing a <hi rend="italic">viscous</hi> resistance to
                    the displacement of the governor, which prevents the displacement from occurring
                    too suddenly, without affecting the ultimate position of equilibrium. For this
                    purpose many governors are furnished with a <hi rend="italic">dash-pot,</hi>
                    which is an hydraulic or pneumatic brake, consisting of a piston connected to
                    the governor, working loosely in a cylinder which is filled with oil or with
                    air.</p>

                    axis, and the control is given wholly by springs. An example is shown in fig.

                <p>173. The throttle-</p>
                <p>valve, as introduced by Watt, was origin ally a disk turning on a transverse axis
                    across the centre of the steam-</p>
                <p>pipe. It is now usually a double - beat valve</p>
                <p>(fig. 89) or a piston-</p>
                <p>valve. When regula tion is effected by varying the cut-off, and an
                    expansion-valve of the slide-valve type is used, the governor generally acts by
                    changing the travel of the valve. Fig. 99 illustrates a common mode of doing
                    sion, and then, when the trip-action comes into play, it closes suddenly. The
                    indicator diagram of a Corliss engine consequently has a nearly horizontal
                    admission-line and a sharply defined cut-off. Generally the valves of Corliss
                    engines are cylindrical plates turning in hollow cylindrical seats which extend
                    across the width of the cylinder. Often, however, the admission-valves are of
                    the disk or double-beat type, and spring into their seats when the trip-gear
                    acts. Many forms of Corliss gear have been invented by Corliss himself and by
                    others. One of these, the Spencer Inglis<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi>
                    1868.</p></note> trip-gear, by Messrs Hick, Hargreaves, &amp; Co., is shown in
                    figs. 101 and 102. A wrist-plate A, which turns on a pin on the outside of the
                    cylinder, receives a motion of oscillation from an eccentric. It opens the
                    cylindrical rocking-valve B by pulling the link C, which consists of two parts,
                    connected to each other by a pair of spring clips <hi rend="italic">a, a.</hi>
                    Between the clips there is a rocking-cam <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and as the
                    link is pulled down this cam places itself more and more athwart the link, until
                    at a certain point it forces the clips open. Then the upper part of the link
                    springs back and allows the valve B to close by the action of a spring in the
                    dash-pot D. When the wrist-plate makes its return stroke the clips re-engage the
                    upper portion of the link C, and things are ready for the next stroke. The
                    rocking-cam <hi rend="italic">b</hi> has its position controlled by the governor
                    this, by giving the expansion-valve its motion from an eccentric-rod through a
                    link, the throw of which is varied by the displacement of the governor balls. In
                    fig. 100, the governor acts on the main slide-valve of the engine (there being
                    no separate expansion-valve), and the displacement of the revolving masses Μ, M
                    changes both the throw and the angular advance of the eccentric, thereby
                    producing a change in the steam supply similar to that produced by "notching up”
                    a link-motion. The eccentricity B is altered by the relative displacement of two
                    parts C, D into which the eccentric sheave is divided. In other forms of
                    automatic expansion-gear the lap of the valve is altered; in others the governor
                    acts by shifting the expansion-valve eccentric round on its shaft, and so
                    changing its angular advance.</p>
                <p>174. In large stationary engines the most usual plan of automatically regulating
                    the expansion is to employ some form of trip-gear, the earliest type of which
                    was introduced in 1849 by G. H. Corliss of Providence, U.S. In the Corliss
                    system the valves which admit steam are distinct from the exhaust-valves. The
                    latter are opened and closed by a reciprocating piece which takes its motion
                    from an eccentric. The former are opened by a reciprocating piece, but are
                    closed by springing back when released by a trip-or trigger-action. The trip
                    occurs earlier or later in the piston’s stroke according to the position of the
                    governor. The admissi on-valve is opened by the reciprocating piece with equal
                    rapidity whether the cut-off is going to be early or late. It remains wide open
                    during the admis-</p>
                <p>through the link E in such a way that when the speed of the engine increases it
                    stands more athwart the link C, and therefore causes the clips to be released at
                    an earlier point in the stroke. A precisely similar arrangement governs the
                    admission of steam to the other end of the cylinder. The exhaust-valves are
                    situated on the<pb break="no"

                    their motion from a separate wrist-plate which oscillates on the same pin with

                <p>A rocking-lever <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is made to oscillate on a fixed pin
                    through its centre by a connexion to the crosshead of the engine. When the end
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> rises, the bell-crank lever <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    engages the lever <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    depressed the lever <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is forced down and the valve <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> is opened to admit steam to one end of the cylinder. As <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> continues moving down a point is reached at which the edge
                    of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> slips past the edge of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and
                    the valve is then forced to its seat by a spring in the dash-pot <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi>.</p>
                <p>This disengagement occurs early or late according to the position of the fulcrum
                    piece <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> on which the heel of the bell-crank <hi

                <p>The position of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is determined by the governor. A similar
                    action, occurring at the other end of the rocking-bar <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    gives steam to the other end of the cylinder. In one form of Proëll’s gear both
                    ends of <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> act on the same steam-valve, which is then a
                    separate expansion-valve fixed on the back of a chest in which an ordinary
                    slide-valve works.</p>
                <p>176. In the ordinary form of centrifugal governor the position of the
                    throttle-valve, or the expansion-link, or the Corliss trigger depends on the
                    configuration of the governor, and is definite for each position of the balls.
                    In disengagement governors, of which the governor A shown on the right-hand side
                    in fig. 104 is an example, any reduction of speed below a certain value sets the
                    regulating mechanism in motion, and the adjustment continues until the speed has
                    been restored. Similarly a rise of speed above a certain value sets the
                    regulating mechanism in motion in the other direction. If the spindle <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 104) is connected to the regulator so as to give more
                    steam if it turns one way and less if it turns the other, the speed at which the
                    engine will run in equilibrium must lie between narrow limits, since at any
                    speed high enough to keep <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in gear with <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> the supply of steam will go on being reduced, and at any
                    speed low enough to bring c into gear with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the supply
                    will go on being increased. This mode of governing, besides being sensibly
                    isochronous, has the advantage that the power of the governor is not limited by
                    the controlling force on the balls, since the governor acts by deflecting a
                    portion of the power that is being developed by the engine to the work of moving
                    the regulator. It is rarely applied to steam-engines, probably because its
                    action is too slow. This defect has been ingeniously remedied in the
                    supplementary governor of Mr W. Knowles, who has combined a disengagement
                    governor with one of the ordinary type in the manner shown in fig. 104.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst.

                    driven by the supplementary or disengagement governor A, acts by lengthening the
                    rod <hi rend="italic">d</hi> which connects the ordinary governor B with the
                    regulator. It does this by turning a coupling nut <hi rend="italic">e</hi> which
                    unites two parts of <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> on which right-and left-handed
                    screws are cut. Any sudden fluctuation in speed is immediately responded to by
                    the ordinary governor. Any more or less permanent change of load or of
                    steampressure gives the supplementary governor time to act. It goes on adjusting
                    the supply until the normal speed is restored, thereby converting the control of
                    the ordinary governor, which is stable, and therefore not isochronous, into a
                    control which is isochronous as regards all fluctuations of long period. The
                    power of the combination is limited to that of the common governor B.</p>
                <p>177. Other governors which deserve to be classed as disengagement governors are
                    those in which the displacement of the governor affects the regulator, not
                    directly by a mechanical connexion, but by admitting steam or other fluid into
                    what may be called a relay cylinder, whose piston acts on the regulator. In
                    order that a governor of this class should work without hunting, the piston and
                    valve of the relay cylinder should be connected by what is termed differential
                    gear, the effect of which is that for each displacement of the valve by the
                    governor the piston moves through a distance proportional to the displacement of
                    the valve. An example of differential gear is shown in fig. 105. Suppose that
                    the rod <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is connected with the governor so that it is
                    raised by an acceleration of the engine’s speed. The rod <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> whieh leads from the relay piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to the
                    regulator serves as a fulcrum, and the valve-rod <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is
                    consequently raised. This admits steam to the upper side of the piston and
                    depresses the piston, which pulls down <hi rend="italic">d</hi> with it, since
                    the end of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> now serves as a fulcrum. Thus by the
                    downward movement of the piston the valve is again restored to its middle posi
                    tion and the action of the regulator then ceases until a new change of speed
                    occurs.</p>

                    The lever <hi rend="italic">d</hi> works the throttle-valve or other regulator,
                    either directly or by a steam relay. The governor is isochronous when the force

                    force increases when <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is displaced, the governor is
                    stable. A governor of this class may properly be called a dynamometric governor,
                    since it regulates by endeavouring to keep constant the rate at which energy is

                    governor the friction-brake is replaced by a sort of centrifugal pump,
                    consisting of a paraboloidal cup, open at the top and bottom, whose rotation
                    causes a fluid to rise in it and escape over the rim when the speed is
                    sufficiently great. Any increase in the cup’s speed augments largely the power
                    required to turn it, and consequently affects the position of the piece which
                    corresponds to <hi rend="italic">d.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Churchill<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> is a governor of the
                    same type. In it the rotation of a piece corresponding to <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> is resisted by means of a fan revolving in a case containing a fluid,
                    and the coupling piece which is the mechanical equivalent of <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> in fig. 106 acts on the throttle-valve, not directly but through a steam
                    relay. In Silver’s marine governor<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the piece which corresponds to <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is a set of
                    air-vanes. The inertia is, however, very great, and any acceleration of the
                    engine’s speed consequently displaces the dynamometer coupling,<pb break="no"

                    revolving in a case containing a fluid. The case is also free to turn, except
                    that it is held back by a weight or spring and is connected to the regulator. So
                    long as the speed of the fan is constant, the moment required to keep the case
                    from turning does not vary, and consequently the position of the regulator
                    remains unchanged. When the fan turns faster the moment increases, and the case
                    has to follow it (acting on the regulator) until the spring which holds the case
                    from turning is sufficiently extended, or the weight raised. The term
                    “dynamometric governor” is equally applicable to this form; the power required
                    to drive the fan is regulated by an absorption-dynamometer in the case instead
                    of by a transmission-dynamometer between the engine and the fan. In Napier’s
                    governor the case is fixed, and the reaction takes place between one turbine-fan
                    which revolves with the engine and another close to it which is held from
                    turning by a spring and is connected with the regulator.</p>
                <p>180. Pump governors form another group closely related to the differential or
                    dynamometric type. An engine may have its speed regulated by working a small
                    pump which supplies a chamber from which water is allowed to escape by an
                    orifice of constant size. When the engine quickens its speed water is pumped in
                    faster than it can escape, and the accumulation of water in the chamber may be
                    made to act on the regulator through a piston controlled by a spring or in other
                    ways. This device has an obvious analogy to the cataract of the Cornish
                    pumping-engine (§ 163), whieh has, however, the somewhat different purpose of
                    introducing a regulated pause at the end of each stroke. The “differential
                    valve-gear” invented by Mr H. Davey, and successfully applied by him to modern
                    pumping-engines, combines the functions of the Cornish cataract with that of a
                    hydraulic governor for regulating the expansion.<note anchored="true"

                    motion of the engine piston, while the other (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), which
                    forms (so to speak) the fulcrum, has its position regulated by at tachment to a
                    subsidiary piston-</p>
                <p>rod, which is driven by steam in a cylinder <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and is
                    forced to travel uniformly by a cataract <hi rend="italic">f</hi>. The point of
                    cut-off is determined by the rate at which the main piston overtakes the
                    cataract piston, and consequently comes early with light loads and late with
                    heavy loads.</p>
                <p>181. The government of marine engines is peculiarly difficult on account of the
                    sudden and violent fluctuations of load to which they are subjected by the
                    alternate uncovering and submersion of the screw in a heavy sea. However rapidly
                    the governor responds to increase of speed by closing the throttle-valve, an
                    excess of work is still done by the steam in the valve-chest and in the
                    high-pressure cylinder. To check the racing which results from this, it has been
                    proposed to supplement the control which the throttle-valve on the steam-pipe
                    exercises by throttling the exhaust or by spoiling the vacuum. Probably a better
                    plan is that of Messrs Jenkins and Lee, who give supplementary regulation by
                    causing the governor to open a shunt-valve which connects the top and bottom of
                    the low-pressure cylinder, thus allowing a portion of the steam in it to pass
                    the piston without doing work. In Dunlop’s pneumatic governor<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>
                    1879.</p></note> an attempt is made to anticipate the racing of the screw by
                    causing the regulator to be acted on by the changes of pressure on a diaphragm
                    which is connected by an air-pipe with an open vessel fixed under the stern of
                    the ship. A plan has recently been introduced by Mr W. B. Thompson to prevent
                    the racing of marine engines by working the valves from a lay shaft which is
                    driven at a uniform speed by an entirely independent engine. So long as this lay
                    shaft is not driven too fast the main engine is obliged to follow it; if the lay
                    shaft is driven faster than the main engine can follow the main engine pauses so
                    as to miss a stroke, and then goes on. Reversing the motion of the lay shaft
                    reverses the main engine.</p>
                <p>182. In connexion with governors mention may be made of an apparatus introduced
                    by Mr Moscrop to give a continuous record of fluctuations in the speed of
                    engines.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi> 1884.</p></note> It resembles a small centrifugal
                    governor, but the displacement of the balls actuates, not a regulator, but a
                    pencil which moves transversely on a ribbon of paper that is moved continuously
                    by clockwork. The recorder responds so rapidly to changes of speed as to show
                    not only the comparatively slow changes which occur from stroke to stroke, but
                    also those short-period fluctuations between a maximum and minimum, within the
                    limits of each single stroke, which will be discussed in the next chapter.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Work on the Crank-Shaft.</hi></p>
                <p>183. Besides those variations of speed which occur from stroke to stroke, which
                    it is the business of the governor to check, there are variations within each
                    single stroke over which the governor has of course no control. These are due to
                    the varying rate at which work is done on the crank-shaft during its revolution.
                    To limit them is the function of the fly-wheel, which acts by forming a
                    reservoir of energy to be drawn upon during those parts of the revolution in
                    which the work done on the shaft is less than the work done by the shaft, and to
                    take up the surplus in those parts of the revolution in which the work done on
                    the shaft is greater than the work done by it. This alternate storing and
                    restoring of energy is accomplished by slight fluctuations of speed, whose range
                    depends on the ratio which the alternate excess and defect of energy bears to
                    the whole stock the fly-wheel holds in virtue of its motion. The effect of the
                    fly-wheel may be studied by drawing a diagram of crank-effort, which shows the
                    work done on the crank in the same way that the indicator diagram shows the work
                    done on the piston. The same diagram serves another useful purpose in
                    determining the twisting and bending stress in the crank.</p>
                <p>184. The diagram of crank-effort is best drawn by representing, in rectangular
                    co-ordinates, the relation between the moment which the connecting-rod exerts to
                    turn the crank and the angle turned through by the crank. When the angle is
                    expressed in circular measure, the area of the diagram is the work done on the
                    crank.</p>
                <p>Neglecting friction, and supposing in the first place that the engine runs so
                    slowly that the forces required for the acceleration of the moving masses are
                    negligibly small, the moment of crank-effort is found by resolving the thrust P
                    of the piston-rod into a component Q along the connecting-rod and a component O
                    normal to the surface of the guide (fig. 108). The moment of crank-effort is</p>

                    and <hi rend="italic">α</hi> the angle ACB which the crank makes with the centre
                    line. A graphic determination of CN is the most convenient in practice, unless
                    the connecting rod is so long that its obliquity is negligible, when the second
                    term in the above expres sion vanishes.</p>
                <p>Fig. 109 shows the diagram of crank-effort de termined in this way for an engine
                    whose connect ing-rod is 3½</p>
                <p>times the length of its crank, and in which steam is cut off at half-stroke. The
                    thrust P is determined from the indicator diagrams of fig. 108 by taking the
                    excess of the forward pressure on one side of the piston over the back pressure
                    on the other side, and multiplying this effective pressure by the area of the
                    piston. The area of the diagram of crank-effort is the work done per
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>185. The friction of the piston in the cylinder and the piston-rod in the
                    stuffing-box is easily allowed for, when it is known, by making a suitable
                    deduction from P. Friction at the guides, at the crosshead, and at the crank-pin
                    has the effect of making the stress at each of these places be inclined to the
                    rubbing surfaces at an angle <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> the angle of repose,
                    whose tangent is the coefficient of friction. Hence O, instead of being normal
                    to the guide, is inclined at the angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> in the direction
                    which resists the piston’s motion (fig. 110); and the thrust along the
                    connecting-rod, instead of passing through the centre of each pin, is displaced
                    far enough to make an angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> with the radius at the
                    point where it meets the pin’s surface. To satisfy this condition let a
                    “friction-circle be drawn about the centre of each pin, with radius equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n533/mode/1up"

                    radius of the pin. Any line drawn tangent to this circle will make the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> with the radius of the pin at the surface of the pin. The
                    thrust of the connecting-rod must be tangent to both circles; it is drawn as in
                    fig.</p>
                <p>110, so that it resists the rotation of the pins relatively to the rod. The
                    direction of rotation of the pins is shown by curved arrows in the figure, where
                    the friction-circles are drawn to a greatly exaggerated scale. Finally, P (after
                    allowing for the friction of piston-packing and stuffing-box) is resolved into
                    Q, and Q·CM, the moment of Q on the shaft, is determined. This gives a diagram
                    of crank-effort, correct so far as friction affects it, whose area is no longer
                    equal to that of the indicator diagram. The difference, however, does not
                    represent the whole work lost through friction of the mechanism, since the
                    friction of the shaft itself, and of those parts of the engine which it drives,
                    has still to be allowed for if the frictional efficiency of the engine as a
                    whole is in question.</p>
                <p>186. The diagram of crank-effort is further modified when we take account of the
                    inertia of the piston and connecting-rod. For the purpose of investigating the
                    effects of inertia, we may assume that the crank is revolving at a sensibly
                    uniform rate of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> turns per second. Let M be the mass of
                    the piston, piston-rod, and crosshead in pounds, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    its acceleration at any instant in feet per second per second. The force
                    required to accelerate it is <hi rend="italic">Ma/g,</hi> in pounds-weight, and
                    this is to be deducted in estimating the effective value of P. The effect is to
                    reduce P during the first part of the stroke and to increase it towards the end,
                    thereby compensating to some extent for the variation which P undergoes in
                    consequence of an early cut off. If the connecting-rod is so long that its
                    obliquity may be neglected the piston has simple harmonic motion, and <hi

                    resultant moment of crank-effort.</p>
                <p>187. If, however, the friction at the crosshead and crank-pin is to be taken
                    account of the whole group of forces acting on the rod must be considered as
                    follows. Compound forces equal and opposite to F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, F

                    of the connecting-rod. If the weight of the rod is to be considered, let it also
                    be taken as a component in reckoning R, Then the rod may in any position be
                    regarded as in equilibrium under the action of the forces Q, R, and S, where Q
                    and S are the forces exerted on it by the crosshead and crank-pin respectively.
                    These three forces meet in a point <hi rend="italic">p</hi> in R, which is to be
                    found by trial, the condition being that in the diagram of forces, fig. 114,
                    after the triangle POQ has been drawn, and the force R set out, the force-line S
                    shall be parallel to a line drawn from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> tangent to the
                    friction-circle of the crank-pin, as in fig. 113. When this condition has been
                    satisfied by trial, the value of S, which is the thrust on the crank-pin, is
                    determined, and S. CM is the moment of crank-effort. This method is due to the
                    late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin, who has applied it with great generality to the
                    determination of the frictional efficiency of machinery in two important
                    papers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> vol. xxviii. p. 1 and p.
                    703.</p></note> the second of which deals in detail with the dynamics of the
                    steam-engine. Fig. 115, taken from that paper, shows the diagram of crank-effort
                    in a horizontal direct-acting engine,—the full line with friction, and the
                    dotted line without friction,—the inertia of the piston and connecting rod being
                    taken account of, as well as the weight of the latter. It exhibits well the
                    influence which the inertia of the reciprocating parts has in equalizing the
                    crank-effort in the case of an early cutoff. The cut-off is supposed to occur
                    pretty sharply at about one-sixth of the stroke. The engine considered is of
                    practical proportions, and makes four turns per second; and the initial steam
                    pressure is 50 lb per square inch. It appears from the diagram that, with a
                    slightly higher speed, or with heavier rods, a better balance of crank-effort
                    might be secured, especially as regards the stroke towards the crank, which
                    comes first in the dia gram; on the other hand, by unduly increasing the mass of
                    the reciprocat ing pieces or their speed the inequal ity due to expan sion would
                    be over-corrected and a new inequality would come in.</p>
                <p>188. When two or more cranks act on the same shaft, the joint moment of
                    crank-effort is found by combining the diagrams for the separate cranks, in the
                    manner illustrated by fig. 116, which refers to the case of two cranks at right
                    angles.</p>
                <p>Another graphic method of exhibiting the variations of moment exerted on the
                    crank-shaft during a revolution is to draw a circular diagram of crank-effort,
                    in which lines proportional to the moment are set off radially from a circular
                    line which represents the zero of moment. An example of this plan is given in
                    fig. 117, which shows the resultant moment determined by Mr A. C. Kirk for one
                    of his triple-expansion engines with three cranks set at 120° from each other.
                    Curves are drawn for various speeds, giving in each case the resultant moment
                    due to the steam pressure (as<pb break="no"

                    combined with the moments due to the inertia of the reciprocating parts. The
                    line marked 0 is the steam line without inertia—or, in other words, the curve
                    corresponding to an indefinitely slow speed. The other curves refer to the
                    number of revolutions per minute marked on them.</p>
                <p>189. To determine the fluctuations of speed during a revolution, the resultant
                    diagram of work done <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the crank-shaft is to be compared
                    with a similar diagram drawn to show the work done <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the
                    shaft in overcoming its own friction, and in overcoming the resistance of the
                    mechanism which it drives. In general the resistance may be taken as constant,
                    and the diagram of effort exerted by the crank-shaft is then a straight line, as
                    EFGHIJKL in fig. 118. At F, G, H, T, J, and K the rate at which work is being
                    done on and by the shaft is the same; hence at these points the fly - wheel is
                    neither gaining nor losing speed.</p>
                <p>The shaded area above FG is an excess of work done on the crank, and raises the
                    speed of the fly-wheel from a minimum at F to a maximum at G. From G to H the
                    fly-wheel supplies the defect of energy shown by the shaded area below GH, by
                    which the demand for work exceeds the supply; its speed again reaches a minimum
                    at H, and again a maximum at I. The excesses and defects balance in each
                    revolution if the engine is making a constant number of turns per second. In
                    what follows it is assumed that they are only a small fraction of the whole
                    energy held by the fly-wheel.</p>
                <p>Let ∆E be the greatest single amount of energy which the flywheel has to give out
                    or absorb, as determined by measuring the shaded areas of the diagram; and let ω
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and ω <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the maximum
                    and minimum values of the wheel’s angular velocity, which occur at the extremes
                    of the period during which it is storing or supplying the energy ∆E. The mean
                    angular velocity of the wheel <hi rend="italic">ω</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> will be sensibly equal to ½(ω <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + ω <hi

                    moderate. Let E <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> be the energy of the fly-wheel at

                <p>The Moscrop recorder, alluded to in § 182, exhibits the degree of unsteadiness
                    during a single revolution by the width of the line which it draws. On the other
                    hand, any bending of the line implies the quite independent characteristic of
                    unsteadiness from one revolution to another. The former is due to insufficient
                    fly-wheel energy, the latter to imperfect governing.</p>
                <p>190. An interesting consequence of the periodic alternations in crank-effort
                    which occur in each revolution has been pointed out by Mr M. Longridge.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst.
                    Mech. Eng.,</hi> May 1884, p. 163.</p></note> The fly-wheel receives its
                    alternate acceleration and retardation through changes of the torsional stress
                    in the shaft. If these occur at intervals nearly equal to the period of free
                    torsional vibration which the fly-wheel possesses in virtue of the torsional
                    elasticity of the shaft between it and the crank, strains of great amplitude
                    will arise; and Mr Longridge has suggested that this may account for the
                    observed fact that engine-shafts have been ruptured when running so that the
                    fluctuations of crank-effort occurred with one particular frequency, although
                    the greatest effort was itself much less than the shaft would safely bear.</p>

                <p>191. In classifying engines with regard to their general arrangement of parts and
                    mode of working, account has to be taken of a considerable number of independent
                    characteristics. We have, first, a general division into <hi rend="italic"
                    >condensing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">non-condensing engines,</hi> with a
                    subdivision of the condensing class into those which act by surface condensation
                    and those which use injection. Next there is the division into <hi rend="italic"
                    >compound</hi> and <hi rend="italic">non-compound,</hi> with a further
                    classification of the former as double-, triple-, or quadruple-expansion
                    engines. Again, engines may be classed as <hi rend="italic">single</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">double-acting,</hi> according as the steam acts on one or
                    alternately on both sides of the piston. Again, a few engines—such as
                    steam-hammers and certain kinds of steam-pumps—are <hi rend="italic"
                    >non-rotative,</hi> that is to say, the reciprocating motion of the piston does
                    work simply on a reciprocating piece; but generally an engine does work on a
                    continuously revolving shaft, and is termed <hi rend="italic">rotative.</hi> In
                    most cases the crank-pin of the revolving shaft is connected directly with the
                    piston-rod by a connecting-rod, and the engine is then said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">direct-acting;</hi> in other cases, of which the ordinary
                    beam-engine is the most important example, a lever is interposed between the
                    piston and the connecting-rod. The same distinction applies to non-rotative
                    pumping engines, in some of which the piston acts directly on the pump-rod,
                    while in others it acts through a beam. The position of the cylinder is another
                    element of classification, giving <hi rend="italic">horizontal, vertical,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">inclined cylinder</hi> engines. Many vertical engines are
                    further distinguished as belonging to the <hi rend="italic">inverted
                    cylinder</hi> class; that is to say, the cylinder is above the connecting-rod
                    and crank. In <hi rend="italic">oscillating cylinder engines</hi> the
                    connecting-rod is dispensed with; the piston-rod works on the crank-pin, and the
                    cylinder oscillates on trunnions to allow the piston-rod to follow the crank-pin
                    round its circular path. In <hi rend="italic">trunk engines</hi> the piston-rod
                    is dispensed with; the connecting-rod extends as far as the piston, to which it
                    is jointed, and a trunk or tubular extension of the piston, through the cylinder
                    cover, gives room for the rod to oscillate. In <hi rend="italic">rotary</hi>
                    engines there is no piston in the ordinary sense; the steam does work on a
                    revolving piece, and the necessity is thus avoided of afterwards converting
                    reciprocating into rotary motion.</p>
                <p>192. In the single-acting atmospheric engine of Newcomen the beam was a necessary
                    feature; the use of water-packing for the piston required that the piston should
                    move down in the working stroke, and a beam was needed to let the counterpoise
                    pull the piston up. Watt’s improvements made the beam no longer necessary; and
                    in one of the forms he designed it was discarded—namely, in the form of
                    pumping-engine known as the Bull engine, in which a vertical inverted cylinder
                    stands over and acts directly on the pump-rod. But the beam type was
                    generally<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0535-0512"/> retained by Watt, and for many years it remained
                    a favourite with builders of engines of the larger class. The beam formed a
                    convenient driver for pump-rods and valverods; and the parallel motion invented
                    by Watt as a means of guiding the piston-rod, which could easily be applied to a
                    beam-engine, was, in the early days of engine-building, an easier thing to
                    construct than the plane surfaces which are the natural guides of the piston-rod
                    in a direct-acting engine. In modern practice the direct-acting type has to a
                    very great extent displaced the beam type. For mill-driving and the general
                    purposes of a rotative engine the beam type is now rarely chosen. In pumping
                    engines it is more common, but even there the tendency is to use direct-acting

                <p>193. The only distinctive feature of beam-engines requiring special notice here
                    is the “parallel motion,” an ordinary form of which is shown diagram matically
                    in fig. 119. There MN</p>
                <p>is the path in which the piston-</p>
                <p>rod head, or crosshead, as it is often called, is to be guided.</p>
                <p>ABC is the middle line of half the beam, C being the fixed centre about which the
                    beam oscillates.</p>
                <p>A link BD connects a point in the beam with a radius link ED, which oscillates
                    about a fixed centre at E. A point P in BD, taken so that BP: DP:: EN: CM, moves
                    in a path which coincides very closely with the straight line MPN. Any other
                    point F in the line CP or CP produced below it, the guiding surfaces at Q are
                    avoided, but the path of P is then only very nearly straight. An example of the
                    linkage in this form, with the further modification that A is shifted out, and B
                    is brought nearer to P, occurs in the pumping engine of fig. 130 below.</p>
                <p>In by far the greater number of modern steam-engines the crosshead is guided by a
                    block sliding on planed surfaces. In many beam-engines, even, this plan of
                    guiding the piston has taken the place of the parallel motion.</p>
                <p>is made to copy this motion by means of the links AF and FG, parallel to BD and
                    AC. In the ordinary application of the parallel motion a point such as F is the
                    point of attachment of the piston-rod, and P is used to drive a pump-rod. Other
                    points in the line CP produced are occasionally made use of, by adding other
                    links parallel to AC and BD.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The kinematics of the parallel motion are discussed in
                    Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Machinery and Mill Wark,</hi> p. 275, aud rules are

                <p>Watt’s linkage gives no more than an approximation to straight-line motion, but
                    in a well-designed example the amount of deviation need not exceed one
                    four-thousandth of the length of stroke. It was for long believed that the
                    production of an exact straight-line motion by pure linkage was impossible,
                    until the problem was solved by the invention of the Peaucellier cell.<note

                    Peaucellier linkage has not been applied to the steam-engine, except in isolated
                    cases.</p>
                <p>194. Another “parallel motion” which has been used in steam-engines is shown in
                    fig. 120. AB is a link pivoted on a fixed centre at A, and connected to the
                    middle of another link PQ, which is twice the length of AB. Q is guided to move
                    in a straight line in the direction of AQ. P then moves in an exact straight
                    line through</p>
                <p>A. This is not a pure linkage, since Q slides in a fixed guide, but the distance
                    through which</p>
                <p>Q has to be guided is small compared with the stroke of P. If Q is guided to move
                    in the arc of a circle of large radius, by using a radius rod from a fixed
                    centre above or</p>
                <p>195. No type of steam-engine is so common as the horizontal direct-acting. A
                    small engine of this type, made by Messrs Tangye, and rated as a 10-horse-power
                    engine, is illustrated in figs. 121 to 124. It furnishes a good example of a
                    very numerous class, and serves to illustrate the principal parts of a complete
                    engine. Fig. 121 is a side elevation, fig. 122 a plan, fig. 123 a transverse
                    section through the bedplate in front of the cylinder, on the line<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0536-0513"/> AB; and fig. 124 is a horizontal section through
                    the cylinder, valve-chest, valve, stuffing-boxes, piston, and crosshead. The
                    bedplate is a single hollow casting, with two surfaces planed on it to serve as
                    guides (see fig. 123). At one end the bedplate forms a pillow-block for the
                    shaft, which has another main bearing independently supported beyond the
                    fly-wheel. At the other end the bedplate is shaped so as to form the cylinder
                    cover; the cylinder is bolted to this and overhangs the bed.</p>
                <p>The cylinder (of 10 inches diameter and 20 inches stroke) consists of an internal
                    “liner” of cast-iron, exactly bored, and fitted within an external cylindrical
                    casting, of which the ports and sides of the valve-chest form part. The space
                    between the liner and the external cylinder serves as a steam-jacket. The use of
                    a separate liner within the main cylinder is now general in large engines. In
                    the front cylinder cover there is a stuffing-box through which the piston-rod
                    passes. The stuffing-box is kept steam-tight by a soft packing which is pressed
                    in by a gland. In some instances the packing consists of metallic rings. The
                    cylinder cover and gland are lined with a brass ring in the hole through which
                    the piston-rod passes. The valve-rod is brought out of the valve-chest in the
                    same way. The piston is a hollow casting into which the piston-rod is screwed
                    and riveted over. It is packed by two split rings of cast-iron, which are sprung
                    into recesses turned in the circumference of the piston. This mode of packing is
                    used in locomotives and small engines. For large pistons the usual plan is to
                    employ wider split rings, called floating rings, pressed against the sides of
                    the cylinder, not by their own elasticity, but by separate springs behind them
                    in the body of the piston; they are held in place by a movable flange called a
                    junk-ring on one face of the piston. One example of the packing of a large
                    piston is shown in fig. 134. The crosshead consists of a steel centre-piece with
                    a round boss, in which the piston-rod is secured by a cotter, and a forked
                    front, where the end of the connecting-rod works on a pin. A pair of pins at top
                    and bottom carry the steel shoes or sliding-blocks, whose distance from the
                    centre is adjustable by nuts to take up wear. There is no crank; the
                    connecting-rod works on a pin fixed in a disk on the end of the shaft in front
                    of the main bearing. The valve-rod, which is worked by an eccentric just behind
                    the bearing, is extended through the end of the valve-chest, and forms the
                    plunger of a feed-pump which is bolted to the end of the chest. Frequently the
                    feed-pump is fixed at any convenient part of the bedplate, and is driven by a
                    separate eccentric, and in some cases its plunger is connected directly to the
                    crosshead. In the main bearing the shaft turns in gun-metal or phosphor-bronze
                    blocks called brasses. In heavy engines these are generally lined with Babbit’s
                    anti-friction metal or other soft alloy, and in many modern engines the brasses
                    are entirely dispensed with, a lining of Babbit’s metal being let into the
                    cast-iron surface of the bearing. When the brasses are in two pieces, the plane
                    of division between them is chosen to be that in which the wear is likely to be
                    least. A more satisfactory adjustment is possible when the brasses are in three
                    or more pieces.</p>
                <p>196. When a condenser is used with a small horizontal engine it is usually placed
                    behind the cylinder; and the air-pump, which is within the condenser, is a
                    horizontal plunger or piston-pump worked by a “tail-rod”—that is, a continuation
                    of the piston-rod past the piston and through the back cover of the cylinder.
                    Figs. 125 and 126 show in section one of Messrs Tangye’s small condensers fitted
                    with a double-acting air-pump to be driven by a tail-rod. The condenser proper
                    is the chamber A, and into it the injection-</p>
                <p>water streams continuously through perforations in the pipe B, which has a cock
                    outside to regulate the supply. The pump draws condensed water down to the lower
                    part of the vessel at either end alternately through the valves C, and forces it
                    up thence through the valves D to a chamber E, from which the delivery-pipe
                    leads out. The pump is a gun-metal piston working in a cylinder fitted with a
                    gun-metal liner. The valves are flat india-rubber rings held down in the centre
                    by a spring, which allows them to open by rising bodily, as well as by
                    bending.</p>
                <p>197. The engine of figs. 121-4 makes 85 revolutions per minute, and its mean
                    piston speed is consequently about 280 feet per minute. In some special forms of
                    small horizontal engine the design is adapted to a much more rapid reciprocation
                    of the moving masses, and the piston speed is raised to a value seldom exceeded
                    in the largest land engines, although still higher values are now common in
                    marine practice. Experience shows that the weight of engines of any one type
                    varies roughly as the piston area. Their power depends on the product of piston
                    area, piston speed, and pressure; and hence, so long as the pressures are
                    similar, the ratio of power to weight is nearly proportional to piston speed.
                    Cases present themselves in which it is desirable to make this ratio as great as
                    possible; and, apart from this, an engine making a large number of revolutions
                    per minute is a convenient motor for certain high-speed machines.</p>
                <p>A good example of a small horizontal engine, specially designed by the symmetry
                    and balance of its parts, by largeness of the bearing surfaces, and by very
                    perfect lubrication, to stand the strains which are caused by high speed, is the
                    Armington &amp; Sims engine, made in America by the patentees and in England by
                    Messrs Greenwood &amp; Batley. The bedplate is symmetrical about the line of
                    motion of the crosshead; it supplies two very long main bearings for the shaft,
                    at each end of which there is an overhung fly-wheel. The bearings have an
                    adjustable side-block to take up wear. They are formed entirely of white-metal,
                    cast on to the cast-iron pillow-blocks. In the middle are two disks, forming
                    crank-cheeks, which are weighted opposite the crank-pin, so that they balance
                    the pin and that part of the connecting-rod which may be treated as having its
                    mass applied there. The crank-pin and the crosshead-pin are wide enough to give
                    a large bearing area. The crosshead-block is a hollow bronze casting, giving an
                    exceptionally large surface of contact with the guides. The valve is a
                    piston-valve of the Trick type, which works sufficiently tight without packing.
                    The valve-rod and eccentric-rod are connected through a block which slides on a
                    fixed guide. The governor, which has been already illustrated in fig. 100, is
                    contained within one of the fly-wheels. An engine of this type, with a cylinder
                    12 inches in diameter and a stroke of 12 inches, makes 275 revolutions per
                    minute, has a piston speed of 550 feet per minute, and indicates about 80
                    horse-power. Other good examples of high speed combined with double action are
                    furnished by the Porter-Allen engine<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi>

                    have introduced for driving fans to supply air to the closed stokeholes of
                    torpedo-boats. In these a speed of 1000 revolutions per minute is made possible
                    by the use of light reciprocating parts and large bearing surfaces.</p>
                <p>198. Fig. 127 shows a large non-compound horizontal Corliss engine for
                    mill-driving, by Messrs Hick, Hargreaves, &amp; Co. The cylinder is 34 inches in
                    diameter, the stroke 8 feet, and the speed 45 revolutions per minute, giving a
                    mean piston speed of 720 feet per minute. The cylinder is steam-jacketed round
                    the barrel in the space between the liner and the outer cylinder, and also at
                    the ends, which are cast hollow for this purpose. In large horizontal engines
                    the weight of the piston tends to cause excessive wear on the lower side of the
                    cylinder. In the example shown a part of the weight is borne by a tail-rod,
                    ending in a block, which slides on a fixed guide behind the cylinder. To further
                    diminish wear the piston is sometimes made much wider from front to back than
                    the one shown here; and the device is sometimes resorted to of giving the
                    piston-rod “camber”—that is to say, an upward curvature in the middle portion,
                    which the weight of the piston reduces to straightness. Fig. 127 illustrates a
                    common method of attaching the air-pump and condenser in large horizontal
                    engines. The condenser is placed in a well in front of the cylinder, anti the
                    air-pump, which is a vertical bucket-pump, is worked by a bell-crank lever,
                    connected with the crosshead by a link. The fly-wheel of this engine is grooved
                    for rope-gearing; it is cast in segments, which are bolted to one another and to
                    the spokes, and the spokes are secured by cotters in tapered sockets in the
                    nave. It is large and heavy, to suit the inequality of driving effort which is
                    caused by the use of a single cylinder and a very early cut-off in engines of
                    this class. To facilitate starting and valve-setting, mill engines are often
                    provided with an auxiliary called a “barring” engine. The barring engine turns a
                    toothed pinion, which gears into a toothed rim in the fly-wheel, and is
                    contrived to fall automatically out of gear as soon as the main engine
                    starts.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n537/mode/1up"

                    absence of dead-points is specially important, two independent cylinders are
                    often coupled to the same shaft by cranks at right angles to each other, an
                    arrangement which allows the engine to be started readily from any position. The
                    ordinary locomotive is an example of this form. Among fixed engines of the
                    larger kind, <hi rend="italic">winding engines,</hi> in which ease of starting,
                    stopping, and reversing is essential, are very generally made by coupling a pair
                    of horizontal cylinders, with cranks at right angles to each other, on opposite
                    sides of the winding-drum, with the link-motion as the means of operating the
                    valves.</p>
                <p>200. Non-compound engines of so large a size as that of fig. 127 are
                    comparatively uncommon. Horizontal engines of the larger class are generally
                    compounded either (1) by having a high and a low pressure cylinder side by side,
                    working on two cranks at exactly or nearly right angles to each other, or (2) by
                    placing one cylinder behind the other, with the axes of both in the same
                    straight line. The latter is called the <hi rend="italic">tandem</hi>
                    arrangement. In it one piston-rod is generally common to both cylinders;
                    occasionally, however, the piston-rods are distinct, and are connected to one
                    another by a framing of parallel bars outside of the cylinders. Another con-</p>
                <p>of compound engines, the cut-off is usually effected either by an expansion
                    slide-valve or by some form of Corliss or other trip-gear.</p>
                <p>For mill engines the compound tandem and compound coupled types are now the most
                    usual, and the high-pressure cylinder is very generally fitted with Corliss
                    gear. In the compound coupled arrangement the cylinders are on separate
                    bedplates, and the flywheel is between the cranks.</p>
                <p>201. The general arrangement of vertical engines differs little from that of
                    horizontal engines. The cylinder is usually supported above the shaft by a
                    cast-iron frame resembling an inverted A, whose sides are kept parallel for a
                    part of their length to serve as guides for the crosshead. Sometimes one side of
                    the frame only is used, and the engine is stiffened by a wrought-iron column
                    between the cylinder and the base on the other side. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wall-engines</hi> are a vertical form with a flat frame or bedplate, which is
                    made to be bolted against a wall; in these the shaft is generally at the top.
                    Vertical engines are compounded, like horizontal engines, either by coupling
                    parallel cylinders to cranks at right angles (as in the ordinary marine form,
                    which will be illustrated later, § 218), or, tandem fashion, by placing the
                    high-pressure cylinder above the other. In vertical condensing engines the
                    condenser is situated at the base, and the air-pump, which has a vertical
                    stroke, is generally worked by a lever connected by a short link to the
                    crosshead. In some cases the pump is horizontal, and is worked by a crank on the
                    main shaft.</p>
                <p>202. Engines making 400 to 1600 revolutions per minute have been extensively
                    applied, in recent years, to the driving of dynamos and other high-speed
                    machines. These are for the most part single-</p>
                <p>straction, rarely followed, is to have parallel cylinders with both piston-rods
                    acting on one crank by being joined to opposite ends of one long crosshead. In
                    some recent compound engines the large cylinder is horizontal, and the other
                    lies above it in an inclined position, with its connecting-rod working on the
                    same crankpin.</p>
                <p>In tandem engines, since the pistons move together, there is no need to provide a
                    receiver between the cylinders. It is practicable to follow the “Woolf” plan of
                    allowing the steam to expand directly from the small into the large cylinder;
                    and in many instances this is done. In point of fact, however, the
                    connecting-pipe and steam-chest form an intermediate receiver of considerable
                    size, which will cause loss by “drop” (§ 113) unless steam be cut off in the
                    large cylinder before the end of the stroke. Hence it is more usual to work with
                    a moderately early cut-off in the low-pressure cylinder than to use the “Woolf”
                    plan of admitting steam to it throughout the whole stroke. Unless it is desired
                    to make the cut-off occur before half-stroke, a common slide-valve will serve to
                    distribute steam to the large cylinder. For an earlier cut-off than this a
                    separate expansion-valve is required on the low-pressure cylinder, to supplement
                    the slide-valve; and in any case, by providing a separate expansion-valve, the
                    point of cutoff is made subject to easy control, and may be adjusted so as to
                    avoid drop or to divide the work as may be desired between the two
                    cylinders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Οr,
                    alternatively, the adjustment may be made so that the steam undergoes equal
                    changes of temperature in both cylinders.</p></note> For this reason it is not
                    unusual to find an expansion-valve, as well as a common slide-valve, on the
                    low-pressure cylinder even of tandem engines. In many cases, however, the common
                    slide-valve only is used. On the high-pressure cylinder acting: steam is
                    admitted to the back of the piston only, and the connecting-rod is in
                    compression throughout the whole revolution. Besides simplifying the valves,
                    this has the important advantage that alternation of strain at the joints may be
                    entirely avoided, with the knocking aud wear of the brasses which it is apt to
                    cause. To secure, however, that the connecting-rod shall always push, there must
                    be much cushioning during the back or exhaust stroke. From a point near the
                    middle of the back stroke to the end the piston is being retarded; and, as this
                    must not be done by the rod (which would thereby be required to pull),
                    cushioning must begin there, and the work spent upon the cushion must at every
                    stage be at least as great as the loss of energy on tho part of the piston and
                    rod. In some single-acting engines this cushioning is done by compressing a
                    portion of the exhaust steam; in others the rod is kept in compression by help
                    of a supplementary piston, on which steam from the boiler presses; in Mr
                    Willans’s engine the cushioning is done by compressing air.</p>
                <p>203. A very successful example of the multiple-cylinder singleacting high-speed
                    type is the three-cylinder engine introduced by Mr Brotherhood in 1873, the most
                    recent form of which is shown in figs. 128 and 129. Fig. 128 is a longitudinal
                    and fig. 129 a transverse section. Three cylinders, set at 120° apart, project
                    from a closed casing, the central portion of which forms the exhaust. The
                    pistons are of the trunk type—that is to say, there is a joint in the piston
                    itself which allows the piston-rod to oscillate, and so makes a separate
                    connecting-rod unnecessary. The three rods work on a single crank-pin, which is
                    counterbalanced by masses<pb break="no"

                    the shaft. Steam is admitted to the back of the pistons only. It passes first
                    through a throttle-valve, which is controlled by a centrifugal spring-governor
                    (fig. 128), and is then distributed to the cylinders by three piston-</p>
                <p>piston-rod is taken advantage of to open a supplementary exhaust port (B, fig.
                    129), which remains open during a sufficient portion of the back stroke. The
                    flexible coupling C shown in fig. 128, in which the twisting moment of the shaft
                    is transmitted through disks of leather, prevents straining of the shaft and
                    bearings through any want of alignment between the shaft of the engine and that
                    of the mechanism it drives. Besides its use as a steam-engine, Mr Brotherhood’s
                    pattern has been extensively applied in driving torpedoes by means of compressed
                    air. As a steam-engine it is compounded by placing a high-pressure cylinder
                    outside of and tandem with each low-pressure cylinder.</p>
                <p>204. In other engines of this type a pair of cylinders, or a high and a low
                    pressure cylinder, are set vertically side by side, to work on cranks opposite
                    each other. The cranks aud connecting-rods are completely enclosed, and are
                    lubricated by dipping into a mixture of oil and water with which the lower part
                    of the casing is filled. In the Westinghouse engine, where there are two
                    vertical cylinders to which steam is admitted by a piston-valve, the crank-shaft
                    is situated half a crank’s length out of the line of stroke, to reduce the
                    effects of the connecting-rod’s obliquity during the working stroke.<note

                    engine the high and low pressure cylinders are tandem, and the space between the
                    piston forms an intermediate receiver. The piston-rod is hollow, and has a
                    piston-valve in it which controls the admission of steam to the high-pressure
                    cylinder and its transfer to the low-pressure cylinder. The piston-valve within
                    the rod takes its differential motion from an eccentric on the crank-pin. The
                    crosshead is itself a piston working in a cylindrical guide, in which it
                    compresses air as it rises during the back stroke in order to cushion the
                    reciprocating parts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>205. In engines for pumping or for blowing air it is not essential to drive a
                    revolving shaft, and in many forms the reciprocating motion of the steam-piston
                    is applied directly or through a beam to produce the reciprocating motion of the
                    pump-piston or plunger. On the other hand, pumping engines are frequently made
                    rotative for the sake of adding a fly-wheel. When the level of the suction water
                    is sufficiently high, horizontal engines, with the pump behind the cylinder and
                    in line with it, are generally preferred; in other cases a beam-engine or
                    vertical direct-acting engine is more common. Horizontal engines are, however,
                    employed to pump water from any depth by using triangular rocking frames, which
                    serve as bell-crank levers between the horizontal piston and vertical
                    pump-rods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an
                    account of beam and other forms of rotative pumping engines, see a paper by Mr
                    Rich, and remarks by Mr J. G. Mair, in <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst.

                <p>Fig. 130 shows a compound inverted vertical pumping engine of the non-rotative
                    class, by Messrs Hathorn, Davey, &amp; Co. Steam is distributed through lift
                    valves, and the engine is governed by the differential gear illustrated in fig.
                    107, in conjunction with a cataract, which makes the pistons pause at the end of
                    each stroke. The pistons are in line with two pump-rods, and are coupled by an
                    inverted beam which gives guidance to the crossheads by means of an approximate
                    straight-line motion, which is a modification of that of fig. 120. Surface
                    condensers are frequently used with pumping engines, the water which the engine
                    pumps serving as circulating water.</p>
                <p>206. In a very numerous class of direct-acting steam-pumps, the steam-piston and
                    the pump-piston or plunger are on the same piston-rod. In some of these a
                    rotative element is introduced, partly to secure uniformity of motion, and
                    partly for convenience of working the valves; a connecting-rod is taken from
                    some point in the piston-rod to a crank-shaft which carries a fly-wheel; or a
                    valves A, worked by an eccentric, the sheave of which is made hollow so as to
                    overhang one of the main bearings (fig. 128). Release takes place by the piston
                    itself uncovering exhaust ports in the circumference of the cylinder, and the
                    rocking motion of the slotted crosshead fixed to the rod gives rotary motion to
                    a crankpin gearing into the slot, the line of the slot being perpendicular to
                    that of the stroke. Many other steam-pumps are strictly non-rotative. In some
                    the valve is worked by tappets from the piston-rod. In the Blake steam-pump a
                    tappet worked by the piston as it reaches each end of its stroke throw’s over an
                    auxiliary steam-valve, which admits steam to one or other side of an auxiliary
                    piston carrying the main slide-valve. In Cameron &amp; Floyd’s form one of a
                    pair of tappet-valves at the ends of the cylinder is opened by the piston as it
                    reaches the end of the stroke, and puts one or other side of an auxiliary
                    piston, which carries the slide-valve, into communication with the exhaust, so
                    that it is thrown over. In the Worthington engine—a design which has had much
                    success in America, and is now being introduced in England by Messrs Simpson—two
                    steam cylinders are placed side by side, each working its own pump-piston. The
                    piston-rod of each is connected by a short link to a swinging bar, which
                    actuates the slide-valve of the other steam-cylinder. In this way one piston
                    begins its stroke when the motion of the other is about to cease, and a smooth
                    and continuous action is secured.</p>
                <p>207. The Worthington engine has been extensively applied, on a large scale, to
                    raise water for the supply of towns and to force oil through “pipe-lines” in the
                    United States. In the larger sizes it is made compound, each high-pressure
                    cylinder having a low-pressure cylinder tandem with it on the same rod. Owing to
                    the lightness of the reciprocating masses, and their comparatively slow
                    acceleration, their inertia does not compensate, to any great extent, for tho
                    inequality of pressure on the pump-piston that would be caused by an early
                    cut-off in the steam cylinder (see § 186). To meet this difficulty, and make
                    high expansion practicable, an ingenious addition has recently been made to the
                    engine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    each of the piston-rods is connected to tho piston-rods of a pair of oscillating
                    cylinders B, B, which contain water and communicate with a reservoir full of air
                    compressed to a pressure of about 300 lb per square inch. When the stroke
                    (which<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n539/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0539-0516"/> takes place in the direction of the arrow) begins
                    the pistons are at first forced in, and work is at first done by the main
                    piston-rod, through the compensating cylinders</p>
                <p>B, B, on the compressed air in the reservoir. This continues until the crosshead
                    has advanced so that the cylinders stand at right angles to the line of stroke.
                    Then for the re mainder of the stroke the compen sating cylinders assist in
                    driving the main piston, and the compressed air gives out the energy which it
                    stored in the earlier portion. The volume of the air reservoir is so much
                    greater than the volume of the cylinders B, B that the air pressure remains
                    nearly constant throughout the stroke. Any leakage from the cylinder or
                    reservoir is made good by a small pump which the engine drives. One advantage
                    which this method of equalizing the effort of a steam-engine piston has (as
                    compared with making use of the inertia of the reciprocating masses) is that the
                    effort, when adjusted to be uniform at one speed, remains uniform although the
                    speed be changed, provided the inertia of the reciprocating parts be small. In
                    the Worthington “high-duty” engine, where this plan is in use, the high and low
                    pressure cylinders are each provided with a separate expansion-valve of the
                    rocking-cylinder type, as well as a slide-valve; the cut-off is early, and the
                    efficiency is as high as in other pumping engines of the best class.</p>
                <p>208. Mr Hall’s “pulsometer” is a peculiar pumping engine without cylinder or
                    piston, which may be regarded as the modern representative of tho engine of
                    Savery (§ 6). The sectional view, fig. 132, shows its principal parts. There are
                    two chambers A, A', narrowing towards the top, where the steam-pipe B enters. A
                    ball-valve C allows steam to pass into one of the chambers and closes the other.
                    Steam entering (say) the right-hand chamber forces water out of it past the
                    clack-valve V into a delivery pas sage D, which is connected with an air-</p>
                <p>vessel. When the water-level in A sinks so far that steam begins to blow through
                    the delivery-passage, the water and steam are disturbed and so brought into
                    intimate contact, the steam in A is condensed, and a partial vacuum is formed.
                    This causes the ball-valve C to rock over and close the top of A, while water
                    rises from the suc tion-pipe E to fill that chamber. At the same time steam
                    begins to enter the other chamber A', discharging water from it, and the same
                    series of actions is repeated in either chamber alternately. While the water is
                    being driven out there is comparatively little condensation of steam, partly
                    because the shape of the vessel does not promote the formation of eddies, and
                    partly because there is a cushion of air between the steam and the water. Near
                    the top of each chamber is a small air-valve opening inwards, which allows a
                    little air to enter each time a vacuum is formed. When any steam is condensed,
                    the air mixed with it remains on the cold surface and forms a non-con ducting
                    layer. The pulsometer is, of course, far from efficient as a thermodynamic
                    engine, but its suitability for situations where other steam-pumps cannot be
                    used, and the extreme simplicity of its working parts, make it valuable in
                    certain cases.</p>
                <p>209. We have seen that the tendency of modern steam practice is towards higher
                    pressures, and that this means a gain both in efficiency and in power for a
                    given weight of engine. High pressure, or indeed any pressure materially above
                    that of the atmosphere, is out of the question when engine and boiler are to
                    work without the regular presence of an attendant. Mr Davey has recently
                    introduced a domestic motor which deserves notice from the fact that it employs
                    steam at atmospheric pressure. One form of this successful little engine is
                    shown in fig. 133. The boiler—which serves as the frame of the engine —is of
                    cast-iron, and is fitted with a cast-iron internal fire-box, with a vertical
                    flue which is traversed by a water-bridge. The cylinder, which is enclosed
                    within the upper part of the boiler, and the piston are of gun-metal, and work
                    without lubrication. Steam is admitted by an ordinary slide-valve, also of
                    gun-metal, worked by an eccentric in the usual way. The condenser stands behind
                    the boiler; it consists of a number of upright tubes in a box, through which a
                    current of cold water circulates from a supply-pipe at the bottom to an
                    overflow-pipe at the top. In larger sizes of the motor the cylinder stands on a
                    distinct frame, and the boiler has a hopper fire-box, which will take a charge
                    of coke sufficient to drive the engine for several hours without attention.
                    About 6 or 7 lb of coke are burned per horse-power per hour.</p>
                <p>210. From the earliest days of the rotative engine attempts have been made to
                    avoid the intermittent reciprocating motion which an ordinary piston-engine
                    first produces and then converts into motion of rotation. Murdoch, the
                    contemporary of Watt, proposed an engine consisting of a pair of spur-wheels
                    gearing with one another in a chamber through which steam passed by being
                    carried round the outer sides of the wheels in the spaces between successive
                    teeth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Farey's <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on the Steam Engine,</hi> p. 676.</p></note></p>
                <p>In a more modern wheel-engine (Dudgeon’s) the steam was admitted by ports in
                    side-plates into the clearance space behind teeth in gear with one another, just
                    after they had passed the line of centres. From that point to the end of the arc
                    of contact the clearance space increased in volume; and it was therefore
                    possible, by stopping the admission of steam at an intermediate point, to work
                    expansively. The difficulty of maintaining steam-tight connexion between the
                    teeth and the side-plates on which the faces of the wheels slide is obvious; and
                    the same difficulty has prevented the success of many other forms of rotary
                    engine. These have been devised in immense variety, in many cases, it would
                    seem, with the idea that a distinct mechanical advantage was to be secured by
                    avoiding the reciprocating motion of a piston.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A large number of proposed rotary engines are
                    described, and their kinematic relations to one another are discussed, in

                    Kennedy.</p></note> In point of fact, however, very few forms entirely escape
                    having pieces with reciprocating motion. In all rotary engines, with the
                    exception of steam turbines,—where work is done by the kinetic impulse of
                    steam,—there are steam chambers which alternately expand and contract in volume,
                    and this action usually takes place through a more or less veiled reciprocation
                    of working parts. So long as engines work at a moderate speed there is little
                    advantage in avoiding reciprocation; the alternate starting and stopping of
                    piston and piston-rod does not affect materially the frictional efficiency,
                    throws no deleterious strain on the joints, and need not disturb the equilibrium
                    of the machine as a whole. The case is different when very high speeds are
                    concerned; it is then desirable as far as possible to limit the amount of
                    reciprocating motion and to reduce the masses that partake in it.</p>
                <p>211. A recent interesting and successful example of the rotary type is the
                    spherical engine of Mr Beauchamp Tower,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    moving pieces in a Hooke’s joint. Imagine a Hooke’s joint, uniting two shafts
                    set obliquely to one another, to be made up of a central disk to which the two
                    shafts are hinged by semicircular plates, each plate working in a hinge which
                    forms a diameter of the central disk, the two hinges being on opposite sides of
                    the disk and at right angles to one another. Further, let the disk and the
                    hinged pieces be enclosed in a spherical chamber through whose walls the shafts
                    project. As the shafts revolve each of the four spaces bounded by the disk, a
                    hinged piece, and the chamber wall will suffer a periodic increase and
                    diminution of volume, between limits which depend on the angle at which the
                    shafts are set. In Mr Tower’s engine this arrangement is modified by using
                    spherical sectors, each a quarter sphere, in place of semicircular plates, for
                    the pieces in which the shafts terminate. The shafts are set at 135°. Each of
                    the four enclosed cavities then alters in volume from zero to a quarter sphere,
                    back to zero, again to a quarter sphere, and again back to zero, in a complete
                    revolution of the shafts. In practice the central disk is a plate of finite
                    thickness, whose edge is kept steam-tight in the enclosing chamber by
                    spring-packing, and the sectors are reduced to an extent corresponding to the
                    thickness of the central disk. One shaft is a dummy and runs free, the other is
                    the driving-shaft. Steam is admitted and exhausted by ports in the spherical
                    sectors, whose backs serve as revolving slide-valves. It is admitted to each
                    cavity during the first part of each periodical increase of the cavity’s volume.
                    It is then cut off and allowed to expand as the cavity further enlarges, and is
                    exhausted as the cavity contracts. If the working shaft, to which the driven
                    mechanism serves as a fly-wheel, revolves uniformly, the dummy shaft is
                    alternately accelerated and retarded. Apart from this, the only reciprocating
                    motion is the small amount of oscillation which the comparatively light central
                    disk undergoes.</p>

                    of the disk. Two curved pistons are fixed on each side of the gimbal-ring, and
                    as the shafts revolve these work in a corresponding pair of cavities, which may

                <p>212. Attempts have been made from time to time to devise steam-engines of the
                    turbine class, where rotation of a wheel is produced either by reaction from a
                    jet of escaping steam or by impact of a jet upon revolving blades. A revolving
                    piece which is to extract even a respectable fraction of the kinetic energy of a
                    steam jet must move with excessive velocity. In Mr C. A. Parsons’s steam-turbine
                    this difficulty is overcome and a moderate degree of efficiency is secured by
                    using a series of central-flow turbine wheels, in the form of perforated disks,
                    all on one shaft, with fixed disks between which are perforated to serve as
                    guide-blades. Steam passes from end to end of the series, giving up a small
                    portion of its energy to each, but retaining little at the end.</p>
                <p>XII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Marine Engines.</hi></p>
                <p>213. The early steamers were fitted with paddle-wheels, and the engines used to
                    drive them were for the most part modified beam-engines. Bell’s “Comet” (§ 21)
                    was driven by a species of inverted beam-engine, and another form of inverted
                    beam, known as the side-lever engine, was for long a favourite with marine
                    engineers. In the side-lever engine the cylinder was vertical, and the
                    piston-rod projected through the top. From a crosshead on the rod a pair of
                    links, one on each side of the cylinder, led down to the ends of a pair of
                    horizontal beams or levers below, which oscillated about a fixed gudgeon at or
                    near the middle of their length. The two levers were joined at their other ends
                    by a crosstail, from which a connecting-rod was taken to the crank above. The
                    side-lever engine is now obsolete.</p>
                <p>In American practice, engines of the beam type, with a braced-beam supported on A
                    frames above the deck, are still common in river-steamers and coasters.</p>
                <p>214. An old form of direct-acting paddle-engine was the steeple-engine, in which
                    the cylinder was set vertically below the crank. Two piston-rods projected
                    through the top of the cylinder, one on each side of the shaft and of the crank.
                    They were united by a crosshead sliding in vertical guides, and from this a
                    return-connecting-rod led to the crank.</p>
                <p>215. Modern paddle-wheel engines are usually of one of the following types. (1)
                    In <hi rend="italic">oscillating cylinder engines</hi> the cylinders are set
                    under the crank-shaft, and the piston-rods are directly connected to the cranks.
                    The cylinders are supported on trunnions which give them the necessary freedom
                    of oscillation to follow the movement of the crank. Steam is admitted through
                    the trunnions to slide-valves on the sides of the cylinders. In some instances
                    the mean position of the cylinders is inclined instead of vertical; and
                    oscillating engines have been arranged with one cylinder before and another
                    behind the shaft, both pistons working on one crank. The oscillating cylinder
                    type is best adapted for what would now be considered comparatively low
                    pressures of steam. (2) <hi rend="italic">Diagonal engines</hi> are
                    direct-acting engines of the ordinary connecting-rod type, with the cylinders
                    fixed on an inclined bed and the guides sloping up towards the shaft.</p>
                <p>216. When the screw-propeller began to take the place of paddle-wheels in
                    ocean-steamers, the increased speed which it required was at first supplied by
                    using spur-wheel gearing in conjunction with one of the forms of engines then
                    usual in paddle steamers. After a time types of engine better suited to the
                    screw were introduced, and were driven fast enough to be connected directly to
                    the screw-shaft. The smallness of the horizontal space on either side of the
                    shaft formed an obstacle to the use of horizontal engines, but this difficulty
                    was overcome in several ways. In Penn’s trunk-engine, still used in the navy,
                    the engine is shortened by attaching the connecting-rod directly to the piston,
                    and using a hollow piston-rod, called a trunk, large enough to allow the
                    connecting-rod to oscillate inside it. The trunk extends through both ends of
                    the cylinder and forms a guide for the piston. It has the drawback of requiring
                    very large stuffing-boxes, of wasting cylinder space, and of presenting a large
                    surface of metal to alternate heating by steam and cooling by contact with the
                    atmosphere. The use of high-pressure steam is likely to make the trunk-engine
                    obsolete.</p>
                <p>217. The return-connecting-rod engine is another horizontal form much used in the
                    navy. It is a steeple-engine placed horizontally, with two, and in some cases
                    four, piston-rods in each cylinder. The piston-rods pass clear of the shaft and
                    the crank, and are joined beyond it in a guided crosshead, from which a
                    connecting-rod returns.</p>
                <p>Ordinary horizontal direct-acting engines with a short stroke and a short
                    connecting-rod are also common in warships, where the horizontal is frequently
                    preferred to the vertical type of engine for the sake of keeping the machinery
                    below the water-line. In horizontal marine engines the air-pump and condenser
                    are generally placed on the opposite side of the shaft from the cylinder, which
                    balances the weight and allows the air-pump to be driven direct.</p>
                <p>218. In merchant ocean-steamers one general type of engine is universal, and the
                    same type is now to an increasing extent adopted in naval practice. This is the
                    inverted vertical direct-acting engine, generally with two or more cylinders
                    placed side by side directly over the shaft. In exceptional cases a single
                    cylinder has been used, with a fly-wheel on the shaft. Two, three, and four
                    cylinders are common.</p>
                <p>The most usual form of existing marine engine is the two-cylinder compound
                    arrangement, with cranks at right angles or nearly at right angles, of which
                    figs. 135, 136, 137 (pp. 518-20) show a characteristic example (the engines of
                    the s.s. “Tartar,” by Messrs John &amp; James Thomson, Glasgow).</p>
                <p>Fig. 135 is an end elevation, fig. 136 a longitudinal section through the centre
                    of the engines, and fig. 137 a thwart-ship section through the condenser and
                    air-pump. The cylinders are 50 and 91 inches in diameter, and the stroke is 5
                    feet. Both cylinders are fitted with liners, and are steam-jacketed.
                    Double-ported slide-valves are used on both, and the high-pressure valve has a
                    reliefring. The crosshead guides are fitted on the side on which the crosshead
                    bears when the engines are going ahead, with a hollow box behind the guiding
                    surface, and cold water is kept circulating in this to prevent the guides from
                    heating.</p>
                <p>The crank-shaft is of Vicker’s steel, 17½ inches in diameter. The condenser is in
                    the place it usually has in engines of this type,— in the lower part of the
                    backframe, with its tubes running horizontally from end to end of the engine.
                    There are 1400 tubes, of 1 inch diameter and 1½ inch pitch. The air-pumps are of
                    the singleacting bucket kind, and are driven by a lever from the crosshead.</p>
                <p>Centrifugal circulating pumps are used, driven by a pair of independent small
                    vertical engines. The link-motion is worked by steam starting and reversing
                    gear, which appears on the left side of the engine in fig. 135. These engines
                    work with a boiler pressure of 90 lb, and indicate 3560 horse-power. Fig. 134
                    shows, on a larger scale, the piston packing, which consists of a pair of
                    floating rings, pressed out by a spiral spring behind them.</p>
                <p>219. Two other arrangements of double compound (as distinguished from
                    triple-expansion) marine engines of the inverted vertical type require notice.
                    One is the tandem arrangement, largely adopted in the steamers of the “White
                    Star” line. In these each crank is operated by an independent pair of compound
                    cylinders, the high-pressure cylinder being on top of the low-pressure cylinder,
                    with one piston-rod common to both, The valves of both are worked by a single
                    pair of eccentrics with a link-motion; the valve-rod of the low-pressure
                    cylinder extends through the top of its valve-chest, and is joined either
                    directly or by a short lever with the valve-rod of the high-pressure cylinder.
                    Generally two pairs of tandem cylinders are placed side by side, one pair abaft
                    the other, to work on cranks at right angles. In exceptionally large engines
                    three pairs have been used, working on<pb break="no"

                    cranks in uniformity of effort on the shaft. To facilitate removing the pistons
                    from the cylinders, the large cylinder has in some cases been set above the
                    other.</p>
                <p>220. The other arrangement of double compound marine engine has three cylinders
                    set in line fore and aft. The middle one is the high-pressure cylinder; the
                    other two receive steam from it, and form together the equivalent of one large
                    low-pressure cylinder. The three work on cranks at 120° apart. Besides securing
                    the advantage in uniformity of effort which three cranks have over two, this
                    form avoids the use, in very powerful engines, of a low-pressure cylinder of
                    excessive size. On the other hand, the three-cylinder form takes up more space,
                    and has a larger number of working parts. In the most powerful engines that have
                    yet been constructed this three-cylinder arrangement is followed. The “Umbria”
                    and “Etruria” have a 71-inch high-pressure cylinder between two 105-inch
                    low-pressure cylinders, with a stroke of 6 feet. These engines, which were built
                    just before the introduction of triple expansion, are supplied with steam at a
                    pressure of 110</p>

                <p>221. During the last two or three years a great advance has taken place in marine
                    engineering by the general introduction of triple-expansion engines, and by an
                    increase in steam pressure which the system of triple expansion makes
                    practicable. In 1874 the steamer “Propontis” was fitted with a set of
                    three-crank triple-expansion engines, designed by Mr A. C. Kirk. The experiment
                    was prevented from being fully successful by the failure of the boilers, which
                    were of a special type. Another experiment with triple engines in the yacht
                    “Isa” in 1877 prepared the way for their application to regular ocean service.
                    In 1882 the steamship “Aberdeen,” with triple engines, designed by Mr Kirk, to
                    work with steam of 125 lb pressure, supplied from double-ended steel boilers of
                    the ordinary marine type, demon strated the advantage and safety of the system.
                    Since then its use has become general in new steamers, and in many cases the
                    older double engines are being removed to give place to engines of the
                    triple-expansion type, with the effect of reducing the consumption of coal by
                    about</p>
                <p>25 per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The rapid
                    progress of the system of triple expansion may be judged from the fact mentioned
                    by Mr W. Parker of Lloyds in a recent paper (<hi rend="italic">Engineering,</hi>
                    July 30, 1886), that, out of 199 engines then being built for merchant steamers,
                    128 sets were of the triple-expansion type. For war-ships also triple engines
                    are being built of sizes up to 13,000 horse-power. For a discussion of several
                    important points in the design of triple-expansion engines, see a paper by R.
                    Wyllie, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> Oct. 1886.</p></note></p>
                <p>222. In the most common arrangement of triple-expansion engines three cylinders
                    are ranged in line, fore and aft, working on cranks at 120° apart.</p>
                <p>Piston-valves are generally preferred, and these are not uncommonly worked by
                    some form of radial valve-gear instead of the ordinary link-motion. An advantage
                    of this is that the space which would be taken up by eccentrics upon the shaft
                    is saved, and longer main bearings are in consequence possible, without
                    spreading the engines in the fore-and-aft direction. An objectionable feature of
                    the three-cylinder triple engine is its length; on the other hand, the high
                    speed and high pressure which are features of modern practice make long bearings
                    indispensable.</p>
                <p>223. To avoid the length of the three-crank engine, Mr Brock and others have made
                    engines of the triple-expansion type with two cranks, by putting the high and
                    the intermediate pressure cylinders above and tandem with two low-pressure
                    cylinders. Mi-Brock has also built four-cylinder <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadruple</hi>-expansion engines of a similar form (with two cranks), and
                    estimates that they show an economy in coal consumption of 5 per cent. as
                    compared with triple-expansion engines working with the same pressure of
                    steam.</p>
                <p>224. Steam-jackets are retained by some but not by all builders; where they are
                    employed the boiler steam is usually reduced in pressure before admission to the
                    intermediate and low-pressure cylinder jackets and to the receiver-jackets. The
                    feed-water is frequently heated to about 200° F. by Weir’s plan of condensing in
                    it, by common injection, a quantity of steam taken from the second receiver;
                    this has the advantage of freeing it of air, and of preventing local chilling in
                    the boiler. In present-day practice the boiler pressure, for a triple-expansion
                    engine, ranges from 120 to 170 lb per square inch (by gauge), and it does not
                    appear that any material increase of this is possible without a complete
                    departure from the present type of marine boiler. On the other hand, without a
                    material increase of pressure there is little advantage in quadruple
                    expansion.</p>
                <p>225. Surface condensation was introduced in marine engines by S. Hall in 1831,
                    but was not brought into general use until much later. Previous to this it had
                    been necessary, in order to avoid the accumulation of too dense brine in the
                    boiler, to blow off a portion of the brine at short intervals and replace it by
                    sea water, a process which of course involved much waste of heat. By the use of
                    surface condensers it became possible to use the same portion of water over and
                    over again. The very freedom of the condensed water from dissolved mineral
                    substances was for a time an obstacle to the adoption of surface condensers, for
                    it was found that the boiler, no longer protected by a deposit of scale, became
                    rapidly corroded through the action of acids formed by the decomposition of the
                    lubricating oil. This objection was overcome by introducing a sufficient amount
                    of salt water to allow some scale to form, and the use of surface condensers
                    soon became universal on steamers plying in sea water. The marine condenser
                    consists of a multitude<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0542-0519"/> of tubes, generally of brass, about ¾ of an inch
                    in diameter. Through these cold sea-water is made to circulate, while the steam
                    is brought into contact with their outside surfaces. In some cases, especially
                    in Admiralty practice, cold water circulates outside the tubes and the steam
                    passes inside.</p>
                <p>226. The ordinary marine engine has four pumps:—the air-pump, which is made large
                    enough to serve in case injection instead of surface-condensation should at any
                    time be resorted to; the feedpump; the circulating-pump, which maintains a
                    current of seawater through the tubes of the condenser; and the bilge-pump,
                    which discharges any water accumulated by leakage or otherwise in the bilge of
                    the ship. The pumps are so arranged that in the event of a serious leak the
                    circulating-pump can also draw its supply from the bilge. In most engines,
                    especially those of less recent construction, the four pumps are placed behind
                    the condenser, and are worked by a single crosshead driven by a lever, the other
                    end of which is connected by a short link with one of the crossheads of the
                    engine. It is now becoming common to use a small engine, distinct from the main
                    engine, to drive the feed-pump, and to supply circulating water by a centrifugal
                    pump also driven by a separate engine.</p>
                <p>227. In the improvement of the marine engine two points are noteworthy,—reduction
                    in the rate of consumption of coal per horsepower, and reduction in the weight
                    of the machine (comprising the engine proper anti the boilers) per horsepower.
                    The second consideration is in some cases of even more moment than the first,
                    especially in war-ships.</p>
                <p>Progress has been made, in both respects, by increase of steam pressure, and, in
                    the second respect especially, by increase of piston speed. Fifty years ago the
                    boilers of marine engines made steam at a pressure of about 5 lb per square inch
                    above that of the atmosphere. By 1860 compound engines were in use with
                    pressures ranging from 25 to 40 lb. In 1872 statistics collected for nineteen
                    ocean steamers showed that the average consumption of coal was then 2·11 lb per
                    H.P. per hour, the boiler-pressure 45 to 60 lb, and the mean piston speed about
                    375 feet per minute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir
                    F. J. Bramwell, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.</hi>,1872.</p></note>
                    These were for the most part two-cylinder compound engines of the vertical
                    inverted type. Nine years later statistics for thirty engines of the same type
                    showed a consumption of 1·83 lb of coal, a mean boiler pressure of 77½ lb, and a
                    mean piston speed of 467 feet per minute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    as high as 165 lb; a piston speed of 700 or 800 feet per minute is not uncommon
                    in naval engines, aud in some cases it has risen to over 1000 feet per
                    minute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Marshall and

                    about by the change from double-expansion engines working at (say) 80 lb to
                    triple engines at 160 lb or more is variously estimated at from 18 to 25 per
                    cent. Much of this is due simply to the increased range of temperature through
                    which the working substance is carried; but it appears that the actual
                    performance of the triple engine is better than that of the double compound in a
                    ratio greater than that by which its ideal efficiency—as an engine using a wider
                    range of temperature—exceeds that of the other; and this is to be ascribed to
                    the same causes as have been already discussed in speaking of the advantage of
                    the compound over the simple engine. Apart from its greater economy of coal, the
                    triple engine owes some of its practical success to the mechanical superiority
                    of three driving cranks over two.</p>
                <p>228. The relation of weight of machinery to power developed, and the causes which
                    affect this ratio, have recently been discussed by Messrs Marshall and Weighton,
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> from whose paper the following figures are taken.
                    Before the introduction of triple expansion and forced draught the weight of
                    engines in the mercantile marine, including the boilers and the water in them,
                    was 480 lb per I.H. P. In the navy this was reduced, chiefly by the use of
                    lighter framing, with the object of minimizing weight, to 360 lb. Triple-engines
                    of the merchant type, without forced draught, are only slightly lighter than
                    double engines; but in naval practice, where forced draught, greatly increased
                    speed, and the use of steel for frames and working parts have combined to reduce
                    the ratio of weight to power, a marked reduction in weight is apparent. A recent
                    set of vertical triple engines, which with natural draught indicate 2200 H.P.,
                    and with a draught forced by pressure in the stokehole equal to 2 inches of
                    water indicate 4000 H. P., weigh under the latter condition (along with the
                    boilers) only 155 lb per I.H.P. In another set, in which the draught is forced
                    by a pressure of 3 inches, and the cylinders are only 15½, 24, and 37 inches in
                    diameter, with a stroke of 16 inches, the indicated horse-power is 4200, and the
                    weight of engines and boilers is 136 lb per I.H.P. In these the boilers are of
                    the locomotive type, and the mean piston speed is 1066 feet per minute. Even
                    these light weights are surpassed in smaller engines, such as those of torpedo
                    boats. In so far as this immense development of power from a small weight o
                    machinery is due to high piston speed it is secured without loss —indeed with
                    some gain—of thermodynamic efficiency , forced draught, however, without a
                    corresponding extension of the heating<pb break="no"

                    fuel. With a given type of engine there is a certain ratio of expansion which
                    gives a minimum in the ratio of weight to power; when this ratio of expansion is
                    exceeded the engines have to he enlarged to an extent that more than
                    counterbalances the saving in boiler weight; when a less ratio of expansion is
                    used the boilers have to be enlarged to an extent that more than counterbalances
                    the reduction of weight in the engine proper.<note anchored="true"

                <p>229. The ordinary locomotive consists of a pair of direct acting horizontal or
                    nearly horizontal engines, fixed in a rigid frame under the front end of a
                    boiler of the type described in § 133, and coupled to the same shaft by cranks
                    at right angles, each with a single slide-valve worked by a link-motion, or by a
                    form of radial gear. The engine is non-condensing, except in special cases, and
                    the exhaust steam, delivered at the base of the funnel through a blast-pipe,
                    serves to produce a draught of air through the furnace. In some instances a
                    portion of the exhaust steam, amounting to about one-fifth of the whole, is
                    diverted to heat the feed-water. In tank engines the feed-water is carried in
                    tanks on the engine itself; in other engines it is carried behind in a
                    tender.</p>
                <p>230. On the shaft are a pair of driving-wheels, whose frictional adhesion to the
                    rails furnishes the necessary tractive force. In some engines a single pair of
                    driving-wheels are used; in many more a greater tractive force is secured by
                    having two equal driving-wheels on each side, connected by a coupling-rod
                    between pins on the outside of the wheels. In goods engines a still greater
                    proportion of the whole weight is utilized to give tractive force by coupling
                    three and even four wheels on each side. These arrangements are distinguished by
                    the terms “four-coupled,” “six-coupled,” and “eight-coupled” applied to the
                    engines. In <hi rend="italic">inside-cylinder</hi> engines the cylinders are
                    placed side by side within the frame of the engine, and their connecting-rods
                    work on cranks in the driving shaft. In <hi rend="italic">outside-cylinder</hi>
                    engines the cylinders are spread apart far enough to lie outside the frame of
                    the engine, and to work on crank-pins on the outsides of the driving wheels.
                    This dispenses with the cranked axle, which is the weakest part of a locomotive
                    engine. Owing to the frequent alternation of strain to which it is subject, a
                    locomotive crank axle is peculiarly liable to rupture, and has to be removed
                    after a certain amount of use.</p>
                <p>In some locomotives the leading wheels are coupled to driving wheels behind them,
                    but it is now generally preferred to have under the front of the engine two or
                    four smaller wheels which do not form part of the driving system. These are
                    carried in a <hi rend="italic">bogie,</hi> that is, a small truck upon which the
                    front end of the boiler rests by a swivel-pin or plate which allows the bogie to
                    turn, so as to adapt itself to curves in the line, and thus obviate the grinding
                    of tyres and danger of derailment which would be caused by using a long rigid
                    wheel-base. The bogie appears to have been of English origin;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Min. Proc.
                    Inst. C.E.,</hi> vol. liii. 3, p. SO.</p></note> it was brought into general use
                    in America, and is now common in English as well as in American practice.
                    Instead of a four-wheeled bogie, a single pair of leading wheels are also used,
                    carried by a Bissel <hi rend="italic">pony</hi> truck, which has a swing-bolster
                    pivoted by a radius bar about a point some distance behind the axis of the
                    wheels. This has the advantage of combining lateral with radial movement of the
                    wheels, both being required if the wheel base is to be properly accommodated to
                    the curve. Another method of getting lateral and radial freedom is the plan used
                    by Mr Webb of carrying the leading axle in a box curved to the arc of a circle,
                    and free to slide laterally for a short distance, under the control of springs,
                    in curved guides.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>231. In inside-cylinder engines the slide-valves are frequently placed back to
                    back in a single valve-chest between the cylinders. The width of the engine
                    within the frame leaves little room for them there, and they are reduced to the
                    flattest possible form, in some cases with split ports, half above and half
                    below a partition in a central horizontal plane. In some of Mr Stroudley’s
                    engines the valves are below the cylinders, with faces sloping down towards the
                    front, while the cylinders themselves slope slightly up. In many engines the
                    valves work on horizontal planes above the cylinders; this position is specially
                    suitable when Joy’s or some other form of radial gear is used instead of the
                    link-motion. Radial valve-gears have the advantage, which is of considerable
                    moment in inside-cylinder engines, that the part of the shafts’ length which
                    would otherwise be needed for eccentrics is available to increase the width of
                    main bearings and crank-pins, and to strengthen the crank-cheeks. Wal-</p>
                <p>shaert’s gear is very extensively used on Continental locomotives, and Joy’s has
                    now been applied to a large num ber of British engines.</p>
                <p>232. In a powerful locomotive of the ordinary type the cylinders are 17 to 19
                    inches in diameter, with a stroke of about 26 inches. The steam pressure is 130
                    to 175 lb.</p>
                <p>The horse-power ranges up to about 700. A passenger engine for express service
                    has driving-wheels from 7 to 8 feet in diameter, and weighs, without the tender,
                    about 40 tons. Of this nearly 15 tons is borne by each driving axle.<note

                    to the frame, which consists of a single pair of steel plates, extending from
                    end to end and united by other transverse plates, one of which, called the
                    motion-plate, gives support to the guide-bars, and another holds the draw-bar.
                    Another form of frame is built up of two longitudinal plates on each side. In
                    the engine illustrated the valves are above the cylinders, and are worked by

                    it is universal. There the cylinders are in castings which are bolted together
                    to form a saddle on which the bottom of the smoke-box sits. The slide-valves are
                    on the tops of the cylinders, and are worked through rocking levers from an ordi
                    nary link-motion. Other features by which American practice is dis tinguished
                    are the use of bars in stead of plates for the frames, of cast-iron wheels with
                    chilled rims instead of wrought-iron wheels with steel rims shrunk or forced on,
                    and steel fire-boxes and wrought-iron tubes instead of copper fire-boxes and
                    brass tubes. Fig. 139, which is a half section through one cyl inder of an
                    American locomotive, by the Balwin Company of Phila delphia, shows the position
                    of the cylinders and valves.</p>
                <p>234. Locomotive engines have been compounded in cylinders are fixed outside the
                    frames, and drive the rear driving axle by crank-pins at right angles to one
                    another. A single low-pressure cylinder of very large size is set beneath the
                    smoke-box, and drives a crank in the middle of the forward driving axle. The
                    driving axles are not coupled, and the phase relation of the low-pressure to the
                    high-pressure stroke is liable to alter through unequal slip on the part of the
                    wheels. This, however, is of no material consequence, on account of the large
                    size of the intermediate receiver and the uniformity with which the two
                    high-pressure cylinders deliver steam to it. The receiver is formed, as in M.
                    Mallet’s arrangement, by leading long connecting pipes through the smoke-box.
                    All three slide-valves are worked by Joy’s gear. Those of the low-pressure
                    cylinders are placed below the cylinders (an arrangement which has the advantage
                    of letting the valve fall away from the port-face when the engine is running
                    down hill with the steam-valve closed); the valve of the large cylinder is above
                    it. The arrangement is completely symmetrical; it has the important mechanical
                    advantage of dispensing with coupling rods, while retaining the several ways. In
                    1876 M. A. Mallet<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> introduced, on tho
                    Bayonne and Biarritz Railway, a type of compound locomotive in which one small
                    high-pressure cylinder and one large low-pressure cylinder were used in place of
                    the two equal cylinders of a common locomotive. Outside cylinders were used in
                    the first instance, but Mallet’s system is also applied to inside-cylinder
                    engines. The pipe from the high to the low-pressure cylinder takes a winding
                    course through the smoke-box; this gives a sufficient volume of intermediate
                    receiver, and also dries the steam before it enters the large cylinder. A
                    reducing valve is provided through which steam of a pressure lower than that of
                    the boiler can be admitted direct to the low-pressure cylinder to facilitate
                    starting. The reversing gear is arranged to act on both cylinders by one
                    movement, and also to permit a separate adjustment of the cut-off in each.
                    Engines on Mallet’s system have been successfully used on other Continental
                    railways and in India, in some instances by conversion from the non-compound
                    form.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Von Borries, <hi

                    advantage of permitting this (in certain cases), and of requiring scarcely any
                    more working parts than are needed in a common locomotive; but it gives an
                    unsymmetrical engine. He has also proposed an engine with four cylinders,—one
                    high-pressure cylinder tandem with one low-pressure cylinder on each side.
                    Another symmetrical form has been used, in which a pair of outside high-pressure
                    cylinders are compounded with a pair of inside low-pressure cylinders.</p>
                <p>235. The most important experiment yet made in the compounding of locomotives is
                    that which Mr F. W. Webb, of the London and North-Western Railway, has been
                    conducting on a large scale since 1881.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. £ng.,</hi> 1883;
                    also <hi rend="italic">Engineerιng,</hi> May 1885.</p></note> In Mr Webb’s
                    system three cylinders are used. Two equal high-pressure greater tractive power
                    of four drivers; only one axle is cranked, and that with a single crank in the
                    centre, which leaves ample room for long bearings. A plan of Mr Webb’s engine,
                    half in section, is given in fig. 140. The results of Mr Webb’s experiments have
                    been, in his judgment, so satisfactory that for express passenger service he is
                    now building engines only of the compound type. In some recent examples the
                    small cylinders are 14 inches, and the large cylinder 30 inches in diameter,
                    with a stroke of 24 inches, and the boiler pressure is 175 lb. Engines of the
                    same type are also being introduced in India, South America, aud the continent
                    of Europe.</p>
                <p>236. Experiments on the saving of fuel by compounding locomotives point to an
                    economy of from 10 to 20 per cent. It may be expected, for reasons which have
                    been discussed above, that a compound engine, even when working at the high
                    speed of a locomotive, will have a somewhat higher efficiency than a
                    non-compound engine. <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0545-0522"/> But, apart from this, an important merit of the
                    compound system is that, while it absolutely prevents the grade of expansion
                    from being reduced below a certain minimum, depending on the ratio of cylinder
                    volumes, it also permits a comparatively high degree of expansion, which in an
                    ordinary locomotive would involve the use of specially large cylinders and a
                    separate cut-off valve. Experiments on the steam-jacketing of locomotive
                    cylinders have not hitherto been attended by success.</p>
                <p>237. <hi rend="italic">Tramway locomotives</hi> for the most part resemble
                    railway locomotives in the general features of their design. The boiler is of
                    the usual locomotive type. A pair of cylinders in front, either inside or
                    outside the frames, are connected directly to the hindmost of two coupled
                    driving axles. Owing to the smallness of the driving-wheels, the axles lie near
                    the road, and the cylinders are set sloping at a considerable angle upwards to
                    keep them clear of dirt. To prevent the discharge of steam into the atmosphere,
                    the exhaust steam is often led into an atmospheric condenser, consisting of a
                    large number of pipes set on the top of the engine, and exposed to free contact
                    with the air. In some instances the common locomotive type is widely departed
                    from: a mixed vertical and horizontal boiler is used, and the engine is
                    connected to the driving axle by worm-wheel or other gear, or by a rocking lever
                    between the connecting-rod and the crank.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    takes the place of an ordinary boiler is charged at the beginning of the journey
                    with water heated under pressure by injecting steam from stationary boilers at a
                    pressure of 15 atmospheres. The thermal capacity of the water is
                    sufficient—without further addition of heat—to supply steam to the engine during
                    the journey, at a pressure which gradually falls off.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech.
                    Eng.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> The system has not come into general use.</p>
                <p>239. Several forms of tramway engine have been devised in which the motive power
                    is supplied by compressed air.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> 1878,
                    1881.</p></note> In the Mekarski system the compressed air, on its way from the
                    reservoir to the cylinders, passes through a vessel containing hot water and
                    steam under pressure (charged, as in Francq’s system, by injecting steam at a
                    station). In this way the air is heated, and may then expand in the cylinder
                    without having its temperature lowered to an objectionable degree.</p>
                <p>240. Steam <hi rend="italic">road-locomotives</hi> or traction-engines have
                    usually a boiler of the locomotive type, with a cylinder or compound pair of
                    cylinders, generally on the top, driving a shaft from which motion is taken by a
                    gearing chain or spur-wheels to a single driving axle at the fire-box end. The
                    engine is steered by means of a leading axle, whose direction is controlled by a
                    hand-wheel and chain-gear. To facilitate rapid turning the driving-wheels are
                    connected to their axle by a differential or compensating gear which allows them
                    to revolve at different speeds. This is a set of four bevel-wheels like White’s
                    dynamometer coupling: the outside bevel-wheels are attached to the
                    driving-wheels; the intermediate ones, which gear with these, turn in bearings
                    in a revolving wheel driven by the engine. So long as both driving-wheels are
                    equally resisted both are driven at the same speed, but if one is retarded (as
                    the inner wheel is in turning a curve) it acts to some extent as a fulcrum to
                    the bevel gear, and the outer wheel takes a greater share of the motion. An
                    important feature in traction engines is the elasticity of the driving-wheels.
                    Many devices have been employed, partly to give the wheels an extended tread, or
                    arc of contact with the ground, and partly to avoid shocks in passing over rough
                    ground. Both objects are accomplished by Mr R. W. Thomson’s plan of surrounding
                    each wheel with a thick tyre of india-rubber, protected on the outside by an
                    armour of small plates. In most modern traction-engines the rim is itself rigid,
                    but is connected to the nave through a system of springs which allow it to take
                    up an eccentric position, and the tyres have skew bars on the surface to
                    increase their adhesion to the road.</p>
                <p>XIV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Air and Gas Engines.</hi></p>
                <p>241. Under this head we may include all heat-engines in which the working
                    substance is air, or the gaseous products of the combustion of fuel and air,
                    whether the fuel be itself solid, liquid, or gaseous. When air alone forms the
                    working substance, it receives heat from an external furnace by conduction
                    through the walls of a containing vessel, as the working substance in the
                    steam-engine takes in heat through the shell of the boiler. An engine supplied
                    with heat in this way may be called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >external-combustion</hi> engine, to distinguish it from a very important class
                    of engines in which the combustion which supplies heat occurs within a closed
                    chamber containing the working substance. The ordinary coal-gas explosive engine
                    is the most common type of <hi rend="italic">internal-combustion</hi>
                    engine.</p>
                <p>242. Compared with an engine using saturated steam, air and gas engines have the
                    important advantage that the temperature and the pressure of the working
                    substance are independent of one another. Hence it becomes possible to use an
                    upper limit of temperature greatly higher than in the ordinary steam-engine, and
                    if the lower limit is not correspondingly raised an increase of thermodynamic
                    efficiency results. It is true that the same advantage might be obtained in the
                    case of steam, by excessive superheating; but this would mean substantially the
                    conversion of the engine into the type we are now considering, the working
                    substance being then steam gas.</p>
                <p>243. A simple, thermodynamically perfect form of external-combustion air-engine
                    would be one following Carnot’s cycle (§ 40), in which heat is received while
                    the air is at the highest temperature τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the air
                    meanwhile expanding isothermally. After this the supply of heat is stopped, and
                    the air is allowed to expand adiabatically until its temperature falls to the
                    lower extreme τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. At this it is compressed
                    isothermally, giving out heat, and finally the cycle is completed by adiabatic
                    compression, which restores the initial high temperature τ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>.</p>
                <p>244. In place of adiabatic expansion as a means of changing the temperature from
                    τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> we may follow
                    Stirling’s plan (§ 54) of storing the heat in a regenerator, from which it will
                    afterwards be taken up and so produce the elevation of temperature from τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which in the above
                    cycle was performed by adiabatic compression.</p>
                <p>Stirling’s air-engine, in which the action approximated to the perfect cycle
                    described in § 54, is diagramatic-ally shown in fig. 141. A is a closed vessel
                    containing air, externally heated by a furnace beneath it. A pipe from the top
                    of A leads to the working cylinder B. At the top of A is a refrigerator C,
                    consisting of pipes through which cold water circulates. In A there is a
                    displacer plunger D, which is driven by the engine; when this is raised the air

                    with the refrigerator and cooled. On its way from the bottom to the top of A, or

                    Finally the plunger is raised, and the working air again passes through the

                    compressed (by means of a pump) to a pressure greatly above that of the
                    atmosphere. Stirling’s cycle is theoretically perfect whatever the density of
                    the working air, and compression did not in his case increase what may be called
                    the theoretical thermodynamic efficiency. It did, however, very greatly increase
                    the mechanical efficiency, and also, what is of special importance, it increased
                    the amount of power yielded by an engine of given size. To see this it is
                    sufficient to consider that with compressed air a greater amount of heat was
                    dealt with in each stroke of the engine, and therefore a greater amount of work
                    was produced. Practically it also increased the thermodynamic efficiency by
                    reducing the ratio of the heat wasted by external conduction and radiation to
                    the whole heat.</p>
                <p>A double-acting Stirling engine of 50 I.H.P., used in 1843 at the Dundee foundry,
                    appears to have realized an efficiency of 0·3, and, notwithstanding very
                    inadequate means of heating the air, consumed only l·7 lb of coal per I.H.P. per
                    hour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Rankine’s <hi

                    much greater.</p></note> This engine remained at work for three years, but was
                    finally abandoned on account of the failure of the heating vessels. In some
                    forms of Stirling’s engine the regenerator was a separate vessel; in others the
                    plunger D was itself constructed to serve as regenerator by filling it with
                    wire-gauze and leaving holes at top and bottom for the passage of the air
                    through it.</p>
                <p>246. Another mode of using the regenerator was introduced in America by Ericsson,
                    in an engine which also failed, partly because the heating surfaces became
                    burnt, and partly because their area was insufficient. In Ericsson’s engine the
                    temperature of the working substance is changed (by passing through the
                    regenerator) while the pressure remains constant. Cold air is compressed by a
                    pump into a receiver, from which it passes through a regenerator into the
                    working cylinder. In so passing it absorbs heat from the regenerator and
                    expands. The air in the cylinder is then further expanded by taking in heat from
                    a furnace under the cylinder. The cycle is completed by the discharge of the air
                    through the regenerator. The indicator diagram approximates to a form bounded by
                    two isothermals and two lines of constant pressure.<note anchored="true"

                    powers—from a fraction of 1 H.P. up to about 3 H.P. Powerful engines of this
                    type are impracticable on account of their relatively enormous bulk. Those that
                    are now manufactured resemble the original Stirling engine very closely in the
                    main features of their action, and comprise essentially the same organs.<note

                    coal or coke is burnt under pressure in a closed chamber, to which the fuel is
                    fed through a species of air-lock. Air for combustion is supplied by a
                    compressing pump, and the engine is governed by means of a distributing valve
                    which supplies a greater or less proportion of the air below the fire as the
                    engine runs slow or fast. The products of combustion, whose volume is increased
                    by their rise in temperature, pass into a working cylinder, raising the piston.
                    When a certain fraction of the stroke is over the supply of hot gas is stopped,
                    and the gases in the cylinder expand, doing more work and becoming reduced in
                    temperature. During the return stroke they are discharged into the atmosphere,
                    and the pump takes in a fresh supply of air. Fig. 142 is a diagram section of
                    the Buckett engine. A is the working piston, the form of which is such as to
                    protect the tight sliding surface (at the top) from contact with the hot gases;
                    B is the compressing pump, C the valve by which the governor regulates the rate
                    at which fuel is consumed, and D the air-lock through which fuel is
                    supplied.</p>
                <p>249. In engines of this class the degree to which the action is thermodynamically
                    efficient depends very largely on the amount of cooling the gases undergo by
                    adiabatic or nearly adiabatic expansion under the working piston. Without a
                    large ratio of expansion the thermodynamic advantage of a high initial tem
                    perature is lost; but, as the gases have to be discharged at atmospheric
                    pressure, a large ratio of expansion is possible only when there is much initial
                    compression. Compression is therefore an essential condition, without which a
                    heat-engine of this type cannot be made efficient. It is also, as has already
                    been pointed out, essential in all air-engines to the development of a fair
                    amount of power by an engine of moderate bulk.</p>
                <p>250. Internal-combustion engines using solid fuel have hitherto been little used,
                    and that only for small powers. Several small engines employ liquid fuel
                    (namely, petroleum) injected in a state of spray, or even vaporized before
                    entering the combustion-chamber. In some forms, of which the Brayton petroleum
                    engine is a type, combustion occurs as the fuel is injected; in others the
                    action approaches closely that of <hi rend="italic">gas-engines,</hi> that is to
                    say, of engines in which fuel (generally coal-gas) is supplied in a perfectly
                    gaseous state, and is burnt in a more or less explosive manner. These last are
                    the only heat-engines that have as yet entered into serious competition with
                    steam-engines.</p>
                <p>251. The earliest gas-engine to be brought iuto practical use was that of Lenoir
                    (1860). During the first part of the stroke air and gas, in proportions suitable
                    for combustion, were drawn into the cylinder. At about half-stroke the inlet
                    valve closed, and the mixture was immediately exploded by an electric spark. The
                    heated products of combustion then did work on the piston during the remainder
                    of the forward stroke, and were expelled during the back stroke. The engine was
                    double-acting, and the cylinder was prevented from becoming excessively heated
                    by a casing through which water was kept circulating. The water-jacket has been
                    retained in nearly all later gas-engines.</p>
                <p>An indicator diagram from a Lenoir engine is shown in fig. 143.<note

                    partly from expansion, and partly from the cooling action of the cylinder walls;
                    on the other hand, its level is to some extent maintained by the phenomenon of
                    after-burn ing, which will be discussed later. In this engine, chiefly because
                    there was no compres sion, the heat removed by the water-jacket bore an
                    exceedingly large proportion to the whole heat, and the efficiency was
                    comparatively low; about 95 cubic feet of gas were used per horse-power per
                    hour. Hugon’s engine, introduced five years later, was a non-compressive engine
                    very similar to Lenoir’s. A novel feature in it was the injection of a jet of
                    cold water to keep the cylinder from becoming too hot. These engines are now
                    obsolete; the type they belonged to, in which the mixture is not compressed
                    before explosion, is now represented by one small engine—Bischoffs—the
                    mechanical simplicity of which atones for its comparatively wasteful action in
                    certain cases where but little power is required.</p>
                <p>252. In 1866 Otto and Langen introduced a curious engine,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech.
                    Eng.,</hi> 1875.</p></note> which, as to economy of gas, was distinctly superior
                    to its predecessors. Like them it did not use compression. The explosion
                    occurred early in the stroke, in a vertical cylinder, under a piston which was
                    free to rise without doing work on the engine shaft. The piston rose with great
                    velocity, so that the expansion was much more nearly adiabatic than in earlier
                    engines. Then after the piston had reached the top of its range the gases
                    cooled, and their pressure fell below that of the atmosphere; the piston
                    consequently<pb break="no"

                    doing work. The burnt gases were discharged during the last part of the
                    down-stroke. A friction-coupling allowed the piston to be automatically thrown
                    out of gear when rising, and into gear when descending. This “atmospheric” gas
                    engine used about 40 cubic feet of gas per horse-power per hour, and came into
                    somewhat extensive use in spite of its noisy and spasmodic action. After a few
                    years it was displaced by a greatly improved type, in which the direct action of
                    Lenoir’s engine was restored, but the gases were compressed before ignition.</p>
                <p>253. Dr Otto’s “silent” engine, introduced in 1876, was the first successful
                    motor of the modern type. It is a single-acting engine, generally horizontal in
                    form, and the explosive mixture is compressed in the working cylinder itself.
                    This is done by making the cycle of the action extend through two revolutions of
                    the engine. During the first forward stroke gas and air are drawn in by the
                    piston. During the first back-stroke the mixture is compressed into a large
                    clearance space at the end of the cylinder. The mixture is then ignited, and the
                    second forward stroke (which is the only working stroke in the cycle) is
                    performed under the pressure of the heated products of combustion. During the
                    second back-stroke the products are discharged, with the exception of so much as
                    remains in the clearance space, which serves to dilute the explosive mixture in
                    the next cycle. The principal parts of Otto’s engine (as made by Messrs
                    Crossley) are shown in the diagram section, fig. 144. The cylinder is kept cool
                    by a water-jacket AA. B</p>
                <p>is the clearance space into which the mixture is compressed before explosion. Its
                    volume is usually about two-thirds of the stroke, or 40 per cent. of the whole
                    volume to which the gases afterwards expand. C is the exhaust-valve, which is
                    opened during the second back-stroke of each cycle. Gas and air are admitted at
                    D, through a slide-valve E, which reciprocates once in each complete cycle of
                    two revolutions. This slide-valve is shown to a larger scale in fig. 145, in the
                    position it occupies while gas is entering from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and air
                    from <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> To ignite the mixture a gas-jet is kept burning
                    at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> In the slide-valve there is an igniting port <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> which is supplied with gas from a groove in the cover. As
                    the slide moves towards the right, the igniting port <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    carries a flame from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> to D.</p>
                <p>Just before reaching D a little of the compressed mixture from the cylinder
                    enters the igniting port by a small opening which does not appear in the figure,
                    and by the time D is reached the contents of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are so
                    much raised in pressure by their own combustion that a tongue of flame shoots
                    into the cylinder, firing the mixture there. The speed is regulated by a
                    centrifugal governor, which cuts off the supply of gas when the speed exceeds a
                    certain limit. In some small Otto engines of recent construction the inertia of
                    a reciprocating piece is used instead of the inertia of revolving pieces to
                    effect the same end.</p>
                <p>254. In Mr Clerk’s engine the cycle of operations is essentially the same as in
                    Otto’s, but a charging cylinder is introduced, with the effect of allowing an
                    explosion to take place in the working cylinder once in every revolution. As in
                    Otto’s, there is a large clearance space behind the piston, and the mixture is
                    compressed into this space by the backward movement of the working piston. The
                    peculiarity of the engine lies in the manner in which the charge is introduced.
                    As the piston advances after an explosion it uncovers exhaust ports in the sides
                    of the cylinder, close to the end of its forward stroke. While it is passing the
                    dead-point there the plunger of the charging cylinder (which has meanwhile taken
                    in a mixture of gas and air) delivers this mixture into the cylinder, driving
                    the products of the previous combustion out of the cylinder through the exhaust
                    ports. The charging cylinder is so arranged that the first part of the charge
                    consists almost wholly of air, and this is followed by the explosive mixture of
                    gas and air. The working piston then returns, closing the exhaust ports and
                    compressing the mixture, which is ignited after compression by means of a
                    slide-valve similar to Otto’s. In Otto’s engine the explosive mixture is
                    diluted, and the sharpness of the explosion thereby reduced, by the residue of
                    burnt products which fill the clearance space at the end of the discharge
                    stroke. In Clerk’s engine the mixture is diluted by an excess of air. It does
                    not appear that this difference has any material effect on the action.</p>
                <p>255. Over 20,000 Otto engines are now in use, of power ranging up to about 40
                    H.P. Besides the engines which have been named, others are manufactured in which
                    the operations are essentially of the same kind, though in some cases the
                    mechanical details are widely varied. In one of these, Mr Atkinson’s ingenious
                    “differential” engine, the working chamber consists of the space between two
                    pistons working in one cylinder. During exhaust the pistons come close together;
                    they recede from each other to take in a fresh charge; they approach for
                    compression; and finally they recede again very rapidly and farther than before,
                    after ignition of the mixture, thus giving a comparatively large ratio of
                    expansion. At the same time, by moving bodily along through the cylinder, the
                    pistons uncover admission and exhaust ports and an ignition-</p>
                <p>tube, which is kept permanently incandescent.</p>
                <p>256. If the explosion of a gaseous mixture were practically instantaneous,
                    producing at once all the heat due to the chemical reaction, and if the
                    expansion and compression were adiabatic, the theoretical indicator diagram of
                    an engine of the Otto type would have the form shown in fig. 146. OA represents
                    the volume of clearance; AB is the admission, at atmospheric pressure; BC is the
                    compression (which is assumed to be adiabatic); CD is the rise of pressure
                    caused by explosion; DE is adiabatic expansion during the working stroke; and
                    EBA is the exhaust. The height of the point D above C may be calculated when we
                    know the temperature at C (an element of considerable uncertainty in practice),
                    the specific heat (at constant volume) of the burnt mixture, the amount of heat
                    evolved by explosion, and the change of specific density due to the change of
                    chemical constitution which explosion brings about. With the proportion of
                    coal-gas and air ordinarily employed this last consideration may generally be
                    neglected, as the volume of the products would differ by less than 2 per cent.

                    cases much less than the calculated rise of pressure which would be caused by a
                    strictly instantaneous explosion. An actual diagram from an Otto engine working
                    in its normal manner is given in fig. 147, where the reference letters
                    distinguish the parts of a complete cycle, as in fig. 146. It shows a rapid rise
                    of pressure on explosion, so rapid that the volume has not very materially
                    altered when the maximum of pressure is reached; and the specific heat at
                    constant volume may therefore be used without serious error in calculating the
                    amount of heat which this rise accounts for. When this calculation is made,<note

                    potential heat of combustion in the mixture is required to produce the rise of
                    temperature corresponding to the point of greatest pressure. The remainder
                    continues to be slowly evolved during the subsequent expansion of the hot gases.
                    The process of combustion—a term evidently more appropriate than explosion</p>
                <p>—is essentially gradual; when ignition takes place it begins rapidly, but it
                    continues to go on at a diminishing rate throughout the stroke. That part which
                    takes place after the maximum pressure is passed is the phenomenon of
                    after-burning to which allusion has been made above.</p>
                <p>258. The existence of “after-burning” is proved not only by the fact that the
                    maximum pressure after ignition is much less than it would be if combustion were
                    then complete, but also by the form which the curve of subsequent expansion
                    takes. During expansion the gases are losing much heat by conduction through the
                    cylinder walls. The water-jacket absorbs rather more than half of the whole heat
                    developed in the engine,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    part of this is of course taken up from the gases during the working stroke.
                    Notwithstanding this loss, the curve of expansion does not fall much below the
                    adiabatic curve; in some cases it even lies higher than the adiabatic curve.
                    This shows that the loss to the sides of the cylinder is being made up by
                    continued development of heat within the gas. The process of combustion is
                    especially protracted when the explosive mixture is weak in gas; the point of
                    maximum pressure then comes late in the stroke; and it is probable that the
                    products which are discharged in the exhaust contain some incompletely-burnt
                    fuel. Fig. 148 is the indicator diagram of an Otto engine supplied with a
                    mixture containing an exceptionally large proportion of air: it exhibits well
                    the very gradual character of the explosion in such a case.</p>
                <p>259. Much light has been thrown on this subject by the experiments of Mr Clerk,
                    who has exploded mixtures of gas and air, and also mixtures of hydrogen and air,
                    in a closed vessel furnished with an apparatus for recording the time-rate of
                    variation of pressure. In these experiments the pressure fell after the
                    explosion only on account of the cooling action of the containing walls. The
                    temperature before ignition being known, it became possible to calculate from
                    the diagrams of pressure the highest temperature reached during combustion (on
                    the assumption that the specific heat of the gases remained unchanged at high
                    temperatures), and to compare this with the temperature which would have been
                    produced had combustion been at once complete. Mixtures of gas and air were
                    exploded, the proportion of gas varying from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> to <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, and the highest temperature produced was generally a
                    little more than half that which would have been reached by instantaneous
                    combustion of the mixture. With the best proportion of coal-gas to air (1 to 6
                    or 7) the greatest pressure and hottest state was found one-twentieth of a
                    second after ignition, and the temperature was then 1800° C.,—instead of 3800° ,
                    which would have been the value had all the heat been at once evolved. With the
                    weakest mixtures about half a second was taken to reach a maximum of
                    temperature, and its value was 800° C., instead of 1800° C. In this case,
                    however, the degree of completeness of the combustion is not fairly shown by a
                    comparison of these temperatures, since much cooling occurred during the
                    relatively long interval that preceded the instant of greatest pressure.</p>
                <p>260. Ίο explain the phenomenon of after-burning or delayed combustion, it has
                    been supposed that the high temperature to which the gases are raised in the
                    first stages of the explosion prevents union from being completed,—just as high
                    temperature would dissociate the burnt gases were they already in chemical
                    union,—until the fall of temperature by expansion and by the cooling action of
                    the cylinder walls allows the process of union to go on. The maximum temperature
                    attained in the gas-engine is high enough to cause a perceptible amount of
                    dissociation of the burnt products; it may therefore be admitted that this
                    explanation of delayed combustion is to some extent true. On the other hand, the
                    phenomenon is most noticeable with mixtures weak in gas, in which the maximum
                    temperature reached is low, and the dissociation effect is correspondingly
                    small. It appears, therefore, that dissociation is not the main cause of the
                    action; apart from it the process of combustion of a gaseous mixture is gradual,
                    beginning fast and going on at a continuously-diminishing rate as the
                    combustible mixture becomes more and more diluted by the portions already burnt.
                    If the mixture is much diluted to begin with, the process is comparatively slow
                    from the first.</p>
                <p>261. Much stress has been laid by some makers of gas-engines on the desirability
                    of having a stratified mixture of gases in the cylinder, with a part rich in gas
                    near the ignition port and a greater proportion of residual product or air near
                    the piston. It has even been supposed that stratification of the gases is the
                    cause of their gradual combustion. Mr Clerk’s experiments are conclusive against
                    this; the mixtures he used, which gave in some cases very gradual explosions,
                    were allowed to stand long enough to become sensibly homogeneous. In dealing
                    with weak mixtures it is no doubt of advantage to have a small quantity of
                    richer fluid close to the igniting port to start the ignition of the rest,—but
                    beyond this stratification has probably little or no value. And it may be
                    questioned whether, in the ordinary working of a gas-engine, any general
                    stratification can occur, when account is taken of the commotion which the air
                    and gas cause as they rush into the cylinder at a speed exceeding that of an
                    express train.</p>
                <p>262. A compression gas-engine of the Otto type burns from 20 to 25 cubic feet of
                    coal-gas per hour per indicated horse-power. Good coal-gas has a heating power
                    equivalent to about 500,000 foot-pounds per cubic foot, and hence, with a
                    consumption of 20 cubic feet the efficiency which the engine realizes is nearly
                    0·2. The efficiency of a large steam-engine is about 0·14, and in steam-engines
                    that are small enough to be fairly compared with actual gas-engines the
                    efficiency is not more than 0·1. The superiority of gas-engines over
                    steam-engines, from the<pb break="no"

                    comparing their consumption of fuel. In the steam-engine we find in good engines
                    of large size a consumption of 2 K) or 1¾ lb of coal per I.H.P. per hour, and by
                    triple expansion this is reduced in large marine engines to about 1 <hi

                    in small-power engines the consumption is at least 2½ lb, and is generally 3 lb
                    or more. When Mr Dowson’s cheap gas,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst.</hi><hi rend="italic

                    passing a mixture of superheated steam and air through red-hot anthracite, is
                    used to drive an Otto engine, the consumption of coal has been found to be only
                    1·1 lb per I.H.P. per hour, or less than half the amount used by a steam-engine
                    of similar size. What gives this comparison additional interest is the fact that
                    the gas-producer for a 40 or 50 H.P. engine need not take up more space than the
                    boiler of a steam-engine of the same power.</p>
                <p>263. In another sense the gas-engine is much less perfect than the steam-engine.
                    The actual efficiency of the latter is about half the ideal efficiency which a
                    perfect engine would show when working through the same range of temperature. In
                    the gas-engine the actual is less than one-fourth of the ideal efficiency.
                    Taking the highest temperature as 1900° C.—a value reached in some of Mr Clerk’s
                    experiments—and the lowest temperature as 15° C., the efficiency of a perfect
                    engine would be 0·87, while that of the actual engine is 0·2. This only means
                    that the gas-engine has all the greater margin for future improvement.</p>
                <p>264. At present the main causes of waste in gas-engines are the action of the
                    sides of the cylinder and the water-</p>
                <p>jacket, and the high temperature of the exhaust gases. The water-jacket absorbs
                    about half the whole heat, only to keep the cylinder cool enough to permit of
                    lubrication. The waste gases are discharged at a temperature of about 420° C.,
                    and so carry away a large amount of heat which might in part be saved by having
                    a greater ratio of expansion, or by the use of a regenerator. Another source of
                    thermodynamic imperfection is the after-burning, which gives heat to the working
                    substance at a temperature lower than the maximum.</p>
                <p>In an engine constructed by the late Sir William Siemens it was attempted to do
                    away with or reduce the two main causes of loss—(1) by using a separate
                    combustion-chamber, distinct from the cylinder in which the piston worked, and
                    (2) by passing the exhaust gases through a regenerator, which afterwards gave up
                    heat to the incoming air and gas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Fleeming Jenkin endeavoured to attain the same ends by adapting the Stirling
                    type of engine to internal combustion, a mixture of gas and air being exploded
                    under a displacer like that of fig. 141. Practical difficulties have hitherto
                    prevented regenerative internal-combustion engines from coming into use, but it
                    can scarcely be doubted that their development is only a question of time. With
                    regard to the probable future of heat-engines, it is important to notice that
                    the internal-combustion engine using gaseous fuel, though already much more
                    efficient than the steam-engine, is crude and full of defects which further
                    invention ought to remove, while the steam-engine has been improved so far that
                    little increase in its efficiency can be expected, and more than a little is
                    impossible. (<hi rend="smallcaps">j. a. e.)</hi><pb break="no"
