                    that the number of forty for the years of wandering and for the stations are
                    round numbers, and that the details are not based on historical tradition of the
                    Mosaic age. This does not exclude the possibility that the names of some or all
                    of the stations belong to real places and are based on more or less careful
                    research on the part of the writers who record them. As regards the Mountain of
                    the Law in particular, if the record of Exod. xix. <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> is
                    strictly historical, we must seek a locality where 600,000 fighting men, or some
                    two million souls in all, could encamp and remain for some time, finding pasture
                    and drink for their cattle, and where there was a mountain (with a wilderness at
                    its foot) rising so sharply that its base could be fenced in, while yet it was
                    easily ascended, and its summit could be seen by a great multitude below. In the
                    valley there must have been a flowing stream. The peninsula of Sinai does not
                    furnish any locality where so great a host could meet under the conditions
                    specified, and accordingly many investigators give up the statistics of the
                    number of Hebrews and seek a place that fulfils the other conditions. But when
                    we consider that the various records embodied in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pentateuch</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>.) were composed long after the time
                    of Moses, and that the authors in all probability never saw Sinai, and had no
                    exact topographical tradition to fall back on, but could picture to themselves
                    the scene of the events they recorded only by the aid of imagination, the
                    topographical method of identifying the Mountain of the Law becomes very
                    questionable. The Pentateuchal writers are not at one even about the name of the
                    mountain. It used to be thought that Horeb was the name of the mountain mass as
                    a whole, or of its southern part, while Sinai was the Mountain of the Law
                    proper, but it has been shown by Dillmann that the Elohist and Deuteronomy
                    always use the name Horeb for the same mountain which the Jahvist and the
                    Priestly Code call Sinai. The Elohist belonged to Northern Israel, but Judges V.
                    5 shows that even in Northern Israel the other name Sinai was not unknown. And
                    it might be shown, though that cannot be done here, that the several accounts
                    vary not only as regards the name but in topographical details. Thus all that
                    can be taken as historically fixed is that after leaving Goshen the Hebrews
                    abode for some time near a mountain called Sinai or Horeb <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 396), and that this
                    mountain or range was held to be holy as a seat of the Deity (Exod. ii. 1, 1
                    Kings xix.).</p>
                <p>Where, then, was this mountain? The Midianites, of whom according to one source
                    Jethro was priest, probably always lived east of the Gulf of 'Akaba; yet we can
                    hardly follow Beke in seeking Sinai beyond that gulf, but must rather think of
                    some point in the so-called peninsula of Sinai, which lies between the Gulfs of
                    'Akaba and Suez, bounded on the N. by the Wilderness el-Tíh, which slopes gently
                    towards the Mediterranean. To the south of this wilderness rises the Jebel
                    el-Tíh, a mass composed mainly of Nubian sandstone and cretaceous limestone,
                    which attains in fantastic forms an altitude of some 3000 feet; its ridges
                    converge towards the south and are cut off by great valleys from the mass now
                    known as Mount Sinai. The latter is composed of primitive rocks,—granite,
                    porphyry, diorite, gneiss, &amp;c. The sandstones of Jebel el-Tíh are rich in
                    minerals; inscriptions of Amenophis III. and Thothmes III. found on the spot
                    show that the ancient Egyptians got emerald, malachite, and kupfergrün at Sarbút
                    al-Khádem; and still older are the turquoise and copper mines of Maghára, where
                    inscriptions occur bearing the names of kings from Senefru and Cheops down to
                    Rameses II. These mines were worked by criminals and prisoners of war, and the
                    waste products of copper foundries indicate that the peninsula was once better
                    wooded than now, of which indeed we have express testimony of post-Christian
                    date. At present the dominant feature is bare walls of rock, especially in the
                    primitive formations; the steep and jagged summits have a striking effect, which
                    is increased by the various colours of the rock and the clearness of the
                    atmosphere. The deep-cut valleys are filled by rushing torrents after rain, but
                    soon dry up again. In the south the centre of the main mountain mass is Mount
                    Catherine (8540 feet), Omm Shômar to the south-east being little lower; this
                    peak and north of it Mount Serbâl (6750 feet), which rises more immediately from
                    the plain, dominate the Kâ'ah, a waste expanse of sand strown with pebbles,
                    which occupies the south-west margin of the peninsula. In the Kâ'ah is the
                    village of Tür, and at the southern promontory (Ras Mohammed) is the little
                    hamlet of Sherm. The Sinai group as a whole is called by the Arabs Jebel al-Túr;
                    the name Sînâ in Arabic comes only from books. The area<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0104-0089"/> of the peninsula is about 11,200 square miles,
                    the population is four to five thousand souls, chiefly Bedouins of various
                    tribes, whose common name, derived from Túr, is Towára. They have sheep and
                    goats, with which they retire in summer to the higher lands, where there is good
                    pasture ground, and where springs are comparatively common. On the chalk and
                    sandstone water is scarcer than among the primitive rocks, and often brackish.
                    Though the rocks are bare, there is always vegetation in the dales, especially
                    acacias and tamarisks; from the latter <hi rend="italic">(T. mannifera)</hi>
                    manna is still derived in quantities that vary with the rainfall. On the hills
                    grow aromatic plants, especially <hi rend="italic">Thymaceae.</hi> The fauna
                    includes the ibex, hyrax, and hyaena; the panther too is sometimes found.
                    Flights of quail have been observed. In some valleys there are well-kept gardens
                    and good date-palms; the most noted oasis is that of Feiran, in the north-west
                    of the peninsula, which is watered by a perennial stream. Whether Feiran is the
                    Rephidim of Exod. xvii. is a question which, like the identification of the
                    other stations of the Israelites, depends on the localization of the Mountain of
                    the Law.</p>
                <p>There is no genuine pre-Christian tradition on this subject. The chief authority
                    for the ancient sanctity of Mount Sinai is Antoninus Martyr (end of the 6th
                    century), who tells that the heathen Arabs in his time still celebrated a moon
                    feast there. As <hi rend="italic">sin</hi> means “moon,” this feast has been
                    connected with the name of Sinai, but the proposed etymology is not certain. Of
                    heathen origin, too, are the many Nabataean inscriptions (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nabataeans)</hi> of Sinai, found especially in the Wády
                    Mokatteb (in the north-west), and sometimes accompanied by rude drawings. The
                    language and character are Aramaic, but the proper names are mainly those of
                    Arabs, who passing by graved their names on the rocks. That they were pilgrims
                    to Sinai cannot be made out with certainty. The inscriptions date from the early
                    years of the Christian era, when the Nabataean kingdom was at its height.</p>
                <p>In early Christian times many anchorites inhabited Sinai, living for the most
                    part in the caves, which are numerous even in the primitive rocks. Then
                    monasteries were built, the most famous being the great one of St Catherine in
                    Wády el-Dér (the valley of the monastery). On Serbâl, too, there were many
                    granite dwellings, and in the neighbouring Pharan (Phoenicion), which was a
                    bishop’s see, there were, as the ruins show, churches and convents.</p>
                <p>The question then is whether when the hermits first settled in the peninsula
                    there existed a tradition as to the place of the Mountain of the Law, and
                    whether they chose for their residence a spot which was already traditionally
                    consecrated by memories significant to the Christian as well as to the Jew. No
                    assertion of the existence of such a tradition is to be found in Josephus, who
                    only says that Sinai was the highest mountain of the district—a description
                    which might apply to Serbâl as seen from the plain below. Eusebius uses
                    expressions which may also seem to point to Serbâl as the place of the
                    law-giving, and it must be admitted that the tradition which seeks the holy site
                    in the group of Jebel Músá (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the mass of which Mount
                    Catherine is the highest peak) is not older than the time of Justinian, so that
                    the identification with Mount Serbâl seems to have greater antiquity in its
                    favour. In later times Jebel Músá and Serbál had each its own tradition, and the
                    holy places were pointed out at each; thus from the monastery of St Catherine a
                    path of granite steps was constructed up to “the Mountain of the Law,” but
                    similar steps are found at Serbâl. That these traditions are not decisive,
                    however, is admitted, more or less, even by those moderns who, like Lepsius,
                    Ebers, Bartlett, give their voice for Serbâl. Most authorities still prefer
                    Jebel Músá or some point in that group, but they again differ in details. First
                    of all there is much difficulty in determining the route by which the Hebrews
                    approached the mountain. Then comes the question of finding a suitable plain for
                    their encampment under the mountain, which is best met if, with Robinson,
                    Stanley, Palmer, and others, the plain is taken to be that of al-Ráhe and the
                    overhanging mountain to be Jebel Sufsáfeh. The latter is over 6300 feet high,
                    and consists of pasture ground; it does not fit all the details in Exodus, but
                    this objection is quite as strong against the traditional site on Jebel Músá
                    (Mount Moses), which lies farther to the south. Jebel Músá has been accepted by
                    Tischendorf, Laborde, Ritter, Strauss, Farrar, and many others; on this view the
                    Israelites must have encamped in the narrow Wády al-Seba'íyeh, north of the
                    mount. But the absence of exact topographical detail on the part of the Biblical
                    narrators, who always speak of Sinai as if it were a single summit and give no
                    hint about several summits of which it is one, shows that in their time there
                    was no real tradition on the matter, and that all attempts at identification are
                    necessarily vain.</p>
