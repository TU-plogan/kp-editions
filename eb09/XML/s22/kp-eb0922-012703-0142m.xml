                <p><label type="entry">SLATE</label> is an argillaceous rock of various
                    colours—blue, green, purple, grey, and black—and a peculiar structure by which
                    it readily splits into thin plates or laminae. It is of sedimentary origin,
                    being primarily deposited on ocean floors as fine mud formed by the waste and
                    denudation of pre-existing rocks, and afterwards compressed, hardened, and
                    altered into compact rock. Slate beds occur mainly in the Cambrian, Silurian,
                    and Devonian formations—frequently alternating with bands of grit and limestone,
                    or interstratified with felspathic lava or ashes— and, being tilted up from
                    their original horizontal or nearly horizontal position, stretch across wide
                    districts in a series of undulations, which rise to the surface in crests, or
                    dip into troughs underground and form angles of every inclination with the

                <p>Slate rock splits along cleavage planes which are distinct from and independent
                    of original stratification. These planes are, as a rule, vertical or highly
                    inclined, and intersect the lines of bedding at various angles, but sometimes
                    coincide with them. The strike of cleavage is generally parallel with that of
                    the slate beds, and a uniform direction is often maintained over wide areas, as
                    in North Wales, where it is nearly north-north-east and southsouth-west, while
                    in Shropshire it is north-east and southwest, and in Pembrokeshire north-by-west
                    and south-by-east. This peculiar cleavage structure is believed to be the result
                    of a combination of intense forces, chiefly lateral pressure acting at right
                    angles to the planes of cleavage.</p>
                <p>Contraction, compression, shearing, and other powerful forces have caused great
                    disturbances in slate beds, since they were first thrown down as fine sediment,
                    and the results are seen in the foldings, contortions, fissures, rents, and
                    dislocations that now exist. The fissures often follow well-defined courses and
                    form divisional planes termed joints,—some running parallel with the strike and
                    called strike joints, others running in the direction of the dip and called dip
                    joints. Dykes of greenstone and other<pb break="no"

                    intersect the beds, and the surfaces of rents are frequently baked by heat
                    ejected from the interior. Faults also occur, and cause displacements of the
                    beds by upheaval or downthrow of one or other side of a rent.</p>
                <p>Several varieties of clay slate are met with, and are characterized by the
                    mineral that chiefly prevails. The colour —varying shades of blue, green, and
                    purple being the most common—depends mainly on the presence of iron and the form
                    in which it exists. The common roofing slate of commerce is generally
                    fine-grained, and combines great strength and durability with moderate weight.
                    It is also very dense, 1 cubic foot weighing over 170 lb, while according to Mr
                    Wilkinson it takes on an average 20,000 lb) to crush 1 cubic inch.</p>
                <p>Certain varieties of slate, however, are soft and perishable, particularly the
                    black carbonaceous kinds. Cubes of iron pyrites frequently occur in slate rock,
                    and are generally deleterious owing to their tendency to decompose and fall out,
                    but this is not always the case, as some of the most durable slates are
                    sprinkled with pyrites without detriment.</p>

                <p>Slate has been used for roofing during many centuries, and it is said that some
                    of the old castles of North Wales—such as Carnarvon and Conway—were covered with
                    this material. And no doubt the better class of houses, situated in the
                    neighbourhood of slate beds, would be roofed with slates obtained by rough
                    surface digging, or from blocks exposed by mountain streams and split by the
                    action of the weather, long before regular quarrying operations commenced. The
                    Delabole quarries of Cornwall had acquired considerable importance as far back
                    as the 16th century, and some of the Welsh slate quarries are very old, as are
                    those of Angers in France. But the slate industry belongs mainly to the present
                    century and latter part of the 18th; and since the opening up of the country by
                    sea and land communications the progress and development of slate quarries have
                    been great and rapid. The largest and most valuable quarries of North Wales are
                    worked in the Cambrian and Lower Silurian beds, those of Llanberis and Penrhyn
                    being worked in the former, and the Festiniog quarries in the latter. Important
                    quarries are worked in Cumberland (Lower Silurian), Westmoreland, and Lancashire
                    (Upper Silurian), and also in Devon and Cornwall (Devonian and Carboniferous),
                    the lake districts being specially noted for their rich green slates. Some of
                    the western and midland districts of Scotland—mainly Argyleshire,
                    Dumbartonshire, and Perthshire—produce very strong and durable slates (Lower
                    Silurian and Cambrian), the largest and most important quarries being at
                    Ballachulish in Argyllshire, where 15,000 tons are annually made. The Scotch
                    slates are chiefly blue in colour, but thin beds of green are found in some of
                    the central districts.</p>
                <p>Slate is now almost universally used for roofing houses and buildings of every
                    description, and for such purposes it is unequalled, the better sorts possessing
                    all the qualities necessary for protection against wind, rain, and storm. The
                    finer varieties are made into writing slates, and in districts where cross
                    cleavage exists slate pencils are made. Slabs are also manufactured, and, being
                    readily cut, planed, dressed, and enamelled, are used for chimney pieces,
                    billiard tables, wall linings, cisterns, paving, tomb stones, ridge rolls, and
                    various other architectural and industrial purposes.</p>
                <p>Slate rocks are quarried both above ground and below ground, according as they
                    lie near to or distant from the surface. When they are near the surface, and
                    their dip corresponds with the slope of the ground, they are in the most
                    favourable position, and are worked in terraces or galleries formed along the
                    strike of the beds and having a height of about 50 feet. The galleries are
                    generally carried on in sections of 10 yards, worked across the beds, and may
                    rise to any height or be sunk below the surrounding level by excavations. When
                    the rock is much removed from the surface, or inconveniently situated for open
                    workings, it is quarried in underground chambers reached by levels driven
                    through the intervening mass and across or along the beds. Or it may be
                    necessary to sink shafts as in coal-pits before the rock is arrived at, but the
                    cost of doing so forms a serious drawback. Inclines, waggons, tramways, and
                    other machinery are employed in slate quarries as in other quarries, to suit the
                    special circumstances and position of the operations, and need not be
                    detailed.</p>
                <p>The sections of a gallery are generally worked by crews of six men, who undertake
                    to perform all operations of quarrying, splitting, and dressing at fixed rates.
                    The rock is bored by jumper drills directed and turned by the hand and driven by
                    hammers. When the bore is short and of small diameter one man can do the work,
                    holding the jumper with one hand and using the hammer with the other. But when a
                    large mass of rock has to be thrown down a bore 4 to 6 feet deep and a diameter
                    of 2 to 3 inches is required and three men are employed,—one to guide and turn
                    the jumper and two to drive it with heavy hammers. Bores of intermediate size
                    are made by two men, one holding and the other driving the drill. When the
                    boring has to be done on a steep face a staging is fixed to the rock or
                    suspended from the top by means of ropes. The explosive generally used is
                    rock-blasting powder, being the most suitable for the heaving force required to
                    throw out or detach masses of rock without much splintering, which would destroy
                    the blocks for slate making. Advantage is taken of the natural cuts or joints in
                    blasting, as the rock is readily thrown or worked off these. From the mass
                    thrown out by the blast, or loosened so as readily to come away by the use of
                    crowbars, the men carefully select and sort all good blocks and send them in
                    waggons to the slate huts to be split and dressed into slates. Two men are
                    employed at this operation—one splitting and the other dressing, performing
                    their work in a sitting posture. The splitter places a block on end between his
                    knees, and with chisel and mallet splits it into as many plates as possible of
                    the usual thickness for roofing purposes—namely, quarter of an inch more or less
                    according to the size and strength required. These plates are then placed
                    horizontally by the dresser on a vertical iron “stand,” and cut with a sharp
                    knife into slates of various sizes suitable for the market (from 30 in. × 16 in.
                    to 10 in. × 6 in.). Certain sizes are designated by names from the peerage, such
                    as princesses (24 in. × 14 ins.), duchesses (24 × 12), marchionesses (22 × 11),
                    countesses (20 × 10), viscountesses (18 × 9), ladies (16 × 10), &amp;c. In every
                    slate rock there is a large amount of waste or bad rock, which is thrown away as
                    rubbish—the proportion of good to bad varying from one in twelve to one in
                    thirty. Attempts are being made at present to have this waste material
                    manufactured into some article of industrial value; and, as it consists chiefly
                    of silica and alumina, these attempts should prove successful.</p>
                <p>The slate industry of the British Isles is now of very considerable importance,
                    that of North Wales in particular being immense. According to the census of 1881
                    the number of slate quarriers in the United Kingdom amounted to 15,765, while
                    over half a million tons of slates and slabs are produced annually, the value of
                    which may be estimated at or over £1,250,000. The number of slates exported in
                    1884 exceeded 49 millions, the declared value being £251,824, of which over 35
                    millions went to Germany, valued at £163,321, over 5 ¾ millions to Australasia,
                    valued at £37,474, and over 3 millions to Denmark, valued at £34,304.</p>
                <p>Good slate beds are also worked in the south of Ireland, particularly in the
                    counties of Wicklow, Tipperary, Cork, and Kerry (Lower Silurian, Devonian, and
                    Carboniferous). On the continent of Europe slate rock is worked in Devonian and
                    other formations —in France (Lower Silurian and Devonian), Belgium, Sweden,
                    Norway, Germany, Austria, and Italy (Oolitic). In North America immense slate
                    beds extend from Newfoundland westwards to the Great Lakes and south westwards
                    to Arkansas (U.S.); and slate quarries are successfully worked in Newfoundland,
                    Canada, and in the States of Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York,
                    Pennsylvania, &amp;c. Writing and roofing slates and slabs of every variety of
                    size and colour are manufactured in these; but none of the quarries have
                    hitherto reached the immense developments of the principal ones in North Wales,
                    and yet, with characteristic enterprise, roofing slates have been within recent
                    years imported to Great Britain from Newfoundland and the United States. (D.
