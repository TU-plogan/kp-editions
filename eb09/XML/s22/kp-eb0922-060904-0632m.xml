                    a Norman baron Alan, whose eldest son William became progenitor of the earls of
                    Arundel, and whose two younger sons Walter and Simon came to Scotland, Walter
                    being appointed high steward of David I., who conferred on him various lands in
                    Renfrewshire, including Paisley, where he founded the abbey in 1160. Walter, his
                    grandson, third steward, was appointed by Alexander II. justiciary of Scotland,
                    and, dying in 1246, left four sons and three daughters. The third son Walter
                    obtained by marriage the earldom of Menteith, which ultimately came by marriage
                    to Robert, duke of Albany, third son of Robert II. Alexander, fourth steward,
                    the eldest son of Walter, third steward, inherited by his marriage with Jean,
                    granddaughter of Somerled, the islands of Bute and Arran, and on 2d October 1263
                    defeated Haco at Largs. He had two sons, James and John. The latter, who
                    commanded the men of Bute at the battle of Falkirk in 1298, had seven sons :—(1)
                    Sir Alexander, whose grandson became in 1389 earl of Angus, the title afterwards
                    passing in the female line to the Douglases, and in 1761 to the duke of
                    Hamilton; (2) Sir Alan of Dreghorn, ancestor of the earls and dukes of Lennox,
                    from whom Lord Darnley, husband of Queen Mary, and also Arabella Stuart, were
                    descended; (3) Sir Walter, who obtained the barony of Garlies, Wigtownshire,
                    from his uncle John Randolph, earl of Moray, and was the ancestor of the earls
                    of Galloway, younger branches of the family being the Stewarts of Tonderghie,
                    Wigtownshire, and also those of Physgill and Glenturk in the same county; (4)
                    Sir James, who fell at Dupplin in 1332, ancestor of the lords of Lorn, on whose
                    descendants were conferred at different periods the earldoms of Athole, Buchan,
                    and Traquair, and who were also the progenitors of the Stewarts of Appin,
                    Argyllshire, and of Grandtully, Perthshire; (5) Sir John, killed at Halidon Hill
                    in 1333; (6) Sir Hugh, who fought under Edward Bruce in Ireland; and (7) Sir
                    Robert of Dal-dowie, ancestor of the Stewarts of Allanton and of Coltness. James
                    Stewart, the eldest son of Alexander, fourth steward, succeeded his father in
                    1283, and, after distinguishing himself in the wars of Wallace and of Bruce,
                    died in 1309. His son Walter, sixth steward, who had joint command with Douglas
                    of the left wing at the battle of Bannockburn, married Marjory, daughter of
                    Robert the Bruce, and during the latter’s absence in Ireland was entrusted with
                    the government of the kingdom. He died in 1326, leaving an only son, who as
                    Robert II. ascended the throne of Scotland in 1370 (see vol. xxi. p. 490). Sir
                    Alexander Stewart, earl of Buchan, fourth son of<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0633-0610"/> Robert II., who earned by his ferocity the title
                    of the “Wolf of Badenoch,” inherited by his wife the earldom of Ross, but died
                    without legitimate issue, although from his illegitimate offspring were
                    descended the Stewarts of Belladrum, of Athole, of Garth, of Urrard, and of St
                    Fort. On the death of the “Wolf of Badenoch” the earldom of Buchan passed to his
                    brother Robert, duke of Albany, also earl of Fife and earl of Menteith, but
                    these earldoms were forfeited on the execution of his son Murdoch in 1425, the
                    earldom of Buchan again, however, coming to the house of Stewart in the person
                    of James, second son of Sir James Stewart, the black knight of Lorn, by Johanna,
                    widow of King James I. From Murdoch, duke of Albany, were descended the Stewarts
                    of Ardvoirlich and other families of the name in Perthshire, and also the
                    Stuarts of Inch-breck and Laithers, Aberdeenshire. From a natural son of Robert
                    II. were descended the Steuarts of Dalguise, Perthshire, and from a natural son
                    of Robert III. the Shaw Stewarts of Blackhall and Greenock. The direct male line
                    of the royal family terminated with the death of James V. in 1542, whose
                    daughter Mary was the first to adopt the spelling “Stuart.” Mary was succeeded
                    in her lifetime in 1567 by her only son James VI., who through his father Lord
                    Darnley was also head of the second branch, there being no surviving male issue
                    of the family from progenitors later than Robert II. In James V., son of James
                    IV. by Margaret, daughter of Henry VII., the claims of the English junior branch
                    became merged in the Scottish line, and on the death of Queen Elizabeth of
                    England, last surviving offshoot of Henry VIII., James VI. of Scotland, lineally
                    the nearest heir, was proclaimed king of England, in accordance with a
                    declaration of Elizabeth that no minor person should ascend the throne, but her
                    cousin the king of Scots. The accession of James was, however, contrary to the
                    will of Henry VIII., which favoured the Suffolk branch, whose succession would
                    probably have marvellously altered the complexion of both Scottish and English
                    history. As it was, the only result of that will was a tragedy initiated by
                    Elizabeth, but consummated by James, so as to clothe his memory with deep
                    disgrace. In the Scottish line the nearest heir after James VI., both to the
                    Scottish and English crowns, was Arabella Stuart, only child of Charles, earl of
                    Lennox, younger brother of Lord Darnley,—Lady Margaret Douglas, the mother of
                    Darnley and his brother, having been the daughter of Archibald, sixth earl of
                    Angus by Margaret, queen dowager of James IV. James VI. (I. of England) was thus
                    nearest heir of the junior English branch by a double descent, Arabella Stuart
                    being next heir by a single descent. On account of the descent from Henry VII.,
                    the jealousy of Elizabeth had already caused her to imprison Arabella’s mother
                    (Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Cavendish) on learning that she had presumed
                    to marry Lennox. The daughter’s marriage she was determined by every possible
                    means to prevent. She objected when King James proposed to marry her to Lord
                    Esme Stuart, whom he had created duke of Lennox, but when the appalling news
                    reached her that Arabella had actually found a lover in William Seymour,
                    grandson of Catherine Grey, heiress of the Suffolk branch, she was so deeply
                    alarmed and indignant that she immediately ordered her imprisonment. This
                    happened immediately before Elizabeth’s death, after which she obtained her
                    release. Soon after the accession of James a conspiracy, of which she was
                    altogether ignorant, was entered into to advance her to the throne, but this
                    caused no alteration in her treatment by James, who allowed her a maintenance of
                    £800 a year. In February 1610 it was discovered that she was engaged to Seymour,
                    and, although she then promised never to marry him without the king’s consent,
                    the marriage took place secretly in July following. In consequence of this her
                    husband was sent to the Tower, and she was placed in private confinement. Though
                    separated, both succeeded in escaping simultaneously on 3d June 1611; but, less
                    fortunate than her husband, who got safe to the Continent, she was captured at
                    the Straits of Dover, and shut up in the Tower. Her hopeless captivity deprived
                    her of her reason before her sorrows were ended by death, 27th September
                    1615.</p>
                <p>By the usurpation of Cromwell the Stuarts were excluded from the throne from the
                    defeat of Charles I. at Naseby in 1645 until the restoration of his son Charles
                    II. in 1661. Carlyle refers to the opinion of genealogists that Cromwell “was
                    indubitably either the ninth or the tenth or some other fractional part of half
                    a cousin of Charles Stuart,” but this has been completely exploded by Walter
                    Rye, in the <hi rend="italic">Genealogist</hi> (“The Steward Genealogy and
                    Cromwell’s Royal Descent,” new ser., vol. ii. pp. 34-42). On the death of
                    Charles II. without issue in 1685, his brother James, duke of York, ascended the
                    throne as James II., but he so alienated the sympathies of the nation by his
                    unconstitutional efforts to further the Catholic religion that an invitation was
                    sent to the prince of Orange to come “to the rescue of the laws and religion of
                    England.” Next to the son of James II., still an infant under his father’s
                    control, Mary, princess of Orange, eldest daughter of James II., had the
                    strongest claim to the crown; but neither were the claims of the prince, even
                    apart from his marriage, very remote, since he was the son of Mary, eldest
                    daughter of Charles I. The marriage had strengthened the claims of both, and
                    they were proclaimed joint sovereigns of England on 12th February 1689, Scotland
                    following the example of England on the 11th April. They had no issue, and the
                    Act of Settlement passed in 1701, excluding Catholics from the throne, secured
                    the succession to Anne, second daughter of James II., and on her death without
                    issue to the Protestant House of Hanover, descended from the princess Elizabeth,
                    daughter of James I., wife of Frederick, count palatine of the Rhine. On the
                    death of Anne in 1714, George, elector of Hanover, eldest son of Sophia,
                    electress of Hanover (only surviving child of the princess Elizabeth), and
                    Ernest, youngest son of George, duke of Brunswick, consequently became sovereign
                    of Great Britain and Ireland, and, notwithstanding somewhat formidable attempts
                    in behalf of the elder Stuart line in 1715 and 1745, the Hanoverian succession
                    has remained uninterrupted, and has ultimately won universal assent. The female
                    line of James II. ended with the death of his daughter, Queen Anne. James,
                    called James III. by the Jacobites and the Old Pretender by the Hanoverians, had
                    two sons,—Charles Edward, the Young Pretender, who died without legitimate issue
                    in 1780, and Henry, titular duke of York, commonly called Cardinal York, at
                    whose death in 1807 the male line of James II. came to an end. He was also the
                    last lineal male representative of any of the crowned heads of the race, so far
                    as either England or Scotland was concerned, and excepting of course the
                    Hanoverian line. In the female Stuart line there are, however, still nearer
                    heirs to the throne than those of the Hanoverian line, viz., the descendants of
                    Henrietta, duchess of Orleans, daughter of Charles I., represented now only in
                    Maria Theresa, married to Prince Louis Leopold of Bavaria, and their nine
                    children. The male representation of the family, being extinct in the royal
                    lines, is claimed by the earls of Galloway and also by the Stewarts of
                    Castlemilk, but the claims of both are more than doubtful.</p>
