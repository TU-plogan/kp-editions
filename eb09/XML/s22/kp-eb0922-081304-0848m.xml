                    p. 269); but there is no reason to doubt that Syracuse was founded by Archias of
                    Corinth as part of a joint enterprise together with Corcyra, and the received
                    date 735 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> may pass as approximate.<note

                    >Amat Narr.,</hi> 2.</p></note> The first settlement was on a small island,
                    parted from the coast by a very narrow channel (for map, see pl. IL). It points
                    southward, in front of a deep bay, which, with the opposite headland
                    (Plemmyrium), it helps to shelter from the sea. This formed the Great Harbour;
                    the Lesser Harbour of Laccius lay to the north of the island, between it and a
                    peninsula of the mainland, with the open sea to the east and north. The
                    peninsula consists of part of a hill which almost everywhere leaves some space
                    between itself and the sea. To the west of the Great Harbour a marshy plain lies
                    on each side of the river Anapus. On the south side of the river is a smaller
                    hill. The coast of the island and of the peninsula is rocky. That of the harbour
                    is for the most part flat, except part of the west and south sides and the
                    headland opposite the island. From the island the city spread over the whole
                    peninsula, while a detached suburb (Polichne) arose on the outlying hill beyond
                    Anapus. The marshy ground between the two was not fit for building. All these
                    additions have been gradually forsaken, and the modern town is confined to the
                    island.</p>
                <p>The island was called Ortygia, a name connected with the Delian legend of Artemis
                    (see Holm, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. Sic.,</hi> i. 886), but often simply the
                    Island (Liv., xxv. 24, 30). Though the lowest part of the city, its position and
                    strength made it the citadel, and it is therefore often spoken of by Diodorus
                    and Plutarch as if it had been a real acropolis. It is famous for the fountain
                    of Arethusa, connected in Greek legend with the river Alpheus in
                    Peloponnesus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Pind.,

                    first settlement the island was held by Sicels; some have thought that a
                    Phoenician element lingered on under both Sicels and Greeks. It is certain
                    (Herod., vii. 166) that Syracuse and Carthage stood in relations to one another
                    which were not usual between Greek and barbarian cities. It has also been
                    thought from some legendary hints that Polichne was the original Syracuse, and
                    that the plural form (<hi rend="italic">Συράκουσαι</hi>) arose from the union of
                    Ortygia and Polichne. But the plural form is common enough in other cases. The
                    chief evidence for the belief is that the<pb break="no"

                    and that (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Nic.,</hi> 14) the register of Syracusan
                    citizens was kept there.</p>
                <p>Till the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> our notices
                    of Syracusan history are quite fragmentary. Almost the only question is whether,
                    as some stray notices (Athen., i. 56; see Müller’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donans,</hi> i. 161, Eng. tr.) might suggest, the primitive kingship was
                    retained or renewed at Syracuse, as it certainly was in some other Greek
                    colonies. A king Pollis is spoken of; but nothing is known of his actions. It is
                    far more certain that Syracuse went through the usual revolutions of a Greek
                    city. The descendants of the original settlers kept the land in their own hands,
                    and they gradually brought the Sicel inhabitants to a state not unlike
                    villainage. Presently other settlers, perhaps not always Greek, gathered round
                    the original Syracusan people; they formed a distinct body, <hi rend="italic"
                    >δημος</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plebs,</hi> personally free, but with an
                    inferior political franchise or none at all. The old citizens thus gradually
                    grew into an exclusive or aristocratic body, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >yάμοpοι</hi> or landowners. We hear incidentally of disputes, seditions, and
                    changes, among others the banishment of a whole <hi rend="italic">yens</hi>
                    (Thuc., V. 5; Arist., <hi rend="italic">Pol.,</hi> v. 3, 5, 4, 1 ); but we have
                    no dates or details till we have entered the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> In its external development Syracuse differed somewhat from other
                    Sicilian cities. Although it lagged in early times behind Loth Gela and Acragas
                    (Agrigentum), it very soon began to aim at a combination of land and sea power.
                    Between 663 and 598 it founded the settlements of Acrae, Casmenae, and Camarina,
                    of which the first was unusually far inland. The three together secured for
                    Syracuse a continuous dominion to the south-east coast. They were not strictly
                    colonies but outposts; Camarina indeed was destroyed after a revolt against the
                    ruling city (Thuc., v. 1). That the inland Sicel town of Henna was ever a
                    Syracusan settlement there is no reason to believe. Of this early time some
                    architectural monuments still remain, as the two temples in Ortygia, one of
                    which is now the metropolitan church, and the small remains of the Olympieum or
                    temple of Zeus in Polichne,—all of course in the ancient Doric style.</p>
                <p>The second period of Syracusan history, which roughly begins with the 5th
                    century, is far better ascertained. It is a period of change in every way. The
                    aristocratic commonwealth becomes in turn a tyranny and a democracy; and
                    Syracuse becomes the greatest Greek city in Sicily, the mistress of other
                    cities, the head of a great dominion,— for a moment, of the greatest dominion in
                    Hellas. Strange to say, all this growth begins in subjection to the ruler of
                    another city. Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, held the chief power in eastern
                    Sicily at the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    (498-491). He threatened Syracuse as well as other cities, and it was delivered
                    only by the joint intervention of Corinth and Corcyra, and by the cession of the
                    vacant territory of Camarina. In 485 the Syracusan <hi rend="italic">8ημος</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> joined with the Sicel serf population to drive
                    out the <hi rend="italic">gamoroi,</hi> the ruling oligarchs. These last craved
                    help of Gelon, the successor of Hippocrates, who took possession of Syracuse
                    without opposition, and made it the seat of his power. Syracuse now grew by the
                    depopulation of other cities conquered by Gelon. He gave citizenship both to
                    mercenaries (Diod., xi. 73) and to settlers from old Greece (Paus., v. 27, 16,
                    17; Pind., <hi rend="italic">Olymp.,</hi> vi.), so that Syracuse became a city
                    of mingled race, in which the new citizens had the advantage. The town spread to
                    the mainland: the new town of Achradina, with separate fortifications, arose on
                    the eastern part of the adjoining peninsula (Diod., xi. 73), while Ortygia
                    became the inner city, the stronghold of the ruler. Indeed in the form of
                    unwalled suburbs the city seems to have spread even beyond Achradina (Diod., xi.
                    61, 68, 72). Gelon’s general rule was mild, and he won fame as the champion of
                    Hellas by his great victory over the Carthaginians at Himera. He is said to have
                    been greeted as king; but he does not seem to have taken the title in any formal
                    way.</p>
                <p>Gelon’s brother and successor Hiero (478-467) kept up the power of the city; he
                    won himself a name by his encouragement of poets and philosophers; and his
                    Pythian and Olympian victories made him the special subject of the songs of
                    Pindar. He appeared also as a Hellenic champion in the defence of Cumae, and he
                    attempted to found a Syracusan colony on the island of Aenaria, now Ischia. But
                    his internal government, unlike that of Gelon, was suspicious, greedy, and
                    cruel. After some family disputes the power passed to his brother Thrasybulus,
                    who was driven out next year by a general rising (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sicily,</hi> p. 16). In this revolution Thrasybulus and his mercenaries held
                    the fortified quarters of Ortygia and Achradina; the revolted people held the
                    unwalled suburbs, already, it is plain, thickly inhabited. Thrasybulus yielded
                    to the common action of Siceliots and Sicels. Syracuse again became a free
                    commonwealth, and, as the effect of the tyranny had been to break down old
                    distinctions, it was now a democratic commonwealth. Renewed freedom was
                    celebrated by a colossal statue of Zeus Eleutherius and by a yearly feast in his
                    honour. But when the mercenaries and other new settlers were shut out from
                    office<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Diod., xi. 72;
                    cf. Arist., <hi rend="italic">Pol.,</hi> v. 3, 10, and Grote’s note, v.
                    319.</p></note> new struggles arose. The mercenaries again held Ortygia and
                    Achradina. The people now walled in the suburb of Tyche to the west of Achradina
                    (Diod., xi. 73). The mercenaries were at last got rid of in 461. Although we
                    hear of attempts to seize the tyranny and of an institution called <hi
                    rend="italic">petalism,</hi> like the Athenian ostracism, designed to guard
                    against such dangers, popular government was not seriously threatened for more
                    than fifty years. The part of Syracuse in general Sicilian affairs has been
                    traced in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Sicily</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.);</hi> but one striking scene is wholly local, when the defeated Ducetius
                    took refuge in the hostile city (451), and the common voice of the people bade
                    “spare the suppliant.” We have but one solitary notice of the great military and
                    naval strength of Syracuse in 439 (Diod., xii. 30). Yet all that we read of
                    Syracusan military and naval action during the former part of the Athenian siege
                    shows how Syracuse had lagged behind the cities of old Greece, constantly
                    practised as they were in warfare both by land and sea.</p>
                <p>The Athenian siege (415-413) is of the deepest importance for the topography of
                    Syracuse, and it throws some light on the internal politics. Hermocrates, the
                    best of counsellors for external affairs, is suspected, and seemingly with
                    reason, of disloyalty to the democratic constitution. Yet he is, like Nicias and
                    Phocion, the official man, head of a board of fifteen generals, which he
                    persuades the people to cut down to three. Athenagoras, the demagogue or
                    opposition speaker, has the best possible exposition of democratic principles
                    put into his mouth by Thucydides (vi. 36-40). Through the whole siege<note

                    siege are Thucydides (bks. vi. and vii.), Diodorus (bk. xiii.), and Plutarch,
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of Nicias.</hi></p></note> there was a treasonable party
                    within the city, which—for what motive we are not told— kept up a correspondence
                    with the besiegers.</p>
                <p>The speech of Athenagoras is that of a very clever demagogue; it sums up very
                    forcibly all that can be said against oligarchy, and it may have been perfectly
                    sincere. But his views were overruled, and preparation was made in earnest for
                    the city’s defence. When the Athenian fleet under Nicias and Lamachus was at
                    Rhegium in Italy, the question for the commanders was whether they should seek
                    to strengthen themselves by fresh alliances on the spot or strike the blow at
                    once. Lamachus was for immediate action, and there can hardly be a doubt that
                    Syracuse must have fallen before a sudden attack by so formidable an armament in
                    the summer of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n850/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0850-0815"/> 415. The Syracusans were neither at unity among
                    themselves nor by any means adequately prepared for effectual defence.
                    Throughout the whole struggle it is perfectly clear that they owed their final
                    deliverance to the most extraordinary good fortune. Athens had the prize within
                    her grasp, and she lost it wholly through the persistent dilatoriness and
                    blundering of her general, the desponding, vacillating Nicias. It was at his
                    advice that the summer and autumn of 415 were frittered away and the siege not
                    begun till the spring of 414. By that time the Syracusans were both in better
                    spirits and better prepared: their troops were better organized, and they had
                    built a wall from the Great Harbour to Panagia so as to screen them from attack
                    on the side of Epipolae on the northwest. The effect of this was to bar the
                    enemy’s approach and push back his blockading lines, which had to be carried
                    over an inconveniently large extent of ground. The Syracusans had been at first
                    thoroughly cowed; but they were cowed no longer, and they even plucked up
                    courage to sally out and fight the enemy on the high ground of Epipolae. They
                    were beaten and driven back; but at the suggestion of Hermocrates they carried a
                    counter-work up the slope of Epipolae, which, if completed, would cut in two the
                    Athenian lines and frustrate the blockade. At this point Nicias showed
                    considerable military skill. The Syracusans’ work was destroyed by a prompt and
                    well-executed attack; and a second counter work carried across marshy ground
                    some distance to the south of Epipolae and near to the Great Harbour was also
                    demolished after a sharp action, in which Lamachus fell. However, the blockade
                    on the land side was now almost complete, and the Athenian fleet had at the same
                    time entered the Great Harbour. The citizens began to think of surrender, and
                    Nicias was so confident that he neglected to push his advantages. He left a gap
                    in his lines at the point where Epipolae slopes down to the sea, and he omitted
                    to occupy an important position on its north-western ridge, known as Euryalus, a
                    pass which commanded on this side the approach to the city from the
                    interior.</p>
                <p>The second act of the drama may be said to open with the irretrievable blunder of
                    Nicias in letting the Spartan Gylippus first land in Sicily, and then march at
                    the head of a small army, partly levied on the spot, across the island, and
                    enter Syracuse by way of Epipolae, through the Euryalus pass. Gylippus was felt
                    to be the representative of Sparta, and of the Peloponnesian Greeks generally,
                    and his arrival inspired the Syracusans with the fullest confidence. Just before
                    his arrival a few ships from Corinth had made their way into the harbour with
                    the news that a great fleet was already on its way to the relief of the city.
                    The tables were now completely turned, and we hear of nothing but defeat and
                    disaster for the besiegers till their final overthrow. The military skill of
                    Gylippus enabled the Syracusan militia to meet the Athenian troops on equal
                    terms, to wrest from them their fortified position on Plemmyrium, and to reduce
                    them to such a plight that, as Nicias said in his despatch to Athens towards the
                    close of 414, they were themselves besieged rather than besieging. In the spring
                    of the following year Syracuse once again gave herself up for lost, when
                    seventy-three warships from Athens, under Demosthenes, entered the harbour with
                    a large force of heavy infantry and light troops. Demosthenes decided at once to
                    make a grand attack on Epipolae, with a view to recovering the Athenian
                    blockading lines and driving the Syracusans back within the city walls. The
                    assault was made by night, by the uncertain light of the moon, and this
                    circumstance turned what was very nearly a successful surprise into a ruinous
                    defeat. The affair seems to have been well planned up to a certain point, and
                    well executed; but the Athenian van, flushed with a first success, their ranks
                    broken and disordered by a pursuit of the enemy over rough ground, were repulsed
                    with great loss by a body of heavy armed Boeotians, and driven back in disorder.
                    The confusion spread to the troops behind them, and the action ended in a wild
                    flight through the narrow roads and passes of Epipolae. The army was now
                    thoroughly out of heart, and Demosthenes was for at once breaking up the camp,
                    embarking the troops, and sailing back to Athens. But Nicias could not bring
                    himself to face the Athenian people at home, nor could he be prevailed on to
                    retire promptly to some position on the coast, such as Catana or Thapsus, where
                    the army would be at least able to maintain itself for a time. He dallied till
                    the end of August, many weeks after the defeat, and on the 27th of that month
                    was an eclipse of the moon, on the strength of which he insisted on a delay of
                    almost another month. His fleet too lingered uselessly in the harbour, till,
                    after a frantic effort to break out and a desperate conflict, it was utterly
                    defeated and half destroyed. The broken and demoralized army, its ranks thinned
                    by fever and sickness, at last began its hopeless retreat in the face of the
                    numerous Syracusan cavalry, and, after a few days of dreadful suffering, was
                    forced to lay down its arms. The Syracusans sullied the glory of their triumph
                    by huddling their prisoners iuto their stone-quarries,—a living death, dragged
                    out, for some of them at least, to the space of seventy days.</p>
                <p>Her great deliverance and victory naturally stirred up the energies of Syracuse
                    at home and abroad. Syracusan ships under Hermocrates now play a not unimportant
                    part in the warfare between Sparta and Athens on the coast of Asia. Under the
                    influence of Diodes the constitution became a still more confirmed democracy,
                    some at least of the magistracies being filled by lot, as at Athens (Diod.,
                    xiii. 31, 35; Arist., <hi rend="italic">Pol.,</hi> v. 3-6). Diodes appears also
                    as the author of a code of laws of great strictness, which was held in such
                    esteem that later lawgivers were deemed only its expounders. There seems no
                    reason to suppose, with Holm, an earlier lawgiver Diodes distinct from the
                    demagogue; but the story of his death by his own hand to punish a breach of his
                    own law is, we may suspect, a repetition of the story of Charondas (Diod., xiii.
                    33; cf. xii. 19). Under these influences Hermocrates was banished in 409; he
                    submitted to the sentence, notwithstanding the wishes of his army. He went back
                    to Sicily, warred with Carthage on his own account, and brought back the bones
                    of the unburied Syracusans from Himera, but was still so dreaded that the people
                    banished Diodes without restoring him. In 407 he was slain in an attempt to
                    enter the city, and with him was wounded one who was presently to outstrip both
                    rivals.</p>
                <p>This was Dionysius, son of another Hermocrates, and an adherent of the
                    aristocratic party, but soon afterwards a demagogue, though supported by some
                    men of rank, among them the historian Philistus (Diod., xiii. 91, 92). By
                    accusing the generals engaged at Gela in the war against Carthage, by obtaining
                    the restoration of exiles, by a variety of tricks played at Gela itself, he
                    secured his own election, first as one of the generals, then as sole general (or
                    with a nominal colleague) with special powers. He next, by another trick,
                    procured from a military assembly at Leontini a vote of a bodyguard; he hired
                    mercenaries and in 406-5 came back to Syracuse as tyrant of the city (Diod.,
                    xiii. 91-96). Dionysius kept his power till his death thirtyeight years later
                    (367). But it was wellnigh overthrown before he had fully grasped it. His defeat
                    before Gela (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sicily,</hi> p. 18) was of course turned
                    against him. His enemies in the army, chiefly the horsemen, reached Syracuse
                    before him, plundered his house—he had not yet a fortress —and horribly
                    maltreated his wife; but they took no political or military steps against
                    himself. He came and took his vengeance, slaying and driving out his enemies,
                    who established themselves at Aetna (Diod., xiii. 113). This revolution and the
                    peace with the Carthaginians confirmed Dionysius in the possession of Syracuse,
                    but of no great territory beyond, as Leontini was again a separate city. It left
                    Syracuse the one great Hellenic city of Sicily, which, however enslaved at home,
                    was at least independent of the barbarian. Dionysius was able, like Gelon,
                    though with less success and less honour, to take up the part of the champion of
                    Hellas.</p>
                <p>During the long tyranny of Dionysius the city grew greatly in size, population,
                    and grandeur. Plato says (<hi rend="italic">Epist.,</hi> vii. ) that he gathered
                    all Sicily into it. In fact the free Greek cities and communities, in both
                    Sicily and southern Italy, were sacrificed to Syracuse; there the greatness and
                    glory of tho Greek world in the West were concentrated. The mass of the
                    population of Gela and Camarina in the disastrous year 405 had, at the prompting
                    of Dionysius, taken refuge at Syracuse. Gela had in the previous year received
                    the fugitive inhabitants of Acragas (Agrigentum), which had been sacked by the
                    Carthaginians. Syracuse thus absorbed three of the chief Greek cities of Sicily.
                    It received large accessions from some of the Greek cities of southern Italy,
                    from Hipponium on its west and Caulonia on its east coast, both of which
                    Dionysius captured in 389 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There had also been an
                    influx of free citizens from Rhegium. At the time of the Athenian siege Syracuse
                    consisted of two quarters—the Island and the “outer city” of Thucydides,
                    generally known as Achradina, and bounded by the sea on the north and east, with
                    the adjoining suburb of Apollo Temenites farther inland at the foot of the
                    southern slopes of Epipolae. With the vast increase in its population, it now
                    grew<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n851/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0851-0816"/> into a city of four quarters. The suburb
                    Temenites was expanded into Neapolis (New Town), spreading over the adjoining
                    slopes. A district stretching down to the sea, to the north-west of Achradina,
                    was taken in, and subsequently enlarged into a separate fortified town. Tyche
                    (<hi rend="italic">Tύχη</hi>) was the name given to this quarter, according to
                    Cicero (<hi rend="italic">In Verr.,</hi> iv. 52, 53) from an old temple of
                    Fortune somewhere within its limits, —a fact which seems to indicate that the
                    spot must have been inhabited in very early times. But of this Thucydides says
                    nothing, and his silence on a point which would have naturally entered into his
                    description of the Athenian blockading operations is somewhat perplexing. This
                    quarter was in Cicero’s time the most populous part of the entire city; it was
                    practically secured by the new city walls, which were drawn inland in a
                    triangular form so as to enclose the hill of Epipolae, the apex of the triangle
                    being the fortress of Euryalus, the remains of which are said to be the most
                    perfect existing specimen of ancient fortification. Syracuse was now secure on
                    the land side. The Island (Ortygia) had been provided with its own defences,
                    converted in fact into a separate stronghold, with a fort to serve specially as
                    a magazine of corn, and with a citadel or acropolis which stood apart, and might
                    be held as a last refuge. Dionysius, to make himself perfectly safe, drove out a
                    number of the old inhabitants and turned the place into barracks for his
                    soldiers, he himself living in the citadel. For any unpopularity he may have
                    thus incurred he seems to have made up by his great works for the defence of the
                    city; these were executed under the direction of the most skilful engineers, and
                    are said to have found employment for 60,000 men. The new lines covered an
                    extent of 3½ miles, and were constructed of huge well-cut blocks of stone from
                    the neighbouring quarries. Each quarter of the city had its own distinct
                    defences, and Syracuse was now the most splendid and the best fortified of all
                    Greek cities. Its naval power, too, was vastly increased; the docks were
                    enlarged; and 200 new warships were built. Besides the triremes, or vessels with
                    three banks of oars, we hear of quadriremes and quinqueremes with four and five
                    banks of oars,—larger and taller and more massive ships than had yet been used
                    in Greek sea warfare. The fleet of Dionysius was the most powerful in the
                    Mediterranean. It was doubtless fear and hatred of Carthage, from which city the
                    Greeks of Sicily had suffered so much, that urged the Syracusans to acquiesce in
                    the enormous expenditure which they must have incurred under the rule of
                    Dionysius. Much too was done for the beauty of the city as well as for its
                    strength and defence. Several new temples were built, and gymnasia erected
                    outside the walls near the banks of the Anapus (Diod., xv. 13).</p>
                <p>“Fastened by chains of adamant” was the boastful phrase in which Dionysius
                    described his empire; but under his son, the younger Dionysius, an easy,
                    goodnatured, unpractical man, a sort of cleverish dilettante, a reaction set in
                    amongst the restless citizens of Syracuse, which, with its vast and mixed
                    population, must have been full of elements of turbulence and faction. But the
                    burdensome expenditure of the late reign would be enough to account for a good
                    deal of discontent. A remarkable man now comes to the front,—Dion, the friend
                    and disciple of Plato, and for a time the trusted political adviser of
                    Dionysius, whom he endeavoured to impress with a conviction of the infinite
                    superiority of free and popular government to any form of tyranny or despotism.
                    Dion’s idea seems to have been to make Dionysius something like a constitutional
                    sovereign, and with this view he brought him into contact with Plato. All went
                    well for a time; but Dionysius had those about him who were opposed to any kind
                    of liberal reform, and the result was the banishment of Dion from Syracuse as a
                    dangerous innovator. Ten years afterwards, in 357, the exile entered Achradina a
                    victor, welcomed by the citizens as a deliverer both of themselves and of the
                    Greeks of Sicily generally. As yet, however, this was the only part of the city
                    gained. A siege and blockade, with confused fighting and alternate victory and
                    defeat, and all the horrors of fire and slaughter, followed, till Dion made
                    himself master of the mainland city. Ortygia, however, was still held by
                    Dionysius; but, provisions failing, it also was soon surrendered. Dion’s rule
                    lasted only three years, for he perished in 354 by the hand of a Syracusan
                    assassin. It was, in fact, after all his professions, little better than a
                    military despotism. The tyrant’s stronghold in the Island was left standing, and
                    Dion actually opposed a proposal for its destruction. The man who won immense
                    popularity by the proposal was murdered, and Dion seems to have been an
                    accomplice in the crime.</p>
                <p>Of what took place in Syracuse during the next ten years we know but little. The
                    younger Dionysius came back and from his island fortress again oppressed the
                    citizens; the plight of the city, torn by faction and conflicts and plundered by
                    foreign troops, was so utterly wretched that all Greek life seemed on the verge
                    of extinction (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Epist.,</hi> viii.). Sicily, too, was
                    again menaced by Carthage. Syracuse, in its extremity, asked help from the
                    mother-city, Corinth; and now appears on the scene one of the noblest figures in
                    Greek history, <hi rend="smallcaps">Timoleon</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>).
                    To him Syracuse owed her deliverance from the younger Dionysius and from the
                    rule of despots, and to him both Syracuse and the Sicilian Greeks owed a
                    decisive triumph over Carthage and the safe possession of Sicily west of the
                    river Halycus, the largest portion of the island. From 343 to 337 he was supreme
                    at Syracuse, with the hearty goodwill of the citizens. The younger Dionysius had
                    been allowed to retire to Corinth; his island fortress was destroyed and
                    replaced by a court of justice. Syracuse rose again out of her desolation—grass,
                    it is said, grew in her streets—and, with an influx of a multitude of new
                    colonists from Greece and from towns of Sicily and Italy, once more became a
                    prosperous city. Timoleon, having accomplished his work, accepted the position
                    of a private citizen, though, practically, to the end of his life he was the
                    ruler of the Syracusan people. After his death (337) a splendid monument, with
                    porticoes and gymnasia surrounding it, known as the Timoleonteum, was raised at
                    the public cost to his honour.</p>
                <p>In the interval of twenty years between the death of Timoleon and the rise of
                    Agathocles to power another revolution at Syracuse transferred the government to
                    an oligarchy of 600 leading citizens. All we know is the bare fact. It was
                    shortly after this revolution, in 317, that Agathocles with a body of
                    mercenaries from Campania and a host of exiles from the Greek cities, backed up
                    by the Carthaginian Hamilcar, who was in friendly relations with the Syracusan
                    oligarchy, became tyrant or despot of the city, assuming subsequently, on the
                    strength of his successes against Carthage, the title of king. Syracuse passed
                    through another reign of terror; the new despot proclaimed himself the champion
                    of popular government, and had the senate and the heads of the oligarchical
                    party massacred wholesale. This man of blood seems to have had popular manners,
                    and to have known how to flatter and cajole, for a unanimous vote of the people
                    gave him absolute control over the fortunes of Syracuse. His wars in Sicily and
                    Africa left him time to do something for the relief of the poorer citizens at
                    the expense of the rich, as well as to erect new fortifications and public
                    buildings; and under his strong government Syracuse seems to have been at least
                    quiet and orderly. After his death in 289 comes another miserable and obscure
                    period of revolution and despotism, in which Greek life was dying out; and but
                    for the brief intervention of Pyrrhus in 278 Syracuse, and indeed all Sicily,
                    would have fallen a prey to the Carthaginians.</p>
                <p>A better time began under Hiero II., who had fought under Pyrrhus and who rose
                    from the rank of general of the Syracusan army to be tyrant—king, as he came to
                    be soon styled—about 270. During his reign of over fifty years, ending probably
                    in 216, Syracuse enjoyed tranquillity, and seems to have grown greatly in wealth
                    and population. Hiero’s rule was kindly and enlightened, combining good order
                    with a fair share of liberty and selfgovernment. His financial legislation was
                    careful and con-<pb break="no"

                    the corn tithes were accepted and maintained under the Roman government, and one
                    of the many bad acts of the notorious Verres, according to Cicero, was to set
                    them aside (Cic., <hi rend="italic">In Verr.,</hi> ii. 13; iii. 8). It was a
                    time too for great public works,— works for defence at the entrance of the
                    Lesser Harbour between the Island and Achradina, and temples and gymnasia. Hiero
                    through his long reign was the staunch friend and ally of Rome in her struggles
                    with Carthage; but his paternal despotism, under which Greek life and
                    civilization at Syracuse had greatly flourished, was unfortunately succeeded by
                    the rule of a man who wholly reversed his policy.</p>
                <p>Hieronymus, the grandson of Hiero, thought fit to ally himself with Carthage; he
                    did not live, however, to see the mischief he had done, for he fell in a
                    conspiracy which he had wantonly provoked by his arrogance and cruelty. There
                    was a fierce popular outbreak and more bloodshed: the conspirators were put to
                    death and Hiero’s family was murdered; whilst the Carthaginian faction, under
                    the pretence of delivering the city from its tyrants, got the upper hand and
                    drew the citizens into open defiance of Rome. Marcellus was then in command of
                    the Roman army in Sicily, and he threatened the Syracusans with attack unless
                    they would get rid of Epicycles and Hippocrates, the heads of the anti-Roman
                    faction. Epicydes did his best to stir up the citizens of Leontini against Rome
                    and the Roman party at Syracuse. Marcellus therefore struck his first blow at
                    Leontini, which was quickly stormed; and the tale of the horrors of the sack was
                    at once carried to Syracuse and roused the anger of its population, who could
                    not but sympathize with their near neighbours, Greeks like themselves. The
                    general feeling was now against any negotiations with the Roman general, and,
                    putting themselves under Epicydes and Hippocrates, they closed their gates on
                    him. Marcellus, after an unsucessful attempt to negotiate, began the siege in
                    regular form (214 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> by both land and sea,
                    establishing a camp on Polichne, where stood the old temple of Olympian Zeus;
                    but he made his chief assault on the northern side and on the defences of Tyche,
                    particularly at the Hexapylum, the entrance facing Megara and Leontini. His
                    assault seawards was made mainly on Achradina, but the city was defended by a
                    numerous soldiery and by what seem to have been still more formidable, the
                    ingenious contrivances of Archimedes, whose engines dealt havoc among the Roman
                    ships, and frustrated the attack on the fortifications on the northern slopes of
                    Epipolae (Liv., xxiv. 34). Marcellus had recourse to a blockade, but
                    Carthaginian vessels from time to time contrived to throw in supplies. At length
                    treachery began to work within. Information was given him in the spring of 212
                    (two years from the commencement of the siege) that the Syracusans were
                    celebrating a great festival to Artemis; making use of this opportunity, he
                    forced the Hexapylum entrance by night and established himself in Tyche and on
                    the heights of Epipolae. The strong fortress of Euryalus held out for a time,
                    but, being now isolated, it soon had to surrender. The “outer” and the “inner
                    city” of Thucydides still held out, whilst a Carthaginian fleet was moored off
                    Achradina and Carthaginian troops were encamped on the spot. But a pestilence
                    broke out in the autumn of 212, which swept them clean away, and thinned the
                    Roman ranks. The ships sailed away to Carthage; on their way back to Syracuse
                    with supplies they could not get beyond Cape Pachynus owing to adverse winds,
                    and they were confronted by a Roman fleet. All hope for the city being now at an
                    end, the Syracusans threw themselves on the mercy of Mar cellus; but Achradina
                    and the Island still held out for a brief space under the Syracusan mercenaries,
                    till one of their officers, a Spaniard, betrayed the latter position to the
                    enemy, and at the same time Achradina was carried and taken. Marcellus gave the
                    city up to plunder (Liv., XXV. 31), and the art treasures<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Statues and pictures are particularized by

                    no doubt—were conveyed to Rome. From this time art seems to have become quite
                    fashionable in certain Roman circles. Archimedes perished in the confusion of
                    the sack, while he was calmly pursuing his studies (Liv., xxv. 31).</p>
                <p>Syracuse was now simply one of the provincial cities of Rome’s empire, and its
                    history is henceforward merged in that of Sicily. It retained much of its Greek
                    character and many of its finest public buildings, even after the havoc wrought
                    by Marcellus. Its importance and historic associations naturally marked it out
                    as the residence of the Roman praetor or governor of Sicily. Cicero often speaks
                    of it as a particularly splendid and beautiful city, as still in his own day the
                    seat of art and culture<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    52, 53) he gives an elaborate description of its four quarters (Achradina,
                    Neapolis, Tyche, the Island), or rather the four cities which composed it. It
                    seems to have suffered in the civil wars at the hands of Sextus Pompeius, the
                    son of the triumvir, who for a short time was master of Sicily; to repair the
                    mischief, new settlers were sent by Augustus in 21 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and established in the Island and in the immediately adjoining part
                    of Achradina (Strabo, vi. 270, ed. Kramer). It is in these districts that the
                    remains of Roman works— of amphitheatres and other public buildings—are mainly
                    to be traced. We hear nothing of any importance about Syracuse during the period
                    of the empire. It had its own senate and its own magistrates.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Local self-government, in
                    fact, like most of the Greek cities.</p></note> Caius Caligula restored its
                    decayed walls and some of its famous temples (Suetonius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caius,</hi> 21). Tacitus, in a passing mention of it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ann.,</hi> xiii. 49), says that permission was granted to the . Syracusans
                    under Nero to exceed the prescribed number of gladiators in their shows. Hence
                    the city by that time must have been provided with an amphitheatre. In the 4th
                    century it is named by the poet Ausonius in his <hi rend="italic">Ordo Nobilium
                    Urbium,</hi> chiefly, perhaps, on the strength of its historic memories.</p>
                <p>Modern Syracuse is confined to the island of Ortygia, and is only about 2½ miles
                    in circumference. The island is irregularly oval in shape, and extends from
                    north to south on the east side of the fine natural harbour, the Porto Grande
                    <hi rend="italic">Magnus Portus).</hi> On the north it is connected with the
                    mainland by a dyke or narrow isthmus, and between the southern extremity and the
                    opposite peninsula of Massolivieri, the ancient Plemmyrium, there is a stretch
                    of 1300 yards, forming the entrance to the harbour. The approach to the town
                    from the mainland is defended by a dilapidated citadel of the time of Charles
                    V., and the southern extremity is occupied by a castle named after George
                    Maniaces, the last Byzantine general by whom it was held in the 11th century
                    before it fell into the hands of the Saracens. The town is further defended by
                    walls with bastions. The streets are in general narrow, and their chief feature
                    consists in their numerous convents with wooden-latticed windows. One tolerably
                    wide and handsome street crosses the island from east to west. Besides the
                    fortifications, the principal objects of interest are the cathedral of Santa
                    Maria delle Colonne (the ancient temple of Minerva), adjoining which is the
                    archiepiscopal residence; the archaeological museum, the finest works preserved
                    in which are a statue of Venus in Parian marble and a colossal head of Zeus; and
                    the fountain of Arethusa, which still bubbles up as clear and abundant as ever
                    on the west side of the island. Its waters, however, are no longer drinkable, an
                    earthquake in 1170 having allowed the sea water to become mingled with them.
                    From the neighbourhood of this fountain a favourite promenade extends northwards
                    along the shore of the Porto Grande.</p>
                <p>Syracuse has been a place of little importance since the year 878, when it was
                    destroyed by the Saracens under Ibrahim ibn Ahmed.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n853/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0853-0818"/> Since that date the mainland portion of the city
                    has never been rebuilt. Syracuse is the seat of an archbishop, and since 1865
                    has been the capital of a province, which takes its name from the town. The
                    inhabitants manufacture drugs and other chemical articles, earthenware, &amp;c.,
                    and carry on a considerable trade, principally in wine. In 1885 785 vessels of
                    21,818 tons entered the port and 778 vessels of 21,480 tons cleared. At Syracuse
                    Admiral de Ruyter died in 1676 after his defeat by the French at Agosta. The
                    population in 1881 was 21,157.</p>
