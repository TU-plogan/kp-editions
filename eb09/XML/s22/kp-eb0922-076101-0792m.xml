                    of any age, was born in Hoey’s Court, Dublin, November 30, 1667. Like Pope’s,
                    his family was of Yorkshire origin; in the time of Charles I. the representative
                    of one branch had obtained a peerage, which expired with him. The first of his
                    own immediate ancestors known to us was a clergyman, rector of St Andrew’s,
                    Canterbury, from 1569 to 1592, whose son succeeded him in that living, and whose
                    grandson was the Rev. Thomas Swift, vicar of Goodrich in Herefordshire, renowned
                    for his eccentricity, his mechanical ingenuity, and, above all, his stubborn
                    devotion to Charles I. and the persecutions he underwent in consequence.
                    Plundered thirty-six times, and ultimately ejected from his living, he died in
                    1658, leaving his thirteen children a small and greatly impoverished landed
                    estate and the questionable advantage of a substantial claim on the gratitude of
                    the restored sovereign. More fortunate than most ruined cavaliers, his eldest
                    son Godwin soon obtained the attorney-generalship of the palatinate of
                    Tipperary. This piece of good fortune naturally attracted other members of the
                    family across the channel,—among them Jonathan, one of the youngest of nine
                    brothers, but already husband of Abigail Ericke of Leicester, a lady of ancient
                    descent and means more limited than his own. A student of law, but never called
                    to the bar, Jonathan appears to have subsisted for some years on windfalls and
                    casual employments. At length (1665) he became steward of the King’s Inns
                    (answering to the Inns of Court in England), an office of small emolument. Two
                    years afterwards he died suddenly, leaving an infant daughter and a widow
                    pregnant with the future dean of St Patrick’s. So embarrassed had his
                    circumstances been that, although considerable debts were owing to the estate,
                    Mrs Swift was for the moment unable to pay the expense of his interment. Thus
                    Swift’s first experience of life was that of a dependant on the charity of his
                    uncles, more particularly of Godwin; and the inevitable bitterness of the
                    situation was aggravated by the grudging manner in which the Tipperary official
                    seemed to dole out his parsimonious help. In fact, the apparently prosperous
                    relative was the victim of unfortunate speculations, and chose rather to be
                    reproached with avarice than with imprudence. A virulent resentment became
                    ingrained into the youth’s whole nature, and, though ultimately acquainted with
                    the real state of the case, he never mentioned his uncle with kindness or
                    respect. Other relatives did more to merit his regard. Yet he took no pride in
                    his Irish connexions or nativity, and a singular adventure in his infancy seems
                    to have afforded him a pretext for insinuating that he was really born in
                    England. "When he was but two years old his nurse, a native of Whitehaven, was
                    recalled to that town by an illness in her family. So attached had she become to
                    her charge as to clandestinely carry him away with her, Mrs Swift was induced to
                    consent to his remaining with her for a time, and the child spent three years in
                    Cumberland. By his return his education had made considerable progress, and in
                    the next year he was sent to the grammar school at Kilkenny. There can be no
                    question as to the author of <hi rend="italic">Gulliver</hi> having been a
                    remarkable child, but unfortunately only one anecdote of his school-days has
                    been preserved. It is the story, graphically narrated by himself, of his having
                    once invested the whole of his pocket-money in the purchase of an old horse
                    condemned to the knacker’s yard, his momentary triumph over his school-fellows,
                    and his mortification on discovering the uselessness of his acquisition,—an
                    anecdote highly characteristic of his daring pride and ambition, and from which,
                    instead of the moral he professed to discover, he might have derived an augury
                    of the majestic failure of his life.</p>
                <p>In April 1682 Swift matriculated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he failed to
                    distinguish himself, “By the ill-treatment of his nearest relations,” he says,
                    meaning especially his uncle Godwin, “he was so discouraged and sunk in his
                    spirits that he too much neglected his academic studies, for some part of which
                    he had no great relish by nature; so that when the time came for taking his
                    degree as bachelor of arts he was stopped of his degree for dulness and
                    insufficiency, and at last hardly admitted in a manner little to his credit,
                    which is called in that college <hi rend="italic">speciali gratia,</hi> February
                    15, 1685.” The college roll, nevertheless, shows that the only subject in which
                    Swift absolutely failed was natural philosophy, including mathematics, in which
                    the future author of the <hi rend="italic">Voyage to Laputa</hi> was hardly
                    likely to excel, nor is it surprising that a student of fitful and unruly
                    temperament should have performed his obligatory theme <hi rend="italic"
                    >negligenter.</hi> His examination in Greek and Latin was satisfactory, and the
                    extent of desultory information evinced by his writings seems to prove that he
                    had always been an industrious reader. His mortification made him reckless, and
                    he repeatedly underwent academic censure during the next three years, though it
                    is not certain whether some of the records supposed to apply to him do not in
                    fact relate to his cousin Thomas.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0793-0762"/> In 1688 Swift quitted the university, and, after
                    a brief residence with his mother at Leicester, entered the family of Sir
                    William Temple at Moor Park, near Farnham, as he declares for the advantage of
                    Temple’s conversation, but at least partly as an amanuensis. A distant
                    relationship between his mother and Lady Temple appears to have recommended him
                    to this post, which he found trying to his pride and independence. Temple was,
                    as Swift admitted, “a man of sense and virtue,” but his temper was exclusive,
                    his manners formal, and he had retired from public affairs from self-regard and
                    over-fastidiousness. If he solaced his voluntary ostracism by a comparison with
                    the elegant retirement and lettered ease of Cicero, it did not therefore occur
                    to him to compare his obscure Irish secretary with the Roman orator’s amanuensis
                    Tiro, who had, at least, invented shorthand. We, who know that in the patron’s
                    place the dependant would have governed the nation, need not be surprised at
                    finding, full twenty years afterwards, the iron of servitude still rankling in
                    the latter’s haughty soul. He withdrew from Temple’s service on a pretext of ill
                    health from May 1690 to August 1691, but returned, and undoubtedly made himself
                    useful to his employer, who on one occasion rendered him the medium of a
                    confidential communication to King William, who had consulted Temple on the bill
                    for triennial parliaments, then sanctioned by both branches of the legislature.
                    Swift did his best to enforce Temple’s arguments in favour of the measure, and
                    was in after life wont to refer to the failure of his rhetoric as the most
                    useful lesson his vanity had ever received. Struck, it would seem, rather by the
                    physical than the mental endowments of the robust young Irishman, William
                    offered him a troop of horse, a proposal which appears to have been subsequently
                    commuted into a promise of church preferment. Swift had already (July 1692)
                    proceeded to the degree of M.A. at Oxford, and the execution of his design to
                    embrace the ecclesiastical profession was hastened by a quarrel with Temple,
                    occasioned by the latter’s reluctance to contract any definite engagement to
                    provide for him. Throwing up his employment, he passed (May 1694) over into
                    Ireland, but found his views impeded by the refusal of all the bishops to ordain
                    him without some certificate of the regularity of his deportment while in
                    Temple’s family. Five months passed ere he could bring himself to solicit this
                    favour from his old patron, which he ultimately did in a letter submissive in
                    appearance, but charged to the full with smothered rage and intense humiliation.
                    Forgiveness was easy to one in Temple’s place and of Temple’s disposition, and
                    he not only despatched the requisite testimonials, but added a recommendation
                    which obtained for Swift the living of Kilroot, in the diocese of Down and
                    Connor (January 1695). His residence here was not fated to be of long duration.
                    Temple, who knew his value and had not parted with him willingly, soon let him
                    understand that a return was open to him, and Swift, whose resentment was cooled
                    by time, and soothed by the acknowledgment of his value to his patron, readily
                    complied (May 1696). He continued to reside with Sir William till the latter’s
                    death in January 1699. No further disagreement troubled their intimacy, and
                    Temple bequeathed Swift the charge of editing his writings, a laborious but not
                    an unprofitable commission.</p>
                <p>Macaulay has justly indicated the familiarity with public affairs acquired by
                    Swift at Moor Park as one main cause of his subsequent distinction as a
                    politician, and here too he laid the foundation of his literary renown. He is
                    reported to have read regularly for eight hours every day; and we have his own
                    authority for his having, as early as 1691, “written and burned, and written
                    again, more on all manner of subjects than perhaps any man in England.” The only
                    relics of these early days, however, belong to a species of composition in which
                    he was little qualified to excel. He has, indeed, a name among the poets of
                    England, but the merit of his verse is usually in the ratio of its approach to
                    the <hi rend="italic">sermo pedestris.</hi> Mistaking the nature of his powers,
                    he must needs begin with Pindarics, and the result may be imagined. Yet his own
                    simple account of his feelings while endeavouring composition proves that the
                    mood was right though the channel was wrong, and that there was error as well as
                    truth in his kinsman Dryden’s severe and unforgiven remark, “Cousin Swift, you
                    will never be a poet.” Swift’s first prose composition betrayed his resentment.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Battle of the Books</hi> (1697), a satirical
                    contribution to the controversy on the comparative merits of the ancients and
                    the moderns raised by Perrault, but with especial reference to the question of
                    the genuineness of the letters of Phalaris, on which his patron Temple had taken
                    the wrong side, Swift for the first and last time committed a plagiarism, and
                    sought to conceal it by an untruth. It is undoubtedly adapted, though certainly
                    improved from, De Callières’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire Poétique de la Guerre
                    nouvellement déclarée entre les Anciens et les Modernes.</hi> Here also his
                    sarcasm for the first and last time recoiled upon himself. The satire against
                    Dryden and Bentley wants, indeed, nothing but truth to be excellent; but the
                    pictures of the former in his monstrous helmet aud the latter in his patchwork
                    mail yield in ludicrousness to the idea of the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pindaric Odes</hi> presuming to ridicule the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Absalom and Achitophel,</hi> and the inglorious student of Trinity College,
                    Dublin, challenging the first philologist of the age on a question of classical
                    scholarship. It is, however, to his credit that his learning was greater than
                    that of the other writers on his side and his pretensions less. Swift’s next
                    literary labour was his edition of Temple’s posthumous works, already mentioned.
                    They appeared with a dedication to King William, which was to have made the
                    editor a prebendary. A petition to this effect miscarried, as he always
                    believed, through the negligence or ill-will of the nobleman who undertook to
                    present it. Be this as it may, he had become too important to be overlooked, and
                    soon obtained the post of secretary and chaplain to Earl Berkeley, one of the
                    lords justices of Ireland. The better half of this appointment, however, escaped
                    him on his arrival in that country, his secretaryship being transferred to a Mr
                    Bushe, who, when Lord Berkeley had at length an opportunity of recompensing
                    Swift’s disappointment by the gift of the deanery of Derry, successfully exerted
                    his influence in favour of another clergyman, who is asserted to have gained his
                    interest by the judicious outlay of a thousand pounds. With bitter indignation
                    Swift threw up his chaplaincy, but was ultimately reconciled to his patron by
                    the presentation to the rectory of Agher, in Meath, with the united vicarages of
                    Laracor and Rathbeggan. For the first time in his life he might now call himself
                    his own master, and had an opportunity of exhibiting, free from suspicion of
                    external constraint, that stern regard to duty which was not the least prominent
                    feature of his character. In an age of general laxity—in a priest of an alien
                    church, whose most energetic servants commonly succumbed to the mortifying
                    conviction of their uselessness and the detestation they excited among the
                    people for whom they laboured, the parishioners of Laracor found a clergyman
                    whom they might have heard three times a week. The energy, however, which
                    probably gained the respect, certainly failed to influence the convictions, of
                    his Catholic flock. We have his own authority for reckoning his average
                    congregation at “half a score”; and on one occasion his clerk Roger was his only
                    auditor. In fact, his exertions in the pulpit were more meritorious than his
                    achievements; he entirely lacked the fire, the self-oblivion, the expansive<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0794-0763"/> geniality of the orator. He himself characterized
                    his discourses as “pamphlets,” and, if meant to imply their arid and
                    argumentative character, the criticism is just. The author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tale of a Tub,</hi> which he had had by him since 1696 or 1698,
                    must have felt conscious of powers capable of far more effective exercise; and
                    his resolution to exchange divinity for politics must appear fully justified on
                    a comparison of these inconclusive essays with another performance of the same
                    period. The <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the Dissensions in Athens and
                    Rome</hi> (September 1700), written in the Whig interest, “without humour and
                    without satire,” and intended as a dissuasive from the pending impeachment of
                    Somers and three other noblemen, received the honour, extraordinary for the
                    maiden publication of a young politician, of being generally attributed to
                    Somers himself or to Burnet, the latter of whom found a public disavowal
                    necessary. Three years and a half later appeared a more remarkable work.
                    Clearness, cogency, masculine simplicity of diction, are conspicuous in the
                    pamphlet, but true creative power told the <hi rend="italic">Tale of a Tub.</hi>
                    “Good God! what a genius I had when I wrote that book !” was his own exclamation
                    in his latter years. It is, indeed, if not the most amusing of Swift’s satirical
                    works, the most strikingly original, and the one in which the compass of his
                    powers is most fully displayed. In his kindred productions he relies mainly upon
                    a single element of the humorous,—logical sequence and unruffled gravity
                    bridling in an otherwise frantic absurdity, and investing it with an air of
                    sense. In the <hi rend="italic">Tale of a Tub</hi> he lashes out in all
                    directions. The humour, if less cogent and cumulative, is richer and more
                    varied; the invention too, is more daringly original and more completely out of
                    the reach of ordinary faculties. The supernatural coats and the quintessential
                    loaf may be paralleled but cannot be surpassed; and the book is throughout a
                    mine of suggestiveness, as, for example, in the anticipation of Carlyle’s
                    clothes philosophy within the compass of a few lines. At the same time it wants
                    unity and coherence, it attains no conclusion, and the author abuses his
                    digressive method of composition and his convenient fiction of hiatuses in the
                    original manuscript. The charges it occasioned of profanity and irreverence were
                    natural, but groundless. There is nothing in the book inconsistent with Swift’s
                    professed and real character as a sturdy Church of England parson, who accepted
                    the doctrines of his church as an essential constituent of the social order
                    around him, battled for them with the fidelity of a soldier defending his
                    colours, and held it no part of his duty to understand, interpret, or assimilate
                    them.</p>
                <p>Before the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Tale of a Tub,</hi> Swift had
                    taken a step destined to exercise a most important influence on his life, by
                    inviting two ladies to Laracor. Esther Johnson, a dependant of Sir William
                    Temple’s (born in March 1681), whose acquaintance he had made in the latter’s
                    family, and whom he has immortalized as “Stella,”<note anchored="true"

                    over with her chaperon, Mrs Dingley, and was soon permanently domiciled in his
                    neighbourhood. The melancholy tale of Swift’s attachment will be more
                    conveniently narrated in another place, and is only alluded to here for the sake
                    of chronology. Meanwhile the sphere of his intimacies was rapidly widening. He
                    had been in England for three years together, 1701 to 1704, and counted Pope,
                    Steele, and Addison among his friends. The success of his pamphlet gained him
                    ready access to all Whig circles; but already his confidence in that party was
                    shaken, and he was beginning to meditate that change of sides which has drawn
                    down upon him so much but such unjustifiable obloquy. The true state of the case
                    may easily be collected from his next publications— <hi rend="italic">The
                    Sentiments of a Church of England Man,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Reasonableness of a Test</hi> (1708). The vital differences among the friends of
                    the Hanover succession were not political, but ecclesiastical. From this point
                    of view, Swift’s sympathies were entirely with the Tories. As a minister of the
                    church he felt his duty and his interest equally concerned in the support of her
                    cause; nor could he fail to discover the inevitable tendency of Whig doctrines,
                    whatever caresses individual Whigs might bestow on individual clergymen, to
                    abase the Establishment as a corporation. He sincerely believed that the
                    ultimate purpose of freethinkers was to escape from moral restraints, and he had
                    an unreasoning antipathy to Scotch Presbyterians and English Dissenters. One of
                    his pamphlets, written about this time, contains his recipe for the promotion of
                    religion, and is of itself a sufficient testimony to the extreme materialism of
                    his views. Censorships and penalties are among the means he recommends. His pen
                    was exerted to better purpose in the most consummate example of his irony, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Argument against Abolishing Christianity.</hi> About this
                    time, too (November 1707), he produced his best poem, <hi rend="italic">Baucis
                    and Philemon,</hi> which, as he frankly tells us, owes very much to the
                    corrections of Addison.</p>
                <p>From February 1708 to April 1709 Swift was in London, urging upon the Godolphin
                    administration the claims of the Irish clergy to the first-fruits and tenths
                    (“Queen Anne’s bounty”), already granted to their brethren in England. His
                    having been selected for such a commission shows that he was not yet regarded as
                    a deserter from the Whigs, although the ill-success of his representations
                    probably helped to make him one. By November 1710 he was again domiciled in
                    London, and writing his <hi rend="italic">Journal to Stella,</hi> that unique
                    exemplar of a giant’s playfulness, “which was written for one person’s private
                    pleasure and has had indestructible attractiveness for every one since.” In the
                    first pages of this marvellously minute record of a busy life we find him
                    depicting the decline of Whig credit and complaining of the cold reception
                    accorded him by Godolphin, whose penetration had doubtless detected the
                    precariousness of his allegiance. Within a few weeks he had become the lampooner
                    of the fallen treasurer, the bosom friend of Oxford and Bolingbroke, and the
                    writer of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> a journal established as the
                    exponent of Tory views (November 1710). He was now a power in the state, the
                    intimate friend and recognized equal of the first writers of the day, the
                    associate of ministers on a footing of perfect cordiality and familiarity. “We
                    were determined to have you,” said Bolingbroke to him afterwards; “you were the
                    only one we were afraid of.” He gained his point respecting the Irish
                    endowments; and, by his own account, his credit procured the fortune of more
                    than forty deserving or undeserving clients. The envious but graphic description
                    of his demeanour conveyed to us by Bishop Kennet attests the real dignity of his
                    position no less than the airs he thought fit to assume in consequence. The
                    cheerful, almost jovial, tone of his letters to Stella evinces his full
                    contentment, nor was he one to be moved to gratitude for small mercies. He had
                    it, in fact, fully in his own power to determine his relations with the
                    ministry, and he would be satisfied with nothing short of familiar and
                    ostentatious equality. His advent marks a new era in English political life, the
                    age of public opinion, created indeed by the circumstances of the time, but
                    powerfully fostered and accelerated by him. By a strange but not unfrequent<pb

                    spirit of his day laboured to enthrone a power which, had he himself been in
                    authority, he would have utterly detested and despised. For a brief time he
                    seemed to resume the whole power of the English press in his own pen and to
                    guide public opinion as he would. His services to his party as writer of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> which he quitted in July 1711, were even surpassed
                    by those which he rendered as the author of telling pamphlets, among which <hi
                    rend="italic">The Conduct of the Allies</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Remarks on
                    the Barrier Treaty</hi> (November and December 1711) hold the first rank. In
                    truth, however, he was lifted by the wave he seemed to command. Surfeited with
                    glory, the nation wanted a convenient excuse for relinquishing a burdensome war,
                    which the great military genius of the age was suspected of prolonging to fill
                    his pockets. The Whigs had been long in office. The High Church party had
                    derived great strength from the Sacheverell trial. Swift did not bring about the
                    revolution with which, notwithstanding, he associated his name. There seems no
                    reason to suppose that he was consulted respecting the great Tory strokes of the
                    creation of the twelve new peers and the dismissal of Marlborough (December
                    1711), but they would hardly have been ventured upon if <hi rend="italic">The
                    Conduct of the Allies</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Examiners</hi> had not
                    prepared the way. A scarcely less important service was rendered to the ministry
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Letter to the October Club,</hi> artfully composed to
                    soothe the impatience of Harley’s extreme followers. He had every claim to the
                    highest preferment that ministers could give him, but his own pride and
                    prejudice in high places stood in his way.</p>
                <p>Generous men like Oxford and Bolingbroke cannot have been unwilling to reward so
                    serviceable a friend, especially when their own interest lay in keeping him in
                    England. Notwithstanding, therefore, some dubious expressions in Swift’s
                    letters, natural to the deferred hope, we need not doubt their having actually
                    used their best efforts to obtain for him the vacant see of Hereford. Swift,
                    however, had formidable antagonists in the archbishop of York, whom he had
                    scandalized, and the duchess of Somerset, whom he had satirized. Anne was
                    particularly amenable to the influence of priestly and female favourites, and it
                    must be considered a proof of the strong interest made for Swift that she was
                    eventually persuaded to appoint him to the deanery of St Patrick’s, Dublin,
                    vacant by the removal of Bishop Sterne to Dromore. It is to his honour that he
                    never speaks of the queen with resentment or bitterness. In June 1713 he set out
                    to take possession of his dignity, and encountered a very cold reception from
                    the Dublin public. The dissensions between the chiefs of his party speedily
                    recalled him to England. He found affairs in a desperate condition. The queen’s
                    demise was evidently at hand, and the same instinctive good sense which had
                    ranged the nation on the side of the Tories, when Tories alone could terminate a
                    fatiguing war, rendered it Whig when Tories manifestly could not be trusted to
                    maintain the Protestant succession. In any event the occupants of office could
                    merely have had the choice of risking their heads in an attempt to exclude the
                    elector of Hanover, or of waiting patiently till he should come and eject them
                    from their posts; yet they might have remained formidable could they have
                    remained united. To the indignation with which he regarded Oxford’s refusal to
                    advance him in the peerage the active St John added an old disgust at the
                    treasurer’s pedantic and dilatory formalism, as well as his evident propensity,
                    while leaving his colleague the fatigues, to engross for himself the chief
                    credit of the administration. Their schemes of policy diverged as widely as
                    their characters: Bolingbroke’s brain teemed with the wildest plans, which
                    Oxford might have more effectually dis countenanced had he been prepared with
                    anything in their place. Swift’s endeavours after an accommodation were as
                    fruitless as unremitting. His mortification was little likely to temper the
                    habitual virulence of his pen, which rarely produced anything more acrimonious
                    than the attacks he at this period directed against Burnet and his former friend
                    Steele. One of his pamphlets against the latter (7‰ <hi rend="italic">Public
                    Spirit of the Whigs)</hi> was near involving him in a prosecution, some
                    invectives against the Scots having proved so exasperating to the peers of that
                    nation that they repaired in a body to the queen to demand the punishment of the
                    author, of whose identity there could be no doubt, although, like all Swift’s
                    writings, except the <hi rend="italic">Proposal for the Extension of
                    Religion,</hi> the pamphlet had been published anonymously. The immediate
                    withdrawal of the offensive passage, and a sham prosecution instituted against
                    the printer, extricated Swift from his danger.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the crisis had arrived, and the discord of Oxford and Bolingbroke had
                    become patent to all the nation. Foreseeing, as is probable, the impending fall
                    of the former, Swift retired to Upper Letcombe, in Berkshire, and there spent
                    some weeks in the strictest seclusion. This leisure was occupied in the
                    composition of his remarkable pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Free Thoughts an the
                    State of Public Affairs,</hi> which indicates his complete conversion to the
                    bold policy of Bolingbroke. The utter exclusion of Whigs as well as Dissenters
                    from office, the remodelling of the army, the imposition of the most rigid
                    restraints on the heir to the throne,—such were the measures which, by
                    recommending, Swift tacitly admitted to be necessary to the triumph of his
                    party. If he were serious, it can only be said that the desperation of his
                    circumstances had momentarily troubled the lucidity of his understanding; if the
                    pamphlet were merely intended as a feeler after public opinion, it is surprising
                    that he did not perceive how irretrievably he was ruining his friends in the
                    eyes of all moderate men. Bolingbroke’s daring spirit, however, recoiled from no
                    extreme, and, fortunately for Swift, he added so much of his own to the latter’s
                    MS. that the author was obliged to recall a production which might not
                    improbably have cost him his liberty and his deanery. This incident but just
                    anticipated the revolution which, after Bolingbroke had enjoyed a three days’
                    triumph over Oxford, drove him into exile and prostrated his party, but enabled
                    Swift to perform the noblest action of his life. Almost the first acts of
                    Bolingbroke’s ephemeral premiership were to order him a thousand pounds from the
                    exchequer and despatch him the most flattering invitations. The same post
                    brought a letter from Oxford, soliciting Swift’s company in his retirement; and,
                    to the latter’s immortal honour, he hesitated not an instant in preferring the
                    solace of his friend to the offers of St John. When, a few days afterwards,
                    Oxford was in prison and in danger of his life, Swift begged to share his
                    captivity; and it was only on the offer being declined that he finally directed
                    his steps towards Ireland, where he was very ill received. The draft on the
                    exchequer was intercepted by the queen’s death.</p>
                <p>These four busy years of Swift’s London life had not been entirely engrossed by
                    politics. First as the associate of Steele, with whom he quarrelled, and of
                    Addison, whose esteem for him survived all differences, afterwards as the
                    intimate comrade of Pope and Arbuthnot, the friend of Congreve and Atterbury,
                    Parnell and Gay, he entered deeply into the literary life of the period. He was
                    treasurer and a leading member of the Brothers, a society of wits and statesmen
                    which recalls the days of Horace and Maecenas. He promoted the subscription for
                    Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Homer,</hi> contributed some numbers to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatler, Spectator,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Intelligencer,</hi>

                    recommending the education of all blue-eyed children in depravity for the public
                    good must surely be his. His fugitive productions during this period are very
                    numerous, and mostly distinguished not only by pungent wit but by overflowing
                    animal spirits. The most celebrated are the cruel but irresistibly ludicrous
                    satires on the astrologer Partridge, a man in fact respectable for his sincere
                    belief in his art, and no mean writer. Many of his best poems belong to this
                    period. A more laboured work, his <hi rend="italic">Memorial</hi> to Harley,
                    proposing the regulation of the English language by an academy, is chiefly
                    remarkable as a proof of the deference paid to French taste by the most original
                    English writer of his day. His <hi rend="italic">History of the Last Four Years
                    of Queen Anne</hi> is not on a level with his other political writings. To sum
                    up the incidents of this eventful period of his life, it was during it that he
                    lost his mother, always loved and dutifully honoured, by death; his sister had
                    been estranged from him some years before by an imprudent marriage, which,
                    though making her a liberal allowance, he never forgave.</p>
                <p>The change from London to Dublin can seldom be an agreeable one. To Swift it
                    meant for the time the fall from unique authority to absolute insignificance.
                    All share in the administration of even Irish affairs was denied him; every
                    politician shunned him; and his society hardly included a single author or wit.
                    At a later period he talked of “dying of rage, like a poisoned rat in a hole”;
                    for some time, however, he was buoyed up by feeble hopes of a restoration to
                    England. So late as 1726 he was in England making overtures to Walpole, but he
                    had no claim on ministerial goodwill, and as an opponent he had by that time
                    done his worst. By an especial cruelty of fate, what should have been the
                    comfort became the bane of his existence. We have already mentioned his
                    invitation of Esther Johnson and Mrs Dingley to Ireland. Both before and after
                    his elevation to the deanery of St Patrick’s these ladies continued to reside
                    near him, and superintended his household during his absence in London. He had
                    frustrated a match proposed for Stella, and, with his evident delight in the
                    society of the dark-haired, brighteyed, witty beauty, a model, if we may take
                    his word, of all that woman should be, it seemed unaccountable that he did not
                    secure it to himself by the expedient of matrimony. A constitutional infirmity
                    has been suggested as the reason, and the conjecture derives support from
                    several peculiarities in his writings. But, whatever the cause, his conduct
                    proved none the less the fatal embitterment of his life and Stella’s and yet
                    another’s. He had always been unlucky in his relations with the fair sex. In
                    1694 he had idealized as “Varina” a Miss Waring, who then discouraged his
                    attentions, but two years later made him advances in her turn. Swift’s mind had
                    also changed, and he could find no better way out of the difficulty than an
                    insulting letter affecting to accept her proposal on terms which he knew must
                    put it out of the question. Varina was avenged by Vanessa, who pursued Swift to
                    far other purpose. Esther Vanhomrigh, the orphan daughter of a commissioner of
                    Irish trade, had become known to Swift at the height of his political influence.
                    He lodged close to her mother, and was a frequent guest at her table. Vanessa
                    insensibly became his pupil, and he insensibly became the object of her
                    impassioned affection. Her letters reveal a spirit full of ardour and
                    enthusiasm, and warped by that perverse bent which leads so many women to prefer
                    a tyrant to a companion. Swift, on the other hand, was devoid of passion. Of
                    friendship, even of tender regard, he was fully capable, but not of love. The
                    spiritual realm, whether in divine or earthly things, was a region closed to
                    him, where he never set foot. As a friend he must have greatly preferred Stella
                    to Vanessa; and from this point of view his loyalty to the original object of
                    his choice, we may be sure, never faltered. But Vanessa assailed him on a very
                    weak side. The strongest of all his instincts was the thirst for imperious
                    domination. Vanessa hugged the fetters to which Stella merely submitted.
                    Flattered to excess by her surrender, yet conscious of his binding obligations
                    and his real preference, he could neither discard the one beauty nor desert the
                    other. It is humiliating to human strength and consoling to human weakness to
                    find the Titan behaving like the least resolute of mortals, seeking refuge in
                    temporizing, in evasion, in fortuitous circumstance. He no doubt trusted that
                    his removal to Dublin would bring relief, but here again his evil star
                    interposed. Vanessa’s mother died (1714), and she followed him. Unable to marry
                    Stella without destroying Vanessa, or to openly welcome Vanessa without
                    destroying Stella, he was thus involved in the most miserable embarrassment;
                    still, for a time he continued to temporize. At length, unable to bear any more
                    Stella’s mute reproach and his own consciousness of wrong, he gave a reluctant
                    consent to a private marriage, which, as at least the weight of testimony seems
                    to prove, though there is no documentary evidence, was accordingly performed.
                    This was in 1716. At the same time he insisted on their union being kept a
                    strict secret, justifying a demand really dictated by tenderness for Vanessa,
                    and perhaps by the unavowable reason to which allusion has been made, on the
                    most futile and frivolous pretexts. Never more than a nominal wife, the
                    unfortunate Stella commonly passed for his mistress till the day of her death,
                    bearing her doom with uncomplaining resignation, and consoled in some degree by
                    unquestionable proofs of the permanence of his love, if his feeling for her
                    deserves the name. Meanwhile his efforts were directed to soothe Miss
                    Vanhomrigh, to whom he addressed <hi rend="italic">Cadenus [Decanus]and
                    Vanessa,</hi> the history of their attachment and the best example of his
                    serious poetry, and for whom he sought to provide honourably in marriage,
                    without either succeeding in his immediate aim or in thereby opening her eyes to
                    the hopelessness of her passion. In 1717, probably at his instance, she retired
                    from Dublin to Marley Abbey, her seat at Celbridge. For three years she and
                    Swift remained apart, but in 1720, on what occasion is uncertain, he began to
                    pay her regular visits. Sir Walter Scott found the Abbey garden still full of
                    laurels, several of which she was accustomed to plant whenever she expected
                    Swift, and the table at which they had been used to sit was still shown. But the
                    catastrophe of her tragedy was at hand. Worn out with his evasions, she at last
                    (1723) took the desperate step of writing to Stella, or according to another
                    account to Swift himself, demanding to know the nature of the connexion with
                    him, and this terminated the melancholy history as with a clap of thunder.
                    Stella replied by the avowal of her marriage, sent her rival’s letter to Swift,
                    and retired to a friend’s house. Swift rode down to Marley Abbey with a terrible
                    countenance, petrified Vanessa by his frown, and departed without a word,
                    flinging down a packet which only contained her own letter to Stella. Vanessa
                    died within a few weeks. She left the poem and correspondence for publication.
                    The former appeared immediately, the latter was suppressed until it was
                    published by Sir Walter Scott.</p>
                <p>Five years afterwards Stella followed Vanessa to the grave. The grief which the
                    gradual decay of her health evidently occasioned Swift is sufficient proof of
                    the sincerity of his attachment, as he understood it. It is a just remark of
                    Thackeray’s that he everywhere half-consciously recognizes her as his better
                    angel, and dwells on her wit<pb break="no"

                    exhibits for any other topic. Yet he could never overcome his repugnance to
                    acknowledge their union till she lay on her deathbed, when he was heard by Mrs
                    Whiteway (his cousin, a lady of fortune and talent, who, though not residing
                    with him, superintended his household during his latter years) to say, “Well my
                    dear, if you wish it, it shall be owned.” She answered, “It is too late.” On
                    January 28, 1728, she died, and her wretched lover sat down the same night to
                    record her virtues in language of unsurpassed simplicity, but to us who know the
                    story more significant for what it conceals than for what it tells. A lock of
                    her hair is preserved, with the inscription in Swift’s handwriting, most
                    affecting in its apparent cynicism, “Only a woman’s hair !” “Only a woman’s
                    hair,” comments Thackeray;</p>
                <p>“only love, only fidelity, purity, innocence, beauty, only the tenderest heart in
                    the world stricken and wounded, and passed away out of reach of pangs of hope
                    deferred, love insulted, and pitiless desertion; only that lock of hair left,
                    and memory, and remorse, for the guilty, lonely wretch, shuddering over the
                    grave of his victim.” The more unanswerable this tremendous indictment appears
                    upon the evidence the greater the probability that the evidence is incomplete.
                    <hi rend="italic">Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner.</hi> The hypothesis to
                    which we have referred must for ever remain an hypothesis, but better than any
                    other it not only excuses but explains.</p>
                <p>Between the death of Vanessa and the death of Stella, as though withheld by an
                    evil fate until he could no longer enjoy them, came the greatest political and
                    the greatest literary triumph of Swift’s life. He had fled to Ireland a broken
                    man, to all appearance politically extinct; a few years were to raise him once
                    more to the summit of popularity, though power was for ever denied him. With his
                    fierce hatred of what he recognized as injustice, it was impossible that he
                    should not feel exasperated at the gross misgovernment of Ireland for the
                    supposed benefit of England, the systematic exclusion of Irishmen from places of
                    honour and profit, the spoliation of the country by absentee landlords, the
                    deliberate discouragement of Irish trade and manufactures. An Irish patriot in
                    the strict sense of the term he was not; he looked upon the indigenous
                    population as conquered savages; but his pride and sense of equity alike
                    revolted against the stay-athome Englishmen’s contemptuous treatment of their
                    own garrison, and he delighted in finding a point in which the triumphant
                    faction was still vulnerable. His <hi rend="italic">Proposal for the Universal
                    Use of Irish Manufactures,</hi> published anonymously in 1720, urging the Irish
                    to disuse English goods, became the subject of a prosecution, which at length
                    had to be dropped. A greater opportunity was at hand. One of the chief wants of
                    Ireland in that day, and for many a day afterwards, was that of small currency
                    adapted to the daily transactions of life. Questions of coinage occupy a large
                    part of the correspondence of the primate, Archbishop Boulter, whose anxiety to
                    deal rightly with the matter is evidently very real and conscientious. There is
                    no reason to think that the English ministry wished otherwise; but secret
                    influences were at work, and a patent for supplying Ireland with a coinage of
                    copper halfpence was accorded to William Wood on such terms that the profit
                    accruing from the difference between the intrinsic and the nominal value of the
                    coins, about 40 per cent., was mainly divided between him and the duchess of
                    Kendal, the king’s mistress, by whose influence he had obtained the privilege.
                    Swift now had his opportunity, and the famous letters signed M. B. Drapier
                    (1724) soon set Ireland in a flame. Every effort was used to discover, or rather
                    to obtain legal evidence against, the author, whom, Walpole was assured, it
                    would then have taken ten thousand men to apprehend. None could be procured; the
                    public passion swept everything before it; the patent was cancelled; Wood was
                    compensated by a pension; Swift was raised to a height of popularity which he
                    retained for the rest of his life; and the only real sufferers were the Irish
                    people, who lost a convenience so badly needed that they might well have
                    afforded to connive at Wood’s illicit profits. Perhaps, however, it was worth
                    while to teach the English ministry that not everything could be done in
                    Ireland. Swift’s pamphlets, written in a style more level with the popular
                    intelligence than even his own ordinary manner, are models alike to the
                    controversialist who aids a good cause and to him who is burdened with a bad
                    one. The former may profit by the study of his marvellous lucidity and
                    vehemence, the latter by his sublime audacity in exaggeration and the sophistry
                    with which he involves the innocent halfpence in the obloquy of the nefarious
                    patentee.</p>
                <p>The noise of the Drapier’s letters had hardly died away when Swift acquired a
                    more durable glory by the publication of <hi rend="italic">Gulliver’s
                    Travels</hi> in 1726. The work had been at least partly written by 1722, and the
                    keenness of the satire on courts and statesmen suggests that it was planned
                    while Swift’s disappointments as a public man were still rankling and recent. It
                    is Swift’s peculiar good fortune that his book can dispense with the
                    interpretation of which it is nevertheless susceptible, and may be equally
                    enjoyed whether its inner meaning is apprehended or not. It is so true, so
                    entirely based upon the facts of human nature, that the question what particular
                    class of persons supplied the author with his examples of folly or misdoing,
                    however interesting to the commentator, may be neglected by the reader. It is
                    also fortunate for him that in three parts out of the four he should have
                    entirely missed “the chief end I propose to myself, to vex the world rather than
                    divert it.” The world, which perhaps ought to have been vexed, chose rather to
                    be diverted; and the great satirist literally strains his powers <hi
                    rend="italic">ut pueris placeat.</hi> Few books have added so much to the
                    innocent mirth of mankind as the first two parts of Gulliver; the misanthropy is
                    quite overpowered by the fun. The third part, equally masterly in composition,
                    is less felicitous in invention; and in the fourth Swift has indeed carried out
                    his design of vexing the world at his own cost. Human nature indignantly rejects
                    her portrait in the Yahoo as a gross libel, and the protest is fully warranted.
                    An intelligence from a superior sphere, bound on a voyage to the earth, might
                    actually have obtained a fair idea of average humanity by a preliminary call at
                    Lilliput or Brobdingnag, but not from a visit to the Yahoos. While <hi
                    rend="italic">Gulliver</hi> is infinitely the most famous and popular of Swift’s
                    works, it exhibits no greater powers of mind than many others. The secret of
                    success, here as elsewhere, is the writer’s marvellous imperturbability in
                    paradox, his teeming imagination, and his rigid logic. Grant his premises, and
                    all the rest follows; his world may be turned topsy-turvy, but the relative
                    situation of its contents is unchanged. The pains he took to be correct are
                    evinced by the care with which, as Prof. De Morgan has shown, he calculated the
                    proportions of Lilliput and Brobdingnag to ordinary humanity on the basis of 1
                    to 12 and 12 to 1 respectively, and his copying the description of the storm
                    word for word from Sturmy’s <hi rend="italic">Compleat Mariner.</hi> By such
                    accuracy and consistency he has given the wildest fiction imaginable an air of
                    veracity rivalling Defoe.</p>
                <p>Swift’s grave humour and power of enforcing momentous truth by ludicrous
                    exaggeration were next displayed in his <hi rend="italic">Modest Proposal for
                    Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland from Being a Burden to their
                    Parents,</hi> by fattening and eating them (1729), a parallel to the <hi

                    comic irony. The <hi rend="italic">Directions to Servants</hi> in like manner
                    derive their overpowering comic force from the imperturbable solemnity with
                    which all the misdemeanours that domestics can commit are enjoined upon them as
                    duties. The power of minute observation displayed is most remarkable, as also in
                    <hi rend="italic">Polite Conversation</hi> (written in 1731, published in 1738),
                    a surprising assemblage of the vulgarities and trivialities current in ordinary
                    talk. As in the <hi rend="italic">Directions,</hi> the satire, though cutting,
                    is good-natured, and the piece shows more animal spirits than usual in Swift’s
                    latter years. It was a last flash of gaiety. The attacks of giddiness and
                    deafness to which he had always been liable increased upon him, and his literary
                    compositions became confined to occasional verses, not seldom indecent and
                    commonly trivial, with the exception of his remarkable lines on his own death
                    and the delightful <hi rend="italic">Hamilton's Bawn,</hi> and to sallies
                    against the Irish bishops, in whose honest endeavours to raise the general
                    standard of their clergy he could only see arbitrary interference with
                    individuals. He fiercely opposed Archbishop Boulter’s plans for the reform of
                    the Irish currency, but admitted that his real objection was sentimental: the
                    coins should be struck as well as circulated in Ireland. His exertions in
                    repressing robbery and mendicancy were strenuous and successful. His popularity
                    remained as great as ever, and, when he was menaced by the bully Bettesworth,
                    Dublin rose as one man to defend him. He governed his cathedral with great
                    strictness and conscientiousness, and for years after Stella’s death continued
                    to hold a miniature court at the deanery. But his failings of mind were
                    exacerbated by his bodily infirmities; he grew more and more whimsical and
                    capricious, morbidly suspicious and morbidly parsimonious; old friends were
                    estranged or removed by death, and new friends did not come forward in their
                    place. For many years, nevertheless, he maintained a correspondence with Pope
                    and Bolingbroke, and with Arbuthnot and Gay until their deaths, with such warmth
                    as to prove that an ill opinion of mankind had not made him a misanthrope, and
                    that human affection and sympathy were still very necessary to him. The letters
                    become scarcer and scarcer with the decay of his faculties; at last, in 1740,
                    comes one to his best Dublin friend, Mrs Whiteway, of heart-rending pathos
                    :—</p>
                <p>“I have been very miserable all night, and to-day extremely deaf and full of

                <p>In March 1742 it was necessary to appoint guardians of Swift’s person and estate.
                    In September of the same year his physical malady reached a crisis, from which
                    he emerged a helpless wreck, with faculties paralysed rather than destroyed. “He
                    never talked nonsense or said a foolish thing.” The particulars of his case have
                    been investigated by Dr Bucknill and Sir William Wilde, who have proved that he
                    suffered from nothing that could be called mental derangement until the
                    “labyrinthine vertigo” from which he had suffered all his life, and which he
                    erroneously attributed to a surfeit of fruit, produced paralysis, “a symptom of
                    which was the not uncommon one of aphasia, or the automatic utterance of words
                    ungoverned by intention. As a consequence of that paralysis, but not before, the
                    brain, already weakened by senile decay, at length gave way, and Swift sank into
                    the dementia which preceded his death” (Craik, <hi rend="italic">Life of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Swift).</hi> The scene closed on October 19, 1745. With what he
                    himself described as a satiric touch, his fortune was bequeathed to found a
                    hospital for idiots and lunatics. He was interred in his cathedral, in the same
                    coffin as Stella, with the epitaph, written by himself, “Hic depositum est
                    corpus Jonathan Swift, S.T.P., hujus ecclesiae cathedralis decani; ubi saeva
                    indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit. Abi viator, et imitare, si poteris,
                    strenuum pro virili libertatis vindicem.”</p>
                <p>The stress which Swift thus laid upon his character as an assertor of liberty has
                    hardly been ratified by posterity, which has comparatively neglected the patriot
                    for the genius and the wit. Not unreasonably; for if half his patriotism sprang
                    from an instinctive hatred of oppression, the other half was disappointed
                    egotism. He utterly lacked the ideal aspiration which the patriot should
                    possess: his hatred of villainy was far more intense than his love of virtue.
                    The same cramping realism clings to him everywhere beyond the domain of
                    politics,—in his religion, in his fancies, in his affections. At the same time,
                    it is the secret of his wonderful concentration of power: he realizes everything
                    with such intensity that he cannot fail to be impressive. Except in his
                    unsuccessful essay in history, he never, after the mistake of his first Pindaric
                    attempts, strays beyond his sphere, never attempts what he is not qualified to
                    do, and never fails to do it. His writings have not one literary fault except
                    their occasional looseness of grammar and their frequent indecency. Within
                    certain limits, his imagination and invention are as active as those of the most
                    creative poets. As a master of humour, irony, and invective he has no superior;
                    his reasoning powers are no less remarkable within their range, but he never
                    gets beyond the range of an advocate. Few men of so much mental force have had
                    so little genius for speculation, and he is constantly dominated by fierce
                    instincts which he mistakes for reasons. As a man the leading note of his
                    character is the same,—strength without elevation. His master passion is
                    imperious pride,—the lust of despotic dominion. He would have his superiority
                    acknowledged, and cared little for the rest. Place and profit were comparatively
                    indifferent to him; he declares that he never received a farthing for any of his
                    works except <hi rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels,</hi> and that only by Pope’s
                    management; and he had so little regard for literary fame that he put his name
                    to only one of his writings. Contemptuous of the opinion of his fellows, he hid
                    his virtues, paraded his faults, affected some failings from which he was really
                    exempt, and, since his munificent charity could not be concealed from the
                    recipients, laboured to spoil it by gratuitous surliness. Judged by some
                    passages of his life he would appear a heartless egotist, and yet he was capable
                    of the sincerest friendship and could never dispense with human sympathy. Thus
                    an object of pity as well as awe, he is the most tragic figure in our
                    literature,—the only man of his age who could be conceived as affording a
                    groundwork for one of the creations of Shakespeare. “To think of him,” says
                    Thackeray, “is like thinking of the ruin of a great empire.” Nothing finer or
                    truer could be said.</p>
                <p>Swift’s correspondence is the best authority for his life. Of his contemporaries,
                    we are mainly indebted to his panegyrist Delany and his detractor Lord Orrery.
                    Hawkesworth compiled the particulars of his life, and published what was the
                    standard edition of his works till the appearance of Sir Walter Scott’s in 1814.
                    This edition is not likely to be superseded, but might with great advantage be
                    reissued with amendments and additions. The biography prefixed is based on
                    Hawkesworth, but is far more copiously and elegantly written. At the same time
                    the author’s views are frequently conventional, his judgments superficial, and
                    his good nature has made him too indulgent to his hero. The late John Forster
                    subjected all available records of Swift’s life to the most diligent scrutiny,
                    and in 1875 published the first volume, coming down to 1711, of a biography
                    intended to have been completed<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n799/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0799-0768"/> in three volumes. Invaluable in many respects, it
                    exhibited the process as well as the result of biography, and hence threatened
                    to be too long. Mr H. Craik, succeeding to the post vacated by Forster’s death,
                    judiciously reduced the scale, and produced in one volume (1882) a work which
                    will long rank as the standard one on the subject. Remarkable monographs on
                    Swift have been produced by Leslie Stephen in the “Men of Letters” series, Dr
                    Johnson in the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Poets,</hi> Thackeray in the <hi
                    rend="italic">English Humourists.</hi> Mr Stephen is anxiously impartial;
                    Johnson’s acuteness is perverted by his antipathy; Thackeray, as is natural in a
                    novelist, has dwelt disproportionately on the romantic side of Swift’s history,
                    and his pity for Stella and Vanessa forms too large an element in his general
                    judgment. But he has, better than any one else, apprehended the fearfully tragic
                    element in Swift’s character and fortunes. Swift’s early life has been carefully
                    investigated by Dr Barrett of Trinity College, and the final epoch of his life
                    by Monck Mason and Sir William Wilde. His greatness is exaggerated and his
                    failings are extenuated in two brilliant articles in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review,</hi> vols. cli. and clvi. Minor points in his life and
                    writings have received much elucidation from numerous inquirers, especially the
                    late Mr Charles Dilke and Colonel F. Grant. Mr Stanley Lane Poole has edited
                    selections from his works and correspondence, with excellent notes and prefaces,
                    and has prepared a valuable bibliography. (R. G. )</p>
