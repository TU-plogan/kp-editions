                    attempting to develop the mineral resources of his property. James was sent to
                    the High School at the age of nine, and remained there until he was fifteen,
                    when he entered the university. For two years he frequented the arts classes
                    (including botany), and in 1817 began the medical curriculum, devoting himself
                    with particular keenness to chemistry. His chemical experiments led him to the
                    discovery that “a valuable substance is obtainable from coal tar which has the
                    property of dissolving india-rubber,” and could be used for waterproofing silk
                    and other textile fabrics,—an idea which was patented a few months afterwards by
                    Macintosh of Glasgow. In the session of 1818-19 Syme became assistant and
                    demonstrator in the dissecting room of Liston, who had started as an extra-mural
                    teacher of anatomy in competition with his old master Barclay; in those years he
                    held also resident appointments in the infirmary and the fever hospital, and
                    spent some time in Paris practising dissection and operative surgery. In 1823
                    Liston handed over to him the whole charge of his anatomy classes, retaining his
                    interest in the school as a pecuniary venture; the arrangement did not work
                    smoothly, and a feud with Liston arose, which did not terminate until twenty
                    years later, when the latter was settled in London. Syme’s next venture was the
                    Brown Square school of medicine, which he started in 1824-25 in conjunction with
                    Dr Macintosh, Dr Fletcher, and others; the partnership was again inharmonious,
                    and soon came to an end. Announcing his intention to practise surgery only, Syme
                    started a surgical hospital of his own, Minto House hospital, which he carried
                    on from May 1829 to September 1833, with great success as a surgical charity and
                    school of clinical instruction. It was here that he first put into practice his
                    method of clinical teaching, which consisted in having the patients to be
                    operated or prelected upon brought from the ward into a lecture-room or theatre
                    where the students were seated conveniently for seeing and taking notes. His
                    private practice had become very considerable, his position having been assured
                    ever since his amputation at the hip joint in 1823, the first of the kind in
                    Scotland. In 1833 he succeeded Russel as professor of clinical surgery in the
                    university. Syme’s accession to the clinical chair was marked by two important
                    changes in the conditions of it: the first was that the professor should have
                    the care of surgical patients in the infirmary in right of his professorship,
                    and the second, that attendance on his course should be obligatory on all
                    candidates for the medical degree. When Liston removed to London in 1835 Syme
                    became the leading consulting surgeon in Scotland. On Liston’s death in 1847
                    Syme was offered his vacant chair of clinical surgery at University College,
                    London, and accepted it. He began practice in London in February 1848; but early
                    in May the same year difficulties with two of his colleagues at Gower Street and
                    a desire to “escape from animosity and contention” led him to throw up his
                    appointment. He returned to Edinburgh in July, and was re-instated in his old
                    chair, which the crown authority had meanwhile found a difficulty in appointing
                    to. The judgment of his friends was that “he was always right in the matter, but
                    often wrong in the manner, of his quarrels.” In 1849 he broached the subject of
                    medical reform in a letter to the lord advocate; in 1854 and 1857 he addressed
                    open letters on the same subject to Lord Palmerston; and in 1858 a Medical Act
                    was passed which largely followed the lines laid down by himself. As a member of
                    the General Medical Council called into existence by the Act, he made
                    considerable stir in 1868 by an uncompromising statement of doctrines on medical
                    education, which were thought by many to be reactionary; they were, however,
                    merely an attempt to recommend the methods that had been characteristic of
                    Edinburgh teaching since Cullen’s time,—namely, a constant reference of facts to
                    principles, the subordination (but not the sacrifice) of technical details to
                    generalities, and the preference of large professorial classes and the
                    “magnetism of numbers'” to the tutorial system, which he identified with
                    “cramming.” In April 1869 he had a paralytic seizure, and at once resigned his
                    chair; he never recovered his powers, and died on 26th June 1870.</p>
                <p>Syme’s surgical writings are numerous, although the terseness of his style and
                    directness of his method save them from being bulky. In 1831 he published <hi
