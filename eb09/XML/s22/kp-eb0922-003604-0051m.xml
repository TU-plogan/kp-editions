                    medicine and natural science at Würzburg, and obtained his doctor’s diploma in
                    1820. In 1822 he entered the service of the king of the Netherlands as medical
                    officer to the East Indian army. On his arrival at Batavia he was attached to a
                    new mission to Japan, sent by the Dutch with a view to improve their trading
                    relations with that country. Siebold was well equipped with scientific
                    apparatus, and he remained in Japan for six years, with headquarters at the
                    Dutch settlement on the little island of Deshima. His medical qualifications
                    enabled him to find favour with the Japanese, and he gathered a vast amount of
                    information concerning a country then almost as little known as Corea,
                    especially concerning its natural history and ethnography. He had comparatively
                    free access to the interior, and his reputation spreading far and wide brought
                    him visitors from all parts of the country. His valuable stores of information
                    were added to by trained natives whom he sent to collect for him in the
                    interior. In 1824 he published <hi rend="italic">De Historiae Naturalis in
                    Japonia Statu</hi> and in 1832 his splendid <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                    Japonica.</hi> His knowledge of the language enabled him also in 1826 to issue
                    from Batavia his <hi rend="italic">Epitome Linguae Japonicae.</hi> In Deshima he
                    also laid the foundation of his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Librorum
                    Japonicorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lsagoge in Bibliothecam Japonicam,</hi>
                    published after his return to Europe, as also his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Japonica,</hi> which, with the co-operation of J. Hoffmann, appeared at Leyden
                    in 1833. During the visit which he was permitted to make to Yedo (Tokio),
                    Siebold made the best of the rare opportunity; his zeal, indeed, outran his
                    discretion, since, for obtaining a native map of the country, he was thrown into
                    prison and compelled to quit Japan on 1st January 1830. On his return to Holland
                    he was raised to the rank of major, and in 1842 to that of colonel. After his
                    arrival in Europe he began to give to the world the fruits of his researches and
                    observations in Japan. His <hi rend="italic">Nippon; Archiv zur Beschreibung von
                    Japan und dessen Neben-und Schutz-Ländern</hi> was issued in five quarto volumes
                    of text, with six folio volumes of atlas and engravings. He also issued many
                    fragmentary papers on various aspects of Japan. In 1854 he published at Leyden
                    <hi rend="italic">Urkundliche Darstellung der Bestrebungen Niederlands und
                    Russlands zur Eröffnung Japans.</hi> In 1859 Siebold undertook a second journey
                    to Japan, and was invited by the emperor to his court. In 1861 he obtained
                    permission from the Dutch Government to enter the Japanese service as negotiator
                    between Japan and the powers of Europe, and in the same year his eldest son was
                    made interpreter to the English embassy at Yedo. Siebold was, however, soon
                    obliged by various intrigues to retire from his post, and ultimately from Japan.
                    Returning by Java to Europe in 1862, he set up his ethnographical collections,
                    which were ultimately secured by the Government of Bavaria and removed to
                    Munich. He continued to publish papers on various Japanese subjects, and
                    received honours from many of the learned societies of Europe. He died at Munich
                    on 18th October 1866. Siebold until recent years was our great authority on
                    Japan, and even now his writings on the natural history of that country have not
                    been superseded.</p>
