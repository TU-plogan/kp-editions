                    (1796-1866), scientific explorer of Japan and elder brother of the physiologist
                    noticed above, was born at Würzburg, Germany, on 17th February 1796. He studied
                    medicine and natural science at Würzburg, and obtained his doctor’s diploma in
                    1820. In 1822 he entered the service of the king of the Netherlands as medical
                    officer to the East Indian army. On his arrival at Batavia he was attached to a
                    new mission to Japan, sent by the Dutch with a view to improve their trading
                    relations with that country. Siebold was well equipped with scientific
                    apparatus, and he remained in Japan for six years, with headquarters at the
                    Dutch settlement on the little island of Deshima. His medical qualifications
                    enabled him to find favour with the Japanese, and he gathered a vast amount of
                    information concerning a country then almost as little known as Corea,
                    especially concerning its natural history and ethnography. He had comparatively
                    free access to the interior, and his reputation spreading far and wide brought
                    him visitors from all parts of the country. His valuable stores of information
                    were added to by trained natives whom he sent to collect for him in the
                    interior. In 1824 he published <hi rend="italic">De Historiae Naturalis in
                        Japonia Statu</hi> and in 1832 his splendid <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                        Japonica.</hi> His knowledge of the language enabled him also in 1826 to
                    issue from Batavia his <hi rend="italic">Epitome Linguae Japonicae.</hi> In
                    Deshima he also laid the foundation of his <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Librorum
                        Japonicorum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lsagoge in Bibliothecam

                    Hoffmann, appeared at Leyden in 1833. During the visit which he was permitted to
                    make to Yedo (Tokio), Siebold made the best of the rare opportunity; his zeal,
                    indeed, outran his discretion, since, for obtaining a native map of the country,
                    he was thrown into prison and compelled to quit Japan on 1st January 1830. On
                    his return to Holland he was raised to the rank of major, and in 1842 to that of
                    colonel. After his arrival in Europe he began to give to the world the fruits of
                    his researches and observations in Japan. His <hi rend="italic">Nippon; Archiv
                        zur Beschreibung von Japan und dessen Neben-und Schutz-Ländern</hi> was
                    issued in five quarto volumes of text, with six folio volumes of atlas and
                    engravings. He also issued many fragmentary papers on various aspects of Japan.
                    In 1854 he published at Leyden <hi rend="italic">Urkundliche Darstellung der
                        Bestrebungen Niederlands und Russlands zur Eröffnung Japans.</hi> In 1859
                    Siebold undertook a second journey to Japan, and was invited by the emperor to
                    his court. In 1861 he obtained permission from the Dutch Government to enter the
                    Japanese service as negotiator between Japan and the powers of Europe, and in
                    the same year his eldest son was made interpreter to the English embassy at
                    Yedo. Siebold was, however, soon obliged by various intrigues to retire from his
                    post, and ultimately from Japan. Returning by Java to Europe in 1862, he set up
                    his ethnographical collections, which were ultimately secured by the Government
                    of Bavaria and removed to Munich. He continued to publish papers on various
                    Japanese subjects, and received honours from many of the learned societies of
                    Europe. He died at Munich on 18th October 1866. Siebold until recent years was
                    our great authority on Japan, and even now his writings on the natural history
                    of that country have not been superseded.</p>
