                    rend="italic">ensilage, i.e.,</hi> the preservation of green food for cattle by
                    partial fermentation in silos, has become an important feature in agricultural
                    economy. In various parts of Germany a method of preserving green fodder
                    precisely similar to that used in the case of sauerkraut (see vol. iv. p. 618)
                    has prevailed for upwards of a century. Special attention was first directed to
                    the practice of ensilage by a French agriculturist, ' M. Auguste Goffart of
                    Sologne near Orleans, who in 1877 published a work <hi rend="italic">(Manuel de
                    la Culture et de l'Ensilage des Mais et autres Fourrages Verts)</hi> detailing
                    the experiences of many years in preserving green crops in silos. An English
                    translation of M. Goffart’s book by Mr J. B. Brown was published in New York in
                    1879, and, as various experiments had been previously made in the United States
                    in the way of preserving green crops in pits, M. Goffart’s experience attracted
                    considerable attention. The conditions of American dairy farming proved
                    eminently suitable for the ensiling of green maize fodder; and the success of
                    the method was soon indisputably demonstrated among the New England farmers. The
                    favourable results obtained in America led to much discussion and to the
                    extensive introduction of the system in the United Kingdom, where, with
                    different conditions, success has been more qualified, but still highly
                    encouraging.</p>
                <p>It has been abundantly proved that ensilage forms a wholesome and nutritious food
                    for cattle. It can be substituted for root crops with advantage, because it is
                    succulent and digestible; milk resulting from it is good in quality and taste;
                    it can be secured largely irrespective of weather; it carries over grass from
                    the period of great abundance and waste to times when none would otherwise be
                    available; and a larger number of cattle can be supported on a given area by the
                    use of ensilage than is possible by the use of green crops.</p>
                <p>A silo should have a depth of at least 15 feet, and may either be a pit or a
                    building above ground, provided it is water-tight and, as far as possible,
                    air-tight. The crops suitable for ensilage are the ordinary grasses, clovers,
                    lucerne, vetches, oats, rye, and maize; but various weeds may also be stored in
                    silos with good, results, notably spurrey, (<hi rend="italic">Spergula
                    arvensis),</hi> a most troublesome plant in poor light soils. As a rule the crop
                    should be mown when in full flower, and deposited in the silo on the day of its
                    cutting. Fair dry weather is not essential; but it is found that when moisture,
                    natural and extraneous, exceeds 75 per cent. of the whole, good results are not
                    obtained. The material is spread in uniform layers over the floor of the silo,
                    and closely packed and trodden down. If possible, not more than a foot or
                    thereby should be added daily, so as to allow the mass to settle down closely,
                    and to heat uniformly throughout. When the silo is quite filled a layer of straw
                    or some other dry porous substance is spread over the surface, then it is
                    covered with boards, and a pressure of not less than 100 lb per square foot is
                    applied by weighting or other mechanical means.</p>
                <p>A silo thus contains, to begin with, a mass of living vegetable cells surrounded
                    with a minimum of oxygen. The activity of the cells continuing, oxygen is
                    absorbed and carbonic acid evolved, and part of the starch of the plants is
                    converted into sugar. In the atmosphere of carbonic acid thus created the acid
                    ferments manifest their vitality, and acetic, lactic, and butyric acids are
                    developed at the expense of the starch and sugar. These chemical changes are
                    accompanied with an evolution of heat, and the temperature of the mass rises,
                    till, when it attains 122° Fahr., the action of the ferments is arrested. Should
                    the heat rise to 150° the vitality of the vegetable cells themselves is
                    destroyed; and also when the available oxygen is exhausted chemical change
                    ceases and sweet silage is produced. When from excess of moisture or other cause
                    the temperature of the silo does not reach 122° Fahr., the acid ferments are not
                    killed, and they go on evolving chiefly acetic and lactic acids, the results
                    being sour silage. These ferments, requiring nitrogen for their existence, act
                    on the nitrogenous constituents of the plants, rendering the albuminoids partly
                    soluble, evolving peptones, and by further splitting up producing amides, urea,
                    and ammonia. The production of sour silage is accompanied by much greater
                    transformation and loss than is incident to sweet silage; and in extreme action
                    the material acquires a most disagreeable odour. There is, however, no sharp
                    line of distinction between the two, and both varieties are eaten freely by
                    stock. Frequently a considerable loss occurs around the edges, and at other
                    points where air gets access to the mass, by mildewing. See <hi rend="italic"
