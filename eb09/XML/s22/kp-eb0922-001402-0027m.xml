                <p><label type="entry">SICILY</label>, slightly surpassed by Sardinia in superficial
                    extent, is, in its geographical and historical position, the greatest island of
                    the Mediterranean. As such it holds among European lands a position answering to
                    that of Great Britain, the greatest island of the Ocean, and the events of their
                    history have at more than one period brought the two islands into a close
                    connexion with one another. The geographical position of Sicily (see vol. xiii.
                    pl. IV.) led almost as a matter of necessity to its historical position, as the
                    meeting-place of the nations, the battle-field of contending races and creeds.
                    Lying nearer to the mainland of Europe and nearer to Africa than any other of
                    the great Mediterranean islands, Sicily is, next to Spain, the connecting link
                    between those two quarters of the world. It stands also as a breakwater between
                    the eastern and western divisions of the Mediterranean Sea. In prae-historic
                    times those two divisions were two vast lakes, and Sicily is a surviving
                    fragment of the land which once parted the two united seas and united the
                    continents which are now distinct. That Sicily and Africa were once joined we
                    know only from modern scientific research; that Sicily and Italy were once
                    joined is handed down in legend, unless the legend itself is not rather an
                    obvious guess. Sicily then, comparatively near to Africa, but much nearer to
                    Europe, has been a European land, but one specially open to invasion and
                    settlement from Africa. Dividing the eastern and western basins of the
                    Mediterranean, it has been a part of western Europe, but a part which has had
                    specially close relations with eastern Europe. It has stood at various times in
                    close connexion with Greece, with Africa, and with Spain; but its closest
                    connexion has been with the neighbouring land of Italy. Still Italy and Sicily
                    are thoroughly distinct lands, and the history of Sicily should never be looked
                    on as simply part of the history of Italy. Lying thus between Europe and Africa,
                    Sicily has been the battle-field of Europe and Africa. That is to say, it has
                    been at two separate periods the battle-field of Aryan and Semitic man. In the
                    later stage of the strife it has been the battle-field of Christendom and Islam.
                    This history Sicily shares with Spain to the west of it and with Cyprus to the
                    east. And with Spain the island has had several direct points of connexion.
                    There was in all likelihood a near kindred between the earliest inhabitants of
                    the two lands. In later times Sicily was ruled by Spanish kings, both alone and
                    in union with other kingdoms. The connexion with Africa has consisted simply in
                    the settlement of conquerors from Africa at two periods, first Phoenician, then
                    Saracen. On the other hand Sicily has been more than once made the road to
                    African conquest and settlement, both by Sicilian princes and by the Roman
                    masters of Sicily. The connexion with Greece, the most memorable of all, has
                    consisted in the settlement of many colonies from old Greece, which gave the
                    island the most brilliant part of its history, and which made the greater part
                    practically Greek. This Greek element was strengthened at a later time by the
                    long connexion of Sicily with the Eastern, the Greek-speaking, division of the
                    Roman empire. And the influence of Greece on Sicily has been repaid in more than
                    one shape by Sicilian rulers who have at various times held influence and
                    dominion in Greece and elsewhere beyond the Hadriatic (Adriatic). The connexion
                    between Sicily and Italy begins with the primitive kindred between some of the
                    oldest elements in each. Then came the contemporary Greek colonization in both
                    lands. Then came the tendency in the dominant powers in southern Italy to make
                    their way into Sicily also. Thus the Roman occupation of Sicily ended the
                    struggle between Greek and Phoenician. Thus the Norman occupation ended the
                    struggle between Greek and Saracen. Of this last came the long connexion between
                    Sicily and southern Italy under several dynasties. Lastly comes the late
                    absorption of Sicily in the modern kingdom of Italy. The result of these various
                    forms of Italian influence has been that all the other tongues of the island
                    have died out before the advance of a peculiar dialect of Italian. In religion
                    again both Islam and the Eastern form of Christianity have given way to its
                    Italian form. The connexion with England amounts to this, that both islands came
                    under Norman dynasties, that under Norman rule the intercourse between the two
                    countries was extremely close, and that the last time that Sicily was the seat
                    of a separate power it was under British protection.</p>
                <p>The Phoenician, whether from old Phoenicia or from Carthage, came from lands
                    which were mere strips of sea-coast with a boundless continent behind them. The
                    Greek of old Hellas came from a land of islands, peninsulas, and inland seas. So
                    did the Greek of Asia, though he had, like the Phoenician, a vast continent
                    behind him. In Sicily they all found a strip of sea-coast with an inland region
                    behind; but the strip of sea-coast was not like the broken coast of Greece and
                    Greek Asia, and the inland region was not a boundless continent like Africa or
                    Asia. In Sicily therefore the Greek became more continental, and the Phoenician
                    became more insular, than either nation had been in its own land. Neither people
                    ever occupied the whole island: the presence of the other hindered either from
                    occupying even the whole of the coast; nor was either people ever able to spread
                    its dominion over the earlier inhabitants very far inland. Sicily thus remained
                    a world of its own, with interests and disputes of its own, and divided among
                    inhabitants of various nations. The history of the Greeks of Sicily is
                    constantly connected with the history of old Hellas, but it runs a separate
                    course of its own. Their position answers somewhat to that of the English people
                    of the United States with regard to the mother-country of Great Britain. It
                    differs in this, that the independence of the Greek cities in Sicily was not the
                    result of warfare with the mother-country. Otherwise the analogy would have been
                    almost exact, if France or Spain had kept its old power in North America. The
                    Phoenician element ran an opposite course, as the independent Phoenician
                    settlements in Sicily sank into dependencies of Carthage. The entrance of the
                    Romans put an end to all practical independence on the part of either nation.
                    But Roman ascendency did not affect Greeks and Phoenicians in the same way.
                    Phoenician<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n28/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0028-0015"/> life gradually died out. But Roman ascendency
                    nowhere crushed out Greek life where it already existed, and in some ways it
                    strengthened it. Though the Greeks never spread their dominion over the island,
                    they made a peaceful conquest of it. This process was in no way hindered by the
                    Roman dominion; the work of assimilation went on still faster.</p>
                <p>The question now comes, Who were the original inhabitants of Sicily? The island
                    itself, <hi rend="italic">∑ικϵλία</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sicilia,</hi> plainly
                    takes its name from the Sikels (<hi rend="italic">∑ικϵλoί</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">Siculi),</hi> a people whom we find occupying a great part of the
                    island, chiefly east of the river Gela. They appear also in Italy, in the toe of
                    the boot, and older history or tradition spoke of them as having in earlier days
                    held a large place in Latium and elsewhere in central Italy. They were believed
                    to have crossed the strait into the island about 300 years before the beginning
                    of the Greek settlements, that is to say in the 11th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They found in the island a people called Sikans (<hi
                    rend="italic">∑ικαvoί</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sicani</hi>) <hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> whose name might pass for a dialectic form of their own, did not the
                    ancient writers straitly affirm them to be a wholly distinct people, akin to the
                    Iberians. Sikans also appear with the Ligurians among the early inhabitants of
                    Italy (Virg., <hi rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> vii. 795, viii. 328, xi. 317, and
                    Servius’s note). It is possible then that the likeness of name is accidental,
                    that the Sikels belonged to the same branch of the Aryan family as the Italians,
                    while Sikans, like Ligurians and Iberians and the surviving Basques, belonged to
                    the earlier non-Aryan population of western Europe. But, whatever the origin of
                    either, in the history of the island Sikans and Sikels appear as two distinct
                    nations with a clear geographical boundary. And we may venture to set down the
                    Sikels as undeveloped Latins, who were hindered by the coming of the Greeks from
                    reaching the same independent national life as their kinsfolk in Italy, and,
                    instead of so doing, were gradually Hellenized. On the other hand, some Sikel
                    elements made their way into the Greek life of Sicily. That the Sikels spoke a
                    tongue closely akin to Latin is plain from several Sikel words which crept into
                    Sicilian Greek, and from the Sikeliot system of weights and measures,—utterly
                    unlike anything in old Greece. When the Greek settlements began, the Sikans had
                    hardly got beyond the life of villages on hill-tops (Dion. Hal., v. 6), more
                    truly perhaps villages with places of shelter on the hill-tops. The more
                    advanced Sikels had their hill-forts also, but they had learned the advantages
                    of the sea, and they already had settlements on the coast when the Greeks came.
                    As we go on, we hear of both Sikel and Sikan towns; but we may suspect that any
                    approach to true city life was owing to Greek influences. Neither people grew
                    into any form of national unity. There was neither common king nor common
                    confederation either of Sikels or of Sikans. They were therefore partly subdued,
                    partly assimilated, slowly, but without much effort.</p>
                <p>In the north-east corner of the island we find a small territory occupied by a
                    people who seem to have made much greater advances towards civilized life. The
                    Elymoi were a people of uncertain origin, but they claimed a mixed descent,
                    partly Trojan, partly Greek. Thucydides however unhesitatingly reckons them
                    among barbarians. They had considerable towns, as Segesta (the Greek Egesta) and
                    Eryx, and the whole history, as well as the remains, of Segesta, shows that
                    Greek influences prevailed among them very early. In short, we find in the
                    island three nations distinct from the Greeks, two of which at least easily
                    adopted Greek culture and came in the end to pass for Greeks by adoption.</p>
                <p>But, as we have already seen, the Greeks were not the first colonizing people who
                    were drawn to the great island. As in Cyprus and in the islands of the Aegaean,
                    the Phoenicians were before them. And it is from this presence of the highest
                    forms of Aryan and of Semitic man that the history of Sicily draws its highest
                    interest. Of Phoenician occupation there are two, or rather three, marked
                    periods. We must always remember that Carthage —the new city—was one of the
                    latest of Phoenician foundations, and that the days of the Carthaginian dominion
                    show us only the latest form of Phoenician life. Phoenician settlement in Sicily
                    began before Carthage became great, perhaps before Carthage came into being. A
                    crowd of small settlements from the old Phoenicia, settlements for trade rather
                    than for dominion, factories rather than colonies, grew up on promontories and
                    small islands all round the Sicilian coast. These were unable to withstand the
                    Greek settlers, and the Phoenicians of Sicily withdrew step by step to form
                    three considerable towns in the northwest corner of the island,—Motye, Soloeis
                    or Solunto, on a hill overhanging the sea on the north coast, and the great
                    Panormos, the <hi rend="italic">all-haven</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Palermo),</hi> the city destined to be, in two different periods of the world’s
                    history, the head of Semitic power in Sicily.</p>
                <p>Our earlier notices of Sicily, of Sikels and Sikans, in the Homeric poems and
                    elsewhere, are vague and legendary. Both races appear as given to the buying and
                    selling of slaves (<hi rend="italic">Od.,</hi> xx. 383, xxiv. 30, 210). The
                    intimate connexion between old Hellas and Sicily begins with the foundation of
                    the Sicilian Naxos by Chalkidians of Euboia under Theokles, which is assigned to
                    the year 735 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The site, a low promontory on the
                    east coast, immediately below the height of Tauromenion, marks an age which had
                    advanced beyond the hill-fortress and which thoroughly valued the sea. The next
                    year Corinth began her system of settlement in the west: Korkyra (Corcyra), the
                    path to Sicily, and Syracuse on the Sicilian coast were planted as parts of one
                    enterprise. From this time, for about 150 years, Greek settlement in the island,
                    with some intervals, goes steadily on. Both Ionian and Dorian colonies were
                    planted, both from the older Greek lands and from the older Sicilian
                    settlements. The east coast, nearest to Greece and richest in good harbours, was
                    occupied first. Here, between Naxos and Syracuse, arose the Ionian cities of
                    Leontinoi and Katana (Catina, Catania) and the Dorian Megara by Hybla.
                    Settlement on the south-western coast began about 688 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> with the joint Cretan and Rhodian settlement of Gela, and went on in
                    the foundation of Selinous (the most distant Greek city on this side), of
                    Kamarina (Camarina), and in 588 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> of the Geloan
                    settlement of Akragas (Agrigentum, Girgenti), planted on a high hill, a little
                    way from the sea, which became the second city of Hellenic Sicily. On the north
                    coast the Ionian Himera was the only Greek city in Sicily itself, but the
                    Knidians founded Lipara in the Aeolian Islands. At the north-east corner,
                    opposite to Italy, and commanding the strait, arose Zankle, a city of uncertain
                    date and mixed origin, better known under its later name of Messana (Messene,
                    Messina).</p>
                <p>Thus nearly all the east coast of Sicily, a great part of the south coast, and a
                    much smaller part of the north, passed into the hands of Greek
                    settlers,—Sikeliots (∑ικϵλιωται), as distinguished from the native Sikels. This
                    was one of the greatest advances ever made by the Greek people. The Greek
                    element began to be predominant in the island. Among the earlier inhabitants the
                    Sikels were already becoming adopted Greeks. Many of them gradually sank into a
                    not wholly unwilling subjection as cultivators of the soil under Greek
                    masters,—a relation embodied perhaps in the legend that a native Sikel prince
                    led the Greek settlers to the foundation of Megara. But there were also
                    independent Sikel towns in the interior, and there was a strong religious
                    intercommunion between the two races. Sikel Henna (Enna, Castrogiovanni) is the
                    special seat of the worship of Demeter and her daughter. The Sikans, on<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n29/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0029-0016"/> the other hand, seem more distinct and more
                    steadily hostile. The Phoenicians, now shut up in one corner of the island, with
                    Selinous on one side and Himera on the other founded right in their teeth, are
                    bitter enemies; but the time of their renewed greatness under the headship of
                    Carthage has not yet come. The 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and
                    the early part of the 6th were a time in which the Greek cities of Sicily had
                    their full share in the general prosperity of the Greek colonies everywhere. For
                    a while they outstripped the cities of old Greece. Their political constitutions
                    were aristocratic; that is, the franchise was confined to the descendants of the
                    original settlers, round whom an excluded body (<hi rend="italic">δηµoς</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi>) was often growing up. The ancient kingship was
                    perhaps kept on or renewed in some of the Sikeliot and Italiot towns; but it is
                    more certain that civil dissensions led very early to the rise of tyrants. The
                    first and most famous is Phalaris of Akragas, whose exact date is uncertain,
                    whose letters are now cast aside, and whose brazen bull has been called in
                    question, but who clearly rose to power very soon after the foundation of
                    Akragas. Under his rule the city at once sprang to the first place in Sicily,
                    and he was the first Sikeliot ruler who held dominion over two Greek cities,
                    Akragas and Himera. This time of prosperity was also a time of intellectual
                    progress. To say nothing of lawgivers like Charondas, the line of Sikeliot poets
                    began early, and the circumstances of the island, the adoption of many of its
                    local traditions and beliefs—perhaps a certain intermingling of native
                    blood—gave the intellectual life of Sicily a character in some things distinct
                    from that of old Hellas. Stesichoros of Himera (c. 632-556 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) holds a great place among the lyric poets of Greece, and some place
                    in the political history of Sicily as the opponent of Phalaris. The architecture
                    and sculpture of this age have also left some of their most remarkable monuments
                    among the Greek cities of Sicily (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Syracuse).</hi> The
                    remains of the old temples of Selinous, attributed to the 7th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> show us the Doric style in its earlier state, and
                    the sculptures of their metopes (preserved at Palermo) are as distinctly
                    grotesque as any Romanesque sculpture of the 11th or 12th century. In both ages
                    the art of the builder was far in advance of that of the ornamental carver.</p>
                <p>This first period of Sicilian history lasts as long as Sicily remains untouched
                    from any non-Hellenic quarter outside, and as long as the Greek cities in Sicily
                    remain as a rule independent of one another. A change begins in the 6th century
                    and is accomplished early in the 5th. The Phoenician settlements in Sicily
                    become dependent on Carthage, whose growing power begins to be dangerous to the
                    Greeks of Sicily. Meanwhile the growth of tyrannies in the Greek cities was
                    beginning to group several towns together under a single master, and thus to
                    increase the greatness of particular cities at the expense of their freedom.
                    Thus Theron of Akragas (488-472), who bears a good character there, acquired
                    also, like Phalaris, the rule of Himera. One such power held dominion both in
                    Italy and Sicily. Anaxilaos of Rhegion, by a long and strange tale of treachery,
                    occupied Zankle and changed its name to Messana. But the greatest of the
                    Sikeliot powers began at Gela in 505, and was in 485 translated by Gelon to
                    Syracuse. That city now became the centre of a greater dominion over both Greeks
                    and Sikels than the island had ever before seen. But Gelon, like several later
                    tyrants of Syracuse, takes his place—and it is the redeeming point in the
                    position of all of them—as the champion of Hellas against the barbarian. The
                    great double invasion of 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was planned in
                    concert by the barbarians of the East and the West (Diod., xi. 20; schol. on
                    Pind., <hi rend="italic">Pyth.,</hi> i. 146; Grote, V. 294). While the Persians
                    threatened old Greece, Carthage threatened the Greeks of Sicily. There were
                    Sikeliots who played the part of the Medizers in Greece: Selinous was on the
                    side of Carthage, and the coming of Hamilkar was immediately brought about by a
                    tyrant of Himera driven out by Theron. But the united power of Gelon and Theron
                    crushed the invaders in the great battle of Himera, won, men said, on the same
                    day as Salamis, and the victors of both were coupled as the joint deliverers of
                    Hellas (Herod., vii. 165-167; Diod., xx. 20-25; Pind., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyth.,</hi> i. 147-156; Simonides, fr. 42; Polyainos, i. 27). But, while the
                    victory of Salamis was followed by a long war with Persia, the peace which was
                    now granted to Carthage stayed in force for seventy years. Gelon was followed by
                    his brother Hieron (478-467), the special subject of the songs of Pindar.
                    Akragas meanwhile flourished under Theron; but a war between him and Hieron led
                    to slaughter and new settlement at Himera. These transplantings from city to
                    city began under Gelon and went on under Hieron. They made speakers in old
                    Greece (Thuc., vi. 17) contrast the permanence of habitation there with the
                    constant changes in Sicily. Hieron won the fame of a founder by peopling Katana
                    with new citizens, and changing its name to Aitna.</p>
                <p>None of these tyrannies were long-lived. The power of Theron fell to pieces under
                    his son Thrasydaios. When the power of Hieron passed in 467 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> to his brother Thrasyboulos the freedom of Syracuse was won by a
                    combined movement of Greeks and Sikels, and the Greek cities gradually settled
                    down as they had been before the tyrannies, only with a change to democracy in
                    their constitutions. The mercenaries who had received citizenship from the
                    tyrants were settled at Messana. About fifty years of general prosperity
                    followed. We have special pictures of almost incredible wealth and luxury at
                    Akragas, chiefly founded on an African trade. Moreover art, science, poetry, had
                    all been encouraged by the tyrants, and they went on flourishing in the free
                    states. To these was now added the special growth of freedom, the art of public
                    speaking. Epicharmos (540-450), carried as a babe to Sicily, is a link between
                    native Sikeliots and the strangers invited by Hieron; as the founder of the
                    local Sicilian comedy, he ranks among Sikeliots. After him Sophron of Syracuse
                    gave the Sicilian <hi rend="italic">mimes</hi> a place among the forms of Greek
                    poetry. But the intellect of free Sicily struck out higher paths. Empedokles of
                    Akragas is best known from the legends of his miracles and of his death in the
                    fires of Aetna; but he was not the less philosopher, poet, and physician,
                    besides his political career. It is vaguely implied (Diog. Laert., viii. 2, 9)
                    that he refused an offer of the tyranny or of authority in some shape. Gorgias
                    of Leontinoi (c. 480-375) had a still more direct influence on Greek culture, as
                    father of the technical schools of rhetoric throughout Greece. Architecture too
                    advanced, and the Doric style gradually lost somewhat of its ancient
                    massiveness. The temple at Syracuse which is now the metropolitan church belongs
                    to the earlier days of this time. It is followed by the later temples at
                    Selinous, among them the temple of Zeus, which is said to have been the greatest
                    in Sicily, and by the wonderful series at Akragas, crowned by the Olympian
                    temple, with its many architectural singularities. This, like its fellow at
                    Selinous, was not fully finished at the time of the Carthaginian inroad at the
                    end of the century.</p>
                <p>During this time of prosperity there was no dread of Carthaginian inroads. But in
                    454 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> we read of a war between Segesta and
                    Lilybaion (Lilybaeum). There was as yet no town of Lilybaion; but, if the war
                    was waged against any Phoenician settlement, the fact is to be noticed, as
                    hitherto Segesta has been allied with the Phoenicians against the Greeks. Far
                    more important are our notices of the earlier inhabitants. For now comes the
                    great Sikel<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n30/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0030-0017"/> movement under Douketios, who, between force and
                    persuasion, came nearer towards uniting his people into one body than had ever
                    been done before. From his native hill-top of Menai, rising above the lake
                    dedicated to the Palikoi, the native deities whom Sikels and Greeks alike
                    honoured, he brought down his people to the new city of Palikai in the plain.
                    His power grew, and Akragas could withstand him only by the help of Syracuse.
                    Alternately victorious and defeated, spared by Syracuse (451), sent to be safe
                    at Corinth, he came back to Sicily only to form greater plans than before. War
                    between Akragas and Syracuse enabled him to carry out his schemes, and, with the
                    help of another Sikel prince who bore the Greek name of Archomides, he founded
                    Kale Akte on the northern coast. But his work was cut short by his death in 440;
                    the hope of the Sikel people now lay in assimilation to their Hellenic
                    neighbours. Douketios’s own foundation of Kale Akte lived on, and we presently
                    hear of Sikel towns under kings and tyrants, all marking an approach to Greek
                    life. Roughly speaking, while the Sikels of the plain country on the east coast
                    became subject to Syracuse, most of those in other parts of the island remained
                    independent. Of the Sikans we hear less; but Hykkara in the north-west was an
                    independent Sikan town on bad terms with Segesta. On the whole, setting aside
                    the impassable barrier between Greek and Phoenician, other distinctions of race
                    within the island were breaking down through the spread of the Hellenic element.
                    Segesta was on familiar terms with both Greek and Phoenician neighbours, and had
                    the right of intermarriage (Thuc., vi. 6) with Hellenic Selinous. Among the
                    Greek cities themselves the distinction between the Dorian and the Ionian or
                    Chalkidian settlements is still keenly felt. The Ionian is decidedly the weaker
                    element; and it was most likely owing to the rivalry between the two great
                    Dorian cities of Syracuse and Akragas that the Chalkidian towns were able to
                    keep any independence at all.</p>
                <p>Up to this time the Italiot and Sikeliot Greeks have formed part of the general
                    Greek world, while within that world they have formed a world of their own, and
                    Sicily has again formed a world of its own within that. Wars and conquests
                    between Greeks and Greeks, especially on the part of Syracuse, though not
                    wanting, have been on the whole less constant than in old Greece. It is even
                    possible to appeal to a vein of local Sicilian patriotism, to preach a kind of
                    Monroe doctrine by which Greeks from other lands should be shut out as strangers
                    (<hi rend="italic">αλλόϕυλοι</hi>, Thuc., vi. 61, 74). Presently this state of
                    Sicilian isolation was broken in upon by the great Peloponnesian War. The
                    Sikeliot cities were drawn into alliance with one side or the other, till the
                    main interest of Greek history gathers for a while round the Athenian attack on
                    Syracuse. At the very beginning of the war the Lacedaemonians looked for help
                    from the Dorian Sikeliots. But the first active intervention came from the other
                    side. Conquest in Sicily was a favourite dream at Athens (Thuc., vi. 1, cf. i.
                    48, and Diod., xii. 54), with a view to wider conquest or influence in the
                    western Mediterranean. An opportunity for Athenian interference was found in 427
                    in a quarrel between Syracuse and Leontinoi and their allies. Leontinoi craved
                    help from Athens on the ground of Ionian kindred. Her envoy was Gorgias; his
                    peculiar style of rhetoric was now first heard in old Greece (Diod., xii. 53,
                    54), and his pleadings were successful. For several years from this time
                    (427-422) Athens plays a part, chiefly unsuccessful, in Sicilian affairs. But
                    the particular events are of little importance, except as leading the way to the
                    greater events that follow. The steadiest ally of Athens was the Italiot
                    Rhegion; Messana, with its mixed population, was repeatedly won and lost; the
                    Sikel tributaries of Syracuse give zealous help to the Athenians. But in 424 all
                    the Sikeliot and most of the Italiot cities, under the guidance of Hermokrates
                    of Syracuse, who powerfully set forth the doctrine of Sikeliot, perhaps of
                    Sicilian unity, agreed on a peace. Presently an internal disturbance at
                    Leontinoi led to annexation by Syracuse. This gave the Athenians a pretext for
                    another attempt in 422. Little came of it, though Athens was joined by the Doric
                    cities of Kamarina and Akragas, clearly out of jealousy towards Syracuse. For
                    several years the island was left to itself.</p>
                <p>The far more memorable interference of Athens in Sicilian affairs in the year 415
                    was partly in answer to the cry of the exiles of Leontinoi, partly to a quite
                    distinct appeal from the Elymian Segesta. That city, an ally of Athens, asked
                    for Athenian help against its Greek neighbour Selinous. In a dispute, partly
                    about boundaries, partly about the right of intermarriage between the Hellenic
                    and the Hellenizing city, Segesta was hard pressed. She vainly asked for help at
                    Akragas—some say at Syracuse (Diod., xii. 82)—and even at Carthage. The last
                    appeal was to Athens. But the claims of Segesta and Leontinoi are soon forgotten
                    in the struggle for life and death between Syracuse and Athens.</p>
                <p>The details of the great Athenian expedition (415-413) belong partly to the
                    political history of Athens, partly to that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Syracuse</hi> (q.v.) But its results make it a marked epoch in Sicilian
                    history, and the Athenian plans, if successful, would have changed the whole
                    face of the West. If the later stages of the struggle were remarkable for the
                    vast number of Greek cities engaged on both sides, and for the strange inversion
                    of relations among them on which Thucydides (vii. 57, 58) comments, the whole
                    war was yet more remarkable for the large entrance of the barbarian element into
                    the Athenian reckonings. The war was undertaken on behalf of Segesta; the Sikels
                    gave Athens valuable help; the greater barbarian powers out of Sicily also came
                    into play. Some help actually came from Etruria. But Carthage was more
                    far-sighted. If Syracuse was an object of jealousy, Athens, succeeding to her
                    dominion, creating a power too nearly alike to her own, would have provoked far
                    greater jealousy. So Athens found no active support save at Naxos and Katana,
                    though Akragas, if she would not help the invaders, at least gave no help to her
                    own rival. The war is instructive in many ways: it reminds us of the general
                    conditions of Greek seamanship when we find that Korkyra was the meeting-place
                    for the allied fleet, and that Syracuse was reached only by a coasting voyage
                    along the shores of Greek Italy. We are struck also by the low military level of
                    the Sicilian Greeks. The Syracusan heavy-armed are as far below those of Athens
                    as those of Athens are below those of Sparta. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >quasi</hi>-contintental character of Sicily causes Syracuse, with its havens
                    and its island, to be looked on, in comparison with Athens, as a land power (<hi
                    rend="italic">ἠπϵιρωται</hi>, Thuc., vii. 21). That is to say, the Sikeliot
                    level represents the general Greek level as it stood before the wars in which
                    Athens won and defended her dominion. The Greeks of Sicily had had no such
                    military practice as the Greeks of old Greece; but an able commander could teach
                    both Sikeliot soldiers and Sikeliot seamen to outmanoeuvre Athenians. The main
                    result of the expedition, as regards Sicily, was to bring the island more
                    thoroughly into the thick of Greek affairs. Syracuse, threatened with
                    destruction by Athens, was saved by the zeal of her metropolis Corinth in
                    stirring up the Peloponnesian rivals of Athens to help her. Gylippos came; the
                    second Athenian fleet came and perished. Syracuse was saved; all chance of
                    Athenian dominion in Sicily or elsewhere in the West came to an end. Syracuse
                    repaid the debt by good service to the Peloponnesian cause, and from that<pb

                    Greece upon one another is far stronger than in earlier times.</p>
                <p>But before the war in old Greece was over, seventy years after the great victory
                    of Gelon (410), the Greeks of Sicily had to undergo barbarian invasion on a
                    vaster scale than ever. The disputes between Segesta and Selinous called in
                    these enemies also. Carthage stepped in as the ally of Segesta, the enemy of her
                    old ally Selinous. Her leader was Hannibal, grandson and avenger of the Hamilkar
                    who had died at Himera. In 408, at the head of a vast mercenary host, he sailed
                    to Sicily, attacked Selinous, and stormed the town after a murderous assault of
                    nine days, while the other Sikeliot cities, summoned to help, were still
                    lingering. The walls and temples were overthrown; the mass of the people were
                    massacred; the few who escaped were allowed to return to the dismantled site as
                    tributaries of Carthage; and the city never recovered its old greatness. Thence
                    Hannibal went on to Himera, with the special mission of avenging his
                    grandfather. By this time the other Greek cities were stirred to help, while
                    Sikels and Sikans joined Hannibal; the strife was distinctly a strife of Greeks
                    and barbarians. At last Himera was stormed, and 3000 of its citizens were
                    solemnly slaughtered on the spot where Hamilkar had died. Himera ceased to
                    exist; but the Carthaginians founded the new town of Thermal (Termini) not far
                    off, to which the name is sometimes laxly applied. The Phoenician possessions in
                    Sicily now stretched across the island from Himera to Selinous. The next victim
                    was Akragas; its defenders, natives and allies, quarrelled among themselves; the
                    mass of the people forsook the city, and found shelter at Gela and elsewhere.
                    The few who were left were slaughtered; the town was sacked and the walls
                    destroyed. Akragas was presently restored, and it has lived on to this day; but
                    it never recovered its old greatness.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the revolutions of Syracuse affected the history of Sicily and of the
                    whole Greek world. Dionysios the tyrant began his reign of thirty-eight years in
                    the first months of 405. Almost at the same moment, the new Carthaginian
                    commander, Himilkon, attacked Gela and Kamarina. Dionysios, coming to the help
                    of Gela, was defeated, and was charged with treachery. He now made the mass of
                    the people of both towns find shelter at Syracuse. But now the plague led
                    Himilkon to ask for peace. Carthage was confirmed in her possession of Selinous,
                    Himera, and Akragas, with some Sikan districts which had opposed her. The people
                    of Gela and Kamarina were allowed to occupy their unwalled towns as tributaries
                    of Carthage. Leontinoi, latterly a Syracusan fort, as well as Messana and all
                    the Sikels, were declared independent, while Dionysios was acknowledged as
                    master of Syracuse. No war was ever more grievous to freedom and civilization.
                    More than half Sicily was now under barbarian dominion; several of its noblest
                    cities had perished, and a tyrant was established in the greatest. The 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, after its central years of freedom and
                    prosperity, ended in far deeper darkness than it had begun. The minuter account
                    of Dionysios belongs to Syracusan history; but his position, one unlike anything
                    that had been before seen in Sicily or elsewhere in Hellas, forms an epoch in
                    the history of Europe. His only bright side is his championship of Hellas
                    against the Phoenician, and this is balanced by his settlements of barbarian
                    mercenaries in several Greek cities. Towards the native races his policy varied
                    according to momentary interests; but on the whole his reign tended to bring the
                    Sikels more and more within the Greek pale. His dominion is Italian as well as
                    Sicilian; his influence, as an ally of Sparta, is important in old Greece;
                    while, as a hirer of mercenaries everywhere, he had wider relations than any
                    earlier Greek with the nations of western Europe. He further opened new fields
                    for Greek settlement on both sides of the Hadriatic. In short, under him Sicily
                    became for the first time the seat of a great European power, while Syracuse, as
                    its head, became the greatest of European cities. His reign was unusually long
                    for a Greek tyrant, and his career furnished a model for other rulers and
                    invaders of Sicily. With him in truth begins that wider range of Greek warfare,
                    policy, and dominion which the Macedonian kingdoms carry on. The master of such
                    a dominion becomes the improver of the military art. With him begins the
                    employment of ships greater than the old triremes, of more effective engines in
                    sieges, and that combined use of troops of various arms and nations which
                    Alexander carried to perfection.</p>
                <p>The reign of Dionysios (405-367) is divided into marked periods by four wars with
                    Carthage, in 397-396, 392, 383, and 368. In the first war his home power was all
                    but overthrown; but he lived through the storm, and extended his dominion over
                    Naxos, Katana, and Leontinoi. All three perished as Greek cities. Katana was the
                    first Sikeliot city to receive a settlement of Campanian mercenaries, while
                    others settled in non-Hellenic Entella. Naxos was settled by Sikels; Leontinoi
                    was again merged in Syracuse. Now begin the dealings of Dionysios with Italy,
                    where the Rhegines, kinsmen of Naxos and Katana, planned a fruitless attack on
                    him in common with Messana. He then sought a wife at Rhegion, but was refused
                    with scorn, while Lokroi (Locri) gladly gave him Doris. The two cities
                    afterwards fared accordingly. In the first war with Carthage, the Greek cities
                    under Carthaginian dominion or dependence helped him; so did Sikans and Sikels,
                    which last had among them some stirring leaders; Elymian Segesta clave to
                    Carthage. Dionysios took the Phoenician stronghold of Motye; but Himilkon
                    recovered it, destroyed Messana, founded the hill-town of Tauromenion (Taormina)
                    above Naxos for Sikels who had joined him, defeated the fleet of Dionysios, and
                    besieged Syracuse. Between invasion and home discontent, the tyrant was all but
                    lost; but the Spartan Pharakidas stood his friend; the Carthaginians again
                    suffered from pestilence; and Himilkon went away defeated, taking with him his
                    Carthaginian troops and forsaking his allies. Gela, Kamarina, Himera, Selinous,
                    Akragas itself, now passed into the dependent alliance of Dionysios. The
                    Carthaginian dominion was cut down to what it had been before Hannibal’s
                    invasion. The lord of Syracuse had grown at the cost of Greek and barbarian
                    alike.</p>
                <p>He planted mercenaries at Leontinoi, conquered some Sikel towns, central Henna
                    among them, and made alliances with others. He restored Messana, peopling it
                    with motley settlers, among whom were some of the old Messenians from
                    Peloponnesos. But the Spartan masters of the old Messenian land grudged this
                    possible beginning of a new Messenian power. Dionysios therefore moved his
                    Messenians to a point on the north coast, where they founded Tyndaris. He
                    clearly had a special eye to that region. He took the Sikel Kephaloidion
                    (Cefalù), and even the old Phoenician border-fortress of Solous was betrayed to
                    him. He beat back a Rhegine expedition; but his advance was checked by a failure
                    to take the new Sikel settlement of Tauromenion. His enemies of all races now
                    declared themselves. Many of the Sikels forsook him; Akragas declared herself
                    independent; Carthage herself, stirred by the loss of Solous, again took the
                    field.</p>
                <p>The Punic war of 392-391 was not very memorable. Both sides failed in their chief
                    enterprises, and the main interest of the story comes from the glimpses which we
                    get of the Sikel states. Most of them joined the Cartha-<pb break="no"

                    withstood at Agyrion by Agyris, the ally of Dionysios, who is described as a
                    tyrant second in power to Dionysios himself. This way of speaking would imply
                    that Agyrion had so far advanced in Greek ways as to run the usual course of a
                    Greek commonwealth. The two tyrants drove Carthage to a peace by which she
                    abandoned all her Sikel allies to Dionysios. This time he took Tauromenion and
                    settled it with his mercenaries. For new colonists of this kind the established
                    communities of all races were making way. The transportations under the older
                    tyrants had been movements of Greeks from one Greek site to another. Now all
                    races are confounded.</p>
                <p>Dionysios, now free from Phoenician warfare, gave his mind to enterprises which
                    raised his power to its greatest height. In the years 390-387 he warred against
                    the Italiot cities in alliance with their Lucanian enemies. Rhegion, Kroton
                    (Croton), the whole toe of the boot, were conquered. Their lands were given to
                    Lokroi; their citizens were taken to Syracuse, sometimes as slaves, sometimes as
                    citizens. The master of barbarians fell below the lowest Hellenic level when he
                    put the brave Rhegine general Phyton to a lingering death, and in other cases
                    imitated the Carthaginian cruelty of crucifixion. Conqueror of southern Italy,
                    he turned his thoughts yet further, and became the first ruler of Sicily to
                    stretch forth his hands towards the eastern peninsula. In the Hadriatic he
                    helped Hellenic extension. He planted directly and indirectly some settlements
                    in Apulia, while Syracusan exiles founded the more famous Ankon or Ancona. On
                    the east coast he founded Lissos; he helped the Parians in their settlements of
                    Issa and Pharos; he took into his pay Illyrian warriors with Greek arms, and
                    helped the Molottian Alketas to win back part of his kingdom. He was even
                    charged with plotting with his Epeirot ally to plunder Delphoi. This even Sparta
                    would not endure; Dionysios had to content himself with sending a fleet along
                    the west coast of Italy, to carry off the wealth of the great temple of Agylla
                    or Caere.</p>
                <p>In old Greece men now said that the Greek folk was hemmed in between the
                    barbarian Artaxerxes on the one side and Dionysios, master and planter of
                    barbarians, on the other. These feelings found expression when Dionysios sent
                    his embassy to the Olympic games of 384, and when Lysias bade Greece rise
                    against both its oppressors. Dionysios vented his wrath on those who were
                    nearest to him, banishing many, among them his brother Leptines and his earliest
                    friend Philistos, and putting many to death. He was also once more stirred up to
                    play the part of a Hellenic champion: he made ready for yet another Punic
                    war.</p>
                <p>In this war (383-382) Dionysios seems for once to have had his head turned by a
                    first success. His demand that Carthage should altogether withdraw from Sicily
                    was met by a crushing defeat. Then came a treaty by which Carthage kept Selinous
                    and part of the land of Akragas. The Halykos became the boundary. Dionysios had
                    also to pay 1000 talents, which caused him to be spoken of as becoming tributary
                    to the barbarians. In the last years of his reign we hear dimly of both
                    Syracusan and Carthaginian operations in southern Italy. He also gave help to
                    Sparta against Thebes, sending Gaulish and Iberian mercenaries to take part in
                    Greek warfare. His last war with Carthage, which was going on at his death, was
                    ended by a peace by which the Halykos remained the boundary.</p>
                <p>The tyranny of Dionysios fell, as usual, in the second generation; but it was
                    kept up for ten years after his death by the energy of Philistos, now minister
                    of his son Dionysios the Younger. It fell with the coming back of the exile Dion
                    in 357. The tyranny had lasted so long that it was less easy than at the
                    overthrow of the elder tyrants to fall back on an earlier state of things. It
                    had been a time of frightful changes throughout Sicily, full of breaking up of
                    old landmarks, of confusion of races, and of movements of inhabitants. But it
                    also saw the foundation of new cities. Besides Tyndaris and Tauromenion, the
                    foundation of Alaisa marks another step in Sikel progress towards Hellenism,
                    while the Carthaginians founded their strong town and fortress of Lilybaion.
                    Among these changes the most marked is the settlement of Campanian mercenaries
                    in Greek and Sikel towns. Yet they too could be brought under Greek influences;
                    they were distant kinsfolk of the Sikels, and they were the forerunners of Rome.
                    They mark one stage of migration from Italy into Sicily.</p>
                <p>The reign of Dionysios was less brilliant in the way of art and literature than
                    that of Hieron. Yet Dionysios himself sought fame as a poet, and his success at
                    Athens shows that his compositions did not deserve the full scorn of his
                    enemies. The dithyrambic poet Philoxenos, by birth of Kythera, won his fame in
                    Sicily, and other authors of lost poems are mentioned in various Sikeliot
                    cities. One of the greatest losses in all Greek history is that of the writings
                    of Philistos (436-356), the Syracusan who had seen the Athenian siege and who
                    died in the warfare between Dion and the younger Dionysios. Through the time of
                    both tyrants, he was, next to the actual rulers, the first man in Sicily; but of
                    his record of his own times we have only what filters through the recasting of
                    Diodoros. But the most remarkable intellectual movement in Sicily at this time
                    was the influence of the Pythagorean philosophy, which still lived on in
                    southern Italy. It led, through Dion, to the several visits of Plato to Sicily
                    under both the elder and the younger Dionysios. To architecture the time was not
                    favourable anywhere but in Syracuse.</p>
                <p>The time following the Dionysian tyranny was at Syracuse a time full of the most
                    stirring local and personal interest, under her two deliverers Dion and
                    Timoleon. It is less easy to make out the exact effect on the rest of Sicily of
                    the three years’ career of Dion. But we may mark that, in driving out the
                    younger Dionysios, he was helped by a general movement of Greeks, Sikels, and
                    Sikans. Between the death of Dion in 354 and the coming of Timoleon in 344 we
                    hear of a time of confusion in which Hellenic life seemed likely to die out. The
                    cities, Greek and Sikel, were occupied by tyrants. Syracuse was parted between
                    several, Dionysios coming back to hold Ortygia. Timoleon’s work was
                    threefold—the immediate deliverance of Syracuse, the restoration of Sicily in
                    general to freedom and Greek life, and the defence of the Greek cities against
                    Carthage. The victory of the Krimisos in 340 led to a peace with Carthage with
                    the old frontier; but all Greek cities were to be free, and Carthage was to give
                    no help to any tyrant. Timoleon drove out all the tyrants, and it specially
                    marks the fusion of the two races that the people of the Sikel Agyrion were
                    admitted to the citizenship of free Syracuse. From some towns he drove out the
                    Campanians, and he largely invited Greek settlement, especially from the Italiot
                    towns, which were hard pressed by the Bruttians. The Corinthian deliverer gave,
                    not only Syracuse, but all Greek Sicily, a new lease of life, though a short
                    one.</p>
                <p>With Timoleon begins a series of leaders who came from old Greece to deliver or
                    to conquer among the Greeks of Italy and Sicily. The enterprise of Dion most
                    likely suggested those that followed, but Dion, as a native Syracusan, does not
                    belong altogether to the same class. Timoleon alone was a pure republican
                    deliverer. The Macedonian kings had established a Greek dominion in the East,
                    and a series of princes from Sparta and Epeiros came to establish in the West a
                    Greek dominion which should balance that of the Macedonians. Archidamos,
                    Alexander of<pb break="no"

                    attempted this work in Italy; it was only Pyrrhos, the last and greatest of the
                    series, who played any great part in Sicily. And before he came, Sicily had
                    become the seat of a greater native power than ever. Never till the Norman came
                    was any Sicilian dominion so famous in the world as that of the Syracusan tyrant
                    or king Agathokles.</p>
                <p>We have unluckily no intelligible account of Sicily during the twenty years after
                    the death of Timoleon (337- 317). His deliverance is said to have been followed
                    by great immediate prosperity, but wars and dissensions very soon began again.
                    Agathokles won his first fame in war between Syracuse and Akragas. The
                    Carthaginians played off one city and party against another, and Agathokles,
                    following the same policy, became in 317, by treachery and massacre, undisputed
                    tyrant of Syracuse, and spread his dominion over many other cities. Akragas,
                    strengthened by Syracusan exiles, now stands out again as the rival of Syracuse.
                    The Carthaginian Hamilkar, by conduct which contrasted with the cruelty of
                    Agathokles, won many Greek cities to the Punic alliance. Defeated in battle,
                    with Syracuse blockaded by a Carthaginian fleet, Agathokles formed the bold idea
                    of carrying the war into Africa. He set the model for Regulus and Scipio, and
                    not a few later rulers of Sicily.</p>
                <p>For more than three years (310-307) each side carried on warfare in the land of
                    the other. Carthage was hard pressed by Agathokles, while Syracuse was no less
                    hard pressed by Hamilkar. The force with which Agathokles invaded Africa was far
                    from being wholly Greek; but it was representatively European. Gauls, Samnites,
                    Tyrrhenians, fought for him, while mercenary Greeks and Syracusan exiles fought
                    for Carthage. He won many battles and towns; he quelled mutinies of his own
                    troops; by inviting and murdering Ophellas lord of Kyrene (Cyrene) he doubled
                    his army and brought Carthage near to despair. Meanwhile Syracuse, all but lost,
                    had driven back Hamilkar, and had taken and slain him when he came again with
                    the help of the Syracusan exile Deinokrates. Meanwhile Akragas, deeming
                    Agathokles and the barbarians alike weakened, proclaimed freedom for the
                    Sicilian cities under her own headship. Many towns, both Greek and Sikel, joined
                    the confederacy. It has now become impossible to distinguish the two races;
                    Henna and Erbessos are now the fellows of Kamarina and Leontinoi. But the hopes
                    of Akragas were checked when Agathokles suddenly came back from Africa, landed
                    at Selinous, and marched to Syracuse, taking one town after another. A new
                    scheme of Sicilian union was taken up by Deinokrates, which cut short his
                    dominion. But he now relieved Syracuse from the Carthaginian blockade; his
                    mercenaries gained a victory over Akragas; and he sailed again for Africa, where
                    fortune had turned against his son Archagathos, as it now did against himself.
                    He left his sons and his army to death, bondage, or Carthaginian service, and
                    came back to Sicily almost alone. Yet he could still gather a force which
                    enabled him to seize Segesta, to slay or enslave the whole population, and to
                    settle the city with new inhabitants. This change amounts to the extinction of
                    one of the elements in the old population of Sicily. We hear no more of Elymoi;
                    indeed Segesta has been practically Greek long before this. Deinokrates and
                    Agathokles came to a kind of partnership, and a peace with Carthage, with the
                    old boundary, secured Agathokles in the possession of Syracuse and eastern
                    Sicily (301).</p>
                <p>At some stage of his African campaigns Agathokles had taken the title of king.
                    Earlier tyrants were well pleased to be spoken of as kings; but no earlier
                    rulers of Sicily put either their heads or their names on the coin. Agathokles
                    now put his name, first without, and then with, the kingly title. This was in
                    imitation of the Macedonian leaders who divided the dominion of Alexander. The
                    relations between the eastern and western Greek worlds are drawing closer.
                    Agathokles in his old age took a wife of the house of Ptolemy; he gave his
                    daughter Lanassa to Pyrrhos, and established his power east of Hadria, as the
                    first Sicilian ruler of Korkyra. He carried on wars in the Liparaean Islands and
                    in southern Italy, and died in 289 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> poisoned,
                    some said, by his own grandson. Alike more daring and more cruel than any ruler
                    before him, he carried the arms of Sicily further afield, and made the island
                    the seat of a greater power than any of them.</p>
                <p>This time was not favourable to the intellectual life of Sicily. Hitherto the
                    island had attracted men of letters from old Greece. Now several distinguished
                    Sicilian writers either chose or were driven to find homes elsewhere. Tinaios of
                    Tauromenion, scorned by Polybios, but whose great Sicilian history is none the
                    less a loss, was banished by Agathokles, and made Athens his headquarters for
                    the last fifty years of his long life (356- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 260 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). Dikaiarchos (Dicaearchus) of Messana, geographer
                    and philosopher and author of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Greece,</hi> lived
                    mainly in Peloponnesos till about 285 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Euhemeros
                    (Evemerus), despiser of the gods, who is claimed by more than one birthplace
                    besides Messana, lived in the service and friendship of the Macedonian
                    Kassandros. Philemon too, the long-lived writer of comedy (361-262 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), is claimed for Syracuse, and it was only as an
                    adopted citizen that he spent most of his life at Athens.</p>
                <p>On the death of Agathokles tyrants sprang up in various cities. Akragas, under
                    its king Phintias, won back for the moment somewhat of its old greatness. By a
                    new depopulation of Gela, he founded the youngest of Sikeliot cities, Phintias,
                    by the mouth of the southern Himera. And Hellas was cut short by the seizure of
                    Messana by the disbanded Campanian mercenaries of Agathokles (c. 282). They slew
                    the men, took the women as wives, and proclaimed themselves a new people in a
                    new city by the name of Mamertines, children of Mamers or Mars. Messana became
                    an Italian town; henceforth its formal name was “Mamertina civitas.”</p>
                <p>The Campanian occupation of Messana is the first of the chain of events which led
                    to the Roman dominion in Sicily. As yet Rome has hardly been mentioned in
                    Sicilian story, either for friendship or for enmity. The Mamertine settlement,
                    the war with Pyrrhos, bring us on quickly. Pyrrhos came as the champion of the
                    western Greeks against all barbarians, whether Romans in Italy or Carthaginians
                    in Sicily. His Sicilian war (278-276) was a mere interlude between the two acts
                    of his war with Rome. As son-in-law of Agathokles, he claimed to be specially
                    king of Sicily, and he held the Sicilian conquest of Korkyra as the dowry of
                    Lanassa. With such a deliverer, deliverance meant submission. Pyrrhos is said to
                    have dreamed of kingdoms of Sicily and of Italy for his two sons, the grandsons
                    of Agathokles, and he himself reigned for two years in Sicily as a king who came
                    to be no less hated than the tyrants. Still as Hellenic champion in Sicily he
                    has no peer. As European champion he has none till Roger of Hauteville. Eryx was
                    won from the Phoenician; Panormos first became a city of Europe; if he failed
                    before Lilybaion, that fortress and Messana were all that was left in barbarian
                    hands through the whole island.</p>
                <p>All this was but for a moment. The Greek king, on his way back to fight for
                    Tarentum against Rome, had to cut his way through Carthaginians and Mamertines
                    in Roman alliance. His saying that he left Sicily as a wrestling-ground for
                    Romans and Carthaginians was the very truth of the matter. Very soon came the
                    first war<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n34/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0034-0021"/> between Rome and Carthage, the war which is best
                    marked by its other name of the War for Sicily. It mattered much, now that
                    Sicily was to have a barbarian master, whether that master should be the kindred
                    barbarian of Europe or the barbarian of Asia transplanted to the shore of
                    Africa. That question was decided for Europe, that is for Rome, now beginning
                    her long career as European champion. That strife too gave a large part of
                    Sicily a last day of prosperity under a native ruler who was a king and not a
                    tyrant.</p>
                <p>Sicily in truth never had a more hopeful champion than the second Hieron of
                    Syracuse. The established rule of Carthage in western Sicily was now something
                    that could well be endured alongside of the robber commonwealth at Messana. The
                    dominion of the freebooters was spreading. Besides the whole north-eastern
                    corner of the island, it reached inland to Agyrion and Kentoripa. The Mamertines
                    leagued with other Campanian freebooters who had forsaken the service of Rome to
                    establish themselves at Rhegion. But a new Syracusan power was growing up to
                    meet them. Hieron, claiming descent from Gelon, pressed the Mamertines hard. He
                    all but drove them to the surrender of Messana; he even helped Rome to chastise
                    her own rebels at Rhegion. The wrestling-ground was thus opened for the two
                    barbarian commonwealths. Carthaginian troops held the Messanian citadel against
                    Hieron, while another party in Messana craved the help of the head of Italy.
                    Rome, chastiser of the freebooters of Rhegion, saw Italian brethren in the
                    freebooters of Messana. The War for Sicily began (264).</p>
                <p>The exploits of Hieron had already won him the kingly title (270) at Syracuse,
                    and he was the representative of Hellenic life and independence throughout the
                    island. Partly in this character, partly as direct sovereign, he was virtual
                    ruler of a large part of eastern Sicily. But he could not aspire to the dominion
                    of earlier Syracusan rulers. The advance of Rome after the retreat of Pyrrhos
                    kept the new king from all hope of their Italian position. And presently the new
                    kingdom exchanged independence for safety. When Rome entered Sicily as the ally
                    of the Mamertines, Hieron became the ally of Carthage. But in the second year of
                    the war (263) he found it needful to change sides. His alliance with Rome marks
                    a great epoch in the history of the Greek nation. The kingdom of Hieron was the
                    firstfruits out of Italy of the system by which alliance with Rome grew into
                    subjection to Rome. He was the first of Rome’s kingly vassals. His only burthen
                    was to give help to the Roman side in war; within his kingdom he was free, and
                    his dominions flourished as no part of Sicily had flourished since the days of
                    Timoleon.</p>
                <p>During the twenty-three years of the First Punic War (264-241) the rest of the
                    island suffered greatly. The War for Sicily was fought in and round Sicily, and
                    the Sicilian cities were taken and retaken by the contending powers. Akragas,
                    held by Carthage, stood a Roman siege (262); the Punic garrison escaped; the
                    inhabitants were sold into slavery. Seven years later the repeopled city was
                    taken and burned and its walls destroyed by a Carthaginian army. Selinous was
                    utterly destroyed, when, towards the end of the war, Carthage gathered her whole
                    strength again in a few points in the west. Greek Selinous and Elymian Eryx
                    alike gave way to the new fortress of Drepanon, which, along with Lilybaion,
                    held out till the end of the war. Segesta, subject to Carthage, still remembered
                    its old traditions, and the sons of Aeneas were welcomed as deliverers by the
                    Trojan city. Kamarina and inland Henna passed to and fro between the two powers.
                    But the great exploit of Rome was the second winning of Panormos for Europe, and
                    its brilliant defence against the Semitic enemy. The highest calling of the
                    Greek had now, in the Western lands, passed to the Roman. By the treaty which
                    ended the war Carthage ceded to Rome all her possessions in Sicily. As that part
                    of the island which kept a national Greek government became the first kingdom
                    dependent on Rome, so the share of Carthage became the first Roman province. One
                    point alone did not come under either of those heads. Messana, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mamertina civitas,</hi> remained an Italian ally of Rome on Sicilian soil.</p>
                <p>We have no picture of Sicily in the first period of Roman rule. One hundred and
                    seventy years later, several towns within the original province enjoyed various
                    degrees of freedom, which they had doubtless kept from the beginning. Besides
                    the old ally Messana, Panormos, Segesta, with Kentoripa, Halesa, and Halikye,
                    once Sikel but now Hellenized, kept the position of free cities <hi
                    rend="italic">(liberae et immunes,</hi> Cic., <hi rend="italic">Verr.,</hi> iii.
                    6). The rest paid tithe to the Roman people as landlord. The province was ruled
                    by a praetor sent yearly from Rome. Within the Roman province the new state of
                    things called forth much discontent; but Hieron remained the faithful ally of
                    Rome through a long life. On his death (215) and the accession of his grandson
                    Hieronymos, his dynasty was swept away by the last revolution of Greek Syracuse.
                    The result was revolt against Rome, the great siege by Marcellus, the taking of
                    the city, the addition of Hieron’s kingdom to the Roman province. Two towns
                    only, which had taken the Roman side, Tauromenion and Netos, were admitted to
                    the full privileges of Roman alliance (cf. Diod. Fr., Hoeschl., lib. xxiii. p.
                    18; Cic., <hi rend="italic">Verr.,</hi> iii. 6, v. 22). Tauromenion indeed was
                    more highly favoured than the children of Mamers. Rome had a right to demand
                    ships of Messana, but not of Tauromenion. Some towns were destroyed; the people
                    of Henna were massacred. Akragas, again held for Carthage, was for four years
                    (214-210) the centre of an active campaign. The story of Akragas ended in
                    plunder, slaughter, and slavery; three years later, the story of Agrigentum
                    began.</p>
                <p>The reign of Hieron was the last time of independent Greek culture in Sicily. His
                    great works belong to the special history of Syracuse; but his time marks the
                    growth of a new form of local Sicilian genius. The spread of Hellenic culture
                    among the Sikels had in return made a Greek home for many Sikel beliefs,
                    traditions, and customs. Bucolic poetry is the native growth of Sicily; in the
                    hands of Theokritos it grew out of the germs supplied by Epi-charmos and Sophron
                    into a distinct and finished form of the art. The poet, himself of Syracuse,
                    went to and fro between the courts of Hieron and Ptolemy Philadelphos; but his
                    poetry is essentially Sicilian. So is that of his successors, both the Syracusan
                    Moschos and Bion of Smyrna, who came to Sicily as to his natural school. The
                    most renowned Sicilian name of this time, that of Archimedes, is hardly
                    distinctively Sicilian. A great name in the history of science, a great name in
                    the local history of Syracuse, he had not, like the earlier philosophers and the
                    bucolic poets, any direct bearing on the general political or intellectual
                    development of the island.</p>
                <p>With the incorporation of the kingdom of Hieron into the Roman province
                    independent Sicilian history comes to an end for many ages. Of the state of
                    Sicily under the Roman commonwealth our chief source of knowledge is the
                    pleading of Cicero against the worst Roman oppressor of Sicily, Gaius Verres.
                    Next in importance to this come those fragments of Diodoros which describe the
                    two insurrections of the slaves. Between those insurrections came the
                    legislation of Rupilius which settled the Roman system of administration in
                    Sicily. Cicero’s description comes later than all these; but the general
                    relations between Rome and Sicily seem to have been much the same from the first
                    occupation till the beginning of the empire. In one part of the island<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0035-0022"/> the Roman people stepped into the position of
                    Carthage, in another part into that of King Hieron. The allied cities kept their
                    several terms of alliance; the free cities kept their freedom; elsewhere the
                    land paid to the Roman people, according to the law of Hieron, the tithe which
                    it had paid to Hieron. But, as the tithe was let out to publicans, oppression
                    was easy. The praetor, after the occupation of Syracuse, dwelled there in the
                    palace of Hieron, as in the capital of the island. But, as a survival of the
                    earlier state of things, one of his two quaestors was quartered at Lilybaion.
                    Under the supreme dominion of Rome even the unprivileged cities kept their own
                    laws, magistrates, and assemblies, provision being made for suits between Romans
                    and Sicilians and between Sicilians of different cities (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Verr.,</hi> ii. 16). In Latin the one name Siculi takes in all the inhabitants
                    of the island; no distinction is drawn between Greek and Sikel, or even between
                    Greek and Phoenician cities. It is assumed that all Siculi are Greeks (<hi
                    rend="italic">Verr.,</hi> ii. 3, 29, 49, 52, 65; iii. 37, 40, 73). Even in
                    Greek, <hi rend="italic">∑ικeλoί</hi> is now sometimes used instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">∑ικϵλιωται</hi>. All the persons spoken of by Cicero came to have
                    Greek names save—a most speaking exception—Gaius Heius of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mamertina civitas.</hi> Inscriptions too from Sikel and Phoenician cities are
                    commonly Greek, even when they commemorate men with Phoenician names, coupled
                    perhaps with Greek surnames (C. <hi rend="italic">I. G.,</hi> iii. 597, cf.
                    628). The process of Hellenization which had been so long going on had at last
                    made Sicily thoroughly Greek. Roman conquest itself, which everywhere carried a
                    Greek element with it, would help this result. The corn of the fertile island
                    was said even then to feed the Roman people. It was this character of Sicily
                    which led to its one frightful piece of local history. The evils of slavery and
                    the slave-trade in their worst form—the slavery of men who are their masters’
                    equals in all but luck—reached their height in the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The wars of Rome, and the systematic piracy and
                    kidnapping that followed them, filled the Mediterranean lands with slaves of all
                    nations. Sicily stood out before the rest as the first land to be tilled by
                    slave-gangs, on the estates both of rich natives and of Roman settlers. The free
                    population naturally degenerated and died out. The slaves were most harshly
                    treated, and even encouraged by their masters to rob. The land was full of
                    disorder, and the praetors shrank from enforcing the law against offenders, many
                    of whom, as Roman knights, might be their own judges. Of these causes came the
                    two great slave-revolts of the second half of the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They did not stand alone in the world, but no others
                    reached the same extent. The first outbreak was stained by some excesses, but
                    after that we are struck with the orderly course of the rebellion. It is regular
                    warfare. Sicily had neither native militia nor Roman army; the slaves therefore,
                    strengthened by the poorer freemen, occupied the whole land save only the great
                    cities; they chose kings and founded them a capital. The chosen king of one
                    district submits to the other for the general good. They form armies which could
                    defeat Roman generals, and they are subdued only by efforts on the same scale as
                    the conquest of a kingdom. For most of the slaves were men used to freedom and
                    to arms, not a few of them Sicilian pirates. The fact that in the first war a
                    slave named Achaios—like Davus, Geta, or Syrus—plays a chief part also tells us
                    a good deal. The Syrian element was large, and the movement was mixed up with
                    much of Syrian religion. But the native deities of Sicily and the holy place of
                    the Palikoi were not forgotten. The first slave war lasted from 135 to 132, the
                    time of Tiberius Gracchus and the fall of Numantia. The second lasted from 102
                    to 99, the time of the Cimbrian invasion. At other times the power of Rome might
                    have quelled the revolt more speedily.</p>
                <p>The slave wars were not the only scourge that fell on Sicily. The pirates
                    troubled the coast, and all other evils were outdone by the three years’
                    government of Verres (73-70 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). Besides the light
                    which the great impeachment throws on the state of the island, his
                    administration seems really to have dealt a lasting blow to its prosperity. The
                    slave wars had not directly touched the great cities; Verres plundered and
                    impoverished everywhere. Another blow was the occupation of Messana by Sextus
                    Pompeius in 42 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He was master of Sicily for six
                    years, and Strabo (vi. 2, 4) attributes to this war the decayed state of several
                    cities. To undo this mischief Augustus planted Roman colonies at Syracuse,
                    Tauromenion, Thermae, Tyndaris, and Katana. The island thus received another
                    Italian infusion; but, as elsewhere, Latin in no way displaced Greek; it was
                    simply set up alongside of it for certain purposes. Roman tastes now came in;
                    Roman buildings, especially amphitheatres, arose. But Sicily never became Roman
                    like Gaul and Spain. The dictator Caesar designed the Roman, and Marcus Antonius
                    the Latin, franchise for all Sicily; but neither plan was carried out. Sicily
                    remained a province, a province of the senate and people, not of the prince.
                    Particular cities were promoted to higher privileges, and that was all. The
                    Mamertines were Romans in Pliny’s day; two free cities, Kentoripa and Segesta,
                    had become Latin; still later, Phoenician Lilybaion received a Roman colony. All
                    these were steps in the progress by which, in Sicily as elsewhere, political
                    distinctions were broken down, till the edict of Antoninus bestowed at least the
                    Roman name—no small gift—on all Roman allies and subjects. Sicily was now part
                    of <hi rend="italic">Romania,</hi> but it was one of its Greek members.</p>
                <p>Till this change was made, Sicily could not be in any sense incorporated with
                    Italy. In the division of Constantine, when the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >province</hi> had lost its meaning, when Italy itself was mapped out into
                    provinces, Sicily became one of these last. Along with Africa, Raetia (Rhaetia),
                    and western Illyricum, it became part of the Italian praefecture; along with the
                    islands of Sardinia and Corsica, it became part of the Italian diocese. It was
                    now ruled by a corrector (see the letter of Constantine, which stands first in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Codex Diplomaticus Siciliae</hi> of Johannes), afterwards
                    by a consular under the authority of the vicar of the Roman city <hi
                    rend="italic">(Not. Imp.,</hi> 14, 5). Few emperors visited Sicily; Hadrian was
                    there, as everywhere, and Julian also <hi rend="italic">(C.D.,</hi> 10). In its
                    provincial state Sicily fell back more than some other provinces. Ausonius could
                    still reckon Catina and fourfold Syracuse (“quadruplices Syracusas”) among noble
                    cities; but Sicily is not, like Gaul, rich in relics of later Roman life, and it
                    is now Egypt rather than Sicily that feeds Rome. The island has no internal
                    history beyond a very characteristic fact, a third slave war in the days of
                    Gallienus. External history there could be none in the central island, with no
                    frontier open to Germans or Persians. Sicilian history begins again when the
                    wandering of the nations planted new powers, not on the frontier of the empire,
                    but at its heart.</p>
                <p>The powers between which Sicily now passes to and fro are Teutonic powers. The
                    earlier stages of Teutonic advance could not touch Sicily. Alaric thought of a
                    Sicilian expedition, but a storm hindered him. Sicily was to be reached only by
                    a Teutonic power which made its way through Gaul, Spain, and Africa. The Vandal
                    now dwells at Carthage instead of the Canaanite. Gaiseric (429-477) subdued the
                    great islands for which Roman and Phoenician had striven. Along with Sardinia,
                    Corsica, and the Balearic Isles, Sicily is again a possession of a naval power
                    at Carthage. Gaiseric, at Rome more than a Hannibal, makes a treaty with
                    Odowakar (Odoacer) almost like that which ended the First Punic War. He gave up
                    (Victor<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0036-0023"/> Vitensis, i. 4) the island on condition of a
                    tribute, which was hardly paid by Theodoric. Sicily was now ruled by a Gothic
                    count, and the Goths claimed to have treated the land with special tenderness
                    (Procopius, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Goth.,</hi> iii. 16). The island, like the
                    rest of Theodoric’s dominions, was certainly well looked after by the great king
                    and his minister; yet we hear darkly of disaffection to Gothic rule (Cass., <hi
                    rend="italic">Var</hi>., i. 3). Theodoric gave back Lilybaion to the Vandal king
                    Thrasamund as the dowry of his sister Anala-frida (Proc., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bell. Vand.,</hi> i. 8). Yet Lilybaion was a Gothic possession when Belisarius,
                    conqueror of Africa, demanded it in vain as part of the Vandal possessions
                    (Proc., <hi rend="italic">Bell. Vand.,</hi> ii. 5; <hi rend="italic">Bell.
                    Goth.,</hi> i. 3). In the Gothic war Sicily was the first land to be recovered
                    for the empire, and that with the good will of its people (535). Panormus alone
                    was stoutly defended by its Gothic garrison. In 550 Totila took some fortresses,
                    but the great cities all withstood him, and the Goths were driven out the next
                    year.</p>
                <p>Sicily was thus won back to the Roman dominion, but the seat of the Roman
                    dominion was now at Constantinople. Belisarius was Pyrrhos and Marcellus in one.
                    For 430 years some part of Sicily, for 282 years the whole of it, again remained
                    a Roman province. To the Gothic count again succeeded, under Justinian, a Roman
                    <hi rend="italic">praetor,</hi> in Greek <hi rend="italic">στρατηγός</hi>. That
                    was the official title; we often hear of a <hi rend="italic">patrician</hi> of
                    Sicily, but patrician was in strictness a personal rank. In the later mapping
                    out of the empire into purely military divisions, the <hi rend="italic">theme
                    (θέμa</hi>) of Sicily took in both the island and the nearest peninsula of the
                    mainland, the oldest Italy. The island itself was divided for financial
                    purposes, almost as in the older times, into the two divisions of Syracuse and
                    Lilybaion. The revolutions of Italy hardly touched a land which looked steadily
                    to the eastern Rome as its head. The Lombard and Frankish masters of the
                    peninsula never fixed themselves in the island. When the Frank took the imperial
                    crown of the West, Sicily still kept its allegiance to the Augustus who reigned
                    at Constantinople, and was only torn away piecemeal from the empire by the next
                    race of conquerors.</p>
                <p>This connexion of Sicily with the eastern division of the empire no doubt largely
                    helped to keep up Greek life in the island. This was of course strengthened by
                    union with a power which had already a Greek side, and where the Greek side soon
                    became dominant. Still the connexion with Italy was close, especially the
                    ecclesiastical connexion. Some things tend to make Sicily look less Greek than
                    it really was. The great source of our knowledge of Sicily in the century which
                    followed the reconquest by Belisarius is the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of
                    Pope Gregory the Great, and they naturally show the most Latin side of things.
                    The merely official use of Latin was, it must be remembered, common to Sicily
                    with Constantinople. Gregory’s <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> are largely
                    occupied with the affairs of the great Sicilian estates held by the Roman
                    Church, as by the churches of Milan and Ravenna. But they deal with many other
                    matters (see the collection in Johannes, <hi rend="italic">C.D.,</hi> where the
                    letters bearing on Sicily are brought together, or the usual collection of his
                    letters). Saint Paul’s visit to Syracuse naturally gave rise to many legends;
                    but the Christian Church undoubtedly took early root in Sicily. We hear of
                    Manichaeans (<hi rend="italic">C.D.,</hi> 163); Jews were plentiful, and Gregory
                    causes compensation to be made for the unlawful destruction of synagogues. Of
                    paganism we find no trace, save that pagan slaves, doubtless not natives of the
                    island, were held by Jews (<hi rend="italic">C.D.,</hi> 127). Herein is a
                    contrast between Sicily and Sardinia, where, according to a letter from Gregory
                    to the empress Constantina, wife of Maurice (594-595), praying for a lightening
                    of taxation in both islands, paganism still lingered (<hi rend="italic"
                    >C.D.,</hi> 121). Sicily belonged to the Latin patriarchate; but we already</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">C.D.,</hi> 103) see glimmerings of the coming disputes between
                    the Eastern and Western Churches. Things were changed when, in the early days of
                    the iconoclast controversy, Leo the Isaurian confiscated the Sicilian and
                    Calabrian estates of the Roman Church (Theoph., i. 631).</p>
                <p>In the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries the old drama of Sicily was acted again. The
                    island is again disputed between Europe and Asia, transplanted to Africa between
                    Greek and Semitic dwellers on her own soil. Panormus and Syracuse are again the
                    headquarters of races and creeds, of creeds yet more than of races. The older
                    religious differences—not small certainly when the choice lay between Zeus and
                    Moloch—were small compared with the strife for life and death between
                    Christendom and Islam. Gregory and Mahomet were contemporaries, and, though
                    Saracen occupation did not begin in Sicily till more than two centuries after
                    Gregory’s death, Saracen inroads began much sooner. In 655 (Theoph., i. 532)
                    part of Sicily was plundered, and its inhabitants carried to Damascus. Then came
                    the strange episode of the visit of Constans the Second (641-668), the first
                    emperor, it would seem, who had set foot in Sicily since Julian. After a war
                    with the Lombards, after twelve days’ plunder of Rome, he came on to Syracuse,
                    where his oppressions led to his murder in 668. Sicily now saw for the first
                    time the setting up of a tyrant in the later sense. Meketios, commander of the
                    Eastern army of Constans, revolted, but Sicily and Roman Italy kept their
                    allegiance to the new emperor Constantine Pogonatos, who came in person to
                    destroy him. Then came another Saracen inroad from Alexandria, in which Syracuse
                    was sacked (Paul. Diac., V. 13). Others followed, but there was as yet no
                    lasting settlement. Towards the end of the 8th century, though Sicily itself was
                    untouched, its patricians and their forces play a part in the affairs of
                    southern Italy as enemies of the Frankish power. Charles himself was believed
                    (Theoph., i. 736) to have designs on Sicily; but, when it came to Saracen
                    invasion, the sympathies of both pope and Caesar lay with the invaded Christian
                    land (<hi rend="italic">Mon</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Car.,</hi> 323, 328).</p>
                <p>In 813 a peace for ten years was made between the Saracens and the patrician
                    Gregory. A few years after it expired Saracen settlement in the island begins.
                    This was a special time of Saracen inroad on the islands belonging to the
                    Eastern empire. Almost at the same moment Crete was seized by a band of
                    adventurers from Spain. But the first Saracen settlers in Sicily were the
                    African neighbours of Sicily, and they were called to the work by a home
                    treason. The story has been tricked out with many romantic details (<hi
                    rend="italic">Chron. Salem.,</hi> 60, ap. Pertz, iii. 498; Theoph. Cont., ii.
                    272; George Kedrenos, ii. 97); but it seems plain that Euphemios or Euthymios of
                    Syracuse, supported by his own citizens, revolted against Michael the Stammerer
                    (820-829), and, when defeated by an imperial army, asked help of Ziyâdet Allah,
                    the Aghlabite prince of Kairawán, and offered to hold the island of him. The
                    struggle of 138 years now began. Euphemios, a puppet emperor, was led about by
                    his Saracen allies much as earlier puppet emperors had been led about by Alaric
                    and Ataulf, till he was slain in one of the many sieges. The second Semitic
                    conquest of Sicily began in 827 at Mazzara on the old border of Greek and
                    Phoenician. But the land had a brave defender in the patrician Theodotos, and
                    the invaders met with a stout resistance both in the island and from armies both
                    from Constantinople and from Byzantine Italy. The advance of the invaders was
                    slow. In two years all that was done was to occupy Mazzara and Mineum —the old
                    Menai of Douketios—strange points certainly to begin with, and seemingly to
                    destroy Agrigentum, well used to destruction. Attacks on Syracuse failed; so

                    <hi rend="italic">Καστροιάννη</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> Castrogiovanni. The
                    actual gain was small; but the invaders took seizin alike of the coast and of
                    the island.</p>
                <p>A far greater conquest followed when new invaders came from Spain and when
                    Theodotos was killed in 830. The next year Panormus passed away for ever from
                    Roman, for 230 years from Christian, rule. Syracuse was for fifty years, not
                    only, as of old, the bulwark of Europe, but the bulwark of Christendom. By the
                    conquest of Panormus the Saracens were firmly rooted in the island. We hear
                    dimly of treasonable dealings with them on the part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >strategos</hi> Alexios, son-in-law of the emperor Theophilos; but we see more
                    clearly that Saracen advance was largely hindered by dissensions between the
                    African and the Spanish settlers. In the end the Moslem conquests in Sicily
                    became an Aghlabite principality owning at best a formal superiority in the
                    princes of Kairawán. With the Saracen occupation begins a new division of the
                    island, which becomes convenient in tracing the progress of Saracen conquest.
                    This is into three valleys, known in later forms of language as Val di Mazzara
                    or Mazza in the north-west, Val di Noto in the south-east, and Val Demone (a
                    name of uncertain origin) in the north-east (see Amari, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musulmani in Sicilia,</hi> i. 465). The first Saracen settlement of Val di
                    Mazzara answers roughly to the old Carthaginian possessions. From Panormus the
                    emir or lord of Sicily, Mohammed ibn Abdallah, sent forth his plunderers
                    throughout Sicily and even into southern Italy. There, though they made no
                    lasting settlements, they often occupied particular points. A consul or duke of
                    Naples in 836 even asked for Saracen help against the Lombards, which he is said
                    to have repaid by help against his fellow-subjects in Sicily (Johan. Diac., 57;
                    Amari, i. 314).</p>
                <p>The chief work of the next ten years was the conquest of the Val di Noto, but the
                    first great advance was made elsewhere. In 843 the Saracens won the Mamertine
                    city, Messana, and thus stood in the path between Italy and Sicily. Then the
                    work of conquest, as described by the Arabic writers, went on, but slowly. At
                    last, in 859, the very centre of the island, the stronghold of Henna, was taken,
                    and the main part of Val di Noto followed. But the divisions among the Moslems
                    helped the Christians; they won back several towns, and beat off all attacks on
                    Syracuse and Tauromenium. It is strange that the reign of Basil the Macedonian
                    (867), a time of such renewed vigour in the empire, was the time of the greatest
                    of all losses in Sicily. In Italy the imperial frontier largely advanced; in
                    Sicily imperial fleets threatened Panormus. But in 875 the accession of Ibrâhîm
                    ibn Ahmed in Africa changed the face of things. The emir in Sicily, Ja'far ibn
                    Ahmed, received strict orders to act vigorously against the eastern towns. In
                    877 began the only successful Semitic siege of Syracuse. The next year the city,
                    which for 1600 years had been the seat of Greek, Roman, and Christian life,
                    passed for the first time under the yoke of strangers to the fellowship of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>Thus in fifty-one years the imperial and Christian territory in Sicily was cut
                    down to a few points on or near the eastern coast, to the Val Demone in short
                    without Messana. But between Moslem dissension and Christian valour the struggle
                    had still to be waged for eightyseven years. Henna had been the chief centre of
                    Christian resistance a generation earlier; its place was now taken by the small
                    fort of Rametta not far from Messina. The Moslems of Sicily were busy in civil
                    wars; Arabs fought against Berbers, both against the African overlord. In 900
                    Panormus had to be won by a son of Ibráhím from Moslem rebels provoked by his
                    father’s cruelty. But when Ibrâhîm himself came into Sicily, renewed efforts
                    against the Christians led to the first taking of Tauromenium (908), of Rametta,
                    and of other points. The civil war that followed his death, the endless
                    revolutions of Agrigentum, where the weaker side did not scruple to call in
                    Christian help, hindered any real Saracen occupation of eastern Sicily. The
                    emperors never gave up their claims to Sicily or their hopes of recovering it.
                    Besides the struggle with the Christians in the island, there was often direct
                    warfare between the empire and the Saracens; but such warfare was more active in
                    Italy than in Sicily. In 956 a peace or truce was made by the emperor
                    Constantine Porphyrogenitus. A few years later, Otho the Great, the restorer of
                    the Western empire, looked to Sicily as a land to be won back for Christendom.
                    It had not yet wholly passed away; but the day soon came. Strange to say, as
                    Syracuse fell. in the reign of Basil the Macedonian, the Saracen occupation was
                    completed in the reign of Nikephoros Phokas (Nicephorus Phocas), the deliverer
                    of Crete. In the very year of his accession (963) Tauromenium was taken for the
                    second time, and became for a hundred years a Mohammedan possession. Rametta
                    alone held out. A fleet and army from Constantinople went in vain to its help;
                    the last stronghold of Christendom was taken (965), and for a season all was
                    over.</p>
                <p>Thus in 138 years the Arab did what the Canaanite had never done. The whole
                    island was a Semitic, that is now a Mohammedan, possession. The Greek-speaking
                    Roman of Sicily was a bondman in his own land, like the Latin-speaking Roman of
                    Spain. Yet the complete Saracen possession of Sicily may seem a thing of a
                    moment. Its first and longest period lasted only 73 years. In that time
                    Mohammedan Sicily was threatened by a Western emperor; the Arabic writers claim
                    the Saracen army by which Otho the Second was beaten back in 982 as a Sicilian
                    army. A mightier enemy was threatening in the East. Basil the Second planned the
                    recovery of Sicily in good earnest. In 1027 he sent a great army; but his death
                    stopped their progress before they reached the island. But the great conqueror
                    had left behind him men trained in his school, and eleven years later the eagles
                    of the new Rome again marched to Sicilian victories. The ravages of the Sicilian
                    Saracens in the Greek islands were more frightful than ever, and George
                    Maniakes, the first captain of his time, was sent to win back the lost land. He
                    too was helped by Saracen dissensions. The emir Abul-afar became a Roman vassal,
                    and, like Alaric of old, became <hi rend="italic">magister militum</hi> in the
                    Roman army. His brother and rival Abu-ḥafaṣ brought help from Africa; and
                    finally all joined against the Christians. Four years of Christian victory
                    (1038- 1042) followed. In the host of Maniakes were men of all races,—Normans,
                    who had already begun to show themselves in south Italy, and the Warangian
                    guard, the best soldiers of the empire, among whom Harold Hardrada himself is
                    said to have held a place. Town after town was delivered, first Messana, then
                    Syracuse, then a crowd of others. The exact extent of the reconquest is
                    uncertain; Byzantine writers claim the deliverance of the whole island; but it
                    is certain that the Saracens never lost Panormus. But court influence spoiled
                    everything: Maniakes was recalled; under his successor Stephen, brother-in-law
                    of the emperor Michael, the Saracens won back what they had lost. Messana alone
                    held out, for how long a time is uncertain. But it could not have been again
                    under the yoke for many years when a conqueror came who had no empresses to
                    thwart him. The second Saracen occupation of all Sicily was short indeed. In
                    1060 began the thirty years’ work of the first Roger.</p>
                <p>Thus for 263 years the Christian people of some part or other of Sicily were in
                    subjection to Moslem masters. But that subjection differed widely in different
                    times and<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0038-0025"/> places. The land was won bit by bit. One town was
                    taken by storm; another submitted on terms harsher or more favourable. The
                    condition of the Christians varied from that of personal slaves to that of
                    communities left free on the payment of tribute. The great mass were in the
                    intermediate state usual among the non-Mohammedan subjects of a Mohammedan
                    power. The <hi rend="italic">dhimmí</hi> of Sicily were in essentially the same
                    case as the <hi rend="italic">rayahs</hi> of the Turk. While the conquest was
                    going on, the towns that remained unconquered gained in point of local freedom.
                    They became allies rather than subjects of the distant emperor. So did the
                    tributary districts, as long as the original terms were kept. But, as ever, the
                    condition of the subject race grew worse. After the complete conquest of the
                    island, while the mere slaves had turned Mohammedans, there is nothing more
                    heard of tributary districts. At the coming of the Normans the whole Christian
                    population was in the state of <hi rend="italic">rayahs.</hi> Still Christianity
                    and the Greek tongue never died out; churches and monasteries received and held
                    property; there still are saints and men of learning. Panormus was specially
                    Saracen; yet a Christian religious guild could be founded there in 1048 <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tabularium Regiae, Cap. Panorm.,</hi> p. 1). We have its Greek
                    foundation deed. It would be rash to deny that traces of other dialects may not
                    have lingered on; but Greek and Arabic were the two written tongues of Sicily
                    when the Normans came. The Sicilian Saracens were hindered by their internal
                    feuds from ever becoming a great power; but they stood high among Mohammedan
                    nations. Their advance in civilization is shown by their position under the
                    Normans, and above all by their admirable style of architecture (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Palermo).</hi> Saracens are always called in for any special
                    work of building or engineering. They had a literature which Norman kings
                    studied and promoted. The Normans in short came into the inheritance of the two
                    most civilized nations of the time, and they allowed the two to flourish side by
                    side.</p>
                <p>The most brilliant time for Sicily as a power in the world begins with the coming
                    of the Normans. Never before or after was the island so united or so
                    independent. Some of the old tyrants had ruled out of Sicily; none had ruled
                    over all Sicily. The Normans held all Sicily as the centre of a dominion which
                    stretched far beyond it. The conquest was the work of one man, Count Roger of
                    the house of Hauteville, brother of the more famous Robert Wiscard (Guiscard).
                    That it took him thirty years was doubtless owing to his being often called off
                    to help his brother in Italy and beyond Hadria. The conquests of the Normans in
                    Italy and Sicily form part of one enterprise; but they altogether differ in
                    character. In Italy they overthrew the Byzantine dominion; their own rule was
                    perhaps not worse, but they were not deliverers. In Sicily they were everywhere
                    welcomed by the Christians as deliverers from infidel bondage.</p>
                <p>As in the Saracen conquest of Sicily, as in the Byzantine recovery, so in the
                    Norman conquest, the immediate occasion was given by a home traitor. Count Roger
                    had already made a plundering attack, when Becumen of Catania, driven out by his
                    brother, urged him to serious invasion. Messina was taken in 1060, and became
                    for a while the Norman capital. The Christians everywhere welcomed the
                    conqueror. But at Traîna they presently changed their minds, and joined with the
                    Saracens to besiege the count in their citadel. At Catania Becumen was set up
                    again as Roger’s vassal, and he did good service till he was killed. Roger soon
                    began to fix his eye on the Saracen capital. Against that city he had Pisan
                    help, as the inscription on the Pisan <hi rend="italic">duomo</hi> witnesses
                    (cf. Geoff. Mal., ii. 34). But Palermo was not taken until 1071, and then only
                    by the help of Duke Robert, who kept the prize to himself.</p>
                <p>Still its capture was the turning-point in the struggle. Taormina (Tauromenium)
                    was won in 1078. Syracuse, under its emir Benarvet, held out stoutly. He won
                    back Catania by the help of a Saracen to whom Roger had trusted the city, and
                    whom he himself punished. Catania was won back by the count’s son Jordan. But
                    progress was delayed by Jordan’s rebellion and by the absence of Roger in his
                    brother’s wars. At last, in 1085, Syracuse was won. Next year followed Girgenti
                    and Castrogiovanni, whose chief became a Christian. Noto, the Saracen Rametta,
                    held out till 1090. Then the whole island was won, and Roger completed his
                    conquest by a successful expedition to Malta.</p>
                <p>Like the condition of the Greeks under the Saracens, so the condition of the
                    Saracens under the Normans differed in different places according to the
                    circumstances of each conquest. The Mohammedan religion was everywhere
                    tolerated, in many places much more. But it would seem that, just as under the
                    Moslem rule, conversions from Christianity to Islam were forbidden. On the other
                    hand, conversions from Islam to Christianity were not always encouraged; Saracen
                    troops were employed from the beginning, and Count Roger seems to have thought
                    them more trustworthy when unconverted. At Palermo the capitulation secured to
                    the Saracens the full enjoyment of their own laws; Girgenti was long mainly
                    Saracen; in Val di Noto the Saracens kept towns and castles of their own. On the
                    other hand, at Messina there were few or none, and we hear of both Saracen and
                    Greek villains, the latter doubtless abiding as they were in Saracen times. But
                    men of both races were trusted and favoured according to their deserts. The
                    ecclesiastical relations between Greeks and Latins are harder to trace. At the
                    taking of Palermo the Greek bishop was restored; but his successors were Latins,
                    and Latin prelates were placed in the bishoprics which Count Roger founded.
                    Urban the Second visited Sicily to promote the union of the church, and he
                    granted to the count those special ecclesiastical powers held by the counts and
                    kings of Sicily as hereditary legates of the Holy See which grew into the famous
                    Sicilian monarchy (Geoff. Mal., iv. 29). But Greek worship went on; at Messina
                    it lingered till the 14th and 15th centuries (Pirro, <hi rend="italic">Sicilia
                    Sacra,</hi> i. 420, 431, 449), as it has been since brought back by the Albanian
                    colonists. But the Greeks of Sicily have long been united Greeks, admitting the
                    authority of the see of Rome.</p>
                <p>In its results the Norman conquest of Sicily was a Latin conquest far more
                    thorough than that which had been made by the Roman commonwealth. The Norman
                    princes protected all the races, creeds, and tongues of the island, Greek,
                    Saracen, and Jew. But new races came to settle alongside of them, all of whom
                    were Latin as far as their official speech was concerned. The Normans brought
                    the French tongue with them; it remained the court speech during the 12th
                    century, and Sicily was thrown open to all speakers of French, many of whom came
                    from England. There was constant intercourse between the two great islands, both
                    ruled by Norman kings, and many natives of England filled high places in Sicily.
                    But French was only a language of society, not of business or literature. The
                    languages of inscriptions and documents are Greek, Arabic, and Latin, in private
                    writings sometimes Hebrew. The kings understood Greek and Arabic, and their
                    deeds and works were commemorated in both tongues. Hence comes the fact, at
                    first sight so strange, that Greek, Arabic, and French have all given way to a
                    dialect of Italian. But the cause is not far to seek. The Norman conquest opened
                    Sicily to settlers from Italy, above all from the Norman possessions in Italy.
                    Under the name of Lombards, they became an important, in some parts a dominant,
                    element.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0039-0026"/> Thus at Messina, where we hear nothing of
                    Saracens, we hear much of the disputes between Greeks and Lombards. The Lombards
                    had hardly a distinct language to bring with them. At the time of the conquest,
                    it was already found out that French had become a distinct speech from Latin;
                    Italian hardly was such. The Lombard element, during the Norman reign, shows
                    itself, not in whole documents or inscriptions, but in occasional words and
                    forms, as in some of the mosaics at Monreale. And, if any element, Latin or akin
                    to Latin, had lingered on through Byzantine and Saracen rule, it would of course
                    be attracted to the new Latin element, and would help to strengthen it. It was
                    this Lombard element that had the future before it. Greek and Arabic were
                    antiquated, or at least isolated, in a land which Norman conquest had made part
                    of Western Europe and Latin Christendom. They could grow only within the island;
                    they could gain no strength from outside. Even the French element was in some
                    sort isolated, and later events made it more so. But the Lombard element was
                    constantly strengthened by settlement from outside. In the older Latin conquest,
                    the Latin carried Greek with him, and the Greek element absorbed the Latin.
                    Latin now held in western Europe the place which Greek had held there. Thus, in
                    the face of Italian, both Greek and Arabic died out. Step by step, Christian
                    Sicily became Latin in speech and in worship. But this was not till the Norman
                    reigns were over. Till the end of the 12th century Sicily was the one land where
                    men of divers creeds and tongues could live side by side, each in his own
                    way.</p>
                <p>Hence came both the short-lived brilliancy of Sicily and its later decay. In
                    Sicily there were many nations all protected by the Sicilian king; but there was
                    no Sicilian nation. Greek, Saracen, Norman, Lombard, and Jew could not be fused
                    into one people; it was the boast of Sicily that each kept his laws and tongue
                    undisturbed. Such a state of things could live on only under an enlightened
                    despotism; the discordant elements could not join to work out really free and
                    national institutions. Sicily had parliaments, and some constitutional
                    principles were well understood. But they were assemblies of barons, or at most
                    of barons and citizens; they could only have represented the Latin elements,
                    Norman and Lombard, in the island. The elder races, Greek and Saracen, stand
                    outside the relations between the Latin king and his Latin subjects. Still, as
                    long as Greek and Saracen were protected and favoured, so long was Sicily the
                    most brilliant of European kingdoms. But its greatness had no groundwork of
                    national life; for lack of it the most brilliant of kingdoms presently sank
                    below the level of other lands.</p>
                <p>Four generations only span the time from the birth of Count Roger, about 1030, to
                    the death of the emperor Frederick the Second in 1250. Roger, great count of
                    Sicily, was, at his death in 1101, succeeded by his young son Simon, and he in
                    1105 by the second Roger, the first king. He inherited all Sicily, save half
                    Palermo—the other half had been given up—and part of Calabria. The rest of
                    Palermo was soon granted; the Semitic capital became the abiding head of Sicily.
                    On the death of Duke William of Apulia, Roger gradually founded (1127-40) a
                    great Italian dominion. To the Apulian duchy he added (1136) the Norman
                    principality of Capua, Naples (1138), the last dependency of the Eastern empire
                    in Italy, and (1140) the Abruzzi, an undoubted land of the Western empire. He
                    thus formed a dominion which has been divided, united, and handed over from one
                    prince to another, offener than any other state in Europe, but whose frontier
                    has hardly changed at all. In 1130 Roger was crowned at Palermo, by authority of
                    the antipope Anacletus, taking the strange title of “king of Sicily and Italy.”
                    This, on his recon-</p>
                <p>cilation with Pope Innocent the Second, he exchanged for “king of Sicily and of
                    the duchy of Apulia and of the principality of Capua.” By virtue of the old
                    relations between the popes and the Normans of Apulia, he held his kingdom in
                    fief of the Holy See, a position which on the whole strengthened the royal
                    power. But his power, like that of Dionysios and Agathokles, was felt in more
                    distant regions. His admiral George of Antioch, Greek by birth and creed, warred
                    against the Eastern empire, won Corfu (Korypho; the name of Korkyra is
                    forgotten) for a season, and carried off the silk-workers from Thebes and
                    Peloponnesos to Sicily. But Manuel Komnenos (Comnenus) ruled in the East, and,
                    if Roger threatened Constantinople, Manuel threatened Sicily. In Africa the work
                    of Agathokles was more than renewed; Mahadia and other points were won and kept
                    as long as Roger lived. These exploits won him the name of the terror of Greeks
                    and Saracens. To the Greeks, and still more to the Saracens, of his own island
                    he was a protector and something more.</p>
                <p>Roger’s son William, surnamed the Bad, was crowned in his father’s lifetime in
                    1151. Roger died in 1154, and William’s sole reign lasted till 1166. It was a
                    time of domestic rebellions, chiefly against the king’s unpopular ministers, and
                    it is further marked by the loss of Roger’s African conquests. After William the
                    Bad came (1166- 1189) his son William the Good. Unlike as were the two men in
                    themselves, in their foreign policy they are hardly to be distinguished. The Bad
                    William has a short quarrel with the pope; otherwise Bad and Good alike appear
                    as zealous supporters of Alexander the Third, and as enemies of both empires.
                    The Eastern warfare of the Good is stained by the frightful sack of
                    Thessalonica; it is marked also by the formation of an Eastern state under
                    Sicilian supremacy (1186). Corfu, the possession of Agathokles and Roger, with
                    Durazzo, Cephalonia, and Zante, was granted by William to his admiral Margarito
                    with the strange title of king of the Epeirots. He founded a dynasty, though not
                    of kings, in Cephalonia and Zante. Corfu and Durazzo were to be more closely
                    connected with the Sicilian crown.</p>
                <p>The brightest days of Sicily ended with William the Good. His marriage with
                    Joanna, daughter of Henry of Anjou and England, was childless, and William tried
                    to procure the succession of his aunt Constance and her husband, King Henry the
                    Sixth of Germany, son of the emperor Frederick the First. But the prospect of
                    German rule was unpopular, and on William’s death the crown passed to Tancred,
                    an illegitimate grandson of King Roger, who figures in English histories in the
                    story of Richard’s crusade. In 1191 Henry, now emperor, asserted his claims;
                    but, while Tancred lived, he did little, in Sicily nothing, to enforce them. On
                    the death of Tancred (1194) and the accession of his young son William the
                    Third, the emperor came and conquered Sicily and the Italian possessions, with
                    an amount of cruelty which outdid any earlier war or revolution. First of four
                    Western emperors who wore the Sicilian crown, Henry died in 1197, leaving the
                    kingdom to his young son Frederick, heir of the Norman kings through his
                    mother.</p>
                <p>The great days of the Norman conquest and the Norman reigns have been worthily
                    recorded by contemporary historians. For few times have we richer materials. The
                    oldest is Aimé or Amato of Monte Cassino, who exists only in an Old-French
                    translation. We have also for the Norman conquest the halting hexameters of
                    William of Apulia, and for the German conquest the lively and partial verses of
                    Peter of Eboli. Of prose writers we have Geoffrey Malaterra, Alexander abbot of
                    Telesia, Romuald archbishop of Salerno, Falco of Benevento, above all Hugo
                    Falcandus, one of the very foremost of mediaeval writers.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0040-0027"/> Not one of these Latin writers was a native of
                    the island, and we have no record from any native Greek. Occasional notices we
                    of course have in the Byzantine writers, and Archbishop Eustathios’s account of
                    the taking of Thessalonica is more than occasional. And the close connexion
                    between Sicily and England leads to many occasional references to Sicilian
                    matters in English writers.</p>
                <p>The relations between the various races of the islands are most instructive. The
                    strong rule of Roger kept all in order. He called himself the defender of
                    Christians; others, on account of his favour to the Saracens, spoke of him as a
                    pagan. He certainly encouraged Saracen art and literature in every shape. His
                    court was full of eunuchs, of whom we hear still more under William the Bad.
                    Under William the Good the Saracens, without any actual oppression, seem to be
                    losing their position. Hitherto they had been one element in the land, keeping
                    their own civilization alongside of others. By a general outbreak on the death
                    of William the Good, the Saracens, especially those of Palermo, were driven to
                    take shelter in the mountains, where they sank into a wild people, sometimes
                    holding points of the island against all rulers, sometimes taking military
                    service under them. The Jews too begin to sink into bondmen. Sicily is ceasing
                    to be the land of many nations living side by side on equal terms.</p>
                <p>The Germans who helped Henry to win the Sicilian crown did not become a new
                    element in the island, but only a source of confusion during the minority of his
                    son. Frederick—presently to be the renowned emperor Frederick the Second,
                    “Fridericus stupor mundi et immutator mirabilis”—was crowned at Palermo in 1198;
                    but the child, deprived of both parents, was held to be under the protection of
                    his lord Pope Innocent the Third. During his minority the land was torn in
                    pieces by turbulent nobles, revolted Saracens, German captains seeking
                    settlements, the maritime cities of Italy, and professed French deliverers. In
                    1210 the emperor Otho the Fourth, who had overrun the continental dominions,
                    threatened the island. In 1212, just when Frederick was reaching an age to be of
                    use in his own kingdom, he was called away to dispute the crown of Germany and
                    Rome with Otho. Eight years more of disorder followed; in 1220 the emperor-king
                    came back. He brought the Saracens of the mountains back again to a life in
                    plains and cities, and presently planted a colony of them on the mainland at
                    Nocera, when they became his most trusty soldiers. His necessary absences from
                    Sicily led to revolts. He came back in 1233 from his crusade to suppress a
                    revolt of the eastern cities, which seem, like those of Italy, to have been
                    aiming at republican independence. A Saracen revolt in 1243 is said to have been
                    followed by a removal of the whole remnant to Nocera. Some however certainly
                    stayed or came back; but their day was over.</p>
                <p>Under Frederick the Italian or Lombard element finally prevailed in Sicily. Of
                    all his kingdoms Sicily was the best-beloved. He spoke all its tongues; he
                    protected, as far as circumstances would allow, all its races. He legislated for
                    all in the spirit of an enlightened and equal despotism, jealous of all special
                    privileges, whether of nobles, churches, or cities. The heretic alone was
                    persecuted; he was the domestic rebel of the church; Saracen and Jew were
                    entitled to the rights of foreigners. Yet Frederick, patron of Arabic learning,
                    suspected even of Moslem belief, fails to check the decline of the Saracen
                    element in Sicily. The Greek element has no such forces brought against it. It
                    is still a chief tongue of the island, in which Frederick’s laws are put forth
                    as well as in Latin. But it is clearly a declining element. Greek and Saracen
                    were both becoming survivals in an island which was but one of the many kingdoms
                    of its king. No wonder that the Italian element advanced at the cost of all
                    others. Frederick chose it as the court speech of Sicily, and he made it more
                    than a court speech, the speech of a new-born literature. Sicily, strangely
                    enough, became the cradle of Italian song.</p>
                <p>Two emperors had now held the Sicilian crown. On Frederick’s death in 1250 the
                    crown passed to his son Conrad, not emperor indeed, but king of the Romans. He
                    was nominally succeeded by his son Conradin. The real ruler under both was
                    Frederick’s natural son Manfred. In 1258, on a false rumour of the death of
                    Conradin, Manfred was himself crowned king at Palermo. He had to found the
                    kingdom afresh. Pope Innocent the Fourth had crossed into Sicily, to take
                    advantage of the general discontent. The cities, whose growing liberties had
                    been checked by Frederick’s legislation, strove for practical, if not formal,
                    independence, sometimes for dominion over their fellows. The 5th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> seemed to have come back. Messina laid waste the
                    lands of Taormina, because Taormina would not obey the bidding of Messina. Yet,
                    among these and other elements of confusion, Manfred succeeded in setting up
                    again the kingly power, first for his kinsmen and then for himself. His reign
                    continued that of his father, so far as a mere king could continue the reign of
                    such an emperor. The king of Sicily was the first potentate of Italy, and came
                    nearer than any prince since Louis the Second to the union of Italy under
                    Italian rule. He sought dominion too beyond Hadria: Corfu, Durazzo, and a strip
                    of the Albanian coast became Sicilian possessions as the dowry of Manfred’s
                    Greek wife. But papal enmity was too much for him. His overlord claimed to
                    dispose of his crown, and hawked it about among the princes of the West. Edmund
                    of England bore the Sicilian title for a moment. More came of the grant of Urban
                    the Fourth (1264) to Charles, count of Anjou, and through his wife sovereign
                    count of Provence. Charles, crowned by the pope in 1266, marched to take
                    possession of his lord’s grant. Manfred was defeated and slain at Benevento. The
                    whole Sicilian kingdom became the spoil of a stranger who was no deliverer to
                    any class of its people. The island sank yet lower. Naples, not Palermo, was the
                    head of the new power; Sicily was again a province. But a province Sicily had no
                    mind to be. In the continental lands Charles founded a dynasty; the island he
                    lost after sixteen years. His rule was not merely the rule of a stranger king
                    surrounded by stranger followers; the degradation of the island was aggravated
                    by gross oppression, grosser than in the continental lands. The continental
                    lands submitted, with a few slight efforts at resistance. The final result of
                    the Angevin conquest of Sicily was its separation from the mainland.</p>
                <p>Sicilian feeling was first shown in the support given to the luckless expedition
                    of Conradin in 1268. Frightful executions in the island followed his fall. The
                    rights of the Swabian house were now held to pass to Peter (Pedro), king of
                    Aragon, husband of Manfred’s daughter Constance. The connexion with Spain, which
                    has so deeply affected the whole later history of Sicily, now begins. Charles
                    held the Greek possessions of Manfred and had designs both on Epeiros and on
                    Constantinople. The emperor Michael Palaiologos and Peter of Aragon became
                    allies against Charles; the famous John of Procida acted as an agent between
                    them; the costs of Charles’s Eastern warfare caused great discontent, especially
                    in an island where some might still look to the Greek emperor as a natural
                    deliverer. Peter and Michael were doubtless watching the turn of things in
                    Sicily; but the tale of a long-hidden conspiracy between them and the whole
                    Sicilian people has been set aside by Amari. The actual outbreak of 1282, the
                    famous Sicilian Vespers, was stirred up by the wrongs of the moment. A gross
                    case of insult offered by a Frenchman<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n41/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0041-0028"/> to a Sicilian woman led to the massacre at
                    Palermo, and the like scenes followed elsewhere. The strangers were cut off;
                    Sicily was left to its own people. The towns and districts left without a ruler
                    by no means designed to throw off the authority of the overlord; they sought the
                    good will of Pope Martin. But papal interests were on the side of Charles; and
                    he went forth with the blessing of the church to win back his lost kingdom.</p>
                <p>Angevin oppression had brought together all Sicily in a common cause. There was
                    at last a Sicilian nation, a nation for a while capable of great deeds. Sicily
                    now stands out as a main centre of European politics. But the land has lost its
                    character; it is becoming the plaything of powers, instead of the meeting-place
                    of nations. The tale, true or false, that Frenchmen and Provençale were known
                    from the natives by being unable to frame the Italian sound of <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> shows how thoroughly the Lombard tongue had overcome the other tongues
                    of the island. In Palermo, once city of threefold speech, a Greek, a Saracen, a
                    Norman, who clave to his own tongue must have died with the strangers.</p>
                <p>Charles was now besieging Messina; Sicily seems to have put on some approach to
                    the form of a federal commonwealth. Meanwhile Peter of Aragon was watching and
                    preparing. He now declared himself. To all, except the citizens of the great
                    cities, a king would be acceptable; Peter was chosen with little opposition in a
                    parliament at Palermo, and a struggle of twenty-one years began, of which
                    Charles and Peter saw only the first stage. In fact, after Peter had helped the
                    Sicilians to relieve Messina, he was very little in Sicily; he had to defend his
                    kingdom of Aragon, which Pope Martin had granted to another French Charles. He
                    was represented by Queen Constance, and his great admiral Roger de Loria kept
                    the war away from Sicily, waging it wholly in Italy, and making Charles, the son
                    of King Charles, prisoner. In 1285 both the rival kings died. Charles had before
                    his death been driven to make large legislative concessions to his subjects to
                    stop the tendency shown, especially in Naples, to join the revolted Sicilians.
                    By Peter’s death Aragon and Sicily were separated; his eldest son Alphonso took
                    Aragon, and his second son James took Sicily, which was to pass to the third son
                    Frederick, if James died childless. James was crowned, and held his reforming
                    parliament also. With the popes no terms could be made. Charles, released in
                    1288 under a deceptive negotiation, was crowned king of Sicily by Honorius; but
                    he had much ado to defend his continental dominions against James and Roger. In
                    1291 James succeeded Alphonso in the kingdom of Aragon, and left Frederick not
                    king, according to the entail, but only his lieutenant in Sicily.</p>
                <p>Frederick was the real restorer of Sicilian independence. He had come to the
                    island so young that he felt as a native. He defended the land stoutly, even
                    against his brother. For James presently played Sicily false. In 1295 he was
                    reconciled to the church and released from all French claims on Aragon, and he
                    bound himself to restore Sicily to Charles. But the Sicilians, with Frederick at
                    their head, disowned the agreement, and in 1296 Frederick was crowned king. He
                    had to defend Sicily against his brother and Roger de Loria, who forsook the
                    cause, as did John of Procida. Hitherto the war had been waged on the mainland;
                    now it was transferred to Sicily. King James besieged Syracuse as admiral of the
                    Roman Church; Charles sent his son Robert in 1299 as his lieutenant in Sicily,
                    where he gained some successes. But in the same year the one great land battle
                    of the war, that of Falconaria, was won for Sicily. The war, chiefly marked by
                    another great siege of Messina, went on till 1302, when both sides were
                    thoroughly weakened and eager for peace. By a treaty, confirmed by Pope Boniface
                    the next year, Frederick was acknowledged as king of Trinacria for life. He was
                    to marry the daughter of the king of Sicily, to whom the island kingdom was to
                    revert at his death. The terms were never meant to be carried out. Frederick
                    again took up the title of king of Sicily, and at his death in 1337 he was
                    succeeded by his son Peter. There were thus two Sicilian kingdoms and two kings
                    of Sicily. The king of the mainland is often spoken of for convenience as king
                    of Naples, but that description was never borne as a formal title save in the
                    16th century by Philip, king of England and Naples, and in the 19th by Joseph
                    Buonaparte and Joachim Murat. The strict distinction was between Sicily on this
                    side the Pharos (of Messina) and Sicily beyond it.</p>
                <p>Thus the great island of the Mediterranean again became an independent power.
                    And, as far as legislation could make it, Sicily became one of the freest
                    countries in Europe. By the laws of Frederick parliaments were to be regularly
                    held, and without their consent the king could not make war, peace, or alliance.
                    The treaty of 1302 was not confirmed by parliament, and in 1337 parliament
                    called Peter to the crown. But Sicily never rose to the greatness of its Greek
                    or its Norman days, and its old character had passed away. Of Greeks and
                    Saracens we now hear only as a degraded remnant, to be won over, if it may be,
                    to the Western Church. The kingdom had no foreign possessions; yet faint
                    survivals of the days of Agathokles and Roger lingered on. The isle of Gerba off
                    the African coast was held for a short time, and traces of the connexion with
                    Greece went on in various shapes. If the kings of Sicily on this side the Pharos
                    kept Corfu down to 1386, those beyond the Pharos became in 1311 overlords of
                    Athens, when that duchy was seized by Catalan adventurers, disbanded after the
                    wars of Sicily. In 1530 the Sicilian island of Malta became the shelter of the
                    Knights of Saint John driven by the Turk from Rhodes, and Sicily has received
                    several colonies of Christian Albanians, who have replaced Greek and Arabic by
                    yet another tongue.</p>
                <p>There is no need to dwell at length on the Sicilian history of the last five
                    hundred years. The descendants of Frederick did not form a great dynasty. Under
                    him and after him Sicily played a part in Italian affairs, invading and being
                    invaded on behalf of the Ghibelline cause. But it was torn by dissensions
                    between Spanish and Italian factions, and handed to and fro between one Spanish
                    king and another. At last Ferdinand the Catholic (1479-1515), king by
                    inheritance of Aragon and of Sicily beyond the pharos, conquered the continental
                    Sicily, and called himself king of the Two Sicilies. Both were now ruled by
                    Spanish viceroys. In Charles the First (1516-1555)—Charles of Anjou is not
                    reckoned—Sicily had a third imperial king, and once more became the
                    starting-point for African warfare. Philip, already king of Naples, became king
                    of the Two Sicilies at the abdication of his father, and the two crowns passed
                    along with Castile and Aragon till the division of the Spanish dominions. Under
                    the foreign rule the old laws were trampled under foot. Three risings took
                    place, that of Messina in 1672, with pretended French help, which led to deeper
                    subjection. At the death of Charles the Second in 1700, Sicily acknowledged the
                    French claimant Philip; but the peace of Utrecht made it the kingdom of Victor
                    Amadeus of Savoy (1713-1720). He was crowned at Palermo; but he had to withstand
                    Spanish invasion, and to exchange Sicily for the other insular crown of
                    Sardinia. Both Sicilies now passed to the emperor Charles the Sixth, the fourth
                    imperial king, who also is passed by in Sicilian reckoning. Charles the Third is
                    the Spanish prince of the house of Bourbon who won both Sicilies from the
                    Austrian, and who was the last king crowned at Palermo (1735).<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0044-0029"/> The wars of the French Revolution again parted
                    the Two Sicilies. In 1798 Ferdinand the Fourth (1759-1825) withdrew to the
                    island before the French armies. In 1805 he withdrew again, while Joseph
                    Buonaparte and Joachim Murat reigned on the mainland as kings of Naples. Under
                    the Bourbon rule, besides the common grievances of both kingdoms, Sicily had
                    specially to complain of being treated as subordinate to Naples. But from 1806
                    to 1815 Sicily, practically a separate kingdom under British protection, enjoyed
                    a measure of wellbeing such as it had not had for some ages, and in 1812 a
                    constitution was established. The European settlement of 1815 brought back the
                    Bourbon to his continental kingdom. Ferdinand the First became a constitutional
                    king over the United Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. This was equivalent to the
                    suppression of the separate constitution of the island, and before long all
                    constitutional order was trodden under foot. In 1820, and also in 1836 under
                    Francis the First, Sicily rose for freedom and separation. This last time the
                    island was bound yet more firmly to continental rule. In the general stir of
                    1848 Sicily again proclaimed her independence, and sought for herself a king in
                    the house of Savoy. Again were the liberties of Sicily trodden under foot; and,
                    in the last change of all, the deliverance wrought by Garibaldi in 1860, if not
                    her liberties, her ancient memories were forgotten. Sicily became part of a free
                    kingdom; but her king does not bear her style, and he has not taken the crown of
                    Roger. The very name of Sicily has been wiped out; and the great island now
                    counts only as seven provinces of an Italian kingdom.</p>
                <p>The literature bearing on Sicily, old and new, is endless. It is something for a
                    land to have had part of its story told by Thucydides and another by Hugo
                    Falcandus. Of modern books Holm’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Siciliens im
                    Alterthum</hi> (down to the accession of the second Hieron) is of great value.
                    So are the works of Michele Amari for the Moslem occupation and the War of the
                    Vespers. The old local historian Fazzello must not be passed by, nor the
                    collections of Carusio, Pirro, and Giovanni. But a history of Sicily and the
                    cycles of its history from the beginning is still lacking. The writers on
                    particular branches of the subject are infinite. Gaily Knight’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Normans in Sicily</hi> has probably led many to their first
                    thoughts on the subject; and, as a guide for the traveller, that of Gsel-fels
                    can hardly be outdone. (E. A. F. )</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography and
                    Statistics.</hi></p>
                <p>The island of Sicily (Ital. <hi rend="italic">Sicilia)</hi> belongs to the
                    kingdom of Italy, being separated from the mainland only by the narrow (about 2
                    miles wide) but deep Straits of Messina. It is nearly bisected by the meridian
                    of 14° E., and by far the greater part lies to the south of 38° N. Its
                    southernmost point, however, in 36° 40' N. is 40' to the north of Point Tarifa,
                    the southernmost point of Spain and of the continent of Europe. In shape it is
                    triangular, whence the ancient poetical name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trinacria,</hi> referring to its three promontories of Pelorum (now Faro) in
                    the north-east, Pachynum (now Passaro) in the south-east, and Lilybaeum (now
                    Boeo) in the west. Its area, exclusive of the adjacent small islands belonging
                    to the <hi rend="italic">compartimento,</hi> is, according to the recent
                    planimetrical calculation of the Military Geographical Institute of Italy, 9860
                    square miles, —considerably less than one-third of that of Ireland; that of the
                    whole <hi rend="italic">compartimento</hi> is 9935 square miles.</p>
                <p>The island occupies that part of the Mediterranean in which the shallowing of the
                    waters divides that sea into two basins, and in which there are numerous
                    indications of frequent changes in a recent geological period. The channel
                    between Cape Bon in Tunis and the south-west of Sicily (a distance of 80 miles)
                    is, on the whole, shallower than the Straits of Messina, being for the most part
                    under 100 fathoms in depth, and exceeding 200 fathoms only for a very short
                    interval, while the Straits of Messina, which are at their narrowest part less
                    than 2 miles in width, have almost everywhere a depth exceeding 150 fathoms. The
                    geological structure in the neighbourhood of this strait shows that the island
                    must originally have been formed by a rupture between it and the mainland, but
                    that this rupture must have taken place at a period long antecedent to the
                    advent of man, so that the name Rhegium cannot be based even on the tradition of
                    any such catastrophe. The mountain range that runs out towards the north-east of
                    Sicily is composed of crystalline rocks precisely similar to those forming the
                    parallel range of Aspromonte in Calabria, but both of these are girt about by
                    sedimentary strata belonging in part to an early Tertiary epoch. That a
                    subsequent land connexion took place, however, by the elevation of the sea-bed
                    there is abundant evidence to show; and the occurrence of the remains of African
                    Quaternary mammals, such as <hi rend="italic">Elephas meridionalis, E. antiquus,
                    Hippopotamus pentlandi,</hi> as well as of those of still living African forms,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Elephas africanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hyaeena
                    crocuta,</hi> makes it probable that there was a direct post-Tertiary connexion
                    also with the African continent.</p>
                <p>The north coast is generally steep and cliffy and abundantly provided with good
                    harbours, of which that of Palermo is the finest. In the west and south the
                    coast is for the most part flat, more regular in outline, and less favourable to
                    shipping, while in the east, where the seabottom sinks rapidly down towards the
                    eastern basin of the Mediterranean, steep rocky coasts prevail except opposite
                    the plain of Catania. In the northern half of this coast the lava streams of
                    Mount Etna stand out for a distance of about 20 miles in a line of bold cliffs
                    and promontories. At various points on the east, north, and west coasts there
                    are evidences of a rise of the land having taken place within historical times,
                    at Trapani on the west coast even within the 19th century. As in the rest of the
                    Mediterranean, tides are scarcely observable; but at several points on the west
                    and south coasts a curious oscillation in the level of the waters, known to the
                    natives as the <hi rend="italic">marrobbio</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >marobia),</hi> is sometimes noticed, and is said to be always preceded by
                    certain atmospheric signs. This consists in a sudden rise of the sea-level,
                    occasionally to the height of 3 feet, sometimes occurring only once, sometimes
                    repeated at intervals of a minute for two hours, or even, at Mazzara, where it
                    is most frequently observed, for twenty-four hours together.</p>
                <p>The surface of Sicily lies for the most part more than 500 feet above the level
                    of the sea. Caltanissetta, which occupies the middle point in elevation as well
                    as in respect of geographical situation, stands 1900 feet above sea-level.
                    Considerable mountains occur only in the north, where the lower slopes of all
                    the heights form one continuous series of olive-yards and orangeries. Of the
                    rest of the island the greater part forms a plateau varying in elevation and
                    mostly covered with wheat-fields. The only plain of any great extent is that of
                    Catania, watered by the Simeto, in the east; to the north of this plain the
                    active volcano of <hi rend="smallcaps">Etna (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>)
                    rises with an exceedingly gentle slope to the height of 10,868 feet from a base
                    400 square miles in extent. This is the highest elevation of the island. The
                    steep and narrow crystalline ridge which trends north-eastwards, and is known to
                    geographers by the name of the Peloritan Mountains, does not reach 4000 feet.
                    The Nebrodian Mountains, a limestone range connected with the Peloritan range
                    and having an east and west trend, rise to a somewhat greater height, and
                    farther west, about the middle of the north coast, the Madonie (the only one of
                    the groups mentioned which has a native name) culminate at the height of nearly
                    6500 feet. From the western end of the Nebrodian Mountains a lower range<pb

                    on the whole south-eastwards in the direction of Cape Passaro. With the
                    exception of the Simeto, the principal perennial streams—the Salso, the Platani,
                    and the Belici—enter the sea on the south coast.</p>
                <p>Of the sedimentary rocks of Sicily none are earlier than the Secondary period,
                    and of the older Secondary rocks there are only comparatively small patches of
                    Triassic and Jurassic age—most abundant in the west but also occurring on the
                    flanks of the mountains in the north-east. Cretaceous rocks are very sparingly
                    represented (in the south-east), and by far the greater part of the island is
                    occupied by Tertiary (mainly Eocene and Miocene) limestones. The Nebrodian
                    Mountains are mainly composed of compact limestones of Oligocene date, but are
                    flanked by Eocene rocks including the nummulitic limestone. Quaternary deposits
                    border many of the bays, and the plain of Catania is wholly covered with recent
                    alluvium. Basalts and basaltic tufas border this plain on the south, as the
                    ancient and modern lavas of Etna do on the north.</p>
                <p>The climate of Sicily resembles that of the other lands in the extreme south of
                    Europe. As regards temperature, it has the warm and equable character which
                    belongs to most of the Mediterranean region. At Palermo (where continuous
                    observations have been made since 1791) the range of temperature between the
                    mean of the coldest and that of the hottest month is little greater than at
                    Greenwich. The mean temperature of January (51 ½ ° Fahr.) is nearly as high as
                    that of October in the south of England, that of July (77° Fahr.) about 13°
                    warmer than the corresponding month at Greenwich. During the whole period for
                    which observations have been made the thermometer has never been observed to
                    sink at Palermo below the freezing-point; still frost does occur in the island
                    even on the low grounds, though never for more than a few hours. On the coast
                    snow is seldom seen, but it does fall occasionally. On the Madonie it lies till
                    June, on Etna till July. The annual rainfall except on the higher mountains does
                    not reach 30 inches, and, as in other parts of the extreme south of Europe, it
                    occurs chiefly in the winter months, while the three summer months (June, July,
                    and August) are almost quite dry. During these months the whole rainfall does
                    not exceed 2 inches, except on the slopes of the mountains in the north-east.
                    Hence most of the streams dry up in summer. The chief scourge is the sirocco,
                    which is experienced in its most characteristic form on the north coast, as an
                    oppressive, parching, hot, dry wind, blowing strongly and steadily from the
                    south, the atmosphere remaining through the whole period of its duration
                    leaden-coloured and hazy in consequence of the presence of immense quantities of
                    reddish dust. It occurs most frequently in April, and then in May and September,
                    but no month is entirely free from it. Three days are the longest period for
                    which it lasts. The same name is sometimes applied to a moist and not very hot,
                    but yet oppressive, south-east wind which blows from time to time on the east
                    coast. Locally the salubrity of the climate is seriously affected by the
                    occurrence of malaria, regarding which important evidence was furnished to a
                    Government commission of inquiry by officials of the Sicilian railways. From
                    this it appears that the whole of the north-east coast from Catania to Messina
                    is perfectly free from malaria, and so also is the line on the north coast from
                    Palermo to Termini; and, singularly enough, while these parts of the low ground
                    are free, malarial regions are entered upon in certain places as soon as the
                    railway begins to ascend to higher levels. Such is the case with the line which
                    crosses the island from Termini to Girgenti; and on the line which ascends from
                    Catania to Castrogiovanni it is found that the stations become more and more
                    unhealthy as the line ascends to Leonforte, and at that station so unhealthy are
                    the nights that it is necessary to convey the employés by a special train every
                    evening to Castrogiovanni (at the height of more than 3000 feet), and to bring
                    them back by another train in the morning.</p>
                <p>The flora of Sicily is remarkable for its wealth of species; but, comparing
                    Sicily with other islands that have been long separated from the mainland, the
                    number of endemic species is not great. The orders most abundantly represented
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Compositae, Crueiferae, Labiatae,
                    Caryophyllaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scrophulariaceae.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosaceae</hi> are also abundantly represented, and among them are
                    numerous species of the rose. The general aspect of the vegetation of Sicily,
                    however, has been greatly affected, as in other parts of the Mediterranean, by
                    the introduction of plants within historical times. Being more densely populated
                    than any other large Mediterranean island, and having its population dependent
                    chiefly on the products of the soil, it is necessarily more extensively
                    cultivated than any other of the larger islands referred to, and many of the
                    objects of cultivation are not originally natives of the island. Not to mention
                    the olive, which must have been introduced at a remote period, all the members
                    of the orange tribe, the agave, and the prickly pear, as well as other plants
                    highly characteristic of Sicilian scenery, have been introduced since the
                    beginning of the Christian era. With respect to vegetation and cultivation three
                    zones may be distinguished. The first reaches to about 1600 feet above
                    sea-level, the upper limit of the members of the orange tribe; the second
                    ascends to about 3300 feet, the limit of the growth of wheat, the vine, and the
                    hardier evergreens; and the third, that of forests, reaches from about 3300 feet
                    upwards. But it is not merely height that determines the general character of
                    the vegetation. The cultivated trees of Sicily mostly demand such an amount of
                    moisture as can be obtained only on the mountain slopes, and it is worthy of
                    notice that the structure of the mountains is peculiarly favourable to the
                    supply of this want. The limestones of which they are mostly composed act like a
                    sponge, absorbing the rain-water through their innumerable pores and fissures,
                    and thus storing it up in the interior, afterwards to allow it to well forth in
                    springs at various elevations lower down. In this way the irrigation which is
                    absolutely indispensable for the members of the orange tribe during the dry
                    season is greatly facilitated, and even those trees for which irrigation is not
                    so indispensable receive a more ample supply of moisture during the rainy
                    season. Hence it is that, while the plain of Catania is almost treeless and
                    tree-cultivation is comparatively limited in the west and south, where the
                    extent of land under 1600 feet is considerable, the whole of the north and
                    north-east coast from the Bay of Castellamare round to Catania is an endless
                    succession of orchards, in which oranges, citrons, and lemons alternate with
                    olives, almonds, pomegranates, figs, carob trees, pistachios, mulberries, and
                    vines. Oranges are specially important as an export crop, and the value of this
                    product has enormously increased since steamers began to traverse the
                    Mediterranean. Olives are even more extensively cultivated, but more for home
                    consumption. The limit in height of the olive is about 2700 feet, and that of
                    the vine about 3500. A considerable silk production depends on the cultivation
                    of the mulberry in the neighbourhood of Messina and Catania. One of the most
                    striking features in the commerce of the island is the very large proportion of
                    southern fruits sent to the United States, whence petroleum is chiefly imported.
                    Among other trees and shrubs of importance may be mentioned the deep-rooted
                    sumach, which is adapted to the driest regions, the manna ash (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraxinus ornus</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the American <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opuntia vulgaris</hi> or prickly pear and the agave—the former of which yields
                    a favourite article of diet with the natives, and both of which thrive on the
                    driest soil—the date-palm, the plantain, various bamboos, cycads, and the
                    dwarf-palm, the last of which grows in some parts of Sicily more profusely than
                    anywhere else, and in the desolate region in the south-west yields almost the
                    only vegetable product of importance. The <hi rend="italic">Arundo Donax,</hi>
                    the tallest of European grasses, is largely grown for vine-stakes. The forests
                    on the higher slopes of the mountains are chiefly of oak, with which are
                    associated large numbers of the fruit-trees of central Europe, and on Etna and
                    the Madonie chestnuts.</p>
                <p>Outside of the tree region wheat is by far the most important product. At the
                    present day Sicily is still a rich granary, as it was in ancient times when
                    Greek colonies flourished in the south and east, and later under the supremacy
                    of Rome. In all three-fourths of the cultivated surface are estimated to be
                    covered with cereals, and it is the cultivation of wheat more particularly which
                    determines in most places the character of the Sicilian landscape throughout the
                    year. The <hi rend="italic">maquis,</hi> or thick-leaved stunted evergreens,
                    which on the other Mediterranean islands withstand this summer drought, have
                    been almost banished from Sicily by the extent of the wheat cultivation. Oats
                    and barley are also grown, but maize scarcely at all, for, being a summer crop,
                    it is almost entirely excluded from cultivation by the extreme drought of that
                    season. Beans form in spring the chief food of the entire population. Flax is
                    grown for its seed (linseed), and the <hi rend="italic">Crocus sativus</hi> for
                    the production of saffron. On the plain of Catania cotton is grown along with
                    wheat, and among other sub - tropical products sugar (probably introduced by the
                    Arabs about the 10th century) and tobacco are still of some importance; but the
                    cultivation of rice has greatly declined, in consequence of its tendency to
                    produce malaria.</p>
                <p>The native fauna of Sicily is similar to that of Southern Italy. Among domestic
                    animals mules and asses are very important as beasts of burden. At the
                    enumeration of 10th January 1876 mules numbered in Sicily 112,115 out of a total
                    of 293,868 belonging to the kingdom of Italy; the number of asses at the same
                    date was 82,702 out of a total of 674,246 in the kingdom. The horses, sheep, and
                    cattle are all of indifferent quality. Tunny and sardine fisheries are carried
                    on round the coasts.</p>
                <p>Manufacturing industry is little developed in the island, and besides agriculture
                    mining is the only important occupation of the people. The chief mineral is
                    sulphur, Sicilian sulphur being indeed the most valuable mineral product of
                    Italy. There are about 300 mines in operation in the provinces of Girgenti,
                    Caltanissetta, Catania, and Palermo, employing about 27,000 people. The sulphur
                    is found in a particular formation of the Upper Miocene, and is separated from
                    the ore by fusion in a primitive kind of furnace called <hi rend="italic"
                    >calcaroni,</hi> in most of which part of the sulphur is used as fuel. With the
                    exception of a small quantity, which is used in the island for the vineyards,
                    all the sulphur is exported, chiefly to England, France, Belgium, and the United
                    States, and the production goes on increasing, notwithstanding the lowering of
                    the price,<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n46/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0046-0031"/> due to the extraction of sulphur from iron
                    pyrites obtained elsewhere. Before 1860 the annual production did not exceed
                    150,000 tons, while in 1880 it exceeded 300,000 tons, and in 1884 almost reached
                    400,000 tons. It is estimated that at least 50,000,000 tons are still available
                    in the island. Besides sulphur, rock salt, the annual production of which is
                    about 3000 tons, is the only important mineral product of the island; but not
                    less than 170,000 tons of bay salt are made in the salt-pans of Trapani and
                    other parts of the west coast. The rock salt is principally excavated near
                    Racal-muto, Casteltermini, and Trabona.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">compartimento</hi> of Sicily is divided into seven

                <p>The areas here given are those of Strelbitsky for 1881, these giving a total
                    which agrees better than the old official figures with the total calculated by
                    the Military Geographical Institute, which has not yet made any calculations for
                    the individual provinces. The volcanic Lipari or Aeolian Islands to the north of
                    Sicily are included in the province of Messina; the island of Ustica to the
                    north-west in that of Palermo; the Aegadic group (Lat. <hi rend="italic">Insulae
                    Aegates</hi>), consisting of a number of limestone islands in the west, in that
                    of Trapani, from which the nearest is separated by a channel not more than nine
                    fathoms in depth; and to the same province belongs also Pantelleria, midway
                    between Sicily and Africa.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of the island, due chiefly to the stimulation of the cultivation
                    of southern fruits by the extension of commerce in recent years, is shown by the
                    fact that since 1861 the population has increased more rapidly than that of any
                    other part of the kingdom. In 1861 the total population was 2,392,414, and in
                    1871 2,584,099. Thus the annual rate of increase was 7∙74 per thousand as
                    against 6∙91 for the whole kingdom; while between 1871 and 1881 the annual
                    increase was at the rate of 12∙62 per thousand for Sicily as against 6∙02 for
                    the whole kingdom. The number of emigrants is small. In 1882 the number of
                    emigrants proper (those who declared their intention of remaining out of the
                    country for more than one year) was 2261 out of 65,748 for the whole kingdom,
                    that of the temporary emigrants 954 as compared with 95,814.</p>
                <p>The population, which in consequence of the chequered history of the island is
                    necessarily a very mixed one, is said to be on the whole well disposed and
                    industrious. The lawlessness indicated by the continued existence of the secret
                    society called the <hi rend="italic">Mafia,</hi> which, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Camorra</hi> of the Neapolitan provinces of the main land,
                    overrides the law in taking vengeance on those who have rendered themselves
                    obnoxious to it, is a relic of former misrule, and is diminishing under the
                    present Government. The condition of the peasantry still shows some of the
                    injurious results of Spanish rule, under which the feudal system was introduced
                    in its worst form. The nobles, who then acquired large landed properties,
                    collected their serfs or retainers round their own castles, so that a number of
                    considerable towns grew up, and the country districts were to a large extent
                    deserted. The cultivators of the soil had often to walk 10 or 12 miles from
                    their homes to their fields. It is chiefly from this cause that even at the
                    present day the people of the island are mainly congregated in towns containing
                    not less than 5000 inhabitants each. The three principal towns of Sicily and the
                    chief seats of its foreign commerce are Palermo (population, with suburbs,
                    244,991 in 1881), Catania (100,417), and Messina (81,049), and the next in size
                    are Marsala (40,251), Acireale (38,547), Trapani (38,231; the headquarters of
                    the coral-fishers of Italy), Caltanissetta (25,027), Syracuse (23,507), Sciacca
                    (22,195), Girgenti (20,008; the centre of the trade in sulphur), Castrogiovanni
                    (18,981), Licata (17,565), Terranova (17,173).</p>
                <p>The backward state of education is another consequence of former misrule. In 1881
                    61∙59 per cent of the inhabitants above twelve years of age were still unable to
                    read and write (<hi rend="italic">analfabeti</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and
                    in 1880-81 the number of pupils in the elementary public schools was only
                    101,724, or nearly 1 in 29 of the whole population, as against about 1 in 15 for
                    the whole kingdom. Here, however, as in other parts of Italy, improvement is
                    going on in this respect, for the percentage of the people of Sicily above
                    twelve years old unable to read and write was 67∙59 in 1871 and 73∙12 in
                    1861.</p>
                <p>The system of roads and railways is still defective. One line of railway proceeds
                    along the east coast from Messina to Syracuse, and a branch ascends from it to
                    join one of the lines which cross the middle of the island from north to south.
                    Of these there are two,—one from Licata and one from Porto Empedocle, both on
                    the south coast; these lines meet before touching the north coast a little to
                    the east of Termini; thence the railway proceeds along the north coast to
                    Palermo and Castellamare, whence it recrosses the island again to Mazzara, and
                    afterwards follows the west coast northwards to Trapani. A project is now (1886)
                    entertained for the connexion of the railways of Sicily with those of the
                    mainland by a tunnel under the Straits of Messina.</p>
