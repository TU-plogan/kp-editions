                    distributed, it is very numerous in some districts. It is about the size of a
                    Thrush, and, though at a distance it appears to be black, when near at hand its
                    plumage is seen to be brightly shot with purple, green, and steel-blue, most of
                    the feathers when freshly grown being tipped with buff. These markings wear off
                    in the course of the winter, and in the breeding-season the bird is almost
                    spotless. It is the <hi rend="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</hi> of

                    the limits here allotted is impossible. A more engaging bird scarcely exists,
                    for its familiarity during some months of the year gives opportunities for
                    observing its ways that few others afford, while its varied song, its sprightly
                    gestures, its glossy plumage, and, above all, its character as an
                    insecticide—which last makes it the friend of the agriculturist and the
                    grazier—render it an almost universal favourite. The worst that can be said of
                    it is that it occasionally pilfers fruit, and, as it flocks to roost in autumn
                    and winter among reed-beds, does considerable damage by breaking down the
                    stems.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A most ridiculous
                    and unfounded charge has been, however, more than once brought against it—that
                    of destroying the eggs of Skylarks. There is little real evidence of its sucking
                    eggs, and much of its not doing so; while, to render the allegation still more
                    absurd, it has been brought by a class of farmers who generally complain that
                    Skylarks themselves are highly injurious.</p></note> The congregations of
                    Starlings are indeed very marvellous, and no less than the aerial evolutions of
                    the flocks, chiefly before settling for the night, have attracted attention from
                    early times, being mentioned by Pliny (<hi rend="italic">Hist. Naturalis,</hi>
                    x. 24) in the 1st century. The extraordinary precision with which the crowd,
                    often numbering several hundreds, not to say thousands, of birds, wheels,
                    closes, opens out, rises, and descends, as if the whole body were a single
                    living thing— all these movements being executed without a note or cry being
                    uttered—must be seen to be appreciated, and may be seen repeatedly with
                    pleasure. For a resident, the Starling is rather a late breeder. The nest is
                    commonly placed in the hole of a tree or of a building, and its preparation is
                    the work of some little time. The eggs, from 4 to 7 in number, are of a very
                    pale blue, often tinged with green. As the young grow they become very noisy,
                    and their parents, in their assiduous attendance, hardly less so, thus
                    occasionally making themselves disagreeable in a quiet neighbourhood. The
                    Starling has a wide range over Europe and Asia, reaching India; but examples
                    from Kashmir, Persia, and Armenia have been considered worthy of specific
                    distinction, and the resident Starling of the countries bordering the
                    Mediterranean is generally regarded as a good species, and called <hi

                    unfrequent visitor to the British Islands. It is a bird of most irregular and
                    erratic habits—a vast horde suddenly arriving at some place to which it may have
                    hitherto been a stranger, and at once making a settlement there, leaving it
                    wholly deserted as soon as the young are reared. This happened in the summer of
                    1875 at Villafranca, in the province of Verona, the castle of which was occupied
                    in a single day by some 12,000 or 14,000 birds of this species, as has been
                    graphically told by Sig. de Betta <hi rend="italic">(Atti del R. Ist.
                    Veneto,</hi> ser. 5, vol. ii.);<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    instances have been before recorded,—as in Bulgaria in 1867, near Smyrna in
                    1856, and near Odessa in 1844, to mention only some of which particulars have
                    been published.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    remarkable that on almost all of these occasions the locality pitched upon has
                    been, either at the time or soon after, ravaged by locusts, which the birds
                    greedily devour. Another fact worthy of attention is that they are often
                    observed to affect trees or shrubs bearing rose-coloured flowers, as <hi

                    among the blossoms of which they themselves may easily escape notice, for their
                    plumage is rose-pink and black shot with blue.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps"
