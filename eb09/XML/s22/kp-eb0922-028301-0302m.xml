                <p><label type="entry">SOUTH AUSTRALIA</label>, which lies between 129° and 141° E.
                    long., has New South Wales and Victoria on the E., Western Australia on the W.,
                    and the Southern Ocean on the S. Originally its northern line was 26° S. lat.,
                    but by the addition of the Northern Territory, or Alexandra Land, the area has
                    been extended from 380,070 square miles to 903,690, and the northern border
                    carried to the Indian Ocean. The length is therefore from lat. 38° S. to 11° S.,
                    nearly 2000 miles. Being much more northern and less southern than the
                    neighbouring colony, its present designation is incorrect in point of fact.</p>
                <p>The southern coast-line shows two large gulfs, Spencer and St Vincent,—the first
                    180 miles long, the other 100. Spencer Gulf is open to the ocean, while St
                    Vincent Gulf is partly shielded by Kangaroo Island, with Investigator Straits as
                    its westerly entrance and Backstairs Passage for an easterly one. Yorke
                    Peninsula separates the two gulfs. Port Lincoln and Sleaford Bay are at the
                    south-west of Spencer Gulf. On the western side of Eyria Peninsula— the land
                    westward of Spencer Gulf—are the following bays :—Coffin, Anxious, Venus,
                    Streaky, Denial, and Fowler. The junction of South and Western Australia is on
                    the Australian Bight. Encounter Bay is on the Victorian side, with Lacepede,
                    Guichen, Rivoli, and Macdonnell Bays to the south-east. Flinders, Investigator,
                    and Nuyt Islands are south-west. Cape Jervis is at the eastern entrance of St
                    Vincent Gulf, Spencer at the western. In Northern Territory are Melville, Adam,
                    Arnhem, and Raffles Bays, Van Diemen’s Gulf, Port Essington, and Port Darwin
                    (lat. 12° S.). The Gulf of Carpentaria divides the territory from Cape York
                    Peninsula of Queensland. Melville, Bathurst, and Groote-Eylandt are northern
                    islands. The ranges of hills are few, rarely reaching 3000 feet. One chain runs
                    north from Cape Jervis. Flinders range has Brown and Arden, 3000 feet. Lofty,<pb

                    Gambier and Schanck, are south-east, near Victoria. In general the country is
                    level, where not slightly undulating. It is far from being well watered,
                    especially to the westward and in the interior. The Murray, passing through Lake
                    Victoria, had previously received most of the drainage of the three eastern
                    colonies. The Torrens flows by Adelaide. Few streams reach the ocean. Cooper’s
                    Creek drains part of Western Queensland. The Indian seas receive the Alligator,
                    Liverpool, Roper, Macarthur, Daly and Victoria rivers. Albert and the Coorong
                    are lakes at the Murray mouth. The depressed area northward contains Lakes
                    Torrens, Eyre, Gairdner, Blanche, Hope, and Amadeus. The overland telegraph to
                    Port Darwin passes mostly through an ill-watered country, with oases around
                    springs. The population, 330,000, is principally within 100 miles of Adelaide,
                    the capital, in lat. 35° S. The leading places north of Adelaide are Gawler, 25
                    miles, Barossa 38, Kapunda 49, Angaston 51, Port Wakefield 60, Clare 90,
                    Kooringa of Burra Burra 100, Moonta 100 north-west, Kadina 96 north-west, Blyth
                    100, Morgan or North-West Bend 105, Broughton 150, St Petersburg 154, Port Pirie
                    155 north-west, Port Augusta 240 northwest, Colton 320, Blinman 350. To the east
                    are Barker 21, Echunga 23, Nairne 25, Kingston or Port Caroline 170 south-east,
                    Narracoorte 220, Penola 250, Gambier 290, Macdonnell 304. Lincoln is 210 west.
                    Adelaide Port is 7, Glenelg 7, Brighton 10, Willunga 30 south; Goolwa, the
                    Murray port, is 60 south. Palmerston of Port Darwin is the chief town of
                    Northern Territory; Southport is 25 miles south of it. Other settlements are
                    inland mining townships. There are 36 counties, 4 pastoral districts, 23
                    municipalities, and 112 district councils in South Australia proper.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Excepting Western Australia, this is the driest
                    portion of the island continent. The rain clouds from the Pacific or the Indian
                    Ocean have little store left on reaching the South Australian districts. The
                    north-west summer monsoons favour the northern coast-lands, though the rains
                    penetrate but few miles inland. The trade-winds bring only dry blasts from the
                    Queensland side. A large proportion of the south-western shore has a very
                    partial deposition, and even the southern Yorke Peninsula, laved by two great
                    gulfs, seldom shows any surface water. The conflict between the polar and
                    equatorial currents occasionally throws down rain in the interior, though many a
                    thunderstorm fails to let fall more than a few drops. But the south-eastern
                    coast catches a fair amount of rain from the western breezes off the Southern
                    Ocean. The settled districts have winter rains, when Adelaide plains are
                    transformed from parched sterility to luxuriant vegetation. The average annual
                    rainfall there is but 20 inches, with an evaporation of three times that amount.
                    In 1885 (a dry year) Adelaide had only 16 inches. In some years only 5 inches
                    have fallen, even on parts of the sea-shore. The interior, however, has been
                    known to have extensive floods after sudden storms. The northern coast, as at
                    Port Darwin, has from 50 to 70 inches, though for several months without a
                    shower. The heat is considerable during the dry summer time, though cold is felt
                    severely on winter mornings and nights, even in the tropics, when a dozen
                    degrees of frost may be followed in a few hours by a temperature of 80° or
                    90°.</p>
                <p>The health conditions of the colony are but little inferior, except in Adelaide
                    and Port Darwin, to those ruling in Tasmania and New Zealand, which are so much
                    cooler and wetter. Dry heat is never so prejudicial as a moist heat. A raging
                    hot wind from the north and north-west, to which Adelaide is so unpleasantly
                    exposed, is trying to young children, though it never brings noxious gases. On
                    the contrary, when passing over eucalyptus forests it brings down health-giving
                    airs, in spite of 160° in the sun, or even 120° in the shade. Diarrhoea may
                    trouble in summer, and catarrh in winter; but, with a birth-rate of 39 in the
                    thousand and a death-rate of from 12 to 17, South Australia stands more
                    favourably than England in relation to health. Recently, several townships had
                    for the year but seven deaths in the thousand, exhibiting a freedom from
                    mortality three times greater than London. The death-rate of the colony during
                    1885 was only 12·48 to the thousand, while the birth-rate· was 37·70. One-third
                    of the deaths were in Adelaide. Reports from the tropical Northern Territory
                    speak of fever and ague, especially among imprudent gold-miners.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The few mountain ranges scattered throughout the
                    colony were once, in all probability, but islands rising in a mediterranean sea
                    that connected the Indian Ocean and Java Sea with the Southern Ocean. Over at
                    least the southern half of South Australian territory the water flowed in
                    Tertiary times. The climatic effect of such an archipelago of islands must have
                    been very different from what now is realized in that region. The rise of the
                    country displayed that vast extent of arenaceous limestone forming the southern
                    coast floor, and extending westward hundreds of miles in Western Australia, and
                    far eastward in Victoria. The south coast is still rising. The Murray cuts its
                    channel through this vast coralline formation. According to the Rev. J. Tenison
                    Woods, the newer Pliocene is near Adelaide, while the older is at Mount Gambier.
                    The Murray cliffs are Upper Miocene, and the Murray flats are Lower Miocene. He
                    finds little or none of Eocene. Flint bands occur in this limestone,
                    particularly at Gambier. The Biscuit country, south-east, has flat limestone
                    concretionary cakes on the surface, more or less rounded. Beds of sand cover
                    large areas of the recent rock. Caves abound in the Gambier district, provided
                    with stalactites and stalagmites. Subterranean rivers flow through some of the
                    caverns, and are occasionally reached by natural sloping wells. Gambier exhibits
                    much Bryozoan limestone. Its 40 species and 16 genera of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyzoa</hi> are in Lower Crag. The coral limestone there has extensive flint
                    bands. <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> are of many kinds; some of the
                    Rhizopods are still existing in Australian waters. Sharks’ teeth and large
                    nautili are frequently met with. Most fossils are in casts, except <hi
                    rend="italic">Pecten, Bryozoa, Echini,</hi> &amp;c. The Murray cliffs mark the
                    remains of an extensive formation, since largely denuded. The Gambier deposits
                    prove the presence of an ancient deep sea, when little of Australia, as we now
                    perceive it, had any existence. The South Australian ranges are generally of
                    Primary order, the Silurian formation being often pierced or flooded by igneous
                    rocks, which have transmuted the strata. While granites and granitoids are in
                    great masses, the basalts and greenstones of a later age are not wanting in the
                    ranges. The Primary rocks are observed, also, in Eyria Peninsula, Port Lincoln,
                    the central continental districts, aud very prominently in the Northern
                    Territory. Flat-topped sandstone hills prevail northward. Westward and
                    south-eastward the Tertiary rests on a granite floor. Eastward there is the same
                    Primary presence, with crystalline mountains developing silver mines just over
                    the border. Metamorphic rocks, rising amidst Tertiary beds, are strong in Yorke
                    Peninsula, producing much copper. The tablelands are of horizontal sandstone,
                    often on spiriferous limestone. Desert sandstone may be Miocene. Near the
                    Victorian boundary, in the south-east corner of South Australia, recent volcanic
                    action is apparent. Several of the lakes there were once craters. The deep Blue
                    Lake, or Devil’s Inkstand, occupies the centre of Mount Gambier. The banks are
                    nearly 300 feet high, and are formed of lavas and volcanic ashes. Cinder walls
                    are detected, and other varieties of volcanic products. Several smaller cones
                    surround the great mount. The country itself is of the usual Tertiary limestone,
                    more or less covered with ashes. Mount Schanck, between Gambier and the sea, is
                    known as the Devil’s Punchbowl. This cone of lava has an empty crater 200 feet
                    deep. Gambier and Schanck are landmarks to passing mariners. Among the fossil
                    forms in Tertiary Pliocene strata are those of the huge <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diprotodon,</hi> a marsupial vegetable feeder 16 feet in height, with gigantic
                    kangaroos, emus, wombats, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> South Australia, though without coal, was the
                    first Australian colony to have a metallic mine, and the first to possess a gold
                    mine. In 1841 the wheel of a dray, going over a hill near Adelaide, disclosed to
                    view silver-lead ore. In the midst of the bad times in 1843 the Kapunda copper
                    mine was found. In 1845 the wonderful Burra Burra copper was first wrought. The
                    land, 10,000 acres, cost £10,000; and for several years the dividends to
                    shareholders were 800 per cent. per annum. The first colonial mineral export was
                    30 tons of lead ore, value £128, in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n304/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0304-0285"/> 1843. The copper declined as prices fell. It was
                    £322,983 in 1885, when rates were £50 a ton, but £762,386 ten years before with
                    over £90. In 1886 most of the mines were closed. Between 250 and 400 miles north
                    of Adelaide a very rich copper district exists. Lead is very abundant.
                    Manganese, nickel, bismuth, antimony, and silver have been mined. Tin is seen in
                    granitic places. Iron occurs in almost all formations and in all conditions.
                    There is abundance of haematite, micaceous, bog, and other ores rich in the
                    metal. Talisker and other mines paid in silver. The wonderful Silverton, of
                    Barrier Ranges, in a desert, is just outside the boundary, though 300 miles only
                    from Adelaide while 600 from Sydney. Gold was got from a quartz vein at the
                    Victoria mine, near Adelaide, as early as 1846, but did not pay the company.
                    Partial gold working has been conducted at Echunga, &amp;c., in southern hills.
                    There are rich alluvial and quartz gold mines in Northern Territory, at from 100
                    to 150 miles south of Port Darwin. For the year 1884 the yield was £77,935. Of
                    1349 miners 1205 were Chinese. Gold is now worked at Waukaringa, 225 miles north
                    of Adelaide. Copper, tin, and silver are found in Northern Territory. Among
                    other minerals asbestos, roofing slates, and fine marbles may be named. Some
                    forty years ago precious stones, especially garnets and sapphires, were gathered
                    in the Barossa Hills. Carbonaceous material is found at the Coorong, &amp;c.,
                    yielding 50 per cent. of oil. Lake Eyre has a rude coal. Kapunda marble quarry
                    is a success. In 1885 there were 16,493 acres leased for minerals. The value of
                    minerals exported in 1885 was £338,132.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> This is essentially an agricultural colony.
                    In its first establishment, farming was intended as the main occupation. The
                    land was cut up for sale into eighty-acre lots with the view of settling the
                    people on arrival, and concentrating them, instead of having them scattered as
                    in the neighbouring colonies, in which pastoral pursuits completely dwarfed the
                    farming industry. This wise provision made the colony for years the supplier of
                    breadstuffs to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Auckland. As neighbours
                    became wheat-producers, Adelaide merchants had to seek markets in Natal,
                    Mauritius, the Cape, or even Europe. At all times the state has lent every
                    assistance to agriculture. As the colony suffers more from drought than anything
                    else, public reservoirs are constructed and artesian wells are sunk. Forest
                    culture has especially attracted Government attention. Reforesting and the
                    establishment of nurseries for the trees, fruits, and vegetables of other lands
                    go hand in hand. Forest reserves already amount to 150,000 acres. Hundreds of
                    thousands of trees are annually planted.</p>
                <p>The land system, sound at the beginning, has been repeatedly amended, especially
                    with a view to the advancement of pastoral interests. Instead of cash sales, as
                    formerly, conditional purchases may be made, extending over a long period,
                    subject to conditions of residence and cultivation. At the end of 1884 only ten
                    million acres had been purchased. There were, however, 53,000,000 acres
                    enclosed, chiefly for pasturage, and 2,785,490 under cultivation. The crop for
                    March 1885 was as follows:—wheat, 1,942,653 acres; fallow, 450,536; hay,
                    308,429; artificial grasses, 23,217; barley, 15,697; lucerne, 8649; oats, 7264;
                    orchard, 5825; potatoes, 5666; pease, 4601; vineyard, 4590. The culture
                    indicates a warm and dry climate, different from New Zealand or the tropical
                    coast of Queensland. The product of South Australian fields is so much smaller
                    per acre than in any of the neighbouring colonies that only an open level
                    country of cheap land, with effective machinery at moderate cost, could be
                    managed at a profit. Going northward from Adelaide the country becomes too dry
                    for roots, and then too precarious even for wheat. The county of Adelaide is
                    very favourably placed for vineyards, oliveyards, and orchards. About half the
                    olive trees and a third of the almond trees are there. Of 3,704,107 grape vines
                    in the colony, Adelaide county had 2,158,468, and Light, in the neighbouring
                    hills, had 860,356. There were in 1884 473,535 gallons of wine made. The
                    commissioners lately reported that the light white wines kept sound and good,
                    while full-bodied red wines continue to improve with age. The Water Conservation
                    Department is of great service to agriculture. Tropical cultivation receives
                    some attention already in Northern Territory. The Chinese raise rice crops,
                    there being heavy rains near the coast. Daly river has excellent soil and
                    climate for sugar and coffee.</p>
                <p>The pastoral progress has been considerable, notwithstanding want of moisture. In
                    1885 there were 1528 leases over 214,916 square miles, besides 257 annual leases
                    with 11,214 square miles. There were then 168,420 horses, 389,726 cattle,
                    163,807 pigs, 6,696,406 sheep (twenty sheep per head of population). Of these
                    the settled counties had 151,058 horses, 179,206 cattle, and 4,995,394 sheep. In
                    Northern Territory, with 136,000 cattle, there were in December 1885 6000 horses
                    and 40,000 sheep, that country, excepting in the dry interior, being unfitted
                    for wool-bearers. The total export of wool grown in South Australia had only the
                    value of £1,671,775 in 1885. The prices obtained were a fourth less than ten
                    years before. The rabbit pest is felt as seriously in pastoral as in
                    agricultural operations. Kangaroos are far less troublesome to stockholders than
                    in Queensland. Where water can be procured by dams, reservoirs, or wells stock
                    can be kept, since, where the grass fails, cotton bush and various saline plants
                    supply sufficient food. An artesian well lately was sunk 1220 feet. Wool is
                    remarkably fine there. While a South Australia merino has 2720 serrations to an
                    inch of wool, a Leicester sheep has but 1850.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> South Australia is not separated from the
                    neighbouring colonies by any natural boundaries; hence the fauna includes many
                    animals which are also to be found in the land lying to the east and west. The
                    northern half of the colony lies within the tropics, and possesses a tropical
                    fauna, which is, however, practically identical with that of northern
                    Queensland. In spite of its immense extent north and south, and a corresponding
                    diversity in climate, the colony is poorer in animal life than its neighbours.
                    It possesses thirty-five genera of mammals. These include both genera of the
                    order <hi rend="italic">Monotremata,—</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Echidna,</hi>
                    or spiny anteater, and the <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus,</hi> or
                    duck-billed platypus, both of which are found also in eastern Australia and
                    Tasmania. The other order of <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> associated with
                    Australia, the <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia,</hi> is well represented in South
                    Australia. It contains seven genera of <hi rend="italic">Macropodidae</hi> or
                    kangaroos, including the wallaby and kangaroo rat, four genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phalangistidae,</hi> or opossums, and five species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dasyuridae,</hi> or “native cats.” Two genera of this family are
                    peculiar to the region—the <hi rend="italic">Chaetocercus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antichinomys</hi>; the latter is found in the interior. It is a
                    mouse-like animal with large ears, and is remarkable for the elongation of its
                    fore-arm and hind-foot and for the complete absence of the hallux. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Phascolomys,</hi> or wombat, one of the largest of the marsupials,
                    is also found in South Australia, and the curious <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrmecobius,</hi> or anteater of Western Australia. This remarkable animal is
                    about the size of a squirrel; it possesses fifty-two teeth (a greater number
                    than any known quadruped), and, unlike the other members of its order, the
                    female has no pouch, the young hanging from nipples concealed amongst the hair
                    of her abdomen. The C <hi rend="italic">haeropus,</hi> with peculiarly slender
                    limbs and a pouch opening backwards, is found in the interior. The remaining <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> consist of the dingo, or native dog, and a few
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Muridae,</hi> the mouse family, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cheiroptera,</hi> or bats. There are about 700 species of birds,
                    including 60 species of parrots. Of the 9 families peculiar to the Australian
                    region, 5 are well represented, including the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meliphagidae</hi> (honey-suckers), <hi rend="italic">Cacatuidae</hi>
                    (cockatoos), <hi rend="italic">Platycercidae</hi> (broad-tailed and grass
                    parroquets), <hi rend="italic">Megapodidae</hi> (mound-makers<note

                    The last-named family is represented by the <hi rend="italic">Dromaeus,</hi> or
                    emu, which is hunted in some parts of the colony. Reptiles are fairly
                    represented: there are fifteen species of poisonous snakes. The lizards are very
                    peculiar; South and Western Australia contain twelve peculiar genera. No tailed
                    <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> exist in the continent, but frogs and toads are
                    plentiful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> The plant species resemble those of the eastern
                    colonies and Western Australia, but are more limited in variety. The colony,
                    from its dryness, lacks a number known elsewhere. Enormous areas are almost
                    destitute of forests or of timber trees. The <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi>
                    family, so valuable for timber and gum as well as for sanitary reasons, are
                    fairly represented. Acacias are abundant, the bark of some being an article of
                    commerce. Flinders range has much of the valuable sugar-gum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus Corynocalyx,</hi> which is being now preserved in forest reserves.
                    Its timber is very hard and strong, not warping, resisting damp and ants. The
                    head-flowered stringybark, <hi rend="italic">Eux. capitellata,</hi> has a
                    persistent bark. A sort of stringybark, <hi rend="italic">Euc. tetrodonta,</hi>
                    is found in Northern Territory. The gouty-stem tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Adansonia)</hi> or monkey-bread of the north is a sort of baobab. About 500
                    northern plants are Indian. The <hi rend="italic">Tamarindus indica</hi> occurs
                    in Arnhem land, with native rice, rattans, and wild nutmeg. The cedar is of the
                    Indian variety. Pines are numerous in the south, palms in the north; among the
                    most beautiful is the <hi rend="italic">Kentia acuminata.</hi> Banksias are very
                    common in sandy districts. Flowering shrubs are common in the south. There are
                    130 known grasses in Northern Territory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fisheries.—</hi> Whaling was formerly an important industry
                    about Encounter Bay, as sealing was in Kangaroo Island. The whales have
                    migrated, and the seals are exterminated. On the northern side trepang or
                    bêche-de-mer fishery has commenced, and pearl fisheries have been established.
                    Of fish within colonial waters there are forty-two peculiar genera. The tropical
                    north has similar fish to those of North Queensland, while those of southern
                    bays resemble many of the species of Victoria, Tasmania, and New South Wales.
                    There are the barracouta, bonito, bream, carp, catfish, rock cod and Murray cod,
                    conger, crayfish, cuttle, dogfish, eel, flatfish, flathead, flounder,
                    flying-fish, gadfish, grayling, gurnard, hake, John Dory, ray, salmon
                    (so-called), schnapper, seahorse, shark, sole, squid, swordfish, whiting,
                    &amp;c. Though called by English names, the fish do not always correspond to
                    those in Europe. The Murray cod is a noble freshwater fish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> There is little speculative trade, the shipping
                    being employed in the conveyance of the exports of the colony amt the
                    introduction of needful supplies. The imports during 1884 amounted to

                    £6,623,704, there went to the United Kingdom £4,081,864; New South Wales,
                    £773,240; Victoria, £651,019; Queensland, £255,746; Cape Colony, £249,844;

                    Mauritius, £52,010; Belgium, £33,092. Among the exports during 1884 were wool,
                    £2,616,626; wheat, £1,694,005; Hour, £794,812; copper, £469,231; sheepskins,

                    tallow, £28,403; wine, £17,061; gold, £15,469. There were imported overland
                    411,307 sheep, and exported 168,770. Of shipping, there entered 1120 vessels of
                    909,335 tons, and cleared 1111 of 925,197. The British amounts were 768,301 and
                    783,121 tons respectively. In the Northern Territory the imports were £140,229,
                    exports £90,411; the gold export for the last six months of 1885 was £33,869.
                    The assets of the eleven banks at the close of 1885 were £13,380,716,—total
                    deposits £5,880,950. The Government savings banks, on June 30, 1885, had 53,164
                    depositors, with £1,571,283 as balances—five per cent. interest being
                    allowed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Increased attention has been lately
                    directed to local industries, and a more protective tariff has been enforced
                    with a view to their development. The official returns for March 31, 1886, gave
                    640 works, employing 7952 men and 1350 women.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication. —</hi> The district councils have charge of many
                    of the roads. The general dryness of the country is favourable to the condition
                    of roads. Railways have been constructed for the conveyance of farming produce
                    to market, the carriage of minerals to port, and the tapping of the Murray river
                    traffic from the east. At the beginning of 1886 there were 1211 miles of railway
                    open, and 570 in course of construction. The working expenses during 1885 came
                    to £386,000, and the revenue to £556,000. There are several tramways,
                    supplementing railway traffic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water-Supply. —</hi> The Government is aiding the railway
                    movement for opening out the interior by the construction of waterworks and
                    public reservoirs. To supply Adelaide, independently of the Torrens river, there
                    has been an expenditure of £866,942. Kapunda has a reservoir of 41,200,000
                    gallons; Port Pirie of 25,700,000; Mount Barker of 6,000,000; Port Augusta of
                    666,000; Mount Gambier and Gawler each of 279,000. There are large storage tanks
                    at many places, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> for 810,000 gallons at Moonta.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The governor is the representative of the
                    crown. The legislative council, of twenty-four members, one third retiring every
                    three years, is chosen by 32,000 electors. The house of assembly, of fifty-two
                    members, is appointed for three years by 60,000 electors. Responsible government
                    dates from 1856. The public debt, contracted for useful public works, was
                    £18,000,000 in 1886. For the year 1884-85 the revenue was £2,157,931, but
                    expenditure was £2,430,513. A revision of the tariff was necessary. Customs
                    yielded £511,230; railways, £662,455, against working expenses £411,850; land
                    sales, £333,369; land rents, £132,013; waterworks, £72,366. The expenditure
                    included £311,189 for public works, besides loans; police, £102,784; civil
                    establishments, £73,828; legal, £50,051; charitable institutions, £86,968 (there
                    being no poor law); military defences, £39,473; immigration, £31,129, &amp;c.
                    The Northern Territory gave £71,518 as receipts to the state, but with £85,000
                    charges. The revenue for 1885-86 was £2,279,039, and the expenditure £2,383,290.
                    No Australasian colony has done so much for the good of the aborigines and the
                    advance of good morals as South Australia. The administration is just and firm,
                    being well sustained by public sentiment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Not being so wealthy as its eastern
                    neighbours, the colony has not been able to devote so large an amount to
                    schools; still, a grant of £126,000 was made during 1884-85 towards the
                    instruction of 50,000 pupils. Of 450 schools, half are called public, half
                    provisional for thinly-peopled districts. Payment from scholars is not dispensed
                    with as in Victoria. Lands are being set apart as educational grants for the
                    future. All religious denominations are equal in the sight of the law, none
                    receiving any state aid. Bible reading is sanctioned before school hours, and
                    any religious lessons may be given at the close of school time. The Adelaide
                    university, so richly endowed by the colonists, receives an annual grant of
                    £2550 from the local parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> Including the Northern Territory, the
                    population was returned in 1881 as 279,865 (149,530 males, 130,335 females), in
                    addition to 6346 aborigines (3478 males, 2868 females). The births during 1885
                    were 12,046, and the deaths 3987 (2205 males and 1782 females). Classed at the
                    last census according to religion, the population may be thus stated :—Church of
                    England, 76,000; Roman Catholic, 42,920; Wesleyans, 42,103; Lutherans, 19,617;
                    Presbyterians, 17,917; Baptists, 14,000; Bible Christians, 10,500; Primitive
                    Methodists, 10,350; Congregationalists, 9908. The population in the Northern
                    Territory, 3500, contains only about a hundred females, but has 3000 Chinamen.
                    More than half the people of South Australia, whether of English or German
                    parentage, are native-born. In 1886 the population was 325,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Though the coast of Northern Territory was well
                    known to Portuguese and Spanish navigators as early as perhaps 1530, being
                    called Great Java, it was not surveyed till 1644, when Tasman laid down the line
                    of shore pretty accurately. The western part of the southern coast had been seen
                    and named Nuyt’s Land in 1627. But Flinders, by his discovery of the two great
                    gulfs, Kangaroo Island, and Encounter Bay, in 1802, was the first to reveal
                    South Australia proper. Captain Sturt descended the Murray in 1830, and looked
                    over the hills near Adelaide. The first to direct attention to a settlement
                    there was Major Baron, who communicated with the colonial office in February
                    1831. His suggestion was to establish, at no charge to the British Government, a
                    private company, that should settle a party on Yorke Peninsula. He believed a
                    large river entered Spencer Gulf. In August Colonel Torrens and others proposed
                    to purchase land between 132° and 141°—500,000 acres at 5s. an acre. Some were
                    in favour of Spencer Gulf, others of Kangaroo Island, and a few for the mainland
                    towards the Murray. Memorialists in 1832 sought a charter for the South
                    Australian Association, giving extensive powers of self-government. Land sales
                    were to pay the passages of free labour, chiefly young married people, and no
                    convicts were ever to be sent thither. Lord Goderich did not favour the scheme,
                    and thought a colony with free institutions might prejudice the interests of New
                    South Wales, while free trade would interfere with the English navigation laws.
                    After mucin negotiation, the English authorities regarded the scheme more
                    favourably, but would not consent to give the company the powers they sought.
                    The company receded in their demands, and offered <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    security for the proper observance of law and order, while depositing cash for
                    the purchase of land. Captain Sturt in 1834 informed the colonial secretary that
                    Spencer Gulf and Kangaroo Island were objectionable, but that the eastern side
                    of St Vincent Gulf was the best locality. In 1835 the ministry got an Act passed
                    for the erection of a colony, under commissioners appointed by the crown, who
                    would be responsible for their acts to the British Government. It was arranged
                    that a local government should be established when the settlement had 50,000
                    people. Mr George Fife Angas advanced a large sum as security to the state.
                    Though the first settlers were sent to Kangaroo Island, all were afterwards
                    gathered on the Adelaide plains. The colony was proclaimed under a gum tree,
                    December 28, 1836. Great delay took place in the survey of land. The South
                    Australian Company purchased large tracts from the commissioners at 12s. per
                    acre and sold at 20s. A general speculative spirit arrested progress. Governor
                    Gawler went into extravagant outlay on public buildings, &amp;c., and drew
                    against orders upon the English treasury. Such difficulties arose that the
                    British rulers had to suspend the charter in 1841 and make South Australia a
                    crown colony. A revival of prosperity took place when the farms were tilled and
                    poverty had taught prudence. Copper and lead mines were subsequently discovered.
                    Kapunda in 1843, and the Burra Burra copper mine in 1845, greatly aided in the
                    restoration of commercial credit. The gold fever in Victoria drew off numbers in
                    1852; but the good prices then realized for breadstuffs gave a great impetus to
                    farming. It deserves to be mentioned that rarely if ever has a colony been so
                    favoured as South Australia in the character of its early settlers. (J. BO.
