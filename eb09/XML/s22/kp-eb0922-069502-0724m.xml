                <p><label type="entry">SURVEYING</label> is the art of determining the relative
                    positions of prominent points and other objects on the surface of the ground and
                    making a graphical delineation of the included area. The general principles on
                    which it is conducted are in all instances the same: certain measures are made
                    on the ground and corresponding measures are protracted on paper, on a scale
                    which is fixed at whatever fraction of the natural scale may be most appropriate
                    in each instance. The method of operation varies with the magnitude and
                    importance of the survey, which may embrace a vast empire or be restricted to a
                    small plot of land. All surveys rest primarily on linear measures for direct
                    determinations of distance; but these are usually largely supplemented by
                    angular measures, to enable distances to be deduced by the principles of
                    geometry which cannot be conveniently measured over the surface of the ground
                    where it is hilly or broken. The nature of a survey depends on the proportion
                    which the linear and the angular measures bear to each other; it may be purely
                    linear or even purely angular, but is generally a combination of both methods.
                    Thus in India there are numerous instances of large tracts having been surveyed
                    by the purely linear method, in the course of the revenue surveys which were
                    initiated by the native Governments. The operations were conducted by men who
                    had no knowledge of geometry or of any other measuring instrument than the rod
                    or chain, and whose principal object was the determination of fairly accurate
                    areas; their methods sufficed for this purpose and were accepted and perpetuated
                    for many years by the European officers to whom the revenue assessments became
                    entrusted after the subversion of the native rule. In India, too, there are
                    extensive tracts of country which have been surveyed by the purely angular
                    method, either because the ground did not permit of the chain being employed
                    with advantage, as in the Himalayan mountains and hill tracts generally, or
                    because the chain was considered politically objectionable, as in native states
                    where it would have been regarded with suspicion.</p>
                <p>Surveys of any great extent of country were formerly constructed on a basis of
                    points whose positions were fixed astronomically, and in some countries this
                    method of operation is still of necessity adopted. But points whose relative
                    positions have been fixed by a triangulation of moderate accuracy present a more
                    satisfactory and reliable basis; for astronomical observations are liable, not
                    only to the well-known intrinsic errors which are caused by uncertainties in the
                    catalogued places of the moon and stars, but to external errors arising from
                    deflexions of the plumb line under the influence of local attractions, and these
                    of themselves materially exceed the errors which would be generated in a fairly
                    executed triangulation of a not excessive length, say not exceeding 500 miles.
                    The French Jesuits who made a survey of China for the emperor about 1730 appear
                    to have been the first deliberately to discard<pb break="no"

                    basis. In India the change was made in 1800, when what is known as the Great
                    Trigonometrical Survey was initiated by Major Lambton—with the support of
                    Colonel Wellesley, afterwards Duke of Wellington—as a means of connecting the
                    several surveys of routes and districts which had already been made in various
                    parts of the country, and as a basis for future topography. This necessitated
                    the inception of the survey as an undertaking calculated to satisfy the
                    requirements of geodesy as well as geography, because the latitudes and
                    longitudes of the points of the triangulation had to be determined for future
                    reference,—as in the case of the discarded astronomical stations, though in a
                    different manner,—by processes of calculation combining the results of the
                    triangulation with the elements of the earth’s figure. The latter were not then
                    known with much accuracy, for so far geodetic operations had been mainly carried
                    on in Europe, and additional operations nearer the equator were much wanted; the
                    survey was conducted with a view to supply this want. Thus a high order of
                    accuracy was aimed at from the very first. In course of time the operations were
                    extended over the entire length and breadth of Hindustan and beyond, to the
                    farthest limits of British sway; they cover a larger area than any other
                    national survey as yet completed, and are very elaborate and precise. Thus, as
                    triangulation constitutes the most appropriate basis for survey operations
                    generally, a short account will be given of (1) the methods of the Great
                    Trigonometrical Survey of India. This will be followed by accounts of (2)
                    traversing as a basis for survey, (3) levelling, (4) survey of interior detail,
                    (5) representation of ground, (6) geographical reconnaissance, (7) nautical
                    surveying, (8) mapping, (9) map printing, (10) instruments.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Great Trigonometrical Survey of India.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General Outlines.—</hi> Primarily a network was thrown over
                    the southern peninsula. The triangles on the central meridian were measured with
                    extra care and checked by base-lines at distances of about 2° apart in latitude
                    in order to form a geodetic arc, with the addition of astronomically determined
                    latitudes at certain of the stations. The base-lines were measured with chains
                    and the principal angles with a 3-foot theodolite, which, however, was badly
                    damaged almost at the outset by an accident to the azimuthal circle. The signals
                    were cairns of stones or poles. The chains were somewhat rude and their units of
                    length had not been determined originally, and could not be afterwards
                    ascertained. The results were good of their kind and sufficient for geographical
                    purposes; but the central meridional arc—the “great arc”—was eventually deemed
                    inadequate for geodetic requirements. A superior instrumental equipment was
                    introduced, with an improved <hi rend="italic">modus operandi,</hi> under the
                    direction of Colonel Everest in 1832. The network system of triangulation was
                    superseded by meridional and longitudinal chains taking the form of gridirons,
                    and resting on base-lines at the angles of the gridirons, as represented in fig.
                    1. For convenience of reduction and nomenclature the triangulation west of
                    meridian 92° E. has been divided into five sections,—the lowest a trigon, the
                    other four quadrilaterals distinguished by cardinal points which have reference
                    to an observatory in Central India, the adopted origin of latitudes. In the
                    north-east quadrilateral, which was first measured, the meridional chains are
                    about one degree apart; this distance was latterly much increased, and
                    eventually certain chains—as on the Malabar coast and on meridian 84° in the
                    south-east quadrilateral—were dispensed with, because good secondary
                    triangulation for topography had been accomplished before they could be
                    commenced.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Base-Lines.—</hi> All these were measured with the
                    Colby apparatus of compensation bars and microscopes. The bars, 10 feet long,
                    were set up horizontally on tripod stands; the microscopes, 6 inches apart, were
                    mounted in pairs revolving round a vertical axis and were set up on tribrachs
                    fitted to the ends of the bars. Six bars and five central and two end pairs of
                    microscopes—the latter with their vertical axes perforated for a look-down
                    telescope— constituted a complete apparatus, measuring 63 feet between the
                    ground pins or registers. For explanation of compensation see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Earth, Figure of the,</hi> vol. vii. p. 599. Compound bars are
                    necessarily more liable to accidental changes of length than simple bars; they
                    were therefore tested from time to time by comparison with a standard simple
                    bar; the microscopes were also tested by comparison with a standard 6-inch
                    scale. At the very first base-line the compensated bars were found to be liable
                    to sensible variations of length with the diurnal variations of temperature;
                    these were supposed to be due, not to error in effecting the compensation, but
                    to the different thermal conductivities of the brass and the iron components. It
                    became necessary, therefore, to determine the mean daily length of the bars very
                    precisely, for which reason they were systematically compared with the standard
                    before and after, and sometimes at the middle of, the base-line measurement
                    throughout the entire day for a space of three days, and under conditions as
                    nearly similar as possible to those obtaining during the measurement. Eventually
                    thermometers were applied experimentally to both components of a compound bar,
                    when it was found that the diurnal variations in length were principally due to
                    difference of position relatively to the sun, not to difference of
                    conductivity,—the component nearest the sun acquiring heat most rapidly or
                    parting with it most slowly, notwithstanding that both were in the same box,
                    which was always kept under the cover of a tent and carefully sheltered from the
                    sun’s rays. Happily the systematic comparisons of the compound bars with the
                    standard were found to give a sufficiently exact determination of the mean daily
                    length. An elaborate investigation of theoretical probable errors at the Cape
                    Comorin base showed that, for any baseline measured as usual without
                    thermometers in the compound bars, the <hi rend="italic">p.e</hi>. may be taken
                    as ± 1·5 millionth parts of the length, excluding unascertainable constant
                    errors, and that on introducing thermometers into these bars the <hi
                    rend="italic">p.e.</hi> was diminished to ± 0·55 millionths.</p>
                <p>In all base-line measurements the weak point is the determination of the
                    temperature of the bars when that of the atmosphere is rapidly rising or
                    falling; the thermometers acquire and lose heat more rapidly than the bar if<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0726-0697"/> their bulbs are outside, and more slowly if
                    inside the bar. Thus there is always more or less lagging, and its effects are
                    only eliminated when the rises and falls are of equal amount and duration; but
                    as a rule the rise generally predominates greatly during the usual hours of
                    work, and whenever this happens lagging may cause more error in a base-line
                    measured with simple bars than all other sources of error combined. In India the
                    probable average lagging of the standard-bar thermometer was estimated as not
                    less than 0°·3 Fahr., corresponding to an error of - 2 millionths in the length
                    of a base-line measured with iron bars. With compound bars lagging would be much
                    the same for both components and its influence would consequently be eliminated.
                    Thus the most perfect base-line apparatus would seem to be one of compensation
                    bars with thermometers attached to each component; then the comparisons with the
                    standard need only be taken at the times when the temperature is constant, and
                    there is no lagging.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Factor of Expansion of Standard Bar.—</hi> This was first
                    determined in 1832 by measuring the increment in length between temperatures of
                    76° and 212° Fahr.; in 1870 the increment between 52° and 96° was measured; the
                    results indicated an increase of expansion with temperature. They were therefore
                    combined on the empirical assumption that the expansion is the sum of two
                    terms,— the first <hi rend="italic">x</hi> times the temperature, the second <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> times the square of the temperature; <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> were then determined from the two equations
                    of condition given by the two sets of measurements. The resulting value of the
                    expansion at 62° was found to be 5 per cent. less than the previously derived
                    value at the mean temperature of 144°, thus showing the importance of employing
                    a factor varying with the mean temperature of each base-line; and this was done
                    in the final reductions.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Plan of Triangulation.—</hi> This was broadly a system of
                    internal meridional and longitudinal chains with an external border of oblique
                    chains following the course of the frontier and the coast lines. The design of
                    each chain was necessarily much influenced by the physical features of the
                    country over which it was carried. The most difficult tracts were plains of
                    great extent, devoid of any commanding points of view, in some parts covered
                    with dense forest and jungle, malarious and deadly, and almost uninhabited, in
                    other parts covered with towns and villages and umbrageous trees,—the adjuncts
                    and concomitants of a teeming population. In such tracts triangulation was
                    impossible except by constructing lofty towers as stations of observation,
                    raising them to a sufficient height to overtop at least the earth’s curvature,
                    and then either increasing the height to surmount all obstacles to mutual
                    vision, or clearing the lines, both of which were laborious and expensive
                    processes. Thus in hilly and open country the chains of triangles were generally
                    made “double” throughout, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> formed of polygonal and
                    quadrilateral figures, to give greater breadth and accuracy; but in tracts of
                    forest and close country they were carried out as series of single triangles, to
                    give a minimum of labour and expense. Symmetry was secured by restricting the
                    angles between the limits of 30° and 90°. The average side length was 30 miles
                    in hill country and 11 in the plains; the longest principal side was 62·7 miles,
                    though in the secondary triangulation to the Himalayan peaks there were sides
                    exceeding 200 miles. Long sides were at first considered desirable, on the
                    principle that the fewer the links the greater the accuracy of a chain of
                    triangles; but it was eventually found that good observations on long sides
                    could only be obtained under exceptionally favourable atmospheric conditions,
                    which were of rare occurrence. The sides were therefore shortened, whereby the
                    observations were much improved and accelerated. In plains the length was
                    governed by the height to which towers could be conveniently raised to surmount
                    the curvature, under the well-known condition, height in feet — <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> × square of the
                    distance in miles; thus 24 feet of height was needed at each end of a side to
                    overtop the curvature in 12 miles, and to this had to be added whatever was
                    required to surmount obstacles on the ground. In Indian plains refraction is
                    more frequently negative than positive during sunshine; no reduction could
                    therefore be made for it.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Selection of Sites for Stations.—</hi> This, a very simple
                    matter in hills and open country, is often very difficult in plains and close
                    country. In the early operations, when the great arc was being carried across
                    the wide plains of the Gangetic valley, which are covered with villages and
                    trees and other obstacles to distant vision, masts 35 feet high were carried
                    about for the support of the small reconnoitring theodolites, with a sufficiency
                    of poles and bamboos to form a scaffolding of the same height for the observer.
                    Other masts 70 feet high, with arrangements for displaying blue lights by night
                    at 90 feet, were erected at the spots where station sites were wanted. But the
                    cost of transport was great; the rate of progress was slow; and the results were
                    unsatisfactory. Eventually a method of touch rather than sight was adopted,
                    feeling the ground to search for the obstacles to be avoided, rather than
                    attempting to look over them; the “rays” were traced either by a minor
                    triangulation, or by a traverse with theodolite and perambulator, or by a simple
                    alignment of flags. The first method gives the direction of the new station most
                    accurately; the second searches the ground most closely; the third is best
                    suited for tracts of uninhabited forest in which there is no choice of either
                    line or site, and the required station may be built at the intersection of the
                    two trial rays leading up to it. As a rule it has been found most economical and
                    expeditious to raise the towers only to the height necessary for surmounting the
                    curvature, and to remove the trees and other obstacles on the lines.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Structure of the Principal Stations.—</hi> Each has a
                    central masonry pillar, circular and 3 to 4 feet in diameter, for the support of
                    a large theodolite, and around it a platform 14 to 16 feet square for the
                    observatory tent, observer, and signallers. The pillar is carefully isolated
                    from the platform, and when solid carries the station mark—a dot surrounded by a
                    circle—engraved on a stone at its surface, and on additional stones or the rock
                    <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> in the normal of the upper mark; but, if the
                    height is considerable and there is a liability to deflexion, the pillar is
                    constructed with a central vertical shaft to enable the theodolite to be plumbed
                    over the ground-level mark, to which access is obtained through a passage in the
                    basement. In early years this precaution against deflexion was neglected and the
                    pillars were built solid throughout, whatever their height; the surrounding
                    platforms, being usually constructed of sun-dried bricks or stones and earth,
                    were liable to fall and press against the pillars, some of which thus became
                    deflected during the rainy seasons that intervened between the periods during
                    which operations were arrested or the commencement and close of the successive
                    circuits of triangles. In some instances displacements of mark occurred of which
                    the magnitudes were not ascertainable, but were estimated as equivalent to <hi
                    rend="italic">p.e.'</hi> s of about ±9 inches in the length and± 2"·4 in the
                    azimuth of the side between any two deflected towers; and, as these theoretical
                    errors are identical with what may be expected at the end of a chain of 36
                    equilateral triangles in which all the angles have been measured with <hi
                    rend="italic">ap.e.</hi> = ± 0"·5, the old triangulation over solid towers had
                    evidently suffered much more from the deflexions of the towers than from errors
                    in the measurements of the angles.<pb break="no"

                    Principal Angles.</hi> Large theodolites were invariably employed. Repeating
                    circles were highly thought of by French geodesists at the time when the
                    operations in India were being commenced; but they were not used in the survey,
                    and have now been generally discarded.</p>
                <p>The principal theodolites are somewhat similar to the astronomer’s alt-azimuth
                    instrument, but with larger azimuthal and smaller vertical circles, also with a
                    greater base to give the firmness and stability which are required in measuring
                    horizontal angles. The azimuthal circles have mostly diameters of either 36 or
                    24 inches, the vertical circles having a diameter of 18 inches. In all the
                    theodolites the base is a tribrach resting on three levelling foot-screws, and
                    the circles are read by microscopes; but in different instruments the fixed and
                    the rotatory parts of the body vary. In some the vertical axis is fixed on the
                    tribrach and projects upwards; in others it revolves in the tribrach and
                    projects downwards. . In the former the azimuthal circle is fixed to the
                    tribrach, while the telescope pillars, the microscopes, the clamps, and the
                    tangent screws are attached to a drum revolving round the vertical axis; in the
                    latter the microscopes, clamps, and tangent screws are fixed to the tribrach,
                    while the telescope pillars and the azimuthal circle are attached to a plate
                    fixed at the head of the rotatory vertical axis. The former system—called that
                    of <hi rend="italic">flying microscopes—</hi> permits the vertical axis to be
                    readily opened out and cleaned, and presents the same clamp and tangent screw
                    for employment during a round of angles; the latter—the system of <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed microscopes—</hi> necessitates the removal and replacement
                    of all the microscopes, clamps, and tangent screws whenever the axis is cleaned,
                    which is very troublesome, and it presents three sets of clamps and tangent
                    screws for successive employment during a round of angles, which is a departure
                    from true differentiality. The vertical axis is perforated for centring over the
                    station mark with the aid of a “look-down telescope” instead of a plummet. The
                    azimuthal circle is invariably read by an odd number of microscopes, either
                    three or five, at equal intervals apart. The telescope rests with its pivots in
                    Y’s at the head of two pillars of a sufficient height to enable it to be
                    completely turned round in altitude. The vertical circle is fixed to the transit
                    axis of the telescope, and is read by two microscopes 180° apart, at the
                    extremities of arms projecting from one of the pillars. The stand is a
                    well-braced tripod, carrying an iron ring on which the theodolite rests and may
                    be turned round bodily whenever desired, as for shifting the position of the
                    zero of the azimuthal circle relatively to the points under observation. The
                    ring is 3 inches broad and of the same diameter as the circle of the foot-screws
                    of the theodolite. In some instruments the foot-screws rest directly on the
                    ring; but the instrument can be raised off the ring and turned round with the
                    aid of an apparatus in the centre of the stand. In others they rest in grooves
                    at the angles of an iron triangle which sits on the ring and can be shifted in
                    position by hand; thus with the stand well levelled in the first instance the
                    circle may be set within 1' of any required reading. The centring over the
                    station mark is performed by pushing screws placed either in the drum of the
                    stand or at the angles of the triangle.</p>
                <p>For travelling the theodolites were packed in two cases, the larger containing
                    the body of the instrument, the smaller the telescope and the vertical circle;
                    the stand constituted a third package. Each was carried on men’s shoulders as
                    the safest method of transport; the weights, of the heaviest 36-inch and of the
                    lightest 24-inch instruments, as packed with ropes and bamboos, were,
                    respectively, as follows:—body, 649 lb; telescope, 130; stand, 232; total, 1011
                    lb; and 300, 135, and 185, total 620 lb.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Signals.—</hi> Cairns of stones, poles, or other opaque
                    signals were primarily employed, the angles being measured by day only;
                    eventually it was found that the atmosphere was often more favourable for
                    observing by night than by day, and that distant points were raised well into
                    view by refraction by night which might be invisible or only seen with
                    difficulty by day. Lamps were then introduced of the simple form of a cup, 6
                    inches in diameter, filled with cotton seeds steeped in oil and resin, to burn
                    under an inverted earthen jar, 30 inches in diameter, with an aperture in the
                    side towards the observer. Subsequently this contrivance gave place to the
                    Argand lamp with parabolic reflector; the opaque day signals were discarded for
                    heliotropes reflecting the sun’s rays to the observer. The introduction of
                    luminous signals not only rendered the night as well as the day available for
                    the observations but changed the character of the operations, enabling work to
                    be done during the dry and healthy season of the year, when the atmosphere is
                    generally hazy and dust-laden, instead of being restricted as formerly to the
                    rainy and unhealthy seasons, when distant opaque objects are best seen. À higher
                    degree of accuracy was also secured, for the luminous signals were invariably
                    displayed through diaphragms of appropriate aperture, truly centred over the
                    station mark; and, looking like stars, they could be observed with greater
                    precision, whereas opaque signals are always dim in comparison and are liable to
                    be seen excentrically when the light falls on one side.</p>
                <p>A signalling party of three men was usually found sufficient to manipulate a pair
                    of heliotropes—one for single, two for double reflexion, according to the sun’s
                    position— and a lamp, throughout the night and day. Heliotropem were also
                    employed at the observing stations to flash instructions to the signallers.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Measuring Horizontal Angles.—</hi> The theodolites were
                    invariably set up under tents for protection against sun, wind, and rain, and
                    centred, levelled, and adjusted for the runs of the microscopes. Then the
                    signals were observed in regular rotation round the horizon, alternately from
                    right to left and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>; after the prescribed
                    minimum number of rounds, either two or three, had been thus measured, the
                    telescope was turned through 180°, both in altitude and azimuth, changing the
                    position of the face of the vertical circle relatively to the observer, and
                    further rounds were measured; additional measures of single angles were taken if
                    the prescribed observations were not sufficiently accordant. As the microscopes
                    were invariably equidistant and their number was always odd, either three or
                    five, the readings taken on the azimuthal circle during the telescope pointings
                    to any object in the two positions of the vertical circle, “face right” and
                    “face left,” were made on twice as many equidistant graduations as the number of
                    microscopes. The theodolite was then shifted bodily in azimuth, by being turned
                    on the ring on the head of the stand, which brought new graduations under the
                    microscopes at the telescope pointings; then further rounds were measured in the
                    new positions, face right and face left. This process was repeated as often as
                    had been previously prescribed, the successive angular shifts of position being
                    made by equal arcs bringing equidistant graduations under the microscopes during
                    the successive telescope pointings to one and the same object. By these
                    arrangements all periodic errors of graduation were eliminated, the numerous
                    graduations that were read tended to cancel accidental errors of division, and
                    the numerous rounds of measures to minimize the errors of observation arising
                    from atmospheric and personal causes.</p>

                <p>Under this system of procedure the instrumental and ordinary errors are
                    practically cancelled and any remaining error is most probably due to lateral
                    refraction, more especially when the rays of light graze the surface of the
                    ground. The three angles of every triangle were always measured.</p>

                    a distant point is liable to considerable variations during the twenty-four
                    hours, under the influence of changes in the density of the lower strata of the
                    atmosphere. Terrestrial refraction is very capricious, more particularly when
                    the rays of light graze the surface of the ground, passing through a medium
                    which is liable to extremes of rarefaction and condensation, under the alternate
                    influence of the sun’s heat radiated from the surface of the ground and of
                    chilled atmospheric vapour. When the back and forward verticals at a pair of
                    stations are equally refracted, their difference gives an exact measure of the
                    difference of height. But the atmospheric conditions are not always identical at
                    the same moment everywhere on long rays which graze the surface of the ground,
                    and the ray between two reciprocating stations is liable to be differently
                    refracted at its extremities, each end being influenced in a greater degree by
                    the conditions prevailing around it than by those at a distance; thus instances
                    are on record of a station A being invisible from another B, while B was visible
                    from A.</p>
                <p>When the great arc entered the plains of the Gangetic valley, simultaneous
                    reciprocal verticals were at first adopted with the hope of eliminating
                    refraction; but it was soon found that they did not do so sufficiently to
                    justify the expense of the additional instruments and observers. Afterwards the
                    back and forward verticals were observed as the stations were visited in
                    succession, the back angles at as nearly as possible the same time of the day as
                    the forward angles, and always during the so-called “time of minimum
                    refraction,” which ordinarily commences about an hour after apparent noon and
                    lasts from two to three hours. The apparent zenith distance is always greatest
                    then, but the refraction is a minimum only at stations which are well elevated
                    above the surface of the ground; at stations on plains the refraction is liable
                    to pass through zero and attain a considerable negative magnitude during the
                    heat of the day, for the lower strata of the atmosphere are then less dense than
                    the strata immediately above and the rays are refracted downwards. On plains the
                    greatest positive refractions are also obtained,—maximum values, both positive
                    and negative, usually occurring, the former by night, the latter by day, when
                    the sky is most free from clouds. The values actually met with were found to
                    range from + 1·21 down to - 0·09 parts of the contained arc on plains; the
                    normal “coefficient of refraction” for free rays between hill stations below
                    6000 feet was about ·07, which diminished to ·04 above 18,000 feet, broadly
                    varying inversely as the temperature and directly as the pressure, but much
                    influenced also by local climatic conditions.</p>
                <p>In measuring the vertical angles with the great theodolites, graduation errors
                    were regarded as insignificant compared with errors arising from uncertain
                    refraction; thus no arrangement was made for effecting changes of zero in the
                    circle settings. The observations were always taken in pairs, face right and
                    left, to eliminate index errors, only a few daily, but some on as many days as
                    possible, for the variations from day to day were found to be greater than the
                    diurnal variations during the hours of minimum refraction.</p>

                    Weights.—</hi> In the Ordnance and other surveys the bearings of the surrounding
                    stations are deduced from the actual observations, but from the “included
                    angles” in the Indian Survey. The observations of every angle are tabulated
                    vertically in as many columns as the number of circle settings face left and
                    face right, and the mean for each setting is taken. For several years the
                    general mean of these was adopted as the final result; but subsequently a
                    “concluded angle” was obtained by combining the single means with weights

                    minute than the errors of observation; but it was always small, not exceeding
                    0"·14 with the system of two rounds of measures and 0"·05 with the system of
                    three rounds.</p>
                <p>The weights of the concluded angles thus obtained were employed in the primary
                    reductions of the angles of single triangles and polygons which were made to
                    satisfy the geometrical conditions of each figure, because they were strictly
                    relative for all angles measured with the same instrument and under similar
                    circumstances and conditions, as was almost always the case for each single
                    figure. But in the final reductions, when numerous chains of triangles composed
                    of figures executed with different instruments and under different circumstances
                    came to be adjusted simultaneously, it was necessary to modify the original
                    weights, on such evidence of the precision of the angles as might be obtained
                    from other and more reliable sources than the actual measures of the angles.
                    This treatment will now be described.</p>

                    deduced as above from the measures of such angle, (ii.) from the magnitudes of
                    the excess of the sum of the angles of each triangle above 180° + the spherical
                    excess, and (iii.) from the magnitudes of the corrections which it is necessary
                    to apply to the angles of polygonal figures and networks to satisfy the several

                    found to be much too great. The instrument with which the angles were measured
                    in these instances gave very discrepant results at different settings of the
                    circle; but this was caused by large periodic errors of graduation which did not
                    affect the “concluded angles,” because they were eliminated by the systematic
                    changes of setting, so the results were really more precise than was
                    apparent.</p>
                <p>When weights were determined for the final simultaneous reduction of
                    triangulations executed by different instruments, it became necessary to find a
                    factor <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to be applied as a modulus to each group of
                    angles measured with the same instrument and under similar conditions, to
                    convert the as yet relative weights into absolute measures of precision. <hi
                    rend="italic">ρ</hi> was made = <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> ÷ <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> whenever data were

                    rend="italic">÷ e</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; then the absolute weight of
                    an observed angle in any group was taken as <hi rend="italic">wρ</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">e.m.s.</hi> of the angle as

                    values being usually obtained at hill stations, where the atmospheric conditions
                    were most favourable.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Harmonizing Angles of Trigonometrical Figures.—</hi> Every
                    figure, whether a single triangle or a polygonal network, was made consistent by
                    the application of corrections to the observed angles to satisfy its geometrical
                    conditions. The three angles of every triangle having been observed, their sum
                    had to be made = 180° + the spherical excess; in networks it was also necessary
                    that the sum of the angles measured round the horizon at any station should be
                    exactly = 360°, that the sum of the parts of an angle measured at different
                    times should equal the whole, and that the ratio of any two sides should be
                    identical, whatever the route through which it was computed. These are called
                    the <hi rend="italic">triangular, central, toto-partial,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">side</hi> conditions; they present <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    geometrical equations, which contain <hi rend="italic">t</hi> unknown
                    quantities, the errors of the observed angles, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> being
                    always &gt;n. When these equations are satisfied and the deduced values of
                    errors are applied as corrections to the observed angles, the figure becomes
                    consistent. Primarily the equations were treated by a method of successive
                    approximations; but afterwards they were all solved simultaneously by the
                    so-called method of minimum squares, which leads to the most probable of any
                    system of corrections; it is demonstrated under <hi rend="smallcaps">Earth,

                    extent to which differences may be attributable to errors in the adopted

                <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Final Reduction of Principal Triangulations—</hi> The
                    calculations described so far suffice to make the angles of the several
                    trigonometrical figures consistent <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> and to give
                    preliminary values of the lengths and azimuths of the sides and the latitudes
                    and longitudes of the stations. The results are amply sufficient for the
                    requirements of the topographer and land surveyor, and they are published in
                    preliminary charts, which give full numerical details of latitude, longitude,
                    azimuth, and side-length, and of height also, for each portion of the
                    triangulation—secondary as well as principal—as executed year by year. But on
                    the completion of the several chains of triangles further reductions became
                    necessary, to make the triangulation everywhere consistent <hi rend="italic"
                    >inter se</hi> and with the verificatory baselines, so that the lengths and
                    azimuths of common sides and the latitudes and longitudes of common stations
                    should be identical at the junctions of chains, and that the measured and
                    computed lengths of the base-lines should also be identical.</p>
                <p>How this was done will now be set forth. But first it must be noted that the
                    triangulation might at the same time have been made consistent with any values
                    of latitude, longitude, or azimuth which had been determined by astronomical
                    observations at either of the trigonometrical stations. This, however, was
                    undesirable, because such observations are liable to errors from deflexion of
                    the plumb-line from the true normal under the influence of local attraction, and
                    these errors are of a much greater magnitude than those that would be generated
                    in triangulating between astronomical stations which are not a great distance
                    apart. The trigonometrical elements could not be forced into accordance with the
                    astronomical without altering the angles by amounts much larger than their
                    probable errors, and the results would be useless for investigations of the
                    figure of the earth. The only independent facts of observation which could be
                    legitimately combined with the angular adjustments were the base-lines, and all
                    these were employed, while the several astronomical determinations—of latitude,
                    differential longitude, and azimuth—were held in reserve for future geodetic
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of the problem for treatment, suppose a combination of three
                    meridional and two longitudinal chains comprising seventy-two single triangles,
                    with a base-line at each corner, as shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 2);
                    suppose the three angles of every triangle to have been measured and made con
                    sistent. Let A be the ori gin, with its latitude and longitude given, and also
                    the length and azimuth of the adjoining base-line.</p>
                <p>With these data processes of calculation are carried through the triangulation to
                    obtain the lengths and azimuths of the sides and the latitudes and longi tudes
                    of the stations, say in the following order :—from A through B to E, through F
                    to E, through F to D, through F and E to C, and through F and D to C. Then there
                    are two values of side, azimuth, latitude, and longitude at E,—one from the
                    righthand chains <hi rend="italic">via</hi> B, the other from the left-hand
                    chains <hi rend="italic">via</hi> F; similarly there are two sets of values at
                    C; and each of the baselines at B, C, and D has a calculated as well as a
                    measured value. Thus eleven absolute errors are presented for dispersion over
                    the triangulation by the application of the most appropriate correction to each
                    angle, and, as a preliminary to the determination of these corrections,
                    equations must be constructed between each of the absolute errors and the
                    unknown errors of the angles from which<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">X</hi> to be the angle opposite the flank side of any triangle,
                    and <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Z</hi> the angles opposite
                    the sides of continuation; also let <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> be the most probable values of the errors of the angles
                    which will satisfy the given equations of condition. Then each equation may be
                    expressed in the form <hi rend="italic">[ax+by + cz] = E,</hi> the brackets
                    indicating a summation for all the triangles involved. We have first to
                    ascertain the values of the coefficients <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> of the unknown quantities. They are readily found for the
                    side equations on the circuits and between the base-lines, for <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> does not enter them, but only <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">z,</hi> with coefficients which are the cotangents of <hi
                    rend="italic">Y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Z,</hi> so that these equations are
                    simply [cot <hi rend="italic">Y.y</hi>- cot <hi rend="italic">Z.z</hi>] <hi
                    rend="italic">= E.</hi> But three out of four of the circuit equations are
                    geodetic, corresponding to the closing errors in latitude, longitude, and
                    azimuth, and in them the coefficients are very complicated. They are obtained as
                    follows. The first term of each of the three expressions for ∆λ, ΔA, and <hi

                    >δA,</hi> into the general expression, which will then take different forms,
                    according as the route adopted for the line of traverse was the zigzag or the
                    direct. In the former, the number of stations on the traverse is ordinarily the
                    same as the number of triangles, and, whether or no, a common numerical notation
                    may be adopted for both the traverse stations and the collateral triangles; thus
                    the angular errors of every triangle enter the general expression in the form
                    <hi rend="italic">±φx +</hi> cot <hi rend="italic">Y.μ!y -</hi> cot <hi
                    rend="italic">Z.Vz,</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">f=μ</hi> sin 1", and the
                    upper sign of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is taken if the triangle lies to the
                    left, the lower if to the right, of the line of traverse. When the direct
                    traverse is adopted, there are only half as many traverse stations as triangles,
                    and therefore only half the number of <hi rend="italic">μs</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">φ's</hi> to determine; but it becomes necessary to adopt different
                    numberings for the stations and the triangles, and the form of the coefficients
                    of the angular errors alternates in successive triangles. Thus, if the <hi

                    only an angle at the 7th station, the form is <hi rend="italic">+ φ</hi><hi

                <p>As each circuit has a right-hand and a left-hand branch, the errors of the angles
                    are finally arranged so as to present equations of the general form <hi

                <p>The eleven circuit and base-line equations of condition having been duly
                    constructed, the next step is to find values of the angular errors whieh will
                    satisfy these equations, and be the most probable of any system of values that
                    will do so, and at the same time will not disturb the existing harmony of the
                    angles in each of the seventy-two triangles. Harmony is maintained by
                    introducing the equation of condition <hi rend="italic">x+y+z=0</hi> for every
                    triangle. The most probable results are obtained by the method of minimum
                    squares, which may be applied in two ways.</p>
                <p>(i. ) A factor λ may be obtained for each of the eighty-three equa-Γ~ <hi
                    rend="italic">?/* z~~~</hi> j tions under the condition that ——+ — is made a
                    minimum, <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, L <hi rend="italic">u v w</hi> J</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">V,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w</hi> being the <hi
                    rend="italic">reciprocals</hi> of the weights of the observed angles. This
                    necessitates the simultaneous solution of eighty-three equations to obtain as
                    many values of λ. The resulting values of the errors of the angles in any, the
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> th, triangle, are a⅛ = Wp[fl⅛λ]; <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> p</hi> = ^&gt;[^Λ] » ¾&gt;~ Wp[Cpλ]
                    (17).</p>
                <p>(ii. ) One of the unknown quantities in every triangle, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> may be eliminated from each of the eleven circuit and base-line
                    equations by substituting its equivalent - <hi rend="italic">(y</hi> + 2) for
                    it, a similar substitution being made in the minimum. Then the equations take
                    the form <hi rend="italic">[(b - a)y + (c - a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">)z]= E,</hi> while the minimum becomes</p>
                <p>Γ(y + 2) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 2°—j</p>
                <p>Thus we have now to find only eleven values of λ by a simultaneous solution of as
                    many equations, instead of eighty-three values from eighty-three equations; but
                    we arrive at more complex expressions for the angular errors as follows :—</p>

                <p>The second method has invariably been adopted, originally because it was supposed
                    that, the number of the factors λ being reduced from the total number of
                    equations to that of the circuit and base-line equations, a great saving of
                    labour would be effected. But subsequently it was ascertained that in this
                    respect there is little to choose between the two methods; for, when <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is not eliminated, and as many factors are introduced as
                    there are equations, the factors for the triangular equations may be readily
                    eliminated at the outset. Then the really severe calculations will be restricted
                    to the solution of the equations containing the factors for the circuit and
                    base-line equations, as in the second method.</p>
                <p>In the preceding illustration it is assumed that the base-lines are errorless as
                    compared with the triangulation. Strictly speaking, however, as base-lines are
                    fallible quantities, presumably of different weight, their errors should be
                    introduced as unknown quantities of which the most probable values are to be
                    determined in a simultaneous investigation of the errors of all the facts of
                    observation, whether linear or angular. When they are connected together by so
                    few triangles that their ratios may be deduced as accurately, or nearly so, from
                    the triangulation as from the measured lengths, this ought to be done; but, when
                    the connecting triangles are so numerous that the direct ratios are of much
                    greater weight than the trigonometrical, the errors of the base-lines may be
                    neglected. In the reduction of the Indian triangulation it was decided, after
                    examining the relative magnitudes of the probable errors of the linear and the
                    angular measures and ratios, to assume the base-lines to be errorless (see § 19,
                    p. 704 below).</p>
                <p>The chains of triangles being largely composed of polygons or other networks, and
                    not merely of single triangles, as has been assumed for simplicity in the
                    illustration, the geometrical harmony to be maintained involved the introduction
                    of a large number of “side,” “central,” and “toto-partial” equations of
                    condition, as well as the triangular. Thus the problem for attack was the
                    simultaneous solution of a number of equations of condition = that of all the
                    geometrical conditions of every figure + four times the number of circuits
                    formed by the chains of triangles + the number of baselines-1, the number of
                    unknown quantities contained in the equations being that of the whole of the
                    observed angles; the method of procedure, if rigorous, would be precisely
                    similar to that<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n732/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0732-0703"/> already indicated for “harmonizing the angles of
                    trigonometrical figures,” of which it is merely an expansion from single ligures
                    to great groups.</p>
                <p>The rigorous treatment would, however, have involved the simultaneous solution of
                    about 4000 equations between 9230 unknown quantities, which was quite
                    impracticable. The triangulation was therefore divided into sections for
                    separate reduction, of which the most important were the live between the
                    meridians of 67° and 92° (see fig. 1, p. 696), consisting of four quadrilateral
                    figures and a trigon, each comprising several chains of triangles and some
                    base-lines. This arrangement had the advantage of enabling the final reductions
                    to be taken in hand as soon as convenient after the completion of any section,
                    instead of being postponed until all were completed. It was subject, however, to
                    the condition that the sections containing the best chains of triangles were to
                    be first reduced; for, as all chains bordering contiguous sections would
                    necessarily be “fixed” as a part of the section first reduced, it was obviously
                    desirable to run no risk of impairing the best chains by forcing them into
                    adjustment with others of inferior quality. It happened that both the north-east
                    and the south-west quadrilaterals contained several of the older chains; their
                    reduction was therefore made to follow that of the collateral sections
                    containing the modern chains.</p>
                <p>But the reduction of each of these great sections was in itself a very formidable
                    undertaking, necessitating some departure from a purely rigorous treatment. For
                    the chains were largely composed of polygonal networks and not of single
                    triangles only as assumed in the illustration, and therefore cognizance had to
                    be taken of a number of “side” and other geometrical equations of condition,
                    which entered irregularly aud caused great entanglement. Equations 17 and 18 of
                    the illustration are of a simple form because they have a single geometrical
                    condition to maintain, the triangular, which is not only expressed by the simple
                    and symmetrical equation <hi rend="italic">x + y +z=</hi> 0 <hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> but—what is of much greater importance—recurs in a regular order of
                    sequence that materially facilitates the general solution. Thus, though the
                    calculations must in all cases be very numerous and laborious, rules can be
                    formulated under whieh they can be well controlled at every stage and eventually
                    brought to a successful issue. The other geometrical conditions of networks are
                    expressed by equations which are not merely of a more complex form but have no
                    regular order of sequence, for the networks present a variety of forms; thus
                    their introduction would cause much entanglement and complication, and greatly
                    increase the labour of the calculations and the chances of failure. Wherever,
                    therefore, any compound figure occurred, only so much of it as was required to
                    form a chain of single triangles was employed. The figure having previously been
                    made consistent, it was immaterial what part was employed, but the selection was
                    usually made so as to introduce the fewest triangles. The triangulation for
                    final simultaneous reduction was thus made to consist of chains of single
                    triangles only; but all the included angles were “fixed” simultaneously. The
                    excluded angles of compound figures were subsequently harmonized with the fixed
                    angles, which was readily done for each figure <hi rend="italic">per
                    se.</hi></p>
                <p>This departure from rigorous accuracy was not of material importance, for the
                    angles of the compound figures excluded from the simultaneous reduction had
                    already, in the course of the several independent figurai adjustments, been made
                    to exert their full influence on the included angles. The figurai adjustments
                    had, however, introduced new relations between the angles of different figures,
                    causing their weights to increase <hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus</hi> with
                    the number of geometrical conditions satisfied in each instance. Thus, suppose
                    <hi rend="italic">w</hi> to be the average weight of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> observed angles of any figure, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the number
                    of geometrical conditions presented for satisfaction; then the average weight of
                    the angles after adjustment may be taken as <hi rend="italic">w</hi>. <hi

                <p>In framing the normal equations between the indeterminate factors λ for the final
                    simultaneous reduction, it would have greatly added to the labour of the
                    subsequent calculations if a separate weight had been given to each angle, as
                    was done in the primary figurai reductions; this was obviously unnecessary, for
                    theoretical requirements would now be amply satisfied by giving equal weights to
                    all the angles of each independent figure. The mean weight that was finally
                    adopted for the angles of each group was therefore taken as <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The most laborious part of the calculations was the construction and solution of
                    the normal equations between the factors λ. On this subject a few hints are
                    desirable, because the labour involved is liable to be materially influenced by
                    the order of sequence adopted in the construction. The normal equations
                    invariably take the form of (4), the coefficients on the diagonal containing
                    summations of squares of the coefficients in the primary equations, while those
                    above and below contain summations of products of the primary quantities, such
                    that the coefficient of the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> th λ in the <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> th equation is the same as that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> th λ in the <hi rend="italic">p</hi> th equation. In practice, as any
                    single angular error only enters a few of the primary equations of condition,
                    many of the coefficients vanish, both in the primary and in the normal
                    equations; and it is an object of great importance so to arrange the normal
                    equations that most blanks shall occur <hi rend="italic">above</hi> and fewest
                    blanks <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the significant values on each vertical
                    line of coefficients; in other words, the significant values above and below the
                    diagonal should lie as closely as possible to the diagonal, every value on which
                    is always significant. This advantage is secured when the primary equations are
                    arranged in groups in which each contains a number of angular errors in common
                    and as many as possible of those entering the group on each side. Thus the
                    arrangement must follow the natural succession of the chains of triangles rather
                    than the characteristics of the primary equations; if, for example, all the side
                    equations were grouped together, and all the latitude equations, and so on,
                    great entanglement would arise in the solution of the normal equations,
                    enormously increasing the labour and the chances of failure. The best
                    arrangement was found to be to group the side and the three geodetic equations
                    of each circuit together in the order of sequence of the meridional chains of
                    triangles, and then to introduce the side equations connecting base-lines

                <p>The magnitudes of the 2481 angular errors determined simultaneously in the first
                    two sections were very small, 2240 being under 0"·1, 205 between 0"·1 and 0"·1,
                    33 between 0"·2 and 0"·3, 2 between 0''·3 and 0"·4, and 1 between 0"·4 and 0"·5.
                    In the third section, which contained a number of old chains, executed with
                    instruments inferior to the 2 and 3 foot theodolites, they were larger: 780 were
                    under 0"·1, 911 between 0"·1 and 1"·0, 27 between 1"·0 and 2''·0, and 1 between
                    2"·0 and 2"·1. Thus the corrections to the angles were generally very minute,
                    rarely exceeding the theoretical probable errors of the angles, and therefore
                    applicable without taking any liberties with the facts of observation.</p>

                    Geometrically corrected Triangulation.—</hi> The investigation of such
                    theoretical errors was no easy matter. When first essayed it was generally
                    assumed by mathematicians in England that any attempt to exhibit the theoretical
                    error by a purely algebraical process soon led to results of intolerable
                    complexity, so that it was desirable to introduce numbers as soon as possible
                    for every symbol except the absolute terms of the geometrical or primary
                    equations of condition. But on continuing the algebraical process certain
                    relations were found to exist between the coefficients of the indeterminate
                    factors in the normal equations of the minimum square method and the
                    coefficients of the unknown quantities in the primary equations of condition,
                    which enormously simplified the process and led to a general algebraical
                    expression of no great complexity; it was also found that, the number of primary
                    equations being », the<pb break="no"

                <p>When the function of the corrected angles is the ratio of the terminal to the

                <p>In ordinary ground seven single triangles will span about as much as two hexagons
                    and the weights of the terminal sides would be as twenty-one by the former to
                    thirty by the latter. In a flat country two quadrilaterals would not span more
                    than one hexagon, giving terminal side weights as five to six; but in hills a
                    quadrilateral may span as much as any polygon and give a more exact side of
                    continuation. Thus in the Indian Survey polygons predominate in the plains and
                    quadrilaterals in the hills.</p>
                <p>The theoretical errors of the lengths and azimuths of the sides, and of the
                    latitudes and longitudes of the stations, at the termini of the chains of
                    triangles or at the circuit closings, might be calculated with the coefficients
                    <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> in the circuit and base-line equations
                    as the <hi rend="italic">f</hi> s, and the known <hi rend="italic">p.e'</hi> s
                    of <hi rend="italic">X, Y</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Z</hi> and the other data
                    of the figural reductions. Such calculations are, however, much too laborious to
                    be ordinarily undertaken. Thus the exactitude of a triangulation is very
                    generally estimated merely on the evidence of the magnitudes of the differences
                    between the trigonometrical and the measured lengths of the base-lines; for,
                    though the combined influence of angular precision and geometrical configuration
                    is what really governs the precision of the results, it is not readily
                    ascertainable, and is therefore generally ignored. But, when questions as to the
                    intrinsic value of a triangulation arise, the theory of errors should always be
                    appealed to, and its intimations accepted rather than the evidence of base-line
                    discrepancies, which if very small are certainly accidental, and if seemingly
                    large may be no greater than what we should be prepared to expect. Good work has
                    occasionally been redone unnecessarily, and inferior work upheld, because their
                    merits were erroneously estimated. The following formulae will be found useful
                    in acquiring a fairly approximate knowledge of the magnitude of the errors which
                    theory would lead us to expect, not only in side, but in latitude, longitude,
                    and azimuth also, at the close of any chain of triangles. They indicate
                    rigorously the <hi rend="italic">p.e'</hi> s at the terminal end of a chain of
                    equilateral triangles of which all the angles have been measured and corrected
                    and are of equal weight; the results may be made to serve for less symmetrical
                    chains, including networks of varying weight, by the application of certain
                    factors which can be estimated with fair precision in each instance.</p>

                    to ascertain whether the base-lines may be assumed to be errorless in the
                    general reduction of the triangulation; being fallible quantities, their errors
                    must be included among the unknown quantities to be investigated simultaneously,
                    if their respective <hi rend="italic">p.e.'</hi> s differ sensibly, or if the
                    <hi rend="italic">p.e</hi> 's of their ratios are not materially smaller than
                    those of the corresponding trigonometrical ratios. By (23) the <hi rend="italic"

                    triangulation. But the chains between base-lines were always composed of a large
                    number of triangles, and the average weight of the base-line ratios was about
                    eleven times greater by the direct linear measurements than by the
                    triangulation, even when all the unascertainable constant or accidental errors
                    —as from displacements of mark-stones—which might be latent in the latter were
                    disregarded. Moreover, the baselines were practically all of the same precision;
                    they were therefore treated as errorless, and the triangulation was made

                    <hi rend="italic">p.e.</hi> is smallest if the central section rather than an

                <p>If, with linear and angular <hi rend="italic">p.e</hi> 's as in the Indian
                    operations, a single section is measured once only, and the lengths of the other

                    of the entire length will be greater than that of the whole line once measured;
                    it will be less if the section is measured oftener than once and the mean
                    taken.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Azimuth Observations in connexion with Principal
                    Triangulation.—</hi> These were invariably determined by measuring the
                    horizontal angle between a referring mark and a circumpolar star, shortly before
                    and after elongation, and usually at both elongations in order to eliminate the
                    error of the star’s place. Systematic changes of “face” and of the zero settings
                    of the azimuthal circle were made as in the measurement of the principal angles
                    (§ 9); but the repetitions on each zero were more numerous; the azimuthal levels
                    were read and corrections applied to the star observations for dislevelment. As
                    already mentioned (§ 17), the triangulation was not adjusted, in the course of
                    the final simultaneous reduction, to the astronomically determined azimuths,
                    because they are liable to be vitiated by local attractions; but the azimuths
                    observed at about fifty stations around the primary azimuthal station, which was
                    adopted as the origin of the geodetic calculations, were referred to that
                    station, through the triangulation, for comparison with the primary azimuth. A
                    table was prepared of the differences (observed at the origin - computed from a
                    distance) between the primary and the geodetic azimuths; the differences were
                    assumed to be mainly due to the local deflexions of the plumb-line and only
                    partially to error in the triangulation, and each was multiplied by the factor
                    <hi rend="italic">p=</hi><hi rend="superscript"> tangent of latitude of

                    to what it would have been had the station been situated in the same latitude as

                    Coordinates.</hi></p>
                <p>Traversing is a combination of linear and angular measures in equal proportions:
                    the surveyor proceeds from point to point, measuring the lines between them and
                    at<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0735-0706"/> each point the angle between the back and forward
                    lines; he runs his lines as much as possible over level and open ground,
                    avoiding obstacles by working round them. The system is well suited for laying
                    down roads, boundary-lines, and circuitous features of the ground, and is very
                    generally resorted to for filling in the interior details of surveys based on
                    triangulation. It has been largely employed in certain districts of British
                    India, which had to be surveyed in a manner to satisfy fiscal as well as
                    topographical requirements; for, the village being the administrative unit of
                    the district, the boundary of every village had to be laid down, and this
                    necessitated the survey of an enormous number of circuits. Moreover, the
                    traverse system was better adapted for the country than a network of
                    triangulation, as the ground was generally very flat and covered with trees,
                    villages, and other obstacles to distant vision, and was also devoid of hills
                    and other commanding points of view. The principal triangulation had been
                    carried across it, but by chains executed with great difficulty and expense, and
                    therefore at wide intervals apart, with the intention that the intermediate
                    spaces should be provided with points as a basis for the general topography in
                    some other way. A system of traverses was obviously the best that could be
                    adopted under the circumstances, as it not only gave all the village boundaries
                    but was practically easier to execute than a network of minor triangulation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure of the Indian Survey.—</hi> The traverses are
                    executed in minor circuits following the periphery of each village and in major
                    circuits comprising groups of several villages; the former are done with 4'' to
                    6" theodolites and a single chain, the latter with 7" to 10" theodolites and a
                    pair of chains, which are compared frequently with a standard. The main circuits
                    are connected with every station of the principal triangulation within reach.
                    The meridian of the origin is determined by astronomical observations; the angle
                    at the origin between the meridian and the next station is measured, and then at
                    each of the successive stations the angle between the immediately preceding and
                    following stations; summing these together, the “inclinations” of the lines
                    between the stations to the meridian of the origin are successively determined.
                    The distances between the stations, multiplied by the cosines and sines of the
                    inclinations, give the distance of each station from the one preceding it,
                    resolved in the directions parallel and perpendicular respectively to the
                    meridian of the origin; and the algebraical sums of these quantities give the
                    corresponding rectangular coordinates of the successive stations relatively to
                    the origin and its meridian. The area included in any circuit is expressed by

                    succession round the circuit.</p>
                <p>Of geometrical tests there are two, both applicable at the close of a circuit:
                    the first is angular, viz., the sum of all the interior angles of the described
                    polygon should be equal to twice as many right angles as the figure has sides,
                    less four; the second is linear, viz., the algebraical sum of the <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> coordinates and that of the <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    coordinates should each be = 0. The astronomical test is this: at any station of
                    the traverse the azimuth of a referring mark may be determined by astronomical
                    observations; the inclination of the line between the station and the referring
                    mark to the meridian of the origin is given by the traverse; the two should
                    differ by the convergency of the meridians of the station and the origin. In
                    practice the angles of the traverse are usually adjusted to satisfy their
                    special geometrical and astronomical tests in the first instance, and then the
                    coordinates of the stations are calculated and adjusted by corrections applied
                    to the longest, that the angles may be least disturbed, as no further
                    corrections are given them.</p>

                    longitude; those of a traverse survey are always rectangular, plane for a small
                    area but spherical for a large one. It is often necessary, therefore, for
                    purposes of comparison and check at stations common to surveys of both
                    descriptions, to convert either rectangular coordinates into latitudes and

                    traverses may be dispersed by proportion over the coordinates of the traverse
                    stations, if desired, or adjusted in the final mapping. The latter is generally
                    all that is necessary, more particularly when the traverses are referred to
                    successive trigonometrical stations as origins, as the operations are being
                    extended, in order to prevent any large accumulation of error. Similar
                    conversions are also frequently necessary in map projections. The method of

                    required are frequently rejected because of the labour of computing them.<note

                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Levelling.</hi></p>
                <p>Levelling is the art of determining the relative heights of points on the surface
                    of the ground as referred to a hypothetical surface which cuts the direction of
                    gravity everywhere at right angles. When a line of instrumental levels is
                    commenced at the sea-level, a series of heights is determined corresponding to
                    what would be found by perpendicular measurements upwards from the surface of
                    water communicating freely with the sea in underground channels; thus the line
                    traced indicates a hypothetical prolongation of the surface of the sea inland,
                    which is everywhere conformable to the earth’s curvature.</p>
                <p>The trigonometrical determination of the relative heights of points at known
                    distances apart, by the measurements of their mutual vertical angles,—as already
                    described in section I.—is a method of levelling. But the method to which the
                    term “levelling” is always applied is that of the direct determination of the
                    differences of height from the readings of the lines at which graduated staves,
                    held vertically over the points, are cut by the horizontal plane which passes
                    through the eye of the observer. Each method has its own advantages. The former
                    is less accurate, but best suited for the requirements of a general geographical
                    survey, to obtain the heights of all the more prominent objects on the surface
                    of the ground, whether accessible or not. The latter may be conducted with
                    extreme precision, and is specially valuable for the determination of the
                    relative levels, however minute, of easily accessible points, however numerous,
                    which succeed each other at short intervals apart; thus it is very generally
                    undertaken <hi rend="italic">paid passu</hi> with geographical surveys, to
                    furnish lines of level for ready reference as a check on the accuracy of the
                    trigonometrical heights. In levelling with staves the measurements are always
                    taken from the horizontal plane which passes through the eye of the observer;
                    but the line of levels which it is the object of the operations to trace is a
                    curved line, everywhere conforming to the normal curvature of the earth’s
                    surface, and deviating more and more from the plane of reference as the distance
                    from the station of observation increases. Thus, either a correction for
                    curvature (see footnote, page 705) must be applied to every staff reading, or
                    the instrument must be set up at equal distances from the staves; the curvature
                    correction, being the same for each staff, will then be eliminated from the
                    difference of the readings, which will thus give the true difference of level of
                    the points on which the staves are set up.</p>
                <p>Levelling is an essentially simple operation; but, as it has to be repeated very
                    frequently in executing a long line of levels—say seven times on an average in
                    every mile—it must be conducted with every precaution against errors of various
                    kinds, instrumental and personal, some accidental and tending to cancel each
                    other, others systematic and cumulative. Instrumental errors arise when the
                    visual axis of the telescope is not perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and
                    when the focusing tube does not move truly parallel to the visual axis on a
                    change of focus. The first error is eliminated, and the second avoided, by
                    placing the instrument at equal distances from the staves; and, as this
                    procedure has also the advantage of eliminating the corrections for both
                    curvature and refraction, it should invariably be adopted. Errors of staff
                    readings should be guarded against by having the staves graduated on both faces,
                    but differently figured, so that the observer may not be biassed to repeat an
                    error of the first reading in the second. The staves of the Indian survey have
                    one face painted white with black divisions—feet, tenths, and hundredths—from 0
                    to 10, the other black with white divisions from 5·55 to 15·55. Deflexion from
                    horizontality may either be measured and allowed for by taking the readings of
                    the ends of the bubble of the spirit-level and applying corresponding
                    corrections to the staff readings, or be eliminated by setting the bubble to the
                    same position on its scale at the reading of the second staff as at that of the
                    first, both being equidistant from the observer.</p>
                <p>Certain errors are liable to recur in a constant order and to accumulate to a
                    considerable magnitude, though they may be too minute to attract notice at any
                    single station, as when the work is carried on under a uniformly sinking or
                    rising refraction—from morning to midday or from midday to evening—or when the
                    instrument takes some time to settle down on its bearings after being set up for
                    observation. They may be eliminated (i. ) by alternating the order of
                    observation of the staves, taking the back staff first at one station and the
                    forward first at the next; (ii. ) by working in a circuit, or returning over the
                    same line back to the origin; (iii. ) by dividing a line into sections and
                    reversing the direction of operation in alternate sections. Cumulative error,
                    not eliminable by working in a circuit, may be caused when there is much
                    northing or southing in the direction of the line, for then the sun’s light will
                    often fall endwise on the bubble of the level, illuminating the outer edge of
                    the rim at the nearer end and the inner edge at the further end, and so biassing
                    the observer to take scale readings of edges which are not equidistant from the
                    centre of the bubble; this introduces a tendency to raise the south or depress
                    the north<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0737-0708"/> ends of lines of level in the northern
                    hemisphere. On long lines, the employment of a second observer, working
                    independently over the same ground as the first, station by station, is very
                    desirable. The great lines are usually carried over the main roads of the
                    country, a number of “bench marks” being fixed for future reference. In the
                    Ordnance Survey of Great Britain lines have been carried across from coast to
                    coast, in such a manner that the level of any common crossing point may be found
                    by several independent lines. Of these points there are 166 in England,
                    Scotland, and Wales; the discrepancies met with at them were adjusted
                    simultaneously by the method of minimum squares.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea-Level.—</hi> The sea-level is the natural datum plane for
                    levelling operations, more particularly in countries bordering on the ocean. The
                    earliest surveys of coasts were made for the use of navigators, and, as it was
                    considered very important that the charts should everywhere show the minimum
                    depth of water which a vessel would meet with, low water of spring-tides was
                    adopted as the datum. But this does not answer the requirements of a land
                    survey, because the tidal range between extreme high and low water differs
                    greatly at different points on coast-lines. Thus the generally adopted datum
                    plane for land surveys is the mean-sea level, which, if not absolutely uniform
                    all the world over, is much more nearly so than low water. Tidal observations
                    have been taken at nearly fifty points on the coasts of Great Britain, which
                    were connected by levelling operations; the local levels of mean sea were found
                    to differ by larger magnitudes than could fairly be attributed to errors in the
                    lines of level, having a range of 12 to 15 inches above or below the mean of all
                    at points on the open coast, and more in tidal rivers.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In tidal estuaries and rivers the mean-water
                    level rises above the mean-sea level as the distance from the open coast-line
                    increases; for instance, in the Hooghly river, passing Calcutta, there is a rise
                    of 10 inches in 42 miles between Sagar (Saugor) Island at the mouth of the river
                    and Diamond Harbour, and a further rise of 20 inches in 43 miles between Diamond
                    Harbour and Kidderpur.</p></note> But the general mean of the coast stations for
                    England and Wales was practically identical with that for Scotland. The
                    observations, however, were seldom of longer duration than a fortnight, which is
                    insufficient for an exact determination of even the short period components of
                    the tides, and ignores the annual and semi-annual components, which occasionally
                    attain considerable magnitudes. The mean-sea levels at Port Said in the
                    Mediterranean and at Suez in the Red Sea have been found to be identical, and a
                    similar identity is said to exist in the levels of the Atlantic and the Pacific
                    Oceans on the opposite coasts of the isthmus of Panama. This is in favour of a
                    uniform level all the world over; but, on the other hand, lines of level carried
                    across the continent of Europe make the mean-sea level of the Mediterranean at
                    Marseilles and Trieste from 2 to 5 feet below that of the North Sea and the
                    Atlantic at Amsterdam and Brest,—a result which it is not easy to explain on
                    mechanical principles. In India various tidal stations on the east and west
                    coasts, at which the mean-sea level has been determined from several years’
                    observations, have been connected by lines of level run along the coasts and
                    across the continent; the differences between the results were in all cases due
                    with greater probability to error generated in levelling over lines of great
                    length than to actual differences of sealevel in different localities.</p>
                <p>The sea-level, however, may not coincide everywhere with the geometrical figure
                    which most closely represents the earth’s surface, but may be raised or lowered,
                    here and there, under the influence of local and abnormal attractions,
                    presenting an equipotential surface—an ellipsoid or spheroid of revolution
                    slightly deformed by bumps and hollows—which Bruns calls a “geoid.” Archdeacon
                    Pratt has shown that, under the combined influence of the positive attraction of
                    the Himalayan Mountains and the negative attraction of the Indian Ocean, the
                    sea-level may be some 560 feet higher at Kurrachee than at Cape Comorin; but, on
                    the other hand, the Indian pendulum operations have shown that there is a
                    deficiency of density under the Himalayas and an increase under the bed of the
                    ocean, which may wholly compensate for the excess of the mountain masses and
                    deficiency of the ocean, and leave the surface undisturbed. If any bumps and
                    hollow's exist, they cannot be measured instrumentally; for the instrumental
                    levels will be affected by the local attractions precisely as is the sea-level,
                    and will thus invariably show level surfaces even should there be considerable
                    deviations from the geometrical figure.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Survey of Interior Detail.</hi></p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">General Principles.—</hi> We have seen that the skeleton
                    framework of a survey may be either a triangulation or a system of traverses;
                    very generally it is a combination of both. The method of filling in the details
                    is necessarily influenced to some extent by the nature of the framework, but it
                    depends mainly on the magnitude of the scale and the requisite degree of
                    minutiae. In all instances the principal triangles and circuit traverses have to
                    be broken down into smaller ones, to furnish a sufficient number of fixed points
                    and lines for the subsequent operations. The filling in may be performed wholly
                    by linear measurements or wholly by direction intersections, but is most
                    frequently effected by both linear and angular measures, the former taken with
                    chains and tapes and offset poles, the latter with small theodolites, sextants,
                    optical squares, or other reflecting instruments, magnetized needles, prismatic
                    compasses, and plane tables. When the scale of a survey is large, the linear and
                    angular measures are usually recorded on the spot in a field-book and afterwards
                    plotted in office; when small they are sometimes drawn on the spot on a plane
                    table and the field-book is dispensed with.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">The Scale.—</hi> In every country the scale is generally
                    expressed by the ratio of some fraction or multiple of the smallest to the
                    largest national units of length, but sometimes by the fraction which indicates
                    the ratio of the length of a line on the paper to that of the corresponding line
                    on the ground. The latter form is obviously preferable, being international and
                    independent of the various units of length adopted by different nations. See
                    table of maps and scales under <hi rend="smallcaps">Map,</hi> vol. xv. p. 522.
                    In the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain and Ireland both forms of expression are
                    adopted, the smaller scales being 1 inch and 6 inches to a mile for provinces
                    and counties, the larger <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">

                    > 500</hi> for towns. In the Indian Survey the standard topographical scale is 1
                    inch to a mile, diminishing to ½ and ¼ inch for geographical reconnaissance, and
                    rising by multiples of 2 to higher scales, of which the greatest, for other than
                    city surveys, is 32 inches, for cadastral purposes. In both surveys the double
                    unit of the foot and the Gunter’s link (= <hi rend="superscript"> 66</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 100</hi> th of a foot) is employed, the former invariably in
                    the triangulation, the latter very generally in the traversing and filling in,
                    because of its convenience in calculations and measurements of area, a square
                    chain of 100 Gunter’s links being exactly one-tenth of an acre.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Ordnance Survey Methods.—</hi> All linear measures are made
                    with the Gunter’s chain, all angular with small theodolites only; neither

                    in hill sketching, when bearings are taken with the prismatic compass. As a rule
                    the filling in is done by triangle-chaining only; traverses with theodolite and
                    chain are occasionally resorted to, but only when it is necessary to work round
                    woods and hill tracts across which right lines cannot be carried.</p>

                    being fixed; the alignment is effected with a small theodolite, and marks are

                    the subsequent operations. The surveyor is given a diagram of the triangulation,
                    but no side lengths, as the accuracy of his chaining is tested by comparison
                    with the trigonometrical values. Then straight lines are carried across the
                    intermediate detail between the points established on the sides; they constitute
                    the principal “cutting up or split lines”; their crossings of detail are marked
                    in turn and straight lines are run between them. The process is continued until
                    a sufficient number of lines and marks have been established on the ground to
                    enable all houses, roads, fences, streams, railways, canals, rivers, boundaries,
                    and other detail to be conveniently measured up to and fixed. Perpendicular
                    offsets are limited to eighty aud twenty links for the respective scales of 6

                    When a considerable area has to be thus treated it is divided into a number of
                    blocks of convenient size, bounded by roads, rivers, or parish boundaries, and a
                    “traverse on the meridian of the origin” is carried round the periphery of each
                    block. Commencing at a trigonometrical station, the theodolite is set to circle
                    reading 0° 0' with the telescope pointing to the north, and at every “forward”
                    station of the traverse the circle is set to the same reading when the telescope
                    is pointed at the “back” station as was obtained at the back station when the
                    telescope was pointing to the forward one. When the circuit is completed and the
                    theodolite again put up at the origin and set on the last back station with the
                    appropriate circle reading, the circle reading, with the telescope again pointed
                    to the first forward station, will be the same as at first, if no error has been
                    committed. This system establishes a convenient check on the accuracy of the
                    operations and enables the angles to be readily protracted on a system of lines
                    parallel to the meridian of the origin. Λs a further check the traverse is
                    connected with all contiguous trigonometrical stations by measured angles and
                    distances. Traverses are frequently carried between the points already fixed on
                    the sides of the minor triangles; the initial side is then adopted, instead of
                    the meridian, as the axis of coordinates for the plotting, the telescope being
                    pointed with circle reading 0° 0' to either of the trigonometrical stations at
                    the extremities of the side.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">Plotting and Examination.—</hi> The plotting is done from
                    the field-books of the surveyors by a separate agency. Its accuracy is tested by
                    examination on the ground, when all necessary addenda are made. The examiner—who
                    should be both surveyor, plotter, and draftsman—mounts the plot on his sketching
                    block, and verifies the accuracy of the detail by intersections and productions
                    and occasional direct measurements, and generally endeavours to cause the
                    details under examination to prove the accuracy of each other rather than to
                    obtain direct proof by remeasurement. He fixes conspicuous trees and delineates
                    the woods, footpaths, rocks, precipices, steep slopes, embankments, &amp;c., and
                    supplies the requisite information regarding minor objects—whether pit, shaft,
                    level, spring, well, conduit, weir, quarry, refuse heap, waste, orchard,
                    stackyard, railway, canal, manufacturing and mineral works, viaducts, bridges,
                    tramways, plantations, &amp;c.—to enable a draftsman to make a perfect
                    representation according to the scale of the map. In examining a coast-line he
                    delineates the foreshore and sketches the strike and dip of the stratified
                    rocks. In tidal rivers he ascertains and marks the highest points to which the
                    ordinary tides flow. The examiner on the 25·344 inch scale ( = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2500</hi>) is required to
                    give all necessary information regarding the parcels of ground of different
                    character—whether arable, pasture, wood, moor, moss, sandy —defining the limits
                    of each on a separate tracing if necessary. He has also to distinguish between
                    turnpike, parish, and occupation roads, to collect all names, and to furnish
                    notes of military, baronial, and ecclesiastical antiquities to enable them to be
                    appropriately represented in the final maps. The latter are subjected to a
                    double examination,—first in the office, secondly on the ground; they are then
                    handed over to the officer in charge of the levelling to have the levels and
                    contour lines inserted, and finally to the hill sketchers, whose duty it is to
                    make an artistic representation of the features of the ground.</p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Indian Survey Methods.—</hi> All filling in is invariably
                    done by plane-tabling on a basis of points previously fixed; the methods differ
                    simply in the extent to which linear measures are introduced to supplement the
                    direction rays of the plane table. When the scale of the survey is small, direct
                    measurements of distance are rarely made and the filling is usually done wholly
                    by direction intersections, which fix all the principal points, and by
                    eye-sketching; but as the scale is increased linear measures with chains and
                    offset poles are introduced to the extent that may be desirable. A sheet of
                    drawing paper is mounted on cloth over the face of the plane table; the points,
                    previously fixed by triangulation or otherwise, are projected on it — the
                    collateral meridians and parallels, or the rectangular coordinates, when these
                    are more convenient for employment than the spherical, having first been drawn;
                    the plane table is then ready for use. Operations are commenced at a fixed point
                    by aligning with the sight rule on another fixed point, which brings the
                    meridian line of the table on that of the station. The magnetic needle may now
                    be placed on the table and a position assigned to it for future reference. Rays
                    are drawn from the station point on the table to all conspicuous objects around
                    with the aid of the sight rule. The table is then taken to other fixed points,
                    and the process of ray-drawing is repeated at each; thus a number of objects,
                    some of which may become available as stations of observation, are fixed.
                    Additional stations may be established by setting up the table on a ray,
                    adjusting it on the back station—that from which the ray was drawn—and then
                    obtaining a cross intersection with the sight rule laid on some other fixed
                    point, also by interpolating between three fixed points situated around the
                    observer. The magnetic needle may not be relied on for correct orientation, but
                    is of service in enabling the table to be set so nearly true at the outset that
                    it has to be very slightly altered afterwards. The error in the setting is
                    indicated by the rays from the surrounding fixed points intersecting in a small
                    triangle instead of a point, and a slight change in azimuth suffices to reduce
                    the triangle to a point, which will indicate the position of the station
                    exactly. Azimuthal error being less apparent on short than on long lines,
                    interpolation is best performed by rays drawn from near points, and checked by
                    rays drawn to distant points, as the latter show most strongly the magnitude of
                    any error of the primary magnetic setting. In this way, and by self-verificatory
                    traverses “on the back ray” between fixed points, plane-table stations are
                    established over the ground at appropriate intervals, depending on the scale of
                    the survey; and from these stations all surrounding objects which the scale
                    permits of being shown are laid down on the table, sometimes by rays only,
                    sometimes by a single ray and a measured distance. The general configuration of
                    the ground is delineated simultaneously.</p>

                    For large scale work in plains it is customary to run arbitrary lines across it
                    and make an independent survey of the belt of ground to a distance of a few
                    chains on either side for comparison with the original survey; the smaller scale
                    hill topography is checked by examination from commanding points, and also by
                    traverses run across the finished work on the table.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Representation of Ground.</hi></p>
                <p>The master lines of ground are the main ridges and water-partings of the hills,
                    the watercourses, and the horizontal contour lines of the coasts; the
                    subordinate lines are those which define the undulations and minor features
                    falling between the low-lying plains and the crests of the hills. These lines
                    must first be laid down on a horizontal projection to fix the dimensions of each
                    feature of the ground, after which the slopes must be indicated with sufficient
                    relief and character to present a true picture of the corrugations of surface.
                    In ancient maps the hills are represented as seen against the sky in profile by
                    a spectator standing on the ground below at some distance off. This system of
                    “natural representation,” as it was called, was serviceable in enabling persons
                    looking at the hills from the quarter from which they had been sketched to
                    identify them readily, for which reason such views of distant inland hills are
                    still commonly given on the margins of marine charts of coast-lines for the
                    assistance of navigators. But, when all other objects except the hills are shown
                    in a map by their horizontal projections, hills represented in perspective are
                    false to their surroundings, and misleading to all who approach them from other
                    directions than that of the adopted point of view, for the vertical projection
                    of the profile is practically turned over and confused with the horizontal
                    plane. Hence in course of time hills came to be drawn as if seen from a high
                    bird’s-eye point of view, the position of which was shifted until at last the
                    point of sight was supposed to be vertically over them; thus the evils of the
                    perspective system were diminished, whilst something of natural representation
                    was still preserved. About the end of the 18th century the perspective and the
                    bird’s-eye systems gave way to the true method of indicating the forms of hills,
                    viz., by their horizontal projections, like all the other details of the ground,
                    and by adding the requisite shading to bring every feature into proper
                    relief.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hill-Shading.—</hi> There are two rival methods of
                    hill-shading,—one by horizontal contours, the other by vertical hachures. A
                    contour being the line of intersection of a hill<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0739-0710"/> by a horizontal plane, contour lines indicate the
                    markings which would be made by the successive risings of a flood to different
                    levels above the sea; vertical hachures indicate the directions which the
                    particles of a volume of water, equally disseminated over the top of a hill,
                    would naturally take in running down the sides and slopes. The most perfect
                    representation of ground is obtained when the shade lines, whether horizontal or
                    vertical, are sufficiently close and well graduated in tone and intensity to
                    imitate good mezzotint shading in Indian ink. A good effect may be and is
                    frequently produced by assuming light to fall on the hills obliquely from a
                    specific direction, illuminating them on one side and throwing the reverse
                    slopes into shadow. But this has the disadvantage of giving similar slopes
                    different intensities of shade according to their position with reference to the
                    assumed direction of the light; on the other hand, vertical lighting, which
                    gives the same intensity to the same slope wherever situated, fails in relief
                    and perspicacity. A commission of citizens appointed by the republican
                    Government of France in 1803 to formulate rules on the subject of topography,
                    condemned the representation of hills in demi-perspective as absurd, but
                    approved the system of oblique side-light; it also condemned contours, except
                    for engineering works, and recommended vertical hachures, under the idea that
                    the slope lines of the fall of water represent a material effect of which the
                    eye is witness every moment, and recalls the general cause, if not of the
                    formation, at least of the figure and characteristics, of the mountains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scale of Shade.—</hi> For military purposes it is very
                    desirable that maps should be so drawn as to enable the angles of inclination of
                    all slopes to be readily ascertained, with a view to determining what portions
                    of the ground are suited for the manoeuvres of each of the three arms,—infantry,
                    cavalry, and artillery. Thus military topographers of different nationalities
                    have proposed a variety of scales to regulate the thickness and distance apart
                    of the shade lines, and generally the proportion of black to white, for
                    different angles of slope, that the map may convey to the mind as accurate a
                    knowledge of the slopes of the ground as of the horizontal outlines. All slopes,
                    however, are not of equal practical importance, but only those which are of most
                    common occurrence and most liable to be gone over by men and horses and wheeled
                    vehicles, and their inclination rarely exceeds 25°; consequently it is of most
                    importance to be able to distinguish variations of slope below that angle: it is
                    occasionally desirable to know the sharper slopes up to 45° or 50°, but greater
                    inclinations are comparatively of rare occurrence and unimportant. Now in a true
                    scale of shade the intensity increases with the inclination from 0° to 90°;
                    thus, putting black + white = 1, the proportion of black to white for any

                    cos <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> white = cos <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> But that
                    scale does not sufficiently accentuate the lower inclinations, which are the
                    most important, and have therefore to be dealt with more emphatically; this has
                    led to the introduction of a variety of conventional scales, each with the
                    special characteristics which commended themselves to its author. Major Lehmann
                    of the German army supposed light to be admitted in parallel vertical rays and
                    gave the horizontal plane the fullest light, because the reflected coincides
                    with the vertical ray; at an inclination of 45° the reflected ray is perfectly
                    horizontal, and this slope was therefore least illumined. Disregarding all
                    greater slopes, he placed 45° at the head of his scale and represented it by
                    absolute black; the scale was divided into nine equal parts of 5° each, from 0°
                    to 45°, up to which the illumination varies inversely as the angle of
                    inclination. General van Gorkum of the Netherlands army improved on Lehmann’s
                    system: he adopted certain groups of contours arranged according to the slope,
                    making the vertical distances between the contours equal in each group but
                    greater in the higher groups, and between the contours he drew vertical hachures
                    the lengths of which showed by reference to a scale the angles of slope. His
                    lowest group included all angles up to 25°, the vertical distance between the
                    contours being so regulated with reference to the scale of the map as to permit
                    the draftsman to represent the slopes without inconveniently long hachures. For
                    higher angles he doubled and trebled the vertical interval of his contours and
                    the thickness of his hachures. Thus the relative altitudes of any required
                    points might be deduced with comparative facility by noting the thickness and
                    counting the number of the vertical hachures between them. In this respect the
                    system satisfies the requirements of a military map, but the effect is
                    unpleasing and unsuggestive of hill forms. In 1828 a second French commission,
                    having Laplace for its president, was appointed to report on topographical
                    drawing. It reversed the decision of the first commission in favour of oblique
                    side light, as being difficult to execute and inaccurate in giving different
                    intensities to the same angles of slope facing differently; and, after trying
                    various scales of shade, it determined to increase the intensity in proportion
                    to the sines of double the angles of inclination diminished by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi>, which gives a more
                    rapid increase of shade for the gentle than the steep slopes. In subsequent
                    instructions of the “depot de la guerre” the proportion of black to white is
                    fixed at one and a half times the angle of slope. In England various scales of
                    shade have been proposed, by Colonel Scott and Captain Webber of the Royal
                    Engineers, and by the Council of Military Education. Colonel Scott’s scale is
                    interesting as having been derived from the average of measurements taken from
                    the best examples of hill sketching in the Ordnance and other surveys, whereas
                    all the others were deduced from a conventional application of geometrical
                    principles. The following table (III.) gives the several scales :—</p>

                <p>Of late years the system of shading by lines has been abandoned for the English
                    army, and a method of representing slopes by mezzotint shading over a few
                    governing contour lines, laid down by actual survey, has been introduced
                    instead. The effect aimed at is a transparent shade, dark in proportion to the
                    steepness of the ground represented; its object is to give body and expression
                    to the contours and to explain and develop minor features of the ground which
                    may lie between them. This style of shading, being distinct from all line
                    drawing, may be applied over the most crowded details without causing confusion,
                    such as would be produced by hachure shading. The contours are indicated by
                    continuous red lines of constant thickness, strong enough to be everywhere
                    visible through the shading, which is effected by applying lead with a soft
                    pencil over the parts where it is wanted, and then rubbing it in firmly with a
                    piece of chamois<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0740-0711"/> leather folded into a small pad. No pencil
                    marking is allowed; lightening is done with india-rubber; the shading is finally
                    fixed with a wash of thin gum-water.</p>
                <p>It is to be noted that the several scales of shade above given were devised for
                    military maps to be drawn on a scale of not less than 4 inches to the mile and
                    possibly much greater. The harshness and mannerism to which all line-shading by
                    rule is liable are of less importance in maps of small areas represented on
                    large scales than on maps of large areas on small scales. In the former the
                    sacrifice of pictorial effect is more than compensated by the additional
                    information regarding the slopes of the ground; in the latter any attempt to
                    introduce so much information would tend to crowd the map objectionably, and
                    confuse the vertical with the horizontal details. The smaller the scale of a map
                    of hill country the more necessary it is to abandon mechanical conventionalism,
                    and to aim at achieving an artistic representation which will convey an
                    immediate and accurate impression of the general character of the ground.</p>
                <p>In India the topography has been mainly executed on scales of or less than 1 inch
                    = l mile and rarely exceeding 2 inches, and, as the range of altitude varies
                    considerably in different parts of the country, from plains and undulations
                    little above the sea-level to mountains rising to an altitude of 29,000 feet,
                    scales of shade were long deemed wholly unsuitable for employment. The higher
                    mountains had necessarily to be brought into prominence over the lower by giving
                    them a darker shade than was due simply to their slopes, and similarly the
                    elevated plateaus had to be more lightened and illuminated than the low-lying
                    plains. But in course of time, as the number of hands employed in the operations
                    increased more rapidly than the available supply of artistic draughtsmen, the
                    introduction of a scale of shade became necessary, in order that the multitude
                    of workers might be put more nearly on a par with the few. For men who have been
                    accustomed to associate a certain depth of shade with a certain angle of slope
                    will work together within narrower limits of error and divergence than if left
                    entirely to their own unaided judgment and untutored proclivities. The field
                    sketchers should therefore learn to work on a system which gives every hachure
                    line a definite meaning, so that their sketches may be rightly interpreted and
                    appropriately translated and rendered in the final representation of the ground,
                    when it is the duty of the draughtsman to enhance the tone of the map as much as
                    possible while maintaining its truthfulness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ordnance Survey System of Delineating Ground.—</hi> As a rule
                    the features of the ground are sketched in the field on the 6-inch scale, and
                    afterwards reduced and published on the 1-inch scale. The Highlands of Scotland
                    were sketched partly on the 1-inch and partly on the 2-inch scale; in Ireland
                    the 1-inch scale only was used; and this scale is now being adopted for hill
                    sketching in England and Wales. In the parts where the 6-inch scale was used the
                    ground was first contoured instrumentally; a plan of the contours and of all
                    surveyed outlines was supplied to the sketcher, who proceeded to insert the hill
                    features with the aid of a prismatic compass, protractor, plotting scale, and a
                    “hill-sketcher’s scale,” graduated to show the horizontal intervals between the
                    contours which correspond to various angles of inclination from 0° to 45°. He
                    was required to delineate slopes up to 45° by horizontal hachures, and slopes
                    beyond 45° by vertical hachures. The thickness and number of the strokes, the
                    relation to light and shade, and the character of the touch were left to the
                    skill and experience of the sketcher. The introduction of scales of shade
                    adapted to various inclinations and altitudes was frequently mooted, with a view
                    to securing greater uniformity; but no such scale was adopted, for it was found
                    that, though at first different workmen produced different results, long
                    practice and constant comparison, together with the aid derived from the
                    instrumental contours, effected all desirable uniformity. Thus in good sketches
                    it was found that the maximum breadth of stroke used in the representation of
                    very steep mountain slopes was <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 45</hi> inch, and the minimum used in low and nearly flat
                    country, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 500</hi> inch,
                    also that the average proportions of light to shade were I to 3 at the maximum
                    and 25 to 1 at the minimum inclinations. In the field sketches the light is
                    supposed to fall vertically, and all slopes of like altitude and inclination are
                    similarly expressed. The 6-inch sketches are reduced to the 1-inch scale for
                    publication by an artist working with Indian ink and the camel-hair brush on an
                    impression in outline of the 1-inch map. He makes a careful study of the several
                    sketches which he has to combine together, in order to determine which features
                    should be retained and which omitted in the reduction, and he divides the ground
                    into zones of different altitude to guide him in giving a strength of shade
                    proportioned to the altitude rather than to the slope as in the field sketches;
                    and in drawing he increases the contrasts between light and shade and introduces
                    light from a corner of the map to give a stronger relief, and to attract the eye
                    to the highest points and enable it to distinguish readily the higher from the
                    lower ground. His general aim is to produce a more pictorial and less mechanical
                    study of the ground than is supplied by the field sketches. Many exquisite maps
                    have been thus produced and afterwards engraved; see sheets 32, 33, 38, 53, and
                    64 of Scotland,</p>
                <p>38 and 48 of England, 75 of Wales, 93, 94,191, and 192 of Ireland. These sheets,
                    however, though admirable specimens of engraving, fall short of the original
                    drawings in tone and relief, for in them the hill-shading is necessarily shown
                    by line-etching, and it does not produce such effective contrasts and gradations
                    of light and shade as the original brush work.<note anchored="true"

                    >Delineation by Instrumental Contouring.—</hi> A very precise knowledge of the
                    configuration of surface may be acquired by carrying true contour lines over the
                    ground and projecting them on the map of the survey. But the contours do not
                    give a true representation of the ground, for they seldom represent actual lines
                    on the surface, as do the lines on the map which indicate roads, watercourses,
                    walls, enclosures, &amp;c.; they give, however, a conventional representation
                    which is sufficient <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> for the engineer and the
                    expert, and they furnish guiding lines for all shading, whether by hachures or
                    mezzotint, which may be subsequently executed to produce an artistic delineation
                    of the features of the ground. In instrumental contouring we have first to
                    decide on the vertical intervals to be maintained between the contours. They
                    depend on the scale of the survey and the nature of the ground. In the Ordnance
                    Survey they are made as small as from <hi rend="italic">5</hi> to 10 feet, when
                    special plans on large scales are being prepared for engineering requirements;
                    but for the general maps they are 50 feet up to an elevation of 100 feet above
                    the sea-level, and 100 beyond up to 900 feet, which elevation, being the
                    practical limit of cultivation, is the highest generally marked, though in the
                    northern counties of England and in parts of Scotland additional contours have
                    been executed at the altitudes of 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2500, 3000,
                    &amp;c., feet. The intervals having been determined on, instrumental levelling
                    is commenced at either the top or the bottom of those slopes which best define
                    the general lay of the ground, or at some previously established bench mark of
                    which the height above the sea is known. Points are marked out on the slopes
                    with pickets at the prescribed vertical intervals, and then the contour lines of
                    the horizontal planes passing in succession through each of these points are
                    traced with a levelling instrument and staff and surveyed by traverse, the two
                    processes being performed either simultaneously or consecutively as may be most
                    convenient.</p>
                <p>The instruments generally used in the Ordnance Survey are a 5-inch
                    theodolite—employed as a levelling instrument—and a contouring staff, 8 feet
                    long, provided with a sliding vane which may be fixed at any required height;
                    the staff is shifted about until the vane is brought into the horizontal plane
                    of the theodolite, when the bottom of the staff will be on the contour line. A
                    serviceable contouring instrument of very simple construction is the waterlevel,
                    which consists of a pair of transparent phials partially filled with water; the
                    phials are placed upside down at the ends of a hollow bar fixed on a rotatory
                    vertical axis, and have their mouths connected with piping of any available
                    material,— brass, tin, or gutta-percha. The water in both phials is in free
                    communication, and the water surfaces indicate the horizontal plane naturally,
                    without any mechanical contrivance. The instrument is well suited for short
                    sights not requiring a telescope, and may be readily manipulated by persons
                    ignorant of the use of instruments of a higher class. Eye-reflecting levels,
                    clinometers, orometers, and other light instruments, which may be held in the
                    hand and do not require a fixed support, are frequently employed for
                    interpolating minor between major contours. In military sketching on large
                    scales hypothenusal inclinations and lengths are sometimes measured; the bases
                    and perpendiculars are deduced on the spot from a table<pb break="no"

                    orthogonals also if required, are laid down.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Geographical Reconnaissance.</hi></p>
                <p>When a traveller passes through an unknown or little known region the opportunity
                    afforded him of acquiring ' some new geographical knowledge depends largely on
                    the configuration and aspects of the ground, the condition of the atmosphere,
                    the attitude of the inhabitants, and the time available. If hills are numerous
                    and prominent and free from forest, and other conditions are favourable, a large
                    area may be covered in a short time by reconnaissance from the stations of a
                    chain of triangles carried along the line of route, fixing points in advance,
                    some of which become stations of observation whence further points are fixed;
                    and thus the continuity of the operations is maintained. But the ground may be
                    flat and devoid of prominent points, the view circumscribed by forests and other
                    obstacles, the atmosphere dense and unfavourable for distant vision, the
                    inhabitants hostile, and the time short, and the traveller may be restricted to
                    his line of route and unable to deviate from it; he must then endeavour to
                    maintain a continuous traverse of the route, sketching in the ground in its
                    immediate vicinity. Whenever breaks of continuity occur he must resort to
                    astronomical observations to effect a connexion between the dissociated sections
                    of his survey and to obtain an independent check on the general accuracy of the
                    operations. He has therefore to be prepared to measure base-lines, to carry on a
                    triangulation in some regions and a traverse in others, and to make any
                    astronomical observations which may be wanted, and, if possible, to complete his
                    mapping on the ground instead of postponing it to be done elsewhere. He should
                    supply himself with some instruments suited for rough and rapid work and with
                    others for better work when time and opportunity permit, and he should be
                    careful to arrange beforehand the general character of the proposed operations
                    and the scales and projections to be adopted for the mapping; he should also
                    provide himself with blank sheets of paper duly graticulated to scale, for work
                    in detail in the vicinity of the line of route and for general geography. For
                    measures of base-lines and distances on the ground, chains, rolls of crinoline
                    wire, long Assam canes, and perambulators may be employed, also omnimeters and
                    subtense theodolites, to measure the angle subtended by a pole of known length,
                    whence the distance may be deduced. For measures of angles and bearings, either
                    theodolites,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In many
                    respects a theodolite is more suitable than a sextant: (1) it measures
                    horizontal angles directly, whereas the sextant measures oblique angles, which
                    have to be reduced to the horizon; (2) it measures a round of several angles
                    with much greater facility; (3) it measures all vertical angles with equal
                    facility, including the small elevations and depressions of distant peaks which
                    cannot be readily seen by reflexion from mercury for measurement with a sextant;
                    (4) its telescopic power is usually far higher; (5) it may be so manipulated as
                    to eliminate the effects, without ascertaining the magnitudes, of the constant
                    instrumental errors,—excentricity, index, and collimation; and (6) when much
                    accuracy is required the influence of graduation errors may be greatly reduced
                    by systematic changes of the settings of the horizontal circle.</p></note> or
                    sextants, or prismatic compasses may be used, according as more or less accuracy
                    is required. For the general survey the plane table is a most valuable
                    instrument: it enables bearings to be at once laid down on the paper without
                    previous measurement, and much detail to be sketched in on the spot, instead of
                    being plotted subsequently from a field-book; then the only independent angular
                    measurements which need be taken are those of the principal triangles and of
                    very distant points beyond the range of the table. Rough and rapid route surveys
                    may be made by pacing the distances, taking the magnetic bearings, and combining
                    with the results of astronomical observation. Many thousand miles of itinerary
                    through regions in Central Asia have been surveyed by Asiatic employés of the
                    Indian Government in this way; the northings and southings were controlled by
                    latitude observations, and the factors thus obtained were applied to the
                    eastings and westings, longitudes being impracticable. The theodolite should be
                    employed to fix points on very distant ranges, for it will give good results,
                    even with short bases and very acute angles, provided the objects actually
                    observed are well identified in each instance. Observations should be taken from
                    three stations, giving two triangles with a common side, which will at once show
                    up any mistake, whether of identity, circle reading, or calculation. Whenever a
                    break of continuity occurs in the triangulation or the traversing, astronomical
                    observations must be resorted to. Much may be done by a judicious introduction
                    of latitudes and azimuths, more particularly where there is considerable
                    northing and southing, for then differences of longitude may be obtained from
                    the azimuths and differences of latitude. A prominent peak, visible from great
                    distances all round, may be made to serve as a connecting link between regions
                    which cannot be continuously connected, by measuring its azimuth and distance
                    from a base-line in each region; the addition of latitudes at the azimuth
                    stations will much strengthen the work.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Collateral Astronomical Determinations. —</hi> Determinations
                    of azimuth, latitude, time, and longitude may all be required for geographical
                    reconnaissance,—the first two more particularly, as they can be obtained readily
                    with much accuracy; the fourth, being much the most troublesome to get and the
                    least reliable when got, is only re sorted to when it cannot be dispensed
                    with.</p>
                <p>The azimuth of an object may be determined without calculation by observing the
                    angles between the object and a star at equal altitudes on opposite sides of the
                    meridian; but it is generally found by observing the angle in one position of
                    the star and applying thereto the azimuth of the star as obtained by
                    calculation. In the spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">PZS,</hi> in which <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi> represents the pole, <hi rend="italic">Z</hi> the zenith,
                    and <hi rend="italic">S</hi> the star, the angle <hi rend="italic">PZS</hi> is
                    the star’s azimuth, which can be computed when any three parts of the triangle
                    are given. <hi rend="italic">PS,</hi> the polar distance of the star, is given
                    by the tables, and <hi rend="italic">PZ,</hi> the co-latitude, must be
                    previously determined; then, for the third part, we may have either (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">PSZ,</hi> a right angle, by observing a circumpolar star at its
                    maximum elongation, or (2) the hour angle <hi rend="italic">P</hi> for any star,
                    by taking the time of the observation, or (3) the zenith distance <hi
                    rend="italic">ZS,</hi> by measurement simultaneously with the horizontal angle.
                    Of these three methods the first is the most accurate, but it is not always
                    convenient; the second requires, in addition, special observations for time; the
                    third is generally the most convenient, for it may be performed between sunset
                    and dark, when the stars are coming into view, but when there is still
                    sufficient light to illuminate the wires of the telescope and the referring
                    mark, and thus enable lamps to be dispensed with.</p>
                <p>The latitude is most readily determined by measures of stars’ zenith distances on
                    the meridian, duly corrected for refraction; then, the polar distance being
                    known, the latitude is at once ascertained. The stars should be observed in
                    pairs of nearly equal zenith distance, north and south, for this eliminates all
                    constant instrumental errors, as of index, excentricity, and graduation, and
                    also errors in the adopted refractions. When a single star is employed,
                    circum-meridian observations of zenith distance may be taken and reduced to the
                    meridian by calculation; tables for the pole star are given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> which enable an observation, taken at any

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0742-0713"/> The time is usually best determined by measuring
                    the zenith distances of stars situated not far from the prime vertical; then,
                    the latitude and polar distance being known, the hour angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >P</hi> of the spherical triangle is found by calculation. Time may also be
                    determined by observing the transits of stars over the wires of the telescope of
                    a theodolite set up in the meridian.</p>
                <p>The longitude may be determined either absolutely, by purely astronomical
                    methods, as by observations of the moon’s motion, or differentially, with the
                    aid of telegraph lines and travelling chronometers. Absolute longitude is the
                    geographer’s great difficulty; for much time must be devoted to the
                    observations, and much more to their reduction, when undertaken with the object
                    of fixing the relative positions of the stations of a survey. The observations
                    are of various kinds,—(1) lunar distances, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the
                    distance between the moon and the sun or one of the stars given for this purpose
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac·,</hi> (2) lunar zenith distances,
                    observed at points of the moon’s path where the conditions are favourable; (3)
                    lunar transits over the meridian, observed with transits of the moon-culminating
                    stars given in the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac;</hi> (4) lunar
                    occultations of stars; (5) eclipses of the sun and moon; (6) eclipses of
                    Jupiter’s satellites. The first method requires the employment of a sextant or
                    other reflecting instrument; the second may be accomplished with either a
                    reflecting instrument or a theodolite; the third with a theodolite; for the last
                    three a good astronomical telescope is wanted. The first, when carried out
                    strictly, requires three observers,—one to measure the lunar distance, while the
                    others are measuring the zenith distances of the moon and the star; but, as the
                    last two are not wanted with great accuracy, the several observations may be
                    taken in succession by one person, and the observed zenith distances afterwards
                    adjusted to the time of the lunar distance.</p>
                <p>The effects of errors of observation in these methods are as follows. In (1) an
                    error in time produces the same error in the longitude, and an error of one
                    second of arc in the distance produces two seconds in time in the longitude. In
                    (2) an error of one second in time produces at least thirty seconds of time
                    error in the longitude, and one second of arc in the zenith distance at least
                    two seconds of time in the longitude. In (3) to (6) an error of time produces
                    the same error in the longitude. The first method is preferred by seamen and
                    travellers, who are more expert in the use of the sextant than of the
                    theodolite. The second method is preferred by those who are more familiar with
                    the theodolite, and who are equipped with one of good telescopic power. It gives
                    very good results when the observations are made at the most favourable time,
                    which occurs when the resultant of the moon’s motion in right ascension and in
                    declination lies in the direction of the observer’s zenith; this time may be
                    readily found by graphical projection on a chart of the heavens.</p>
                <p>Differential longitude may be determined chronometri-cally, on land as at sea, by
                    carrying about several wellrated chronometers and comparing their times with the
                    local times deduced from observations of the sun and stars; or
                    electro-telegraphically, by interchanging signals between two stations connected
                    by a telegraph wire, and ascertaining the local times at which the signals are
                    transmitted from and received at each station.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hypsometry.—</hi> Determinations of height form a very
                    necessary part of geographical reconnaissance. Whenever triangulation is
                    possible, vertical angles may be measured and the heights ascertained in regular
                    succession. But in a traverse this is scarcely practicable; breaks of continuity
                    in the verticals are liable to be of frequent occurrence, and then recourse must
                    be had to observations of the pressure and temperature of the atmosphere, or of
                    the temperature of the vapour of boiling water, from either of which fairly
                    correct heights may be deduced differentially under normal atmospheric
                    conditions in settled weather. The instruments employed for this purpose are
                    mercurial and aneroid baro meters and boiling-point thermometers; descriptions
                    of them, and the formulae employed in reducing the observa tions, are given
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Barometer</hi> (vol. iii. pp. 381-387). Here it is
                    only necessary to add that the date and hour of every barometric observation
                    should be recorded, and the observations referred for reduction to those taken
                    at the same time at one or more of the nearest standard meteorological
                    observatories; otherwise corrections should be given to the barometer readings
                    for the hour of the day and the month of the year, in order to reduce them as
                    nearly as may be to the local mean altitude of the mercury. The index errors of
                    aneroid barometers, being liable to variations, should be determined from time
                    to time by observations at stations of known altitude, or by comparisons with
                    boiling-point thermometers.</p>
                <p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nautical Surveying.</hi></p>
                <p>Nautical surveying has for its object the determination of the configuration of
                    land which is covered and concealed from view by water, more particularly along
                    the foreshore of a coast-line, and wherever navigation is carried on in
                    comparatively shallow waters and a knowledge of the depth of water is of great
                    importance; it has likewise to lay down the positions of oceanic islands,
                    shoals, and rocks, and generally to delineate whatever land exists immediately
                    above or below the surface of the ocean. Its methods differ according as they
                    are performed in or out of sight of land. When in the vicinity of land it is
                    preceded by a survey of the coast-line and a belt of the country beyond, which
                    must be of sufficient breadth to furnish suitable points of reference for the
                    survey operations on the water, and may have to be extended inland to embrace
                    those peaks of distant hill ranges which are prominent objects at sea for the
                    guidance of mariners. This done, the nautical survey is carried on in boats, by
                    taking soundings and determining the positions of the boats by observations to
                    some of the points already fixed on land. The observations are necessarily made
                    with sextants and magnetic compasses only. With the former the angles between
                    conspicuous land-marks are measured, and, as the angle between any two points is
                    half the magnitude of the angle between the same points at the centre of the
                    circle which passes through them and through the boat, the measurement of two
                    angles between three points enables two circles to be drawn on the chart, the
                    intersection of which will generally indicate the position of the boat with
                    sufficient accuracy. Occasionally, however, it happens that the positions of all
                    three points on shore and the boat also lie actually, or very nearly, on the
                    circumference of one and the same circle; then a bearing taken with the compass
                    will fix the position of the boat on the circumference of the circle. Time is
                    noted whenever soundings are taken, that due allowance may be made for the rise
                    and fall of the tide. All the sounding stations are not fixed by observations to
                    points on shore, as just indicated, but only a certain proportion, and between
                    them straight lines of sounding are run, with intervals measured either by a
                    patent log, or by time, or by counting the strokes of the oars; whenever
                    possible the lines of sounding are carried parallel to each other. Sounding is
                    the most important part of a nautical surveyor’s duty and that on which his
                    character mainly depends. It is essentially the work of the sailor, for in
                    carrying it out the accidents of wind and water—the direction and force of the
                    wind, the rise and fall of the tide, and the velocity of currents—must be duly
                    taken cognizance of and the work managed to suit wind and weather; on the other
                    hand, the work on land may be done by landsmen. Nautical surveying, out of sight
                    of land, rests on astronomical determinations of latitude and time, chronometric
                    longitudes, and dead reckoning by log.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0743-0714"/> When triangulation is resorted to, base-lines are
                    measured sometimes with a patent log, sometimes by sound, by noting the interval
                    in time between the flash and the report of a gun. The great length of modern
                    ironclads presents a base-line which is occasionally very convenient: points are
                    taken at each end of the ship, as far apart as possible, from which two
                    observers can see each other; they are carefully marked, and the distances
                    between them determined for future reference; then angles between moderately
                    distant objects and observers standing at these points, taken simultaneously
                    from each point, enable the required distances to be obtained. The magnetic
                    variation is determined by observing the azimuth of the sun, when on or near the
                    horizon, with a standard compass fixed amidship, care being taken beforehand to
                    determine any deviation of the needle which may be due to the attraction of the
                    surrounding ironwork, by observing the bearing of a distant mark as the ship is
                    swung round and her head laid on different points of the compass. See also <hi

                    The sheets of paper on which the details of the survey of any large area of
                    country are to be laid down must be furnished with a system of conventional
                    lines, drawn with a view to assimilate the margins of contiguous sheets and to
                    form a graticulation within which the details may be accurately inserted. The
                    graticule is sometimes rectangular, sometimes spherical, sometimes a combination
                    of both, as when points of which the latitude and longitude coordinates are
                    given have to be plotted within rectangular marginal lines. Spherical graticules
                    are constructed in various ways, usually in accordance with some specific method
                    of projection; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geography</hi> (Mathematical), vol. x.
                    p. 197. The following convenient method is not referable to any demonstrated
                    projection, but is generally employed on the Indian Survey. Suppose the
                    intersection of two meridians by two parallels to form a small spherical
                    quadrilateral, with sides of aliquot parts of a degree in latitude and in
                    longitude; let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the length of each of the meridional
                    arcs, <hi rend="italic">p, p</hi> the lengths of the arcs on the upper and lower
                    parallels, and let <hi rend="italic">q</hi> be a diameter, then <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi> =√ <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi>. <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>; thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,p,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> ' being given, <hi rend="italic">q</hi>
                    is calculated. With these data, which are tabulated for different arcs and
                    scales, the corner points of a number of quadrilaterals are laid off in
                    succession on either side of an adopted meridian, and lines are drawm through
                    the points to indicate the collateral meridians and the parallels of latitude.
                    The latter are always curved, more or less sensibly; the former are also curved,
                    though in a much less degree, being concave to their initial meridian, and the
                    more so the farther they are from it. When the area is small and the scale
                    large, the meridians are practically straight lines, and the several sheets of a
                    map, each projected on its own meridian, will fit together closely when carried
                    on in any direction. But, when the area is large—exceeding 8 or 10 square
                    degrees —and the scale small, the sheets will not fit together continuously
                    unless they are projected with reference to a single meridian for the whole map,
                    to which the meridians on either side will be increasingly concave, or unless
                    all the meridians are made straight lines, by slightly contracting each of the
                    intermediate arcs of parallel to a length which is exactly proportioned to the
                    lengths and relative distances of the upper and lower parallels of the map from
                    it. There must be some distortion in either case: in the first, meridians which
                    are actually straight lines are represented as being curved; in the second,
                    straight meridians are obtained, but the distances between them are exact only
                    on the upper and lower parallels, and are too small elsewhere, more particularly
                    on the middle parallel, the length of which necessarily exceeds the mean length
                    of the upper and lower parallels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    But distortion is inevitable whenever a spherical surface is projected on a
                    plane.</p>
                <p>When a map is constructed in rectangular sheets, some station is adopted as the
                    origin and its meridian as the principal axis, to which the corner points of the
                    sheets are to be referred; the coordinates of these points are given such
                    dimensions as are most suitable for the size and scale of the map, and are
                    equivalent to the rectangular spherical coordinates of imaginary points on the
                    curved surface of the earth, at corresponding distances from the origin and its
                    meridian. These being given, the distances of the points from the origin in
                    latitude and longitude may be computed, as already shown (p. 706); thus data
                    become available for projecting the graticulation of meridians and parallels
                    within the rectangular marginal lines of each sheet, or for introducing the
                    divisions of latitude and longitude on the marginal lines if preferred.
                    Conversely, when the latitudes and longitudes are given, the rectangular
                    spherical coordinates are computed and the marginal lines projected around the
                    graticulation. Filling in is then commenced: the principal stations are laid
                    down by their coordinates and the topographical details pencilled around them by
                    copying or tracing the field sheets of the survey; the names and the outlines
                    are then inked in; the shading for delineating the features and general
                    configuration of the ground is usually done last of all. The manner in which the
                    details are inked in and rendered permanent depends on whether the map is to be
                    reproduced by hand only—as when it is to be engraved or lithographed—or whether
                    in its reproduction photography is to be employed and the action of light
                    invoked, either in entire supersession of or in partial co-operation with the
                    labour of the draftsman. In the former case the map is made as perfect a
                    pictorial representation of the surface of the ground as possible, the hill
                    features being represented artistically in mezzotint shading with a brush or in
                    chalk drawing, and a variety of colours used to facilitate discrimination of
                    differences of topographical detail. In the latter no colours are used which
                    will not photograph well, nor flat shades of any colour, nor—as a rule—mezzotint
                    shading, but only some substitute therefor in pen and ink. This last condition
                    is essential for the commonly employed processes of photozincography and
                    photo-lithography; but endeavours have recently been made, with some degree of
                    success, to reproduce mapping in middle tones by the processes of photocollotype
                    and photo-gravure.</p>
                <p>Photography is much employed as an auxiliary in mapping; for when a map is to be
                    published on various scales the hand-drawn details of the largest scale edition
                    may be reduced by its means as accurately as by the familiar pantagraph, and of
                    course very much more rapidly. Thus in the Ordnance Survey town maps on the
                    scale of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 500</hi> are
                    reduced to the scale of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    2500</hi> for incorporation into the parish maps; the latter are reduced for
                    insertion in the 6-inch maps, and they in turn for the 1-inch map. By limiting
                    the dimensions of each sheet for reduction to 3 feet by 2, and by a judicious
                    use of stops to lenses, the reductions are made without any error in scale or
                    any distortion that can be detected by the most rigid examination. But
                    photography reduces every part of the original alike, the printing of words and
                    names as well as the topographical details, and it reproduces all the minor and
                    less import-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n744/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0744-0715"/> ant as well as the more important features; hence
                    a reduction is rarely suited for reproduction without intermediate modification,
                    the printing being generally too small to be easily legible, and the mass of
                    minor detail tending to confuse the principal sub-lines. The draftsman is
                    therefore called in and the procedure so arranged as to obtain the best results
                    with the least labour. Either he may construct a new map by tracing from a
                    silver print of the photograph whatever topographical details are required for
                    it and omitting the rest, or he may ink in such details at once with black ink
                    on a blue print taken from a transfer of the photograph to stone or zinc, in
                    both cases adding names and writing of appropriate sizes; either result may be
                    reproduced by photography, as the unblackened details of the blue print will
                    disappear in the process. This done, a transfer to stone or zinc may be made
                    from the second photograph for the printing off. Prints from photographic
                    reproductions to full scale exhibit all the blemishes of the hand drawing and
                    somewhat exaggerate them, whereas prints from photo-reductions are freer from
                    blemish, and often as clear and sharp as good hand lithographs. In employing a
                    process of double photography, therefore, the first photo is usually made on a
                    larger scale than that for publication; the lines of the printing and
                    topographical detail are correspondingly exaggerated by the draftsman; and then
                    the second photo is a reduction, which should be sharp, clear, and free from
                    blemish.</p>
                <p>IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Map Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>Various processes are employed for the reproduction of maps in large numbers for
                    general issue; some are purely manual, the map being redrawn by hand on copper,
                    stone, or other substance presenting a suitable surface from which prints may be
                    taken, or on paper specially prepared for transfer to such substance; others are
                    carried out with the aid of photography, whereby an exact copy of the original
                    can be obtained either directly upon, or for subsequent transfer to, the surface
                    to be printed from. The former include the processes of copper-plate engraving
                    and lithography, which are the oldest, and still in some respects the best of
                    all, but slow and expensive; the latter include the processes of
                    photo-lithography, photo-zincography, photo-gravure, and photo-collotype.
                    Engraving on stone is much employed on the Continent for map work, being cheaper
                    and quicker than engraving on copper. Electro-metallurgic processes are
                    frequently employed in connexion with copper-plate engraving, either to protect
                    and harden the surface of the plate with a facing of steel or to furnish
                    duplicates to be printed from, instead of the plate itself being used; sometimes
                    the wear of the plate is prevented by transferring a print from it to a
                    lithographic stone or a zinc plate, from which the printing is done in its
                    stead. By the anastatic process an old print of a map may be transferred to a
                    zinc plate to be printed from.</p>
                <p>Engraving may be performed on copper, wood, zinc, or stone; see vol. viii. p.
                    435. As done on copper plate for mapping, it is a combination of ploughing with
                    the burin and etching with an acid, the former being used for the names and
                    topographical outlines, the latter for the features of the ground. The system
                    adopted in the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain—where it has been largely
                    employed and carried to great perfection—is as follows. The 6-inch maps of the
                    survey are engraved on copper plates measuring 36 by 24 inches within the
                    marginal lines and weighing about 35 ft; the 1-inch maps are 18 by 12 for
                    England and 24 by 18 for Scotland. The corners of the maps, the prescribed
                    marginal subdivisions, and the trigonometrical points are first marked on the
                    plate by a scoring machine, in which it is laid, and which is provided with a
                    travelling carriage holding a steel pricker. The carriage is moved along a
                    graduated scale and the pricker along another scale at right angles to the
                    former, and all points of which the rectangular coordinates are known are laid
                    off by vernier-read measurements from the two scales. The plate is then removed
                    from the scoring machine, heated, and given a thin coating of white wax, to form
                    a surface on which the topographical details are plotted before the graving is
                    commenced. This surface is divided into a number of rectangles by fine lines
                    joining marginal subdivisions, the distances between which are usually so
                    regulated as to introduce sixteen of the survey sheets on the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2500</hi> scale into one
                    sheet on the 6-inch scale. The reductions to this scale are made by photography,
                    and the subsequent reductions to the 1-inch scale either by the pantagraph or by
                    photography. Tracings of the reductions in lamp-black, made to fit into the
                    rectangles, are transferred to the wax ground by nibbing with a steel burnisher.
                    The plate is then ready to be placed in the hands of the engravers, who complete
                    first the outlines, then the printing and writing, and afterwards the ornament,
                    each class of work being usually done by a different person. The figures of
                    latitudes, longitudes, and altitudes, and various conventional symbols, are
                    stamped with steel punches. Parks and sands are ruled with a dotting wheel, and
                    buildings shaded in lines with a ruling machine. When a plate of the 1-inch map
                    is being engraved, all the printing is completed, and line-engraving with the
                    exception of the contour lines, and then an electrotype duplicate of the plate
                    is taken. The contour-lines are engraved on the duplicate, and the hills arc
                    etched on the original plate; thus two editions of the map are obtained, one
                    with contours but without hills, the other with hills but without contours, the
                    topographical details and writing being the same in both. In etching, the
                    surface of the plate is thinly coated with an acid-resisting substance composed
                    of asphalt, Burgundy pitch, and virgin wax, forming an etching ground, on which
                    the outlines of the hill features are traced, and then marked through with a
                    needle which removes the ground where it passes, exposing the surface of the
                    copper. Aquafortis is applied to bite in the finer lines and then poured off;
                    the parts which are bitten sufficiently are painted over with “stopping varnish
                    and acid is again applied. The processes of stopping out and biting in are
                    alternately repeated until all the required tints from the lightest to the
                    darkest are produced. In printing from a copper plate, a much more powerful
                    press has to be used than in printing from stone or zinc, as the ink lies in the
                    furrows that have been ploughed or bitten into the plate and not on its surface;
                    the process of printing is also much slower. In engraving on stone or zinc, the
                    surface is coated with a preparation of gum and lamp-black, and on it the detail
                    is traced with red chalk and afterwards cut in with very fine steel or diamond
                    points so as just to lay bare the surface of the ground without penetrating to
                    any depth, as in copperplate engraving. A little oil having been rubbed over the
                    surface, the gummy composition is washed away and printing-ink applied; the
                    printing is performed almost exactly in the same way as in ordinary lithography,
                    except that the printing-ink is in the first instance spread over the stone or
                    the zinc plate with a dabber instead of a roller.</p>
                <p>Electrotyping is employed to conserve work engraved on copper, either by
                    depositing a thin surface of steel over an engraved plate, which enables it to
                    be printed from very much oftener without injury, or by producing a duplicate to
                    be employed in its stead in the printing. In the latter case, a double process
                    is gone through: first, a cast or matrix is produced in relief by the deposition
                    of copper on the surface of the original plate, and then an intaglio of the
                    matrix—which is therefore a duplicate of the original—is formed by depositing
                    copper on the surface of the matrix. For details of these processes, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electro-Metallurgy,</hi> vol. viii. p. 114. In the Ordnance
                    Survey electrotyping was first employed to obtain duplicates on which to make
                    the corrections and additions necessary to show the growth of railroads and
                    towns since the time of the original survey. The alterations are effected more
                    easily when obsolete details are scraped off the electrotype matrix than when
                    they are scooped out of an intaglio; the original plate is also preserved
                    intact.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the French
                    and Austrian surveys corrections are made on fresh copper deposited by
                    electricity over the faulty parts, which are scooped out.</p></note>
                    Electrotyping is further serviceable in producing the two editions of the
                    general map, one with contour lines, the other with hill-shading, already
                    mentioned, as well as editions for geological and other details. It is also
                    serviceable in effecting a combination of portions of several plates: matrices
                    of the different portions are riveted together to form a single plate; then an
                    intaglio of this plate is taken, on which any details lost at the junction of
                    the matrices are made good by hand. The dimensions of a full-sized plate are 38½
                    by 26½ inches; the weight of a matrix is 18 lb, and of the duplicate 38 lb.</p>
                <p>There are two essentially distinct processes of lithography,—one in which the map
                    is wholly drawn by hand on the stone, the other, a much quicker but coarser
                    process, in which it is traced with greasy ink on specially prepared paper,
                    which is then laid face downwards on the stone. When lithographs are to be
                    produced by a single printing, all hill features, as well as topographical
                    outlines and names, are drawn with a pen or fine camel-hair brush in ink of one
                    colour. Double printing is necessary when the hills are drawn in chalk, two
                    stones being required, one for the chalk work, the other for the pen-and-ink
                    work; and in chromo-lithography a separate stone is required for the work in
                    each colour. For full details, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lithography,</hi> vol.
                    xiv. p. 699.</p>
                <p>Zincography has of late years largely taken the place of lithography for printing
                    from hand-drawn transfers, though not for hand-drawing on the surface of the
                    zinc, as on stone and copper. Zinc plates are less costly and bulky than
                    lithographic stones, and are much more conveniently handled: thus a plate
                    measuring about 43 by 28½ inches and <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> of an inch thick weighs 60 ft, is easily carried by
                    one man, and costs 16 shillings; a lithographic stone of the same surface is 4½
                    inches thick, weighs 450 ft, requires four men<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n745/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0745-0716"/> to lift it, and costs about £7. Prints from
                    transfers to a zinc plate are as satisfactory as prints from transfers to stone,
                    and there is no liability of the plate being fractured in the press, which not
                    unfrequently happens to the stone. The surface of the plate is prepared by
                    scraping it evenly all over with a razor blade in parallel lines, until all
                    irregularities are removed; the plate is then bent so as to present a slightly
                    convex surface, which is ground with pumice-stone and water, and smoothed with a
                    piece of steatite, and then given a grained surface with sand. It is flattened
                    by being passed through a press, after which it is ready to receive the
                    transfer. The subsequent procedure depends, as in lithography, on the
                    circumstance that greasy substances do not mix with water and are repelled by
                    gummy substances. The greasy ink lines of the transfer are readily absorbed by
                    the surface of the plate; then a preparation of gum and decoction of gall nuts
                    (to which a little phosphoric acid is added), applied to the entire surface of
                    the plate, serves to etch the blank ground without affecting the lines of the
                    transfer; but it prevents the ink from spreading, and also fills up the pores of
                    the blank parts of the plate with a gummy substance, which repels a greasy ink.
                    Printing ink, therefore, applied as usual with a roller to the entire surface of
                    the plate adheres to the inked lines only and can be readily washed off the
                    blank spaces, and then a print taken will show the inked lines only. The tracing
                    for transfer is drawn on paper thinly coated with starch to prevent the graphic
                    writing-ink from soaking into it; the ink is a mixture of Paris black, Castile
                    soap, white wax, tallow or sweet oil, and shellac, which being greasy is readily
                    absorbed by the zinc. The tracing is laid face downwards on the plate and passed
                    several times under the pressure of the roller of the printing press. It is then
                    wetted and peeled off, the ink remaining on the zinc. The surface of the plate
                    is again washed with the etching liquid, which removes stains from the blank
                    spaces and renders them more susceptible of being equably wetted with water, and
                    also—after a few drops of turpentine have been added—removes the unabsorbed
                    writing-ink and helps to fix the lines. The plate is then ready to be printed
                    from. The printing-ink is composed of lamp-black—with a little Prussian blue
                    added—and linseed oil varnish of a thickness depending on the temperature and
                    the subject. Small corrections on the plate can be made by removing the surface
                    with a strong solution of hydrate of potash, and then preparing a new surface to
                    be drawn on by applying dilute nitric acid and afterwards washing off the
                    nitrate of zinc.</p>
                <p>Anastatic printing produces facsimiles of any inked print by transfer to a zinc
                    plate, the inked lines on it being absorbed in a greater or less degree by the
                    plate. The print is laid face downwards on blotting-paper, and brushed with a
                    solution of nitric acid diluted with five times its bulk of water until
                    thoroughly and evenly saturated; it is then placed face downwards on a zinc
                    plate with a well-grained surface, and passed under the roller of a powerful
                    copper-plate printing press. The grease of the ink, being set free by the acid,
                    adheres to the surface of the plate; but, as the amount of ink absorbed is much
                    less than in the case of an ordinary transfer, it is strengthened by working up
                    with lithographic ink, oil, and gum water until the surface is sufficiently
                    strong to bear etching with the usual preparation of gum, nut galls, and
                    phosphoric acid. The plate is now ready to be printed from in the usual manner.
                    If the original print is an old one, it must first have its ink softened by
                    immersion in hot water containing half an ounce of caustic strontia for every
                    pint of water, the time of immersion varying, with the condition of the print,
                    from a few minutes to an hour. A print well worked up is often superior to the
                    original.</p>
                <p>Photography having already been described in detail (see vol. xviii. p. 821 ),
                    its application to mapping and map-printing need only be noticed here. The
                    action of light can be employed either by placing the map in contact with a
                    sheet of sensitized paper and against a glass plate in a printing frame, when
                    the light will pass through the map and produce a picture of it on the paper, or
                    by using a camera furnished with an object-glass, through which rays of light
                    from the map are transmitted so as to produce a picture on a sensitized glass
                    plate, which can afterwards be printed from. The best known of the processes in
                    which the camera is not used is the “cyanotype”; the paper is sensitized with a
                    mixture containing nearly equal proportions of solutions of ammonio-citrate of
                    iron and the ferrid-cyanide of potassium; the prints give white lines on a
                    dark-blue ground, and are very inexpensive. There are other processes of
                    printing with the salts of iron, uranium, &amp;c., which give an exact
                    transcript of the original drawing with dark lines on a white ground. But they
                    are only suitable for maps drawn in pen and ink not larger than the glass plate
                    of the printing frame; being therefore only serviceable in special cases when
                    few copies are wanted, they are little employed and may be regarded more as
                    curiosities than as ordinary methods of map-printing. Photography is generally
                    effected with the aid of a camera, and employed to obtain a negative of a map on
                    glass, from which prints may be taken either for use <hi rend="italic">per
                    se</hi> or for transfer to a flat surface of zinc, stone, or other suitable
                    material to print from. The map is usually attached to a board suspended
                    vertically in an adjust able frame, while the camera is placed on an adjustable
                    stand set at right angles to the map frame on a tramway, along which it can be
                    moved to any desired distance from the map. The camera is furnished with a
                    ground-glass focusing screen, on which is pencilled a rectangle whose dimensions
                    are proportional to those of a corresponding rectangle on the map, in the ratio
                    of the scale of the required photograph to that of the map. The map and the
                    focusing screen are brought into parallelism at such a distance that the image
                    of the rectangle on the map exactly coincides with the rectangle on the focusing
                    screen. A sensitized collodion plate is then substituted for the screen and a
                    negative taken, which is afterwards “fixed” and “intensified” so as to produce
                    the greatest transparence in the lines and an almost opaque density of the
                    ground. Printing from a negative is usually performed by the action of light
                    when only a few copies are wanted, and mechanically when many are wanted; the
                    prints are taken directly from the negative in the one instance, and from a
                    transfer of the negative to the surface of a stone or metal plate in the other.
                    Of the processes of printing directly from the negative, silver printing, the
                    oldest, is as yet unsurpassed for the delicacy of its results, but it is
                    expensive and perishable; the prints are taken on paper coated with albumen
                    containing an alkaline chloride, such as common salt, floated on a bath of
                    nitrate of silver, and allowed to dry in the dark. After exposure to light in a
                    printing frame, the prints are washed, toned with a solution of gold, and then
                    fixed in a bath of hyposulphate of soda, which dissolves all the remaining
                    unaltered chloride of silver. At the Ordnance Survey office platinum printing is
                    now (1887) largely used instead of silver printing for all purposes where only a
                    few copies of a map are required. It is more expensive, but the prints are
                    absolutely permanent and are produced more quickly than silver prints. Their
                    rich velvety black colour and freedom from glaze render them peculiarly
                    suitable. The paper is sensitized with a preparation of platinum and ferric
                    oxalate. After exposure to light, the image is developed almost instantaneously
                    by laying the print on a hot solution of potassic oxalate; it is then washed in
                    successive baths of dilute acid to remove the soluble iron salts, and after that
                    in a few changes of water. Various processes of “collo-chromate” printing are
                    also most usefully employed in mapprinting; they depend on the reaction of the
                    salts of chromium— particularly the alkaline bichromates—on gelatin, gum,
                    albumen, or other colloid substances, which, in proportion to the amount of the
                    action of light upon them, become more or less insoluble in and unabsorbent of
                    water, and acquire the property of taking up greasy ink and not attracting
                    plumbago or other fine dry pigment in powder. When the subject is in line the
                    print is taken on paper that is usually coated with a mixture of gelatin and
                    bichromate of potash, coloured with Indian ink or any other suitable pigment;
                    after a few minutes’ exposure in the copying frame the paper is plunged into
                    tepid water, which dissolves the unaltered gelatin in the blank parts of the
                    print—they have been protected from the light under the dark parts of the
                    negative—leaving a clear image in pigment on a white ground. When the subject is
                    in half-tone, the gelatin film has to be detached from the paper that it may be
                    developed by being washed on the unexposed side, a temporary support being
                    employed to preserve the image from injury during the washing; the most delicate
                    shades in the half-tones are thus perfectly preserved.</p>
                <p>In the processes noticed above it is necessary to repeat the operation by
                    exposure to light for every print produced; the rate of printing will therefore
                    be more or less dependent on the sensitiveness of the paper, the strength of the
                    light, and the condition of the atmosphere. In the processes about to be
                    described these disadvantages are obviated by transferring the photographic
                    image to a surface of stone or metal, from which prints may be made mechanically
                    in any numbers independently of light or weather. The photo-mechanical processes
                    are broadly divisible into two classes,— one comprising photo-lithography,
                    photo-zincography, and photo-typography, for the reproduction of subjects in
                    line only; the other, photo-collotype and photo-gravure, for subjects in
                    mezzotint or half-tone as well as line.</p>
                <p>Photo-lithography and the analogous photo-zincography are the processes which
                    have hitherto been most extensively employed for map printing. They are the
                    simplest to carry out; they allow the photographs of several sections of a map
                    which may be too large to be reproduced as a whole to be combined; and additions
                    and corrections may be readily made by hand on the stone or zinc plate. The
                    prints for transfer from the negatives are taken on paper coated with a mixture
                    of gelatin and potassium bichromate, as in the pigment printing process, except
                    that the greasy ink or colouring matter is not mixed with the gelatin, but
                    applied evenly over the surface of the prints after exposure to the light. The
                    inked print is immersed for a few minutes in tepid water to soften the gelatin
                    still remaining soluble in the parts not acted upon by light, and is then laid
                    on a sloping plate and washed with a soft sponge until all the unaltered soluble
                    gelatin and the ink overlying it are removed. The lines on which the light has
                    acted remain insoluble and retain the ink, forming a clear image of the subject
                    in a greasy<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n746/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0746-0717"/> ink. When a map is photographed in several
                    sections, as often happens, each section overlaps well all round to enable the
                    transfers from the different negatives to be neatly joined together without
                    showing lines of juuction; if the whole is too large to be printed on a single
                    sheet of paper, it is cut up into sections for printing separately.</p>
                <p>The object of photo-typography is to obtain by photographic agency a surface
                    block which may be set up with type and printed in the same way as a woodcut.
                    The image may be obtained on a zinc plate by transfer in the same way as for
                    photo-zincography, or it may be printed directly from a reversed negative. In
                    the latter case the zinc plate is usually prepared with a thin coating of
                    bitumen, a substance which has the property of becoming insoluble under the
                    influence of light, so that, when after exposure the plate is washed with
                    turpentine or benzole, the image remains on the zinc, while the ground is washed
                    away. In both cases the image is strengthened by careful inking and by the
                    application of powdered resin, which the plate is heated sufficiently to melt.
                    The image is then etched with nitric acid. The operations of inking, applying
                    resin, and biting with acid are repeated several times, until the plate is
                    bitten sufficiently deeply to give clear prints. In another process, which is
                    perhaps preferable for fine work, a mould is obtained by electrotyping a relief
                    in swollen gelatin, the surface of which has been metallized with plumbago or
                    bronze powder. These processes are largely used for producing small maps to
                    illustrate books and newspapers, but not for maps of ordinary size.</p>
                <p>The three mechanical processes just noticed are only applicable to maps drawn in
                    line, and to get good prints every line should be of the same blackness, though
                    of different breadth. Attempts have been made to reproduce brush-shaded
                    drawings, exhibiting continuous gradations of shade, by photo-lithography and
                    photo-zincography, but with very partial success, and only by breaking up and
                    destroying the continuity of gradation. The following processes are specially
                    suited for reproducing maps in half-tone.</p>
                <p>In photo-collotype, so-called from the printing surface being of gelatin, a plate
                    with a perfectly smooth surface, usually of thick glass, either is coated with a
                    sensitive mixture of gelatin and bichromate of potash, upon which the
                    photographic image is produced by the action of light through a <hi
                    rend="italic">reversed</hi> negative, or is employed to support a gelatin film
                    on which the image has been imprinted from an ordinary negative, and which is
                    attached to the plate with suitable cement. The gelatin when properly moistened
                    possesses the valuable property of receiving a greater or less amount of ink in
                    different parts of the image in exact proportion to the intensity of the action
                    of the light on each part; thus it is capable of reproducing the most delicate
                    gradations of shade. The process is admirable for maps of small size, which only
                    require a single plate, but is not suited for making a combination of sections
                    to form a map of ordinary size; nor can additions or corrections be made on the
                    gelatin film, which is, moreover, so tender that it does not readily permit of a
                    large number of prints of uniform quality being taken, and is easily
                    damaged.</p>
                <p>The several methods of obtaining an incised image on a copper plate by means of
                    photography are broadly divisible into the two groups of electrotyping and
                    etching processes; one of each will be briefly noticed. (1) A positive pigment
                    print, forming a relief in hardened gelatin, is developed on a silvered copper
                    plate by the ordinary operations of the autotype or pigment printing process; it
                    is then blackleaded and copper is deposited on it to form an electrotype
                    intaglio, from which prints may be taken in the usual way, three to four weeks
                    being required for the deposition of enough copper to produce a plate of
                    sufficient thickness. (2) A negative pigment print is developed on a highly
                    polished copper plate, upon which a very fine grain of powdered resin has been
                    deposited and fixed by heat. The intaglio is obtained directly on the plate by
                    biting in with a solution of perchloride of iron, which penetrates the gelatin
                    film with comparative ease in those parts representing the shades and lines of a
                    map, where there is little or no gelatin, and thus bites the copper to a
                    considerable depth, while in the parts representing the blank spaces and ground
                    of the map, where the gelatin is thicker, it penetrates with more and more
                    difficulty as the thickness of the gelatin increases, and in the highest blanks
                    should leave the copper untouched. The operation of biting takes only a few
                    minutes, and the gravure is remarkable for its delicacy of gradation and
                    richness of effect; there is, however, some difficulty in etching to the proper
                    depth so that the plate may stand much printing without the loss of the finest
                    tint. In both cases the copper plates have to be protected by a facing of steel
                    before they can be printed from. The processes have not yet been used to any
                    great extent for maps with half-tones, but they are very promising. For maps in
                    line the first method gives excellent results, and is largely employed in the
                    Austrian and Italian surveys.</p>
                <p>X. <hi rend="smallcaps">Instruments.</hi></p>
                <p>The instruments employed in survey operations are broadly divisible into two
                    classes, one for making the requisite linear and angular measurements on the
                    ground, the other for plotting the data thus acquired on paper’ and for
                    measuring from the map, when completed, lengths and areas which it may not be
                    convenient to calculate from the numerical data. As a rule different instruments
                    are employed for the mensuration on the ground and for the plotting on paper;
                    but to this rule there is a notable exception in the plane table, by means of
                    which all bearings may be drawn directly on paper with a sight rule, without
                    previous measurement of any kind, and thus a plot of the ground may be
                    constructed without employing any other instrument.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Field Instruments.—</hi> These are of two classes,—linear, for
                    deter-Innung distances directly by actual measurement along the surface of the
                    ground, and angular, for determining the bearings of, or the angles between, any
                    objects. Some instruments are automatic, as the needle, which points to the
                    magnetic north, the plumb-line and the spirit-level, which indicate the
                    direction of gravity, and hypsometers of various kinds, for measuring altitudes;
                    others are entirely controlled by the manipulator. Some require to be rigidly
                    supported on the ground, as measuring bars and theodolites; others are adapted
                    for flexible supports, as reflecting and magnetic instruments, which may be
                    employed either on land or on the oscillating deck of a ship at sea. Some, as
                    magnetic compasses, measure angles in the horizontal plane only; others, as
                    theodolites, in two planes,—one horizontal, the other vertical; others, as
                    reflecting instruments, in all planes; others, as levelling instruments, measure
                    nothing, but simply indicate a plane of reference. And there are certain
                    instruments by which angles are measured in the ordinary way, and direct
                    distances are determined by micrometric measures of the small angles subtended
                    at a distance by objects of known dimensions.</p>
                <p>Linear instruments are of two classes,—one for exact measurement of base-lines
                    the lengths of which are required to be known with great precision, the other
                    for ordinary and rough measurements. Among the former may be included the Colby
                    apparatus of compensation bars and microscopes, described in sect. I., § 2 (p.
                    696 above), Bessel’s apparatus, those of Struve and the United States Coast
                    Survey, and Porro’s (adopted by the Spaniards and the French in Algiers), which
                    have already been described in <hi rend="smallcaps">Earth (Figure of the),</hi>
                    vol. vii. pp. 598, 600, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Geodesy,</hi> vol. x. pp. 163,
                    164. For less exact but still essentially accurate measures the instruments most
                    commonly employed are the brass or steel chain of 100 links, the graduated
                    metallic tape, and the offset pole.</p>
                <p>For reconnaissance and rough measurement, perambulators, with wheels of known
                    periphery and dials to indicate the number of revolutions, are largely used in
                    India. Crinoline wire has been employed with advantage in Australia; it is so
                    light that a length of 1000 feet or more may be easily carried, rolled on a
                    drum, by one man, who pays it out as wanted; he is usually followed by another,
                    who commences rolling it up at the opposite end when an entire length has been
                    laid out on the ground. Air lines are sometimes measured by stretching the wire
                    over the tops of trees in valleys obstructed with forest, also the breadths of
                    rivers by resting the wire on logs anchored at suitable intervals to support it
                    above water.</p>
                <p>Angle-measuring instruments are of two classes, direct and reflecting. Both are
                    provided with an aligner, usually a telescope, which is pivoted over the centre
                    of the graduated circle or sector: in one the aligner is pointed in succession
                    to any two objects the angle between which is being measured; in the other it is
                    pointed to one object, while an image of the second is thrown on the first by
                    double reflexion from a pair of mirrors. Reflecting instruments are largely
                    employed in nautical surveys, as they can be held by the hand and do not require
                    a rigid support; but they are very rarely used in land surveys. A description of
                    them will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Sextant</hi> (vol. xxi. pp.
                    724-725). They give the angle in the plane in which they are held; and, whenever
                    this plane is sensibly oblique to the horizon, the angle must be reduced by
                    calculation to the plane of the horizon before it can be employed in the work of
                    a land survey. The other instruments give the required horizontal angles,
                    whatever the altitudes of the objects observed.</p>
                <p>The circles of angle-measuring instruments are usually divided into 360 equal
                    parts called degrees, and subdivided into spaces ranging downwards from thirty
                    to five minutes of arc, according as the diameter of the circle is increased.
                    Smaller arcs are measured by interpolation between the subdivisions, with the
                    aid of a circle reader which moves with the aligner. All instruments except
                    those of the simplest form are supplied with one or more circle readers and
                    spirit-levels and a telescope; these important adjuncts, which are common to so
                    many instruments, will therefore be first described, and afterwards the more
                    important instruments which are employed in connexion with survey
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Circle readers are of two kinds,—the vernier and the microscope.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0747-0718"/> Both are held over the circle at the extremity of
                    a radial arm pivoted over its centre. The vernier moves in contact with the
                    surface of the circle, while the microscope views it a short distance off; the
                    former is usually applied to circles whose diameters do not exceed 12 inches,
                    the latter to those of larger diameter. Both kinds of reader are applicable to
                    linear scales as well as to graduated circles, the microscope being usually
                    employed when most precision is desired.</p>
                <p>The vernier is so called after its inventor, a Frenchman. Its principle is very
                    simple. The space between any convenient number, <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> of
                    graduations on the circle is set off on the vernier and divided into (<hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> +1) equal parts; then some one division of the vernier will
                    always coincide with a graduation of the circle. On counting the divisions from
                    the index onwards it is found that the coinciding division, say the with, of the
                    vernier is opposite the with graduation of the circle, counting from the last
                    one passed by the index. This indicates that the distance of the index from the
                    last graduation is parts of the space between the graduations; <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> is invariably taken as an odd number, such that the unit of <hi
                    rend="italic">{n</hi> +1 ) may be some convenient aliquot part of the circle, as
                    a minute for a circle divided into degree spaces.</p>
                <p>The micrometer microscope presents the combination of object and eye glasses met
                    with in ordinary microscopes, with the addition of a wire-carrying diaphragm,
                    movable by a screw, for micrometric measurements in the plane of the focus of
                    the object-glass. The tube is conical at the object end and cylindrical at the
                    eye end; the box of the micrometer is mounted between these two parts at right
                    angles with the visual axis. The tube is held at the extremity of the arm of an
                    alidade, in a collar in which it may be moved closer to or away from the surface
                    of the circle, or be turned round so as to place the micrometer tangentially to
                    the circle. The distance between the micrometer and the object-glass is usually
                    about four times that between the object-glass and the face of the circle, and
                    thus a correspondingly magnified image of the spaces between the graduations is
                    obtained in the plane of measurement. The objectglass is held in a small tube
                    which can be screwed in or out of the principal tube, to enable the length of
                    the image to be adjusted to an exact integral number of revolutions of the
                    micrometer. The box of the micrometer and the wire diaphragm are rectangular,
                    the latter sliding to the right or left within the former. Slow motion is
                    communicated to the diaphragm by the micrometer screw, which passes into it
                    through a collar in one side of the box, against which the shoulder of the screw
                    is pressed by an internal spiral spring acting against the sides of the
                    diaphragm and the box. The screw is furnished with a circular head divided into
                    a number of equal parts—usually 60, each equivalent to 1" for circular arcs, and
                    100 for linear scales—and is rotated opposite an index arm fixed on the box;
                    complete revolutions are marked by the teeth of a stationary comb, which is
                    fixed above the wire of the diaphragm and viewed with it through the
                    eye-piece.</p>
                <p>The spirit-level consists of a glass tube not quite filled with alcohol, a small
                    quantity of air being left, which rises as a bubble to the highest part of the
                    tube. In small and coarse levels the diameter of the tube is largest in the
                    middle and decreases uniformly towards the ends, which are closed by the
                    blow-pipe; in long and delicate levels the tube is cylindrical, but with a
                    longitudinal portion of the interior surface ground to the curvature of a circle
                    of greater or less radius according as the level is designed to be more or less
                    sensitive, and it is sometimes closed by circular glass stoppers cemented into
                    the ends. When the tube is held horizontally, with the curved surface of the
                    interior uppermost, the middle part is occupied by the air bubble. Lines are
                    etched on the outer surface at equal distances from the central point, to enable
                    the tube to be set with the bubble exactly in the middle, or a scale graduated
                    throughout its entire length is provided, to enable any deviation from
                    centricality to be measured and the corresponding dislevelment to be calculated
                    and allowed for subsequently in the reduction of the observations. The glass
                    tube is commonly fixed in a metal tube, with plaster of Paris for protection;
                    but, as it is then liable, under changes of temperature, to torsion and strain,
                    which may sensibly alter its curvature, it is preferable to place it in a
                    metallic cradle and rest it on cork bearings, with due provision against
                    sliding, the whole being covered with a glass cylinder if need be for further
                    protection. The metallic cradle or tube is attached to any instrument on which
                    the level is to be mounted by adjusting screws, for setting it correctly with
                    reference to the axis of rotation with which it is associated. The value of a
                    division of the scale, in seconds of arc, is usually called the “run,” and is
                    determined by attaching the level with its scale to a (generally) vertical
                    circle, and taking both the circle and the bubble end readings in different
                    positions of the circle. As the length of the bubble is much affected by changes
                    of temperature, and the curvature of the tube may not be identical at all
                    points, values of the run are commonly obtained under widely differing
                    temperatures.</p>
                <p>The telescope consists of a tube, carrying an achromatic objectglass and an
                    eye-piece which holds either a pair of lenses for viewing the inverted image
                    transmitted by the object-glass or a combination of four lenses for inverting
                    the image and causing all objects to be viewed naturally. The former is usually
                    employed for observing celestial objects, the latter for observing terrestrial.
                    The field of view being more or less extensive, a central point is established
                    in the tube, usually by the intersection of a pair of fine wires or spider
                    lines—one vertical, the other horizontal—in the plane of the image, and the
                    telescope is directed by bringing this point on any specific object in the
                    field. As the interval between the objectglass and the image varies with the
                    distance of the object, a tube is provided to slide within the telescope tube
                    and carry the objectglass at one end, while the telescope tube carries the
                    diaphragm and eye-piece at the other end, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>
                    The image and the wires are brought into the same plane by a focusing screw,
                    which acts on the inner through the outer tube. The wires are attached to the
                    surface of an adjustable annular diaphragm, which is held in position by two
                    pairs of antagonizing screws—one pair horizontal, the other vertical—with
                    shoulders working against the exterior of the tube in which the diaphragm is
                    contained, so as to move it to the right or left and up or down, in order to
                    bring the point of intersection of the wires into the visual axis of the
                    telescope. In practice the first adjustment is to set the eye-piece to distinct
                    vision of the wires; the object-glass is then set truly to focus, which is
                    accomplished when no apparent parallax, or movement of the image relatively to
                    the wires, is seen on shifting the position of the eye, for this would indicate
                    that the image is either in front of or behind the plane of the wires. The line
                    joining the point of intersection of the wires with the centre of the
                    object-glass is called the “line of collimation,” and the diaphragm should be so
                    fixed that this line may always be perpendicular to the axis on which the
                    telescope revolves.</p>
                <p>The surveying compass gives the magnetic bearing of any object, and is the
                    simplest of all instruments for measuring horizontal angles. It consists of a
                    magnetized needle, with an agate centre, poised on the point of an upright pivot
                    in the centre of the bottom of a circular box and carrying a concentric circular
                    card or silver ring, the circumference of which is graduated into 360°, and is
                    sometimes further subdivided. The aligner is constituted by a pair of sight
                    vanes attached to the box at opposite extremities of a diameter, one vane having
                    a narrow slit for the eye to look through, the other with a wider opening
                    bisected by a vertical wire to be set on the observed object. There is no circle
                    reader, the prolongation of the wire on to the graduations being estimated by
                    the eye; aud there is no level, for the circle poises itself horizontally on the
                    supporting pivot.</p>
                <p>The prismatic compass is similar to the surveying compass, with the addition of a
                    prism in the eye vane through which the wire of the sight vane and the divisions
                    of the circle are viewed apparently together; the division with which the wire
                    coincides when the needle is at rest indicates the magnetic azimuth of any
                    object bisected by the wire. The sight vane carries a mirror turning on a hinge,
                    to enable objects to be seen by reflexion which may be too high to be seen on
                    the wire; the eye vane is furnished with a pair of dark glasses to be employed
                    when the sun is being observed.</p>
                <p>Magnetic instruments are useful for rapid reconnaissance and rough survey, and
                    for filling in the minor details of an exact survey, but they are not to be
                    relied on to give bearings with errors less than ten to fifteen minutes. In
                    plotting, however, bearings are preferable to angles, for, by drawing a number
                    of meridional lines parallel to each other on the paper, each bearing may be
                    plotted from an independent meridian without any accumulation of error, such as
                    arises when a number of angles are plotted in succession with the protractor
                    adjusted on short lines.</p>
                <p>The plane table is in its usual form simply a rectangular board mounted
                    horizontally on a stand, on which it may be turned round and set in any required
                    position; it is furnished with a flat sight rule, which usually carries a pair
                    of sight vanes and has a bevelled edge, parallel to the line of sight, to serve
                    as a ruler, also with a magnetic needle. Occasionally the construction is more
                    elaborate, and the board is surrounded by a marginal frame with graduations
                    radiating from the centre as the degrees of a circle, so that it may be used as
                    an instrument for measuring horizontal angles, while the sight rule is furnished
                    with a telescope, which takes the place of the vanes and is mounted on an axle
                    to measure vertical angles. The size is made as great as is consistent with the
                    limits of portability in each instance, so that the sheet of paper to be drawn
                    on may be as large as possible. The standard plane table of the Indian Survey
                    measures 30 inches by 24, and is made of planks of well-seasoned wood 1 inch
                    thick, with transverse edge bars below to prevent warping and buckling. It is
                    set up on a stand, usually a braced tripod, to which it is clamped by a powerful
                    hand screw passing through the head of the stand into a brass socket fixed
                    centrally under the table; the screw when relaxed serves as a pivot, round which
                    the table may be turned in azimuth and set in any required position. The table
                    is then firmly clamped so as to maintain a constant position during all the
                    subsequent laying off of bearings. The sight rule is 30 inches long, <hi

                    sight vane at each end, and a fiducial edge parallel to the line of sight; the
                    vanes are about 5 inches high, which gives sufficient elevation and depression
                    for general use. The magnetic needle is about 6 inches long and is held in a
                    rectangular brass box an inch broad, placed on the table whilst it is being set
                    and afterwards removed. Heights may be determined on the spot with the aid of a
                    clinometer, formed of a bar carrying a spirit-level and a pair of sights, one of
                    which has a scale of tangents graduated to radius = the interval between the
                    sights. For the method of employing the table see § 4, p. 709 above.</p>
                <p>The theodolite, the most important of all instruments for the purposes of a
                    survey, is a combination of two graduated circles placed at right angles to each
                    other, for the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, a telescope, which
                    turns on axes mounted centrically to the circles, and an alidade for each
                    circle, which carries two or more readers of the arcs through which the
                    telescope is moved. The whole is supported by a pedestal resting on foot-screws,
                    which are also employed to level the instrument. The size varies from a minimum
                    with circles 3 inches in diameter to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> maximum with a
                    36-inch horizontal and an 18-inch vertical circle, the weight ranging from 4 lb
                    to 1000 lb; the dimensions and magnifying powers of the telescope increase with
                    the diameter of the horizontal circle. The telescope may be connected rigidly
                    with the alidade and move with it while the circle remains stationary, or with
                    the circle and move with it while the alidade remains stationary. The varieties
                    of form as well as of size are numerous: in some the telescope may be completely
                    turned round in altitude as well as azimuth, and pointed to any object celestial
                    or terrestrial; in others the range of movement in altitude is restricted to
                    about 25° above and 25° below the horizon, and a pair of sectors are substituted
                    for the complete vertical circle; in some the telescope and vertical circle are
                    placed between, in others outside of, the pillars which support their common
                    axis; in some the pedestal is a simple tribrach resting on three foot-screws, in
                    others it takes the objectionable form of a ball carrying the vertical axis and
                    a socket holding the ball between two parallel plates, which are antagonized and
                    set firm by two pairs of foot-screws, turning in sockets fixed to the lower
                    plate, while their heads are pressed against the upper plate, to fix it and
                    bring the instrument into level at the same time. There are numerous other
                    specialities of form which have been introduced to meet specific requirements;
                    but these cannot be noticed here.</p>
                <p>The transit theodolite is an alt-azimuth instrument with the graduated circles of
                    equal diameter, usually 6 to 8 inches. The telescope is mounted between a pair
                    of conical arms which taper outwards and end in cylindrical pivots, constituting
                    what is called the transit axis of the instrument. The pivots rest on Y’s or in
                    semicircular collars, on the heads of a pair of pillars, which are made of
                    sufficient height to enable the telescope to revolve between them and be pointed
                    to stars in the zenith. These pillars stand on a circular plate, which serves as
                    the alidade of the horizontal circle and is usually constructed to revolve round
                    a vertical axis fixed in the centre of the plate of the horizontal circle; this
                    axis passes downwards into a socket in the centre of a tribrach, which forms the
                    pedestal of the instrument and rests on three mill-headed foot-screws by which
                    the instrument is levelled. The vertical circle is mounted centrically on one of
                    the cones of the transit axis, near the pivot end; its alidade, usually a
                    rectangular plate carrying a pair of verniers, is fitted centrically over that
                    axis, in contact with the circle but nearer the shoulder of the pivot, and,
                    while the telescope and the circle revolve together, it is held stationary by an
                    adjustable arm the end of which is pinched between a pair of antagonizing screws
                    mounted on the nearest pillar. The alidade of the horizontal circle carries two
                    or three equidistant verniers, because any error in centring an alidade over a
                    circle is eliminated in the mean of the readings whenever two or more verniers,
                    placed at equal distances apart round the circle, are read. A clamp, with a
                    tangent screw for communicating slow motion, is attached to the nearest pillar,
                    to act on the vertical circle and the telescope; another is attached to the
                    plate of the horizontal circle, to act on the alidade of that circle and so also
                    on the telescope for azimuthal motion; and a third to the pedestal, to act on
                    the plate of the horizontal circle. The first two are employed in measuring the
                    vertical and azimuthal angles, the third in setting the zero-diameter of the
                    horizontal circle in any specific direction, with a view to the repetition of
                    the measurements of the azimuthal angles at different parts of the circle. For
                    levelling the instrument, two levels are fixed at right angles to each other on
                    the plate of the alidade of the horizontal circle; a third is attached to the
                    telescope, or, preferably, to the alidade of the vertical circle; a fourth is
                    mounted on the transit axis when levelling for astronomical observations. A
                    magnetic compass or needle is added, and also a plummet for centring the
                    instrument over the station mark.</p>
                <p>Theodolites are designed to measure horizontal angles with greater accuracy than
                    vertical, because it is on the former that the most important work of a survey
                    depends, and they are measurable with greatest accuracy; measures of vertical
                    angles are liable to be much impaired by variations in the refractive condition
                    of the lower strata of the atmosphere, more particularly on long lines, so that
                    when heights have to be determined with much accuracy the theodolite must be
                    discarded for a levelling instrument, to be set up repeatedly with staves at
                    short distances. When truly adjusted the theodolite measures the horizontal
                    angle between any two objects, however much they may differ in altitude, as the
                    pole star and any terrestrial object; but, as adjustments are not always made
                    with accuracy nor permanently maintained, it is desirable always to take the
                    observations in pairs, with the face of the vertical circle alternately to the
                    right and left of the observer, for this eliminates collimation error from the
                    horizontal angles and index error in the setting of the spirit-level from the
                    vertical angles.</p>
                <p>When a horizontal angle is measured several times for greater accuracy, one of
                    two methods of procedure is adopted. (1) The angle is measured once or oftener
                    in the usual way, the horizontal circle remaining clamped and the telescope and
                    alidade moving over it; then the position of the horizontal circle is
                    shifted<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is often
                    done arbitrarily, but systematic shifts which bring equidistant graduations of
                    the circle under the verniers during all the telescope pointings to any one
                    object are always preferable (see sect. I., § 9, p. 69S above).</p></note> as
                    often as may be desired, and after each shifting the angle is again measured as
                    formerly; thus a separate numerical result is obtained for each operation. Or
                    (2), the first object A having been observed and the telescope set on the second
                    object B, the horizontal circle is undamped and turned round until the telescope
                    is brought back on A, when it is again clamped; then the alidade is undamped and
                    the telescope again moved over the horizontal circle to be set on B. The
                    operation is repeated as often as may be desired. The vernier readings are only
                    taken for the first telescope pointing to A and the last to B; their difference
                    +360° for every complete revolution of the circle, divided by the number of
                    repetitions, gives the angle. This method is objectionable when a round of
                    several angles has to be measured, but it enables the value of a single
                    angle—more particularly a small one, as between objects in the same field of the
                    telescope—to be determined accurately with much greater rapidity than the first
                    method.</p>
                <p>An auxiliary telescope is sometimes fixed below the plate of the horizontal
                    circle of a theodolite, to be pointed to a referring mark while the upper
                    telescope is being moved about, and thus to serve as a check on the general
                    stability of the instrument and on the permanence of the initial setting of the
                    circle during the measurement of a round of angles. When a theodolite is set up
                    on a lofty scaffolding which is liable to be swayed by the wind, or on a stand
                    which cannot be readily isolated from the observer, horizontal angles may be
                    measured accurately by employing a second observer to keep the auxiliary
                    telescope truly pointed to a referring mark while the observing telescope is
                    being pointed.</p>
                <p>The subtense transit theodolite differs from the ordinary transit theodolite
                    merely in having a pair of wire-carrying micrometers mounted in the telescope
                    tube, in order that the small angle subtended by a distant object of known
                    dimensions, or by two objects sufficiently near each other to be seen in the
                    same field of the telescope, may be measured with greater facility and precision
                    than on the graduated circles in the usual way. The micrometers are held in a
                    rectangular box, one on the right hand, the other on the left, with the wires
                    brought as closely as possible into the plane of the fixed wires in the ordinary
                    diaphragm; the box can be turned on the telescope tube through an angle of
                    rather more than 90°, to enable the micrometer wires to be set parallel to
                    either the horizontal or the vertical wire of the diaphragm, or to be placed at
                    any desired angle of inclination. The subtense object usually employed in survey
                    work is a pole of known length; if held perpendicularly to the line of sight of
                    the telescope, its direct distance may be determined from the angle measured by
                    the micrometers with a sufficiently small percentage of error to make this
                    method preferable to chaining over rough ground. The instrument has been
                    advantageously employed in carrying traverses of considerable length over ground
                    which was impracticable for direct linear measurements. The micrometers are also
                    serviceable in astronomical observations for time and longitude, for they give
                    additional wires on which to observe the passage of a star, at distances from
                    the fixed wire which may be varied with the speed of the star; and for
                    determining the longitude they permit numerous measures of the distance between
                    the edge of the moon and a star to be taken, immediately before and after
                    occultation.</p>
                <p>Eckhold’s omnimeter is a theodolite furnished with a microscope of considerable
                    magnitude facing a graduated linear scale; the tube of the. microscope is
                    rigidly attached to the telescope tube, either at right angles or parallel to
                    it, so that the two always move together. The scale is fixed either parallel or
                    perpendicular to the alidade plate of the horizontal circle; thus, when the
                    telescope is moved through vertical arcs within the range of the scale, the
                    tangents of the arcs are measured by the microscope on the scale. The latest and
                    best form of the instrument is shown in fig. 8, which represents a transit
                    theodolite converted into an omnimeter by the application of a microscope <hi

                    to that of the vertical circle. The microscope is furnished with a diagonal
                    eyepiece, through which the observer looks down on the scale. The scale is
                    divided into 100 equal parts, and is movable in its bedplate through the length
                    of one of these divisions by one rotation of a micrometer screw, with a large
                    head, <hi rend="italic">D</hi>, the circumference of which is divided into 100
                    equal parts, each divisible into fifths by a vernier. The microscope has a fixed
                    wire in a diaphragm at its eye end, <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> and, when the
                    telescope is set on an object anil the wire is seen between a pair of divisions
                    on the scale, the scale is moved by the micrometer screw until the nearest
                    division is brought under the wire; the scale reading corresponding to the
                    horizontal position of the telescope being known, the difference between it and
                    the reading when the telescope is pointing above or below the horizontal plane
                    is the tangent of the arc of elevation or depression, to radius = the
                    perpendicular from the axis of rotation of the telescope to the scale. Thus both
                    the distance and the height of any point over which a staff of known length has
                    been set up vertically may be readily determined with fair accuracy. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">O</hi> (fig.</p>
                <p>9) be the position of the transit axis of the telescope, <hi rend="italic"
                    >OA</hi> the direction of the telescope when horizontal, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oa</hi> the corresponding direction of the microscope at right angles to the

                    when the telescope is pointing to the bottom and top of the staff; then, since
                    <hi rend="italic">MN</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oa</hi> are known, the
                    horizontal distance <hi rend="italic">OA</hi> and the height <hi rend="italic"
                    >AM</hi> are determined from the proportions <hi rend="italic">OA: oa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">AM: am }:: MN: mn</hi></p>
                <p>It is essential that the focusing tube of the microscope should always move
                    parallel to the visual axis when different divisions of the scale are being
                    brought into focus, otherwise errors materially exceeding the quantities
                    appreciable by the micrometer may be caused. The linear results thus obtained
                    are satisfactory when the subtense staff is set up at a moderate distance; the
                    instrument has often been used with advantage in localities where measuring
                    chains could not be conveniently employed. As an angular instrument it is
                    identical with the ordinary transit theodolite, as will be seen from the figure,
                    which may be referred to as illustrating the description of that instrument; the
                    foot-screws are represented as resting on a plate such as is usually fixed on
                    the head of a folding tripod stand, their lower extremities, as well as the
                    grooves in which they are placed on the plate, being concealed from view by a
                    capping upper plate, which is clamped over their shoulders to prevent the
                    instrument from falling off the stand.</p>
                <p>In any theodolite with a telescope of the ordinary form the height of the pillars
                    must necessarily be somewhat greater than half the length of the telescope if
                    stars in the zenith are to be observed or if the telescope is to be completely
                    rotated on its transit axis; the higher the pillars the higher the centre of
                    gravity, the less perfect the stability of the instrument when set up for
                    observation, and the greater its weight and cumbersomeness for transport. In
                    Germany and Russia theodolites and transit instruments are sometimes em ployed
                    in which the eye end of the telescope tube is removed—a counterpoise to the
                    object end being substituted in its place; and a prism is inserted at the
                    intersection of the visual axis with the transit axis, so that the rays of light
                    from the object-glass may be reflected through one of the tubes of the transit
                    axis to an eye-piece in the pivot of this tube. In this case the pillars need
                    only be high enough for the counterpoise to pass freely over the plate of the
                    horizontal circle; but the observer has always to place himself at right angles
                    to the direction of the object he is observing.</p>
                <p>The levelling instrument consists of a telescope which carries a long
                    spirit-level parallel to itself and is mounted on a horizontal plate, which is
                    fixed rigidly either on the head of a vertical axis revolving within a socket in
                    the centre of the pedestal or on that of a hollow cone revolving round a
                    vertical axis which projects upwards from the pedestal. There are various forms
                    of the instrument; in the Y-level the telescope rests on a pair of Y’s, in which
                    it can be both rotated and turned end for end; in the dumpy level the telescope
                    is rigidly attached to its supports, and its tube is made shorter and of greater
                    diameter, to carry an object-glass of shorter focal length and larger aperture.
                    A magnetic compass is attached to the instrument to enable the bearings of the
                    levelling staves to be taken whenever desired. Levelling staves are of a variety
                    of patterns and are graduated in various ways, best on both faces and
                    dissimilarly, for a check on accidental errors of reading, as indicated in sect.
                    III.</p>
                <p>Reflecting levels are portable instruments which may be held by the hand for
                    rough and rapid survey work. They are of two forms: in one an image of the eye
                    of the observer, in the other an image of the bubble of a spirit-level, is seen
                    by reflexion on a level with the observed object. The first consists of a square
                    of common looking-glass, which is set in a frame suspended from a ring on the
                    line of prolongation of one of the diagonals in such a manner as to swing freely
                    but not turn round on its axis of suspension; the frame is weighted by a metal
                    plate behind, to which it is so adjusted that, when suspended, the plane of the
                    surface of the mirror will be vertical. A small portion of the glass at one end
                    of the horizontal diagonal is either cut away or unsilvered. When the image of
                    the observer’s eye is seen on the diagonal, all objects bisected by the
                    diagonal, whether viewed through the opening in the mirror or by reflexion, are
                    on the level of the eye. The second consists of a tube open at the object end
                    and closed at the eye end by a disk which is perforated with a sight hole; a
                    mirror filling up half the section is fixed in the tube, facing the eye end at
                    an angle of 45° with the axis; and an all-round transparent spirit-level is
                    mounted over an opening above the mirror, and its bubble is seen by reflexion in
                    the axis of the tube. Abney’s level is of the latter construction, but with the
                    spirit-level attached to the alidade of a graduated arc fixed to one side of the
                    (rectangular) tube; thus vertical angles as well as levels may be determined
                    with it.</p>
                <p>The optical square is a reflecting instrument indicating a right angle, and is of
                    great use in laying off perpendiculars for the measurement of offsets from a
                    line of survey. It consists of two glass plates, one wholly the other partially
                    silvered, which are fixed permanently in a shallow circular box at an angle of
                    45°, so that any two objects seen together through a sight hole in the box-one
                    directly through the transparent portion, the other by reflexion in the mirror
                    of the partially silvered glass plate — subtend an angle of 90° at the point
                    where the observer is standing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blotting and Plot-measuring Instruments.—</hi> These comprise
                    linear scales, common compasses, and angular protractors for laying off
                    distances and angles measured on the ground, proportional compasses and
                    pantagraphs for reproducing a finished plot on some other scale, and opisometers
                    and planimeter for measuring plotted lines and areas.</p>
                <p>Scales are divided, cither decimally or fractionally, into equal parts, each of
                    which is a portion of a fixed unit of length, as a foot or an inch; some are
                    subdivided more or less minutely throughout their entire length between a pair
                    of parallel lines; others are subdivided at their extremities only. Diagonal
                    scales are formed by eleven equidistant parallel lines, the outer ones of which
                    are divided primarily and subdivided into tenths at their extremities. The
                    primary divisions are joined by cross lines perpendicular to the eleven parallel
                    lines; the end subdivisions are joined diagonally, the first on the lower line
                    with the second on the upper, and so on, each diagonal cutting every horizontal
                    line in a point a tenth of a subdivision beyond the cutting point on the
                    parallel line below, as measured from any one of the perpendicular lines; and
                    each of these tenths is further divisible into tenths by measuring from the
                    perpendicular at intervals of tenths between the parallel lines; thus great
                    precision of measurement is obtained.</p>
                <p>The Marquois scale and triangle consist of a scale divided throughout into equal
                    parts more or less minutely and a right-angled triangle of which the hypothenuse
                    is three times the shortest ∣ side. An arrow is drawn perpendicular to the
                    hypothenuse to 1 serve as a pointer to the divisions of the scale. The third
                    side has a bevelled edge for ruling. When the triangle is placed with its
                    hypothenuse against the scale and is moved along it, all lines drawn<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0750-0721"/> along the bevelled edge are parallel to each
                    other, their distances apart being one-third of the distances travelled by the
                    arrow along the scale.</p>
                <p>Compasses usually take the form of a pair of legs movable about a joint, so that
                    their extremities, which are of steel, finely pointed, may be set at any
                    required distance apart; the legs may be knee-jointed, and one is usually
                    adapted to hold either a pencil, a ruling pen, or a steel pointer, as may be
                    desired. A beam compass is employed when long lengths are laid off; it consists
                    of a light tubular metal bar, or a rectangular deal rod, fitted with a pair of
                    boxes, which slide along it and carry either pen, pencil, or pointer, and may be
                    set and clamped at any desired distance apart.</p>
                <p>Proportional compasses consist of two parts so exactly similar that when held in
                    contact throughout they appear as one; each is pointed at both ends, flat and
                    grooved through one-half its length, and tapering to a point in the other half.
                    The two are coupled together by a pair of similar sliders, one for each groove,
                    turning on a common axle which carries a disk at one end and a clamping screw at
                    the other; by shifting the position of the sliders in the grooves the distances
                    between the points at the opposite ends can be brought into any desired
                    proportion. The settings for different proportions are effected by bringing a
                    line on the slider opposite the lines of a fractional scale engraved on one side
                    of the groove.</p>
                <p>Protractors are of two forms circular (or semicircular) and rectangular; the
                    circumferences of the former are divided into 360° or 180°; the latter are
                    divided on three sides of their periphery by lines drawn from the centre of the
                    fourth side to the degree points on the circumference of a semicircle of which
                    that side is the diameter. The protractor being set with its centre on a given
                    point and its zero line on a given line passing through the point, any angle
                    with this line at the point can be readily laid off. Protractors for plotting
                    traverses are commonly annular, that they may be centred over the station of
                    origin with the zero diameter on the initial meridian; their bearings at any
                    other station may be laid off without moving the protractor by drawing lines
                    parallel to the same bearings at the origin. Rectangular protractors sometimes
                    have parallel lines engraved on their faces at equal distances, for setting over
                    paper ruled with parallel lines at unequal distances, and their backs engraved
                    with scales of rhumbs, sines, secants, and tangents and common scales of equal
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The station pointer enables the position of any station at which angles between
                    three fixed points have been measured to be plotted on paper. It consists of
                    three arms: the centre arm carries a graduated circle fixed over an axis at one
                    end; the other two are movable round this axis, and each cames a vernier for
                    reading the circle. Each arm has a straight edge bevelled as a ruler, and the
                    lines on the prolongations of these edges meet in the centre of the axis, where
                    there is a small opening through which a point may be pricked on the paper. The
                    arms having been set to the observed angles, the instrument is moved about until
                    each edge is over one of the fixed points on the paper, when its centre will be
                    exactly over the position of the station if none of the angles are very acute.
                    The instrument is much used in nautical surveying, for laying down the position
                    of a vessel at sea by angles measured to fixed objects on shore.</p>
                <p>The triangular compass is serviceable in reproducing plans to full scale; it is
                    formed by jointing a third leg to the centre pin of the joint of an ordinary
                    pair of compasses, so as to be movable in any direction.</p>
                <p>The pantagraph is employed in reproducing a map on a different —generally a
                    smaller—scale. It consists of two long arms, <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">AC,</hi> jointed together at <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> and two
                    short arms, <hi rend="italic">FD</hi> and <hi rend="italic">FE,</hi> jointed
                    together at <hi rend="italic">F</hi> and with the long arms at <hi rend="italic"
                    >D</hi> and <hi rend="italic">E</hi>; <hi rend="italic">FD</hi> is made exactly
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">AE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">FE</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">AD,</hi> so that <hi rend="italic">ADFE</hi> is a true
                    parallelogram whatever the angle at <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The instrument is
                    supported parallel to the paper on ivory castors, on which it moves freely. A
                    tube is usually fixed vertically at <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> near the extremity
                    of the long arm <hi rend="italic">AC,</hi> and similar tubes are mounted on
                    plates which slide along the short arms <hi rend="italic">BD</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">FD</hi>; they are intended to hold either the axle pin on a
                    weighted fulcrum round which the instrument turns, or a steel pointer, or a
                    pencil, interchangeably. When the centres of the tubes are exactly in a straight
                    line, as on the dotted line <hi rend="italic">bfc,</hi> the small triangle <hi
                    rend="italic">bfD</hi> will always be similar to the large triangle <hi
                    rend="italic">bcA;</hi> and then, if the fulcrum is placed under <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> the pencil at <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, and the pointer at
                    c, when the instrument is moved round the fulcrum as a pivot, the pencil and the
                    pointer will move parallel to each other through distances which will be
                    respectively in the proportion of <hi rend="italic">bf</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >be</hi>; thus the pencil at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> draws a reduced copy of
                    the map under the pointer at <hi rend="italic">c</hi>; if the pencil and the
                    pointer were interchanged an enlarged copy would be drawn; if the fulcrum and
                    pencil were interchanged, and the sliders set for <hi rend="italic">f</hi> to
                    bisect <hi rend="italic">bc,</hi> the map would be copied exactly. Lines are
                    engraved on the arms <hi rend="italic">BD</hi> and <hi rend="italic">FD,</hi> to
                    indicate the positions to which the sliders must be set for the ratios ½, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,. . ., which are
                    commonly required.</p>
                <p>The square pantagraph of Adrian Gavard consists of two graduated arms which are
                    pivoted on a plain bar and connected by a graduated bar sliding between them
                    throughout their entire length, to be set at any required distance from the
                    plain bar; a sliding plate carrying a vertical tube, to hold either the axle of
                    the fulcrum, the pencil, or the pointer, is mounted on one of the arms and on a
                    prolongation of the plain bar beyond the other arm, and also on the graduated
                    connecting bar; and an additional arm is provided by means of which reductions
                    below or enlargements above the scales given on the instrument can be readily
                    effected.</p>
                <p>The eidograph is designed to supersede the pantagraph, which is somewhat
                    unsteady, having several supports and joints. It is composed of three graduated
                    bars, one of which is held over a fulcrum and carries the others, which are
                    lighter, one at each extremity. The three bars are movable from end to end in
                    box-sockets, each having an index and a vernier in contact with the graduated
                    scale. The box-socket of the principal bar turns round the vertical axle of the
                    fulcrum; that of each side bar is attached to a vertical axle, which also
                    carries a grooved wheel of large diameter and turns in a collar at either end of
                    the principal bar. The two wheels are of exactly the same diameter and are
                    connected by a steel band fitting tightly into the grooves, so that they always
                    turn together through identical arcs; thus the side bars over which they are
                    respectively mounted, when once set parallel, turn with them and always remain
                    parallel. A pointer is held at the end of one of the side bars and a pencil at
                    the diagonally opposite end of the other. The bars may be readily set by their
                    graduated scales to positions in which the distances of the pencil and the
                    pointer from the fulcrum will always be in the ratio of the given and the
                    required map scales.</p>
                <p>The opisometer is intended to measure the lengths of roads, rivers, and other
                    lines on a map. It consists simply of a milled wheel mounted in a forked handle
                    on a steel screw with a very fine thread. The wheel, being turned up to one end
                    of the screw, is put down on the map with the handle held vertically over the
                    point at which the measurement is to commence, and is run over the road or line
                    until the point is reached at which the measurement is to stop; it is then
                    lifted off the paper, placed on the scale of the map, and run backwards to the
                    initial end of the screw, over a length of the scale which corresponds to the
                    length run over on the map.</p>
                <p>The polar planimeter was invented by Professor Amsler of Schaffhausen for the
                    measurement of areas on maps and plans. It consists essentially of two arms
                    jointed together and a roller, carried at right angles to one of the arms and
                    moving in touch with the paper, which by its revolutions records the area of a
                    figure whose perimeter is traced by a point on that arm, while the instrument is
                    turned bodily on a point on the other arm as a fixed centre. There are two forms
                    of the instrument: in one the position of the roller is fixed and the arms are
                    jointed on a common pinion; in the other the roller and a pinion, to which the
                    holding arm is attached, are both carried by a slider, which is movable along
                    the tracing arm and can be set at any required distance from the tracing point.
                    The first form gives areas in a single unit of measure only, the second in
                    various units. The annexed figure represents the first form, showing the joint
                    <hi rend="italic">A,</hi> the tracing point <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> the fixed
                    point <hi rend="italic">O,</hi> and the roller with its graduated dial and
                    vernier, for indicating the lengths of line rolled over while the tracer moves
                    round the perimeter of the area under measurement.</p>
                <p>The following explanation of the theory of the instrument is due to Professor
                    Greenhill. Let <hi rend="italic">OA, AP</hi> be the two arms jointed at <hi
                    rend="italic">A,</hi> with the fixed point at <hi rend="italic">O</hi> and the
                    tracer at <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> and suppose the wheel to be fixed at <hi
                    rend="italic">R</hi> on the prolongation of the arm <hi rend="italic">PA.</hi>
                    Let <hi rend="italic">OA=a,</hi><hi rend="italic">AP=b, AR= c,</hi> and the
                    radius of the roller = ?·; and let the direction of a positive rotation of the
                    roller, as marked by the graduations, be that of rotation on a right-handed
                    screw on the axle of <hi rend="italic">R</hi> which would give motion in the
                    direction <hi rend="italic">AR.</hi> Drop the perpendicular<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">AR</hi> produced, a rotation of the instrument about <hi
                    rend="italic">O</hi> with angular velocity ω will give to <hi rend="italic"

                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">IR,</hi> and will therefore compel the roller
