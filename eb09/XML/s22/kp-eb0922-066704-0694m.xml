                    the N. by Broach district and the native state of Baroda; on the E. by the
                    states of Rájpipla, the Gáikwár Bánsda, and Dharampur; on the S. by Thána
                    district and the Portuguese territory of Daman; and on the W. by the Arabian
                    Sea. It has a coast-line of 80 miles, consisting of a barren stretch of sand
                    drift and salt marsh; behind that is a rich highly cultivated plain, nearly 60
                    miles in breadth at the embouchure of the Tápti, but narrowing to only 15 miles
                    in the southern part; and on the north-east are the wild hills and jungle of the
                    Dangs. The only important rivers are the Tápti and the Kim, the former of which
                    is ordinarily navigable for native craft of from 18 to 36 tons. The district
                    contains a large number of tanks for irrigation; and a canal is projected from
                    the Tápti with head works at Kamlápur, 35 miles from Surat. The fauna of the
                    district consists of a few tigers, stragglers from the jungles of Bánsda and
                    Dharampur, besides leopards, bears, wild boars, wolves, hyaenas, spotted deer,
                    and antelopes. The climate of Surat varies with the distance from the sea. Near
                    the coast, under the influence of the sea-breeze, an equable temperature
                    prevails, but 8 to 11 miles inland the breeze ceases to blow. The coast also
                    possesses a much lighter rainfall than the interior, the annual average ranging
                    from 30 inches in Olpád to 72 in Chikhli, while at Surat city the average is 46
                    inches. The Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway runs through the district
                    from north to south. A magnificent iron-girder bridge crosses the Tápti at Surat
                    city.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population of Surat at 614,198 (306,015 males,
                    308,183 females), of whom Hindus numbered 415,031, Mohammedans 55,547, Parsis
                    12,593, and aboriginals 118,664.</p>
                <p>I here are only two towns in the district with a population exceeding
                    5000,—namely, <hi rend="smallcaps">Surat (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> and
                    Bulsar (13,229). The cultivated area in 1884-85 was returned at 726,583 acres,
                    and the area available for cultivation at 81,663. The total area of crops in
                    1884- 85 was 550,233 acres, including 66,096 twice cropped. Rice occupied
                    103,972 acres, wheat 38,617, and <hi rend="italic">joár</hi> 108,644; cotton is
                    also largely cultivated, and its culture is greatly increasing. Grain, cotton,
                    timber, oil, sugar and molasses, and piece goods are the chief articles of
                    export. Almost the whole female population is engaged in spinning cotton thread,
                    and the weaving of cotton cloth in hand looms is carried on in the chief towns;
                    silk is also manufactured in considerable quantities, as well as brocades and
                    embroidery. In 1884-85 the revenue of the district amounted to £378,061, of
                    which the land-tax contributed £268,644. Surat was one of the earliest parts of
                    India brought into close relations with European countries, and its history
                    merges almost entirely into that of its capital, long the greatest maritime city
                    of the peninsula. By an arrangement made in 1799 the English were placed in
                    possession of Surat city and the town of Rander; subsequent cessions under the
                    treaties of Bassein (1802) and Poona (1817), together with the lapse of the
                    Mandvi state in 1839, brought the district into its present shape. Since the
                    introduction of British rale the district has remained comparatively tranquil;
                    and even during the period of the mutiny peace was not disturbed, owing in a
                    great measure to the steadfast loyalty of its leading Mohammedan families.</p>
