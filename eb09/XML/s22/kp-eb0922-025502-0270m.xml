                    people of east Central Africa, mainly confined to the eastern “horn” of the
                    continent, which from them takes the name of Somali Land, probably the Punt of
                    the Egyptian records. Here they are conterminous towards the north-west with the
                    kindred Afars (Dankali), and elsewhere with the more closely related Gallas,
                    from whom they are separated on the south-west by the river Juba. Tajurra Bay,
                    with the lower course of the Hawash, is usually given as the northwest frontier;
                    but, according to the recent explorations of Abargues de Sostén in eastern
                    Abyssinia, there appears to be here an overlapping of the three peoples, the Isa
                    Somâli encroaching on the Afar domain north of Tajurra Bay nearly to the
                    parallel of Asab Bay (13° N.), while the Dawari Gallas penetrate between this
                    Somali tribe and the lower Hawash eastwards to the coast at Obok (12° N.). A
                    line drawn from the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb through the Harrar district and the
                    headwaters of the Haines river (Webbe-Shebeyli or “Leopard river ”) southwards
                    to the equator at the mouth of the Juba will roughly define the landward
                    frontier of the Somâli territory, which is elsewhere sea-girt,—by the Gulf of
                    Aden on the north, by the Indian Ocean from Cape Guardafui to the equator.</p>
                <p>Our first contact with the Somâli people may be said to date from the English
                    occupation of Aden in 1839. But, notwithstanding the early visits of Cruttenden,
                    Ch. H. Johnston, Captain Burton, and one or two others, very little was known
                    about them before the seizure of Berberah by the Egyptians in 1874. This event
                    led to the establishment of permanent relations with the coast tribes, and was
                    followed by several excursions into the interior, of which the most fruitful in
                    results have been those of Sacconi, Revoil, F. L. James, Paulitschke, Von
                    Hardegger, and Josef Menge, the last three bringing our information down to the
                    year 1885. From the reports of these observers the true relations of the Somâli
                    have been gradually determined, and we now know that they form a distinct branch
                    of the eastern (“Ethiopic”) Hamitic stock, of which the other chief members are
                    the neighbouring Gallas and Afars, the Abyssinian Agau, and the Bejas (Bishari)
                    of the steppe lands between the Nubian Nile and the Red Sea. Their close
                    affinities both in physical type and in speech with the surrounding Gallas are
                    obvious, and like them they are described as a fine race,<note anchored="true"

                    been recently surveying the Somâli seaboard, describes the coast tribes near the
                    equator as “the handsomest race of men and women he had ever seen,” black in
                    colour, but with magnificent physique</hi> (Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc., <hi
                    rend="italic">Oct., 1885). Captain F. M. Hunter also describes them as a tall,
                    fine-looking people, with oval face, high rounded forehead, full lips, strong
                    regular teeth, bright restless eye, but lower limbs seldom well developed (</hi>

                    but not free from an infusion of Negro blood, as shown both in their dark, often
                    almost black complexion, and still more in their kinky and even woolly hair,
                    sometimes short, sometimes long enough to be plaited in tresses hanging down to

                    state, broken up into an endless number of clans and septs, variously grouped by
                    different writers. According to Captain Guillain<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Documents sur l'histoire,
                    &amp;c., de l Afrique Orientale,</hi> 1856-59.</p></note> there are three main
                    divisions—the Aji on the north and northeast coast, the Hawiya on the south-east
                    coast, and the Rahhanwin in the interior. But these are reduced by James to two,
                    Isak and Darode (apparently the Edur and Darrud of older observers), with
                    several main branches as under :—</p>
                <p>Habr Gerhaji, south from Berberah, beyond the coast range.</p>
                <p>Isak Habr Tjaleh, east from Berberah, north of the coast range.</p>
                <p>Habr Awál, Berberah district.</p>
                <p>Mejertain, east coast from Guardafui to 4° north.</p>
                <p>Dolbohanti, Nogal River.</p>
                <p>Darode Warsangueli, north coast, west from Guardafui.</p>
                <p>Marehan, between the Mejertain and Ogadain.</p>
                <p>Ogadain, Webbe basin, and widespread in interior.</p>
                <p>To these, however, must be added the powerful Gadabirsi west from Berberah and
                    the Isa (Issa) of the Hawash basin, besides the three low-caste tribes dispersed
                    amongst the others,—Tomal (ironworkers), Ebir (dealers in charms), and Midgan
                    (ostrich breeders).</p>
                <p>The Somâli, who are mainly Mohammedans of a somewhat fanatical type, are a fierce
                    lawless people, impatient of control, and yielding a reluctant obedience even to
                    their own rulers. Hence the tribal chiefs enjoy little more than a nominal
                    authority, although some of the more powerful amongst them affect the title of
                    sultan. At present the great Habr Gerhaji nation appears to be split into two
                    sections, each under a chief claiming this rank. All go armed with spear,
                    shield, and short sword, the latter exactly like that of the ancient Egyptians,
                    whom the Somali are otherwise said to resemble more than any other African
                    people. The weapons are freely used in their disputes, although the tribal laws
                    against homicide are severe, heavy fines of camels or other property being
                    imposed, which must be paid either by the criminal or the community. They are
                    great talkers, keenly sensitive to ridicule, and quick-tempered, although
                    amenable to reason if they can be induced to argue the point. According to the
                    character of the soil and climate they live a settled or nomad life, in some
                    places breeding numerous herds of camels, goats, and fat-tailed sheep, in others
                    growing large crops especially of durrah, or collecting the gums—frankincense
                    and myrrh—for which the land has always been famous. The Marehan (properly
                    Murreyhan) tribe is said to have given its name to the myrrh, which is obtained
                    in the greatest perfection in their district, although the term seems too old to
                    admit of this derivation, and is more probably connected with a Semitic root <hi
                    rend="italic">mar, mur=</hi> bitter. Through the ports of Berberah and Zeyla, a
                    considerable export trade to Arabia, Egypt, and India is carried on with these
                    articles and the other natural products of the country, such as hides, horns,
                    ostrich feathers, coffee of a very fine quality, indigo, salt. But the natives
                    take little part in this movement, which from remote times has been in the hands
                    of the Indian banians settled at various points on the coast. In 1879-80 the
                    total value of the exports was estimated at about £140,000.</p>
                <p>Like many other Mohammedan peoples, the Somali claim Arab descent, their
                    progenitor having been a certain Sheríf Ishak b. Ahmad, who crossed over from
                    Hadramaut with forty followers about five hundred years ago. Other traditions go
                    farther back, tracing their origin to the Himyaritic chiefs Sanhâj and Samamah,
                    said to have been coeval with a King Afrikus, who is supposed to have conquered
                    Africa about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> These legends should perhaps be
                    interpreted as pointing at a series of Arab immigrations, the last two of which
                    are referred to the 13th and 15th centuries. But these intruders seem to have
                    been successively absorbed in the Somâl stock; and it is remarkable that the
                    Arabs never succeeded in establishing permanent settled or nomad communities in
                    this region, as they have done in so many other parts of the continent. Their
                    influence has been very slight even on the Somâl language, whose structure and
                    vocabulary are essentially Hamitic, with marked affinities to the Galla on the
                    one hand and to the Dankali (Afar) on the other. Captain Hunter’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> with exercises and vocabularies (Bombay, 1880),
                    utilizing the materials published by General Rigby in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> of the Bombay Geographical Society (1849), is the only
                    comprehensive treatise on the language, which appears to be spoken with great
                    uniformity throughout the whole of Somali Land. Hunter mentions an eastern and a
                    western dialect, differing, however, but little from one another, which is the
                    more remarkable that there is no written standard and little oral literature,
                    beyond some proverbial sayings, short stories inculcating certain moral
                    teachings, and some simple love-songs. Although the rhythm is defective, these
                    chants are not lacking in poetical ideas, and often betray an unexpected
                    refinement of feeling not inferior to that of similar compositions amongst more
                    civilized peoples. (A. H. K. )</p>
