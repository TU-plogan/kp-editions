                    THE CIRCLE is the problem of finding a square equal in area to a given circle.
                    Like all problems, it may be increased in difficulty by the imposition of
                    restrictions; consequently under the designation there may be embraced quite a
                    variety of geometrical problems. It has to be noted, however, that, when the
                    “squaring” of the circle is especially spoken of, it is almost always tacitly
                    assumed that the restrictions are those of the Euclidean geometry.</p>
                <p>Since the area of a circle equals that of the rectilineal triangle whose base has
                    the same length as the circumference and whose altitude equals the radius
                    (Archimedes, <hi rend="italic">Κύκλου μέτρησις,</hi> prop. 1), it follows that,
                    if a straight line could be drawn equal in length to the circumference, the
                    required square could be found by an ordinary Euclidean construction; also, it
                    is evident that, conversely, if a square equal in area to the circle could be
                    obtained, it would be possible to draw a straight line equal to the
                    circumference. Rectification and quadrature of the circle have thus been, since
                    the time of Archimedes at least, practically identical problems. Again, since
                    the circumferences of circles are proportional to their diameters—a proposition
                    assumed to be true from the dawn almost of practical geometry—the rectification
                    of the circle is seen to be transformable into finding the ratio of the
                    circumference to the diameter. This correlative numerical problem and the two
                    purely geometrical problems are inseparably connected historically.</p>
                <p>Probably the earliest value for the ratio was 3. It was so among the Jews (1
                    Kings vii. 23, 26), the Babylonians (Oppert, <hi rend="italic">Journ.

                    >Journ. Asiatique,</hi> June 1841), and probably also the Greeks. Among the
                    ancient Egyptians, as would appear from a calculation in the Rhind papyrus, the

                    16 of book xii., viz., that “circles are to one another as the squares on their
                    diameters” and that “in the greater of two concentric circles a regular 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi>-gon can be inscribed which shall not meet the circumference
                    of the less,” however nearly equal the circles may be. With Archimedes (287-212
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> a notable advance was made. Taking the
                    circumference as intermediate between the perimeters of the inscribed and the
                    circumscribed regular n-gons, he showed that, the radius of the circle being
                    given and the perimeter of some particular circumscribed regular polygon
                    obtainable, the perimeter of the circumscribed regular polygon of double the
                    number of sides could be calculated; that the like was true of the inscribed
                    polygons; and that consequently a means was thus afforded of approximating to
                    the circumference of the circle. As a matter of fact, he started with a
                    semi-side AB of a circumscribed regular hexagon meeting the circle in B (see
                    fig. 1), joined A and B with O the centre, bisected the AOB by OD, so that BD
                    became the semi-side of a circumscribed regular 12-gon; then as AB: BO: OA:: 1:
                    √3: 2 he sought an approximation to √3 and found that AB: BO &gt;153: 265. Next
                    he applied his theorem<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    OA: AB:: OB: BD to calculate BD; from this in turn he cal culated the semi-sides
                    of the circumscribed regular 24-gon, 48-gon, and 96-gon, and so finally
                    established for the circumscribed regular 96-gon that perimeter: diameter</p>
                <p>&lt; 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>: 1. In a
                    quite analogous manner he proved for the inscribed regular 96-gon that
                    perimeter: diameter &gt; 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 71</hi>: 1. The conclusion from these therefore was that the
                    ratio of circumference to diameter is &lt;31 and &gt;31 <hi rend="superscript">
                    10</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 71</hi>. This is a most notable piece of work;
                    the immature condition of arithmetic at the time was the only real obstacle
                    preventing the evaluation of the ratio to any degree of accuracy whatever.<note

                <p>No advance of any importance was made upon the achievement of Archimedes until
                    after the revival of learning. His immediate successors may have used his method
                    to attain a greater degree of accuracy, but there is very little evidence
                    pointing in this direction. Ptolemy (fl. 127- 151), in the <hi rend="italic"

                    was not until the 15th century that attention in Europe began to be once more
                    directed to the subject, and after the resuscitation a considerable length of
                    time elapsed before any progress was made. The first advance in accuracy was due
                    to a certain Adrian, son of Anthony, a native of Metz (1527), and father of the
                    better-known Adrian Metius of Alkmaar. In refutation of Duchesne (Van der Eycke)
                    he showed that the ratio was <hi rend="smallcaps">&lt; 3</hi><hi

                    / <hi rend="subscript"> 106</hi>, and thence made the exceedingly lucky step of
                    taking a mean between the two by the quite unjustifiable process of halving the
                    sum of the two numerators for a new numerator and halving the sum of the two
                    denominators for a new denominator, thus arriving at the now well-known
                    approximation 3 <hi rend="superscript"> 16</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 113</hi>
                    or <hi rend="superscript"> 355</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 113</hi> which,
                    being equal to 3·1415929..., is correct to the sixth fractional place.<note

                    calculation was Viète (De Viette, Vieta), the greatest mathematician of his age.
                    By finding the perimeter of the inscribed and that of the circumscribed regular
                    polygon of 393216 <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> 6 × 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    16</hi>) sides, he proved that the ratio was &gt;3∙1415926535 and
                    &lt;3T415926537, so that its value became known (in 1579) correctly to 10
                    fractional places. The theorem for angle-bisection which Viète used was not that
                    of Archimedes, but that which would now appear in the form 1 - cos <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> = 2sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ½ <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi></p>
                <p>. With Viète, by reason of the advance in arithmetic, the style of treatment
                    becomes more strictly trigonometrical; indeed, the <hi rend="italic">Universales
                    Inspectiones,</hi> in which the calculation occurs, would now be called plane
                    and spherical trigonometry, and the accompanying <hi rend="italic">Canon

                    labours of Archimedes and Viète, the effect of increased power of symbolical
                    expression is very noticeable. Archimedes’s process of unending cycles of
                    arithmetical operations could at best have been expressed in his time by a
                    “rule” in words; in the 16th century it could be condensed into a “formula.”
                    Accordingly, we find in Viète a formula for the ratio of diameter to
                    circumference, viz., the interminate product<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Klügel, <hi rend="italic">Math. Wörterb.,</hi> ii. pp. 606,

                <p>From this point onwards, therefore, no knowledge whatever of geometry was
                    necessary in any one who aspired to determine the ratio to any required degree
                    of accuracy: the mere arithmetician’s art and length of days were the only
                    requisites. Thus in connexion with the subject a genus of workers became
                    possible who may be styled “π-computers,”—a name which, if it connotes anything
                    uncomplimentary, does so because of the almost entirely fruitless character of
                    their labours. Passing over Adriaan van Roomen (Adrianus Romanus) of Louvain,
                    who published the value of the ratio correct to 15 places in his <hi

                    result was published on his tombstone in St Peter’s church, Leyden. The

                <p>This gives the ratio correct to 35 places. Van Ceulen’s process was essentially
                    identical with that of Viète. Its numerous root extractions amply justify a
                    stronger expression than “multo labore,” especially in an epitaph. In Germany
                    the “Ludolphische Zahl” is still a common name for the ratio.<note

                    meet the tangent at A in E; and then his assertion (not established by him) was
                    that AE was nearly equal to the arc AC, the error being in defect. For the
                    purposes of the calculator a solution erring in excess was also required, and
                    this Snell gave by slightly varying the former construction. Instead of
                    producing AB</p>
                <p>(see fig. 3) so that BD</p>
                <p>was equal to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> he pro duced it only so far that, when the
                    extremity D' was joined with C, the part of</p>
                <p>D'C outside the circle was equal to <hi rend="italic">r</hi>; in other words, by
                    a non-Euclidean construction he trisected the angle AOC, for it is readily seen
                    that, since FD' = FO = OC, the angle FOB = <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>It is thus manifest that by his first construction Snell

                    couplet of constructions is as important from the calculator’s point of view as
                    it is interesting geometrically. To compare it on this score with the
                    fundamental proposition of</p>
                <p>Archimedes, the latter must be put into a form similar to Snell’s. AMC being an
                    arc of a circle (see fig. 4) whose centre is</p>
                <p>O, AC its chord, and HK the tangent drawn at the middle point of the arc and
                    bounded by OA, OC produced, then, according to Archimedes, AMC&lt;HK but &gt;AC.
                    In modern trigonometrical notation the propositions to be compared stand as

                <p>As might be expected, a fresh view of the matter was taken by Descartes. The
                    problem he set himself was the exact converse of that of Archimedes. A given
                    straight line being viewed as equal in length to the circumference of a circle,
                    he sought to find the dia meter of the circle. His con struction is as follows
                    (see fig. 5).</p>
                <p>Take AB equal to one-fourth of the given line; on AB describe a square ABCD; join
                    AC; in AC</p>
                <p>produced find, by a known process, a point C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> such
                    that, when C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    drawn perpendicular to AB pro duced and C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> perpendicular to BC produced, the rectangle BC <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will be equal to ¼ ABCD; by the same process find a
                    point C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> such that the rectangle B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will be equal to ¼ BC
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; and so on <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum.</hi> The
                    diameter sought is the straight line from A to the limiting position of the
                    series of B’s, say the straight line AB <hi rend="subscript"> ∞</hi>. As in the
                    case of the process of Archimedes, we may direct our attention either to the
                    infinite series of geometrical operations or to the corresponding infinite
                    series of arithmetical operations. Denoting the number of units in AB by ¼ <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> we can express BB <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + ... gives us at once
                    an expression for the diameter in terms of the circumference by means of an

                    construction is seen to be involved in the following theorem, which serves
                    likewise to throw new light on the subject :—AB being any straight line
                    whatever, and the above construction being made, then AB is the diameter of the
                    circle circumscribed by the square ABCD (self-evident), AB <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> is the diameter of the circle circumscribed by the regular 8-gon having
                    the same perimeter as the square, AB <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is the
                    diameter of the circle circumscribed by the regular 16-gon having the same
                    perimeter as the square, and so on. Essentially, therefore, Descartes’s process
                    is that known later as the process of <hi rend="italic">isoperimeters,</hi> and

                <p>The work of Wallis had evidently an important influence on the next notable
                    personality in the history of the subject, James Gregory, who lived during the
                    period when the higher algebraic analysis was coming into power, and whose
                    genius helped materially to develop it. He had, however, in a certain sense one
                    eye fixed on the past and the other towards the future. His first
                    contribution<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura,</hi> Padua, 1667; and the

                    the method of Archimedes. The latter, as we know, calculated the perimeters of
                    successive polygons, passing from one polygon to another of double the number of
                    sides; in a similar manner Gregory calculated the areas. The general theorems
                    which enabled him to do this, after a start had been made, are <hi rend="italic"

                    rectifications of circular arcs after the manner of Huygens; and, what is very
                    notable, he made an ingenious and, according to Montucla, successful attempt to
                    show that quadrature of the circle by a Euclidean construction was
                    impossible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    however, and far beyond it in importance, was his use of infinite series. This
                    merit he shares with his contemporaries Mercator, Newton, and Leibnitz, and the
                    exact dates of discovery are a little uncertain. As far as the circle-squaring

                    (in 1670) to make known the series for the arc in terms of the tangent, the
                    series for the tangent in terms of the arc, and the secant in terms of the arc;
                    and in 1669 Newton showed to Barrow a little treatise in manuscript containing
                    the series for the arc in terms of the sine, for the sine in terms of the arc,
                    and for the cosine in terms of the arc. These discoveries formed an epoch in the
                    history of mathematics generally, and had, of course, a marked influence on
                    after investigations regarding circle-quadrature. Even among the mere computers

                <p>The calculator’s work having now become easier and more mechanical, calculation
                    went on apace. In 1699 Abraham Sharp, on the suggestion of Halley, took

                    circle-quadrature have been made. In 1873 Hermite proved that the base ε of the
                    Napierean logarithms cannot be a root of a rational algebraical equation of any
                    degree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    same proposition regarding π is to prove that a Euclidean construction for
                    circle-quadrature is impossible. For in such a construction every point of the
                    figure is obtained by the intersection of two straight lines, a straight line
                    and a circle, or two circles; and, as this implies that, when a unit of length
                    is introduced, numbers employed, and the problem transformed into one. of
                    algebraic geometry, the equations to be solved can only be of the first or
                    second degree, it follows that the equation to which we must be finally led is a
                    rational equation of even degree. Hermite<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv. p. 418); so it is merely with the component genera of
                    the group that we now have to deal.</p><p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Sciurina</hi>
                    six genera are commonly recognized, the first being the typical one, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sciurus,</hi> in which the common English squirrel is included.
                    The characters of the genus are—form slender and agile; tail long and bushy;
                    ears generally well developed, pointed, often tufted; feet adapted for climbing,
                    the anterior pair with four toes and a rudimentary thumb, and the posterior pair
                    with five toes, all the toes having long, curved, and sharp-pointed claws;
                    mammae from four to six in number; skull (see fig. 1) lightly built, very
                    similar in shape throughout the genus; post-orbital processes long and curved;
                    incisors narrow and compressed; premolars either one or two above and one below;
                    when two are present above, the anterior one is quite minute and very different
                    from the corresponding tooth in the marmots; molars three on each side above and
                    below.</p><p>True squirrels are found throughout the greater part of the
                    tropical and temperate regions of both hemispheres, although they are absent
                    both from Madagascar and the Australian region. The species are both largest and
                    most numerous in the tropics, and reach their greatest development in the Malay
                    parts of the Oriental region.</p><p>Squirrels vary in size from animals no
                    larger than a mouse, such as <hi rend="italic">Sciurus soricinus</hi> of Borneo,
                    or <hi rend="italic">S. minutus</hi> of West Africa, to others as large as a
                    cat, such as the black and yellow <hi rend="italic">S. bicolor</hi> of Malaysia
                    (see fig. 1). The very large squirrels, as might be expected from their heavier
                    build, are somewhat less strictly arboreal in their habits than the smaller
                    ones, of which the common English species may be looked upon as typical. The
                    Common Squirrel, »S'. <hi rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> whose general habits are
                    too well known to need special description, ranges over the whole of the
                    Palaearctic region, from Ireland to Japan, from Lapland to North Italy; but
                    specimens from different parts of this wide range differ so much in colour as to
                    have been often looked upon as different species. Thus, while the common
                    squirrels of north and west Europe are of the bright red colour we are
                    accustomed to see in England, those of the mountainous regions of southern
                    Europe are nearly always of a deep blackish grey; those from Siberia again are a
                    clear pale grey colour, with scarcely a tinge of rufous. These last supply the
                    squirrel fur used for lining cloaks. The pairing time of the squirrel is from
                    February to April, and after a period of gestation of about thirty days it
                    brings forth from three to nine young. In addition to all sorts of vegetables
                    and fruits the squirrel is exceedingly fond of animal food, greedily devouring
                    mice, small birds, and eggs.</p><p>Although the English squirrel is a most
