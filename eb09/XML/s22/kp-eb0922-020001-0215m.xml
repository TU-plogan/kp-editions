                <p><label type="entry">SNIPE</label> (Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Snite,</hi>
                    Icelandic <hi rend="italic">Snipa,</hi> Dutch <hi rend="italic">Snip</hi>,
                    German <hi rend="italic">Schnepfe),</hi> one of the commonest Limicoline birds,
                    in high repute no less for the table than for the exciting sport it affords. It
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Scοlοpax gallinago</hi> of Linnaeus, but by many later
                    writers separated from that genus, the type of which is the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Woodcock</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and hence has been variously named
                    <hi rend="italic">Gallinago caelestis, G. media,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">G.
                    scolopacina.</hi> Though considerable numbers are still bred in the British
                    Islands, notwithstanding the diminished area suitable for them, most of those
                    that fall to the gun are undoubtedly of foreign origin, arriving from
                    Scandinavia towards the close of summer or later, and many will outstay the
                    winter if the weather be not too severe, while the home-bred birds emigrate in
                    autumn to return the following spring. Of late years British markets have been
                    chiefly supplied from abroad, mostly from Holland.</p>
                <p>The Snipe is fortunately too well known to need description, for a description of
                    its variegated plumage, if attempted, would be long. It may be noticed, however,
                    as subject to no inconsiderable variation, especially in the extent of dark
                    markings on the belly, flanks, and axillaries, while examples are occasionally
                    seen in which no trace of white, and hardly any of buff or grey, is visible,—the
                    place of these tints being taken by several shades of chocolatebrown. Such
                    examples were long considered to form a distinct species, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >S. sabinii,</hi> but its invalidity is now generally admitted. Other examples
                    in which buff or rust-colour predominates have also been deemed distinct, and to
                    these has been applied the epithet <hi rend="italic">russata.</hi> Again, a
                    slight deviation from the ordinary formation of the tail, whose rectrices
                    normally number 14, and present a rounded termination, has led to the belief in
                    a species, <hi rend="italic">S. brehmi,</hi> now wholly discredited. But,
                    setting aside two European species, to be presently noticed more particularly,
                    there are at least a score, more or less nearly allied, belonging to various
                    parts of the world, for no considerable territory is without its representative.
                    Thus North America produces <hi rend="italic">G. wilsoni,</hi> so like the
                    English Snipe as not to be easily distinguished except by the possession of 16
                    rectrices, and Australia has <hi rend="italic">G. australis,</hi> a larger and
                    somewhat differently coloured bird with 18 rectrices. India, while affording a
                    winter resort to multitudes of the common species, which besides Europe extends
                    its breeding range over the whole of northern Asia, has the so-called Pin-tailed
                    Snipe, <hi rend="italic">G. stenura,</hi> in which the number of rectrices is
                    still greater, varying from 20 to 28, it is said, though 22 seems to be the
                    usual number. This curious variability, deserving more attention than it has yet
                    received, only occurs in the outer feathers of the series, which are narrow in
                    form and extremely stiff, there being always 10 in the middle of ordinary
                    breadth.</p>
                <p>Those who only know the Snipe as it shows itself in the shooting-season, when
                    without warning it rises from the boggy ground uttering a sharp note that sounds
                    like <hi rend="italic">scape, scape,</hi> and, after a few rapid twists, darts
                    away, if it be not brought down by the gun, to disappear in the distance after a
                    desultory flight, have no conception of the bird’s behaviour at breeding-time.
                    Then, though flushed quite as suddenly, it will fly round the intruder, at times
                    almost hovering over his head. But, if he have patience, he will see it mount
                    aloft and there execute a series of aerial evolutions of an astounding kind.
                    After wildly circling about, and reaching a height at which it appears a mere
                    speck, where it winnows a random zigzag course, it abruptly shoots downwards and
                    aslant, and then as abruptly stops to regain its former elevation, and this
                    process it repeats many times. A few seconds, more or less according to
                    distance, after each of these headlong descents a mysterious sound strikes his
                    ear—compared by some to drumming and by others to the bleating of a sheep or
                    goat,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence in many
                    languages the Snipe is known by names signifying ‘Flying Goat,” “Heaven’s Ram,”
                    as in Scotland by “Heather-bleater.”</p></note> which sound evidently comes from
                    the bird as it shoots downwards, and then only; but how the sound is made is a
                    question on which many persons are still undecided. There are those who maintain
                    that it proceeds from the throat, while some declare it is produced by the
                    wings, which sharp-sighted observers say they can see in tremulous motion.</p>
                <p>Others, again, assert that it is caused by the vibration of the webs of the outer
                    rectrices, and these last have in support of their opinion the fact that a
                    similar sound may be made by affixing those feathers to the end of a rod and
                    drawing them rapidly downwards in the same position as they occupy in the bird’s
                    tail while it is performing the feat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cf. Meves, <hi rend="italic">(Efvers. K. Vet.-Akad.
                    Forh.,</hi> 1856, pp. 275-277 (transl. <hi rend="italic">Naumannia,</hi> 1858,

                    with Wolley’s remarks thereon, <hi rend="italic">Zool. Garten,</hi> 1876, pp.
                    204-208.</p></note> But, however it be produced, the air will also ring with
                    loud notes that have been syllabled <hi rend="italic">tinker, tinker,
                    tinker,</hi> while other notes in a different key, something like <hi
                    rend="italic">djepp, djepp, djepp</hi> rapidly uttered, may be heard as if in
                    response. The nest is always on the ground and is a rather deep hollow wrought
                    in a tuft of herbage, and lined with dry grass-leaves. The eggs are four in
                    number, of a dark olive colour, blotched and spotted with rich brown. The young
                    when freshly hatched are beautifully clothed in down of a dark maroon,
                    variegated with black, white, and buff.</p>
                <p>The Double or Solitary Snipe of English sportsmen, <hi rend="italic">S.
                    major,</hi> a larger species, also inhabits northern Europe and may be readily
                    recognized by the white bars in its wings and by its 16 or occasionally 18
                    rectrices. It has also a very different behaviour. When flushed it rises without
                    alarm-cry, and flies heavily. In the breeding season mud of its love-performance
                    is exhibited on the ground, and the sounds to which it gives rise are of another
                    character; but the exact way in which its “drumming” is effected has not been
                    ascertained. Its gesticulations at this time have been well described by Prof.
                    Collett in a communication to Mr Dresser’s <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                    Europe</hi> (vol. vii. pp. 635-637). It visits Great Britain every year at the
                    close of summer, but in very small numbers, and is almost always seen singly—not
                    uncommonly in places where no one could expect to find a Snipe.</p>
                <p>The third species of which any details can here be given is the Jack-<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though this word is clearly
                    not intended as a nickname, such as is the prefix which custom has applied to
                    the Daw, Pie, Redbreast, Titmouse, or Wren, one can only guess at its origin or
                    meaning. It may be, as in Jackass, an indication of sex, for it is a popular
                    belief that the Jack-Snipe is the male of the common species; or, again, it may
                    refer to the comparatively small size of the bird, as the “jack” in the game of
                    bowls is the smallest of the balls used, and as fishermen call the smaller Pikes
                    Jacks.</p></note> or Half-Snipe, <hi rend="italic">S. gallinula,</hi> the
                    smallest and most beautifully coloured of the group. Without being as numerous
                    as the common or full Snipe, it is of frequent occurrence in Great Britain from
                    September to April (and occasionally both earlier and later); but it breeds
                    only, so far as is known, in northern Scandinavia and Russia; and the first
                    trustworthy information on that subject was obtained by Wolley in June 1853,
                    when he found several of its nests near Muonioniska in Lapland.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His account was published by
                    Hewitson in May 1855 <hi rend="italic">{Eggs Br. Birds,</hi> 3d ed., ii. pp.
                    356-358).</p></note> Instead of rising wildly as do most of its allies, it
                    generally lies so close as to let itself be almost trodden upon, and then takes
                    wing silently, to alight at a short distance (if it escape the gun), and to
                    return to the same place on the morrow. In the breeding-season, however, it is
                    as noisy and conspicuous as its larger brethren while executing its aerial
                    evolutions.</p>
                <p>As a group the Snipes are in several respects highly specialized, but here there
                    is only space to mention the sensitiveness of the bill, which, though to some
                    extent noticeable in many Sandpipers (see vol. xxi. p. 260), is in Snipes
                    carried to an extreme by a number of filaments, belonging to the fifth pair of
                    nerves, which run almost to the tip, and open immediately under the soft cuticle
                    in a series of cells that give this portion of the surface of the
                    premaxillaries, when exposed, a honeycomb-like appearance. Thus the bill becomes
                    a most delicate organ of sensation, and by its means the bird, while probing for
                    food, is at once able to distinguish the nature of the objects it encounters,
                    though these are wholly out of sight. So far as is known, the sternum of all the
                    Snipes, except the Jack-Snipe, departs from the normal Limicoline formation, a
                    fact which tends to justify the removal of that species to a separate genus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnocryptes.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The so-called Painted Snipes, forming the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchaea,</hi> demand a few words. Four species have been
                    described, natives respectively of South America, Africa, India with China, and
                    Australia. In all of these it appears that the female is larger and more
                    brilliantly coloured than the male, and in the Australian species she is further
                    distinguished by what in most birds is emphatically a masculine property, though
                    its use is here unknown,—namely, a complex trachea, while the male has that
                    organ simple. He is also believed to undertake the duty of
                    incubation.</p></note><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi><pb break="no"
