                    care and teaching; after that he was educated by private tutors till he went to
                    Rugby in 1841. Whilst under the first of these tutors, in nine months he read
                    all Thucydides, Sophocles, and Sallust, twelve books of Tacitus, the greater
                    part of Horace, Juvenal, Persius, and several plays of Aeschylus and Euripides.
                    He also got up six books of Euclid and some algebra, besides reading a
                    considerable quantity of Hebrew and learning the <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi> of
                    Horace by heart. On the death of his elder brother in September 1843 Henry Smith
                    left Rugby, and in the end of 1844 gained a scholarship at Balliol College,
                    Oxford. He won the Ireland scholarship in 1848 and obtained a first class in
                    both the classical and the mathematical schools in 1849. He gained the senior
                    mathematical scholarship in 1851. He was elected fellow of Balliol in 1850 and
                    Savilian professor of geometry in 1861, and in 1874 was appointed keeper of the
                    university museum. He was elected F.R.S. in 1861, and was an LL.D. of Cambridge
                    and Dublin. He served on various royal commissions, and from 1877 was the
                    chairman of the managing body of the meteorological office. He died at Oxford on
                    9th February 1883.</p>
                <p>After taking his degree he wavered between classics and mathematics, but finally
                    chose the latter. After publishing a few short papers relating to theory of
                    numbers and to geometry, he devoted himself to a thorough examination of the
                    writings of Gauss, Lejeune-Dirichlet, Kummer, &amp;c., on the theory of numbers.
                    The main results of these researches, which occupied him from 1854 to 1864, are
                    contained in his <hi rend="italic">Report on the Theory of Numbers,</hi> which
                    appeared in the British Association volumes from 1859 to 1865. This report
                    contains not only a complete account of all that had been done on this vast and
                    intricate subject but also original contributions of his own. Some of the most
                    important results of his discoveries were communicated to the Royal Society in
                    two memoirs upon Systems of Linear Indeterminate Equations and Congruences and
                    upon the Orders and Genera of Ternary Quadratic Forms (<hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> 1861 and 1867). He did not, however, confine himself to the
                    consideration of forms involving only three indeterminates, but succeeded in
                    establishing the principles on which the extension to the general case of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> indeterminates depends, and obtained the general formulae,
                    thus effecting what is probably the greatest advance made in the subject since
                    the publication of Gauss’s <hi rend="italic">Disquisitiones Arithmeticas.</hi> A
                    brief abstract of Smith’s methods and results appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proc. Roy. Soc.</hi> for 1864 and 1868. In the second of these notices he gives
                    the general formulae without demonstrations. As corollaries to the general
                    formulae he adds the formulae relating to the representation of a number as a
                    sum of five<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n188/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0188-0173"/> squares and also of seven squares. This class of
                    representation ceases when the number of squares exceeds eight. The cases of
                    two, four, and six squares had been given by Jacobi and that of three squares by
                    Eisenstein, who had also given without demonstration some of the results for
                    five squares. Fourteen years later the French Academy, in ignorance of Smith’s
                    work, set the demonstration and completion of Eisenstein’s theorems for five
                    squares as the subject of their “Grand Prix des Sciences Mathématiques.” Smith,
                    at the request of a member of the commission by which the prize was proposed,
                    undertook in 1882 to write out the demonstration of his general theorems so far
                    as was required to prove the results for the special case of five squares. A
                    month after his death, in March 1883, the prize of 3000 francs was awarded to
                    him. The fact that a question of which Smith had given the solution in 1867, as
                    a corollary from general formulae governing the whole class of investigations to
                    which it belonged, should have been set by the French Academy as the subject of
                    their great prize shows how far in advance of his contemporaries his early
                    researches had carried him. Many of the propositions contained in his
                    dissertation are general; but the demonstrations are not supplied for the case
                    of seven squares. He was also the author of important papers in which he
                    extended to complex quadratic forms many of Gauss’s investigations relating to
                    real quadratic forms. After 1864 he devoted himself chiefly to elliptic
                    functions, and numerous papers on this subject were published by him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Bond. Math. Soc.</hi> and elsewhere. At the time of his
                    death he was engaged upon a memoir on the <hi rend="italic">Theta and Omega
                    Functions,</hi> which he left nearly complete. In 1868 he was awarded the
                    Steiner prize of the Berlin Academy for a geometrical memoir, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sur quelques problèmes cubiques et biquadratiques.</hi> He also wrote the
                    introduction to the collected edition of Clifford’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematical Papers</hi> (1882). The three subjects to which Smith’s writings
                    relate are theory of numbers, elliptic functions, and modern geometry; but in
                    all that he wrote an “arithmetical” mode of thought is apparent, his methods and
                    processes being arithmetical as distinguished from algebraic. He had the most
                    intense admiration of Gauss. He was president of the mathematical and physical
                    section of the British Association at Bradford in 1873 and of the London
                    Mathematical Society in 1874-76. A memorial edition of his collected
                    mathematical works is being (1887) printed by the Oxford university press.</p>
                <p>An article in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> of 17th February 1883, written
                    by Lord Justice Bowen, gives perhaps the best idea of Smith’s extraordinary
                    personal qualities and influence, his sound judgment, perfect temper, gentle and
                    Laelian wisdom, sweetness of character, delicate gaiety of spirit, and brilliant
                    conversational power, which made him one of the most accomplished and attractive
                    ornaments of any educated company in which he moved.</p>
