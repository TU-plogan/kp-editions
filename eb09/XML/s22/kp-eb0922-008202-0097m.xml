                    that city. He was soon, by the kindness of a friend who discerned the germs of
                    those talents which were afterwards to render him so celebrated, removed to
                    Paris and enabled to enter upon the study of theology, where he early displayed
                    a taste for Hebrew and other Oriental languages. He was allowed great indulgence
                    in the prosecution of his studies by the authorities of the Congregation of the
                    Oratory, being exempted from those exercises of piety which for an entire year
                    were binding on the other students. This dispensation aroused the ill-will and
                    jealousy of the other Oratorian novitiates. Simon was charged with reading
                    “heretical” books, this designation being applied to <hi rend="italic">Walton’s
                    Polyglott,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Critici Sacri,</hi> and other works of a
                    similar kind. But this jealous opposition proved abortive. Simon, after
                    investigation, was allowed and encouraged to continue his favourite pursuits. At
                    the end of his theological course he was sent, according to custom, to teach
                    philosophy at Juilly, where there was one of the colleges of the Oratory. But he
                    was soon recalled to Paris, and employed in the congenial labour of preparing a
                    catalogue of the Oriental books in the library of the Oratory. This gave him
                    full access to those works, the fruits of the study of which appear so fully in
                    his after writings. His first essay in authorship was the publication of a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Fides Ecclesiae Orientalis, seu Gabrielis
                    Metropolitae Philadelphiensis Opuscula, cum interpretatione Latina, cum
                    notis</hi> (Paris, 1671), the object of which was to demonstrate that the belief
                    of the Greek Church regarding the Eucharist was the same as that of the Church
                    of Rome. Simon entered the priesthood in 1670, and the same year wrote a
                    pamphlet in defence of the Jews of Metz, who had been accused, as they have so
                    often been before and since, of having murdered a Christian child. It was
                    shortly before this time that there were sown the seeds of that enmity with the
                    Port Royalists which filled Simon’s after life with many bitter troubles. The
                    famous Arnauld had written a work on the <hi rend="italic">Perpetuity of the
                    Faith,</hi> the first volume of which treated of the Eucharist. M. Diroys, a
                    doctor of theology, and a friend of Arnauld’s, asked Simon his opinion of the
                    book. Simon replied that it was one of the best works which had been published
                    by the Port Royalists, but that it nevertheless required correction in several
                    important passages, and agreed reluctantly, and after some delay, at Diroys’s
                    request, to write a letter referring to these passages, on the understanding
                    that the original was to be returned to him. The criticisms of Simon excited
                    great indignation among the friends and admirers of Arnauld, and he felt the
                    effects of their vindictiveness to the latest hour of his life. Another matter
                    was the cause of inciting against him the ill-will of the monks of the
                    Benedictine order. A friend of Simon’s, one of the Oratorians, was engaged in a
                    lawsuit, in his capacity as grand vicar of Prince Neubourg, abbé of Fécamp, with
                    the Benedictine monks of that establishment. Simon lent to his friend the aid of
                    his powerful pen, and composed a memorandum in which he employed pretty strong
                    language against the opponents of his friend. They were greatly exasperated, and
                    made loud complaints to the new general of the Oratory that they were virulently
                    assailed by a member of the brotherhood, with which they had always been on
                    friendly terms. The charge of Jesuitism was also brought against Simon,
                    apparently on no other ground than that his friend’s brother was an eminent
                    member of that order. The commotion in ecclesiastical circles was great, and it
                    was seriously contemplated to remove Simon not only from Paris but from France.
                    A mission to Rome was proposed to him, but he saw through the design, and, after
                    a short delay dictated by prudential motives, declined the proposal. He was
                    engaged at the time in superintending the printing of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Critique du Vieux Testament.</hi> He had hoped, through the influence
                    of Père la Chaise, the king’s confessor, and the Duc de Montausier, to be
                    allowed to dedicate the work to Louis XIV., but as His Majesty was absent in
                    Flanders at the time the volume could not be published until the king had
                    accepted the dedication, though it had passed the censorship of the Sorbonne,
                    and the chancellor of the Oratory had given his <hi rend="italic"
                    >imprimatur.</hi> The printer of the book, in order to promote the sale, had
                    caused the titles of the various chapters to be printed separately, and to be
                    put in circulation. These, or possibly a copy of the work itself, had happened
                    to come into the hands of his ever-watchful enemies—the Port Royalists. It seems
                    that, with a view to injure the sale of the work, which it was well known in
                    theological circles had been long in preparation by Simon, the Messieurs de Port
                    Royal had undertaken a translation into French of the Prolegomena to <hi
                    rend="italic">Walton’s Polyglott.</hi> To counteract this proceeding Simon
                    announced his intention of publishing an annotated edition of the Prolegomena,
                    and actually added to the <hi rend="italic">Critical History</hi> a translation
                    of the last four chapters of that work, which had formed no part of his original
                    plan. Simon’s announcement prevented the appearance of the projected
                    translation, but his enemies were all the more irritated against him on that
                    account. They had now obtained the opportunity, which they had long been
                    seeking, of gratifying their hatred of the bold Oratorian. The freedom with
                    which Simon expressed himself on various topics, and especially those chapters
                    in which he declared that Moses could not be the author of much in the writings
                    attributed to him, especially aroused their opposition. The powerful influence
                    of Bossuet, at that time tutor to the dauphin, was invoked; the chancellor Le
                    Tellier lent his assistance; a decree of the council of state was obtained, and
                    after a series of paltry intrigues the whole impression, consisting of 1300
                    copies, was seized by the police and destroyed, and the animosity of his
                    colleagues in the Oratory rose to so great a height against Simon for having so
                    seriously compromised their order by his work that he was declared to be no
                    longer a member of their body. Full of bitterness and disgust Simon retired to
                    the curacy of Bolleville, to which he had been lately appointed by the
                    vicar-general of the abbey of Fécamp.</p>
                <p>The work thus confiscated in France it was proposed to republish in Holland.
                    Simon, however, at first opposed this, in hopes of overcoming the opposition of
                    Bossuet by<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0098-0083"/> making certain changes in the parts objected to.
                    The negotiations with Bossuet lasted a considerable time, but finally failed,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Critical History</hi> appeared, with Simon’s name on
                    the title page, in the year 1685, from the press of Reenier Leers in Rotterdam.
                    An imperfect edition had previously been published at Amsterdam by Daniel
                    Elzevir, based upon a MS. transcription of one of the copies of the original
                    work which had escaped destruction and had been sent to England, and from which
                    a Latin and an English translation were afterwards made. The edition of Leers
                    was a reproduction of the work as first printed, with a new preface, notes, and
                    those other writings which had appeared for and against the work up to that
                    date.</p>
                <p>The work which had excited so much controversy and opposition consists of three
                    books, the first of which deals with questions of Biblical criticism, properly
                    so called, such as the text of the Hebrew Bible and the changes which it has
                    undergone down to the present day, the authorship of the Mosaic writings and of
                    other books of Scripture, with an exposition of his peculiar theory of the
                    existence during the whole extent of Jewish history of recorders or annalists of
                    the events of each period, whose writings were preserved in the public archives,
                    and the institution of which he assigns to Moses. The second book gives an
                    account of the principal translations, ancient and modern, of the Old Testament,
                    and the third contains an examination of the principal commentators. He had,
                    with the exception of the theory above mentioned, contributed nothing really new
                    on the subject of Old Testament criticism, for previous critics, as Cappellus,
                    Morinus, and others, had established many points of importance, and the value of
                    Simon’s work consisted chiefly in bringing together and presenting at one view
                    the results of Old Testament criticism. The work is written in a clear style,
                    and its tone is confident and frequently sarcastic. He displays great contempt
                    for tradition and the opinions of the fathers. This latter peculiarity it was
                    which specially aroused the enmity of Bossuet and other leading Romanists. But
                    it was not only from the Church of Rome that the work encountered strong
                    opposition. The Protestants felt their stronghold—an infallible Bible—assailed
                    by the doubts which Simon raised against the integrity of the Hebrew text. Le
                    Clerc (“Clericus”), the distinguished Dutch divine and critic, in his work <hi
                    rend="italic">Sentimens de quelques Theologiens de Hollande,</hi> controverted
                    the views of Simon, and was answered by the latter in a tone of considerable
                    asperity in his <hi rend="italic">Réponse aux Sentimens de quelques Theologiens
                    de Hollande,</hi> which he signed under the name of Pierre Ambrun, it being a
                    marked peculiarity of Simon rarely to give his own name, but to assume <hi
                    rend="italic">noms de guerre</hi> at various times.</p>
                <p>The remaining works of Simon may be briefly noticed. In 1689 appeared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Critique du Texte du Nouveau Testament,</hi> consisting
                    of thirty-three chapters, in which he discusses the origin and character of the
                    various books, with a consideration of the objections brought against them by
                    the Jews and others, the quotations from the Old Testament in the New, the
                    inspiration of the New Testament (with a refutation of the opinions of Spinoza),
                    the Greek dialect in which they are written (against Salmasius), the Greek MSS.
                    known at the time, especially Codex D (Cantabrigiensis), &amp;c. This was
                    followed in 1690 by his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Critique des Versions du
                    Nouveau Testament,</hi> where he gives an account of the various translations,
                    both ancient and modern, and discusses the manner in which many difficult
                    passages of the New Testament have been rendered in the various versions. In
                    1693 was published what in some respects is the most valuable of all his
                    writings, viz., <hi rend="italic">Histoire Critique des principaux Commentateurs
                    du Nouveau Testament depuis le commencement du Christianisme jusques à notre
                    temps.</hi> This work exhibits immense reading, and the information it contains
                    is still valuable to the student. The last work of Simon that we shall mention
                    is his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Observations sur le Texte et les Versions du
                    Nouveau Testament</hi> (Paris, 1695), which contains supplementary observations
                    upon the subjects of the text and translations of the New Testament.</p>
                <p>Simon is described as a man of middle stature, with somewhat unprepossessing
                    features. His temper was sharp and keen, and as a controversialist he displayed
                    a bitterness of tone and an acerbity of expression which tended only to
                    aggravate the unpleasantness of controversy. He was entirely a man of intellect,
                    free from all tendency to sentimentality, and with a strong vein of sarcasm and
                    satire in his disposition. His reading was immense, and his memory powerful and
                    retentive. He is said to have usually prosecuted his studies lying on the floor
                    of his apartment, on a pile of carpets or cushions. Few men have written more
                    that is worth reading on Biblical subjects than he, considering the hardships
                    and vicissitudes of his chequered life. He died at his native city of Dieppe on
                    the 11th April 1712, at the age of seventy-four.</p>
