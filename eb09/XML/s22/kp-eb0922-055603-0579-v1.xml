                <p><label type="entry">STOCK EXCHANGE</label>, a market for the purchase or sale of
                    all descriptions of public securities. Previous to 1773 the London stockbrokers
                    conducted their business in and about the Royal Exchange, but in that year,
                    having formed themselves into an association under the designation of the Stock
                    Exchange, they, after temporarily locating their headquarters in Sweeting Ally,
                    Threadneedle Street, removed to Capel Court, Bartholomew Lane. The growth of
                    business necessitating improved accommodation, a capital of £20,000 in four
                    hundred shares of £50 each was raised in 1801 for the purpose of erecting a new
                    building in Capel Court, which was finished and occupied in the following year,
                    the members at that date numbering about five hundred. With the occupation of
                    the new building new rules came into force; all future members were admitted by
                    ballot, while both members and their authorized clerks were required to pay a
                    subscription of ten guineas each. As only the wealthier members of the
                    association had provided the capital for the new building, the Stock Exchange
                    henceforth consisted of two distinct bodies—proprietors and subscribers. In
                    1854, the membership having increased to about one thousand persons, an
                    extension of the premises in Capel Court was effected at a cost of £16,000. A
                    further and very extensive increase in the accommodation was made in 1885, the
                    number of members and authorized clerks having risen at that date to above two
                    thousand five hundred. The extended buildings now occupy the whole of a triangle
                    to the east of the Bank of England, having as its base Bartholomew Lane, its
                    north side Throgmorton Street, and its south side portions of Threadneedle
                    Street and Old Broad Street. The completed buildings comprise two large halls,
                    where the various markets are held, settlement rooms, reading room, committee
                    rooms, managers’ rooms, and various other offices. It is intended ultimately to
                    remove the partition between the two halls, when a vast business apartment,<pb

                    will be available for the use of members. The immensely valuable property of the
                    Stock Exchange is now owned by about 1050 proprietors, additions both to the
                    proprietary and to the capital invested in the buildings having been from time
                    to time effected during the past fifty years. The interests of the proprietors
                    are attended to by nine of their number, who are termed managers, aud by a
                    secretary and staff of clerks. The income of the association now amounts to
                    about £130,000 per annum, and is derived from the annual subscriptions of
                    members and their clerks, from entrance fees paid by new members, and from rents
                    and investments. All members of the Stock Exchange are not proprietors, neither
                    are all proprietors necessarily members. Admission as a member is open to any
                    person not engaged in another business. He must, however, be recommended by
                    three members, who each guarantee to the committee of the house payment of £750
                    in the event of the new member being declared a defaulter within two years of
                    his election. A personal guarantee of this description is imperative, the object
                    being to exclude all persons of doubtful character. Elections are by ballot, and
                    for one year only, all members being theoretically liable to exclusion at the
                    expiry of that period.</p>
                <p>The stock exchange opens every morning at 11 o’clock and closes at 4, except on
                    Saturday, on which day the doors are shut at 2 o’clock. All members of the house
                    are either jobbers or brokers, the former term being applied to those who are
                    dealers in stocks. It is contrary to the etiquette of the London Stock Exchange
                    for brokers to deal with brokers, and all transactions are accordingly effected
                    between brokers (representing their clients) and jobbers. Brokers’ charges vary
                    from one-sixteenth to as much as one-half per cent., and the jobbers’ “turn” or
                    profit from one-eighth to two or three per cent., according to the character of
                    the stock dealt in. The turn of the jobber amounts in the aggregate to an
                    enormous tax upon the British public, and the question of the utility of this
                    intermediary has been much discussed at various times. On buyers and sellers the
                    tax operates in this way :—A wishes to buy and B wishes to sell £1000 of
                    Caledonian Railway stock, but, brokers being forbidden to deal with brokers,
                    recourse is had to the jobber C, who makes a price to the brokers of say 98 to
                    98¼, that is to say, he offers to buy at 98 or to sell at 98¼; the buyer A
                    accordingly pays 98¼ plus his broker’s commission, and the seller B receives 98
                    minus his broker’s commission, the jobber C pocketing the difference or “turn”
                    of ¼ per cent. The argument in favour of the jobber is that he supplies at all
                    times and in all circumstances a ready market, and it must be allowed that in
                    ordinary times he is a very convenient functionary. But, as a matter of fact, in
                    excited times the system often breaks down, as the jobbers frequently shut their
                    books and refuse to deal at the very moment when their help is most needed. What
                    are known as the “markets” in the stock exchange are simply groups of jobbers
                    distributed here and there on the floor of the house. Habit or convenience seems
                    to have determined the particular spots occupied, which are known as the consol
                    market, the English railway market, the foreign stock market, and so on.</p>
                <p>In active times the business transacted daily on the London stock exchange
                    amounts to an enormous total. Yet no written contracts or notes pass between
                    jobbers and brokers, verbal communications being alone in use. Notwithstanding
                    this apparent looseness of practice where millions of property are bought and
                    sold almost hourly, there is hardly a single instance of attempted repudiation
                    on record. All transactions are entered into for the fortnightly settlements,
                    the precise dates for which are always fixed a few weeks in advance by the
                    committee of the house. Each fortnightly settlement includes three days: the
                    first is the continuation or contango day, when all transactions of a merely
                    speculative description are continued for another fortnight, the second the
                    ticket day, when names are passed for actual purchases or sales, and the third
                    the pay day, when all amounts or balances are paid or received. As the great
                    bulk of business is purely speculative, the contango or continuation day is by
                    far the busiest of the entire fortnight. The floor of the house is then crowded
                    with an eager throng of from 2000 to 3000 brokers, jobbers, and clerks, and
                    during the greater part of the day little is done beyond arranging the account.
                    Continuation rates or contangos vary with the value of money and the state of
                    the account. When money is dear, or speculative buying active, rates are high,
                    but when speculative selling has preponderated, and the account has become what
                    is called a “bear” account, rates are light. An enormous amount of capital is
                    engaged in stock exchange speculation in London. Banks, financial companies, aud
                    private firms and individuals lend freely on stock exchange securities, and thus
                    encourage, if they do not initiate, most of the great speculative movements.
                    Besides the great central institution in London, stock exchanges exist in nearly
                    all the large cities of the United Kingdom. The principal are those of Glasgow,
                    Liverpool, and Manchester, which provide excellent markets for local stocks and
                    shares.</p>
                <p>On the Continent the two chief centres for the transaction of stock exchange
                    business are Paris and Berlin. In Paris the business can be traced back for
                    about five hundred years, but it was not until 1726 that the Bourse was legally
                    recognized, sixty <hi rend="italic">agents de change</hi> for the transaction of
                    business being appointed in that year by the king. The Bourse now consists of
                    two distinct bodies, known as the <hi rend="italic">parquet</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">coulisse.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">parquet</hi> is composed
                    of the sixty official brokers or <hi rend="italic">agents de change</hi>
                    appointed by the Government, who alone are admitted to the inner business ring
                    of the Bourse. The <hi rend="italic">coulisse</hi> are the outside dealers or
                    brokers, but, unlike the same class in London, these comprise firms of solid
                    standing, bankers, and arbitrage houses. Although a partial settlement occurs
                    once a fortnight, the great bulk of the business on the Paris Bourse is settled
                    for once a month, the arrangements connected therewith occupying no less than
                    six days. Another peculiarity in the mode of conducting business in Paris is
                    that sellers can be compelled to deliver stock at any time during the currency
                    of the account. At Berlin the Bourse is not under Government control, and
                    although a certain number of licences are issued any one may act as a broker.
                    The Bourse can be used by the public on payment of an annual subscription, and
                    all debts incurred there are as obligatory in law as ordinary commercial debts.
                    The settlement occupies three days, and occurs at the end of each month.</p>
                <p>Although stock exchange business in the United States has now attained enormous
                    proportions, it is of comparatively recent origin. The first organization of
                    brokers in New York dates from about 1820. The mode of conducting business in
                    Wall Street differs in some respects from both the English and the Continental
                    procedure. Transactions entered into on one day are settled on the following,
                    and the full amounts involved, and not the mere differences, are paid and
                    received. The jobber, who is of so much importance under the English system, is
                    unknown in New York, as in all cases brokers deal direct with brokers. While
                    stock exchange business in London is of immense variety, and comprises all
                    descriptions of home and foreign Government bonds, railway stocks, and
                    miscellaneous shares, in New York it is confined almost entirely to American
                    railway bonds and shares. In these securities, however, the volume of business
                    in active times is enormous, the vast railway system of the United States
                    providing an ample choice for the investor and a wide field for speculative
                    manipulation. (W. P. H.)</p>
