                    summits, Mount Elias and St Simeon, are crowned by old Byzantine churches—runs
                    through the island; for about 2 miles along the western slope stretches a series
                    of villages, each white-washed house with its own garden and orchard. Apollonia,
                    one of the five (so called because built on the site of a temple to Apollo), is
                    the modern capital; formerly this rank belonged to Kastro (also called
                    Seraglio), an “old-world Italian town” with mediaeval castle and fortifications,
                    and an old town-hall bearing date 1365. Inscriptions found on the spot show that
                    Kastro stands on the site of the ancient city of Siphnos; and Mr Bent identifies
                    the other ancient town of Minoa (see Stephanos) with the place on the coast
                    where a Hellenic white marble tower is distinguished as the Pharos or lighthouse
                    and another as the tower of St John. Churches and convents of Byzantine
                    architecture are scattered about the island. One building of this class is
                    especially interesting—the school of the Holy Tomb or school of Siphnos, founded
                    by Greek refugees from Byzantium at the time of the iconoclastic persecutions,
                    and afterwards a great centre of intellectual culture for the Hellenic world.
                    The endowments of the school are now made over to the gymnasium of Syra. In
                    ancient times Siphnos was famous for its gold and silver mines, the site of
                    which is still easily recognized by the excavations and refuse-heaps. A French
                    company has started mining operations at Kamara. As in antiquity so now the
                    potters of the island are known throughout the Archipelago.</p>
                <p>The wealth of the ancient Siphniotes was shown by their treasury at Delphi, where
                    they deposited the tenth of their gold and silver; but, says the legend, they
                    once sent Apollo a gilded and not a golden bull, and he in his anger flooded
                    their mines. That the mines were invaded by the sea is still evident; and by
                    Strabo’s time the inhabitants of the island were noted for their poverty. During
                    the Venetian period it was ruled first by the Da Corogna family and after 1456
                    by the Gazzadini, who were expelled by the Turks in 1617.</p>
