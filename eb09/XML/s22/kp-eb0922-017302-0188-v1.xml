                    usually distinguished as Captain John Smith, some time president of the English
                    colony in Virginia, was the elder son of George Smith, a well-to-do
                    tenant-farmer on the estate of Lord Willoughby d’Eresby at Willoughby near
                    Alford in Lincolnshire. The life of this Virginian hero falls conveniently into
                    five periods.</p>
                <p>The first of these, 1580-1596, that of his early youth, is thus described by
                    himself in his <hi rend="italic">Travels:</hi> “He was born [1580] in Willoughby
                    in Lincolnshire and was a scholar in the two free schools of Alford and Louth.
                    His parents, dying [April 1596] when he was thirteen [or rather fifteen] years
                    of age, left him a competent means, which he, not being capable to manage,
                    little regarded. His mind being even then set upon brave adventures, he sold his
                        satchel,<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0189-0174"/> books, and all lie had, intending secretly to
                    get to sea, but that his father’s death stayed him. But now the guardians of his
                    estate more regarding it than him, he had liberty enough, though no means, to
                    get beyond the sea. About the age of fifteen years, he was bound an apprentice
                    to Master Thomas Sendall of [King’s] Lynn, the greatest merchant of all those
                    parts; but, because he would not presently send him to sea, he never saw his
                    master in eight years after.”</p>
                <p>The second period, 1596-1604, is that of his adventures in Europe, Asia, and
                    Africa. He first went to Orleans in attendance on the second son of Lord
                    Willoughby. Thence he returned to Paris, and so by Rouen to Havre, where, his
                    money being spent, he began to learn the life of a soldier under Henry IV. of
                    France. On the conclusion of the peace with the League he went with Captain
                    Joseph Duxbury to Holland and served there some time, probably with the English
                    troops in Dutch pay. By this time he had gained a wide experience in the art of
                    war, not merely as an infantry officer, but also in those more technical studies
                    which are now followed by the Royal Engineers. At length he sailed from
                    Enkhuisen to Scotland, and on the voyage had a narrow escape from shipwreck upon
                    Holy Island near Berwick. After some stay in Scotland he returned home to
                    Willoughby, “where, within a short time being glutted with too much company,
                    wherein he took small delight, he retired himself into a little woody pasture, a
                    good way from any town, environed with many hundred acres of other woods. Here
                    by a fair brook he built a pavilion of boughs, where only in his clothes he lay.
                    His study was Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic">Art of War</hi> and Marcus
                    Aurelius; his exercise a good horse with his lance and ring; his food was
                    thought to be more of venison than anything else; what [else] he wanted his man
                    brought him. The country wondering at such a hermit, his friends persuaded one
                    Signior Theadora Polaloga, rider to Henry, earl of Lincoln, an excellent
                    horseman and a noble Italian gentleman, to insinuate [himself] into his woodish
                    acquaintances, whose languages and good discourse and exercise of riding drew
                    Smith to stay with him at Tattersall. . . . Thus, when France and the
                    Netherlands had taught him to ride a horse and use his arms, with such rudiments
                    of war as his tender years, in those martial schools, could attain unto, he was
                    desirous to see more of the world, and try his fortune against the Turks, both
                    lamenting and repenting to have seen so many Christians slaughter one
                    another.”</p>
                <p>Next came his wanderings through France from Picardy to Marseilles. There he took
                    ship for Italy in a vessel full of pilgrims going to Rome. These, cursing him
                    for a heretic, and swearing they would have no fair weather so long as he was on
                    board, threw him, like another Jonah, into the sea. He was able to get to a
                    little uninhabited island, from which he was taken off the next morning by a
                    Breton ship of 200 tons going to Alexandria, the captain of which, named La
                    Roche, treated him as a friend. In this ship he visited Egypt and the Levant. On
                    its way back the Breton ship fought a Venetian argosy of 400 tons and captured
                    it. Reaching Antibes (Var) later on, Captain La Roche put Smith ashore with 500
                    sequins, who then proceeded to see Italy as he had already seen France. Passing
                    through Tuscany he came to Rome, where he saw Pope Clement VIII. at mass, and
                    called on Father R. Parsons. Wandering on to Naples and back to Rome, thence
                    through Tuscany and Venice, he came to Gratz in Styria. There he received
                    information about the Turks who were then swarming through Hungary, and, passing
                    on to Vienna, entered the emperor’s service.</p>
                <p>In this Turkish war the years 1601 and 1602 soon passed away; many desperate
                    adventures did he go through, and one in particular covered him with great
                    honour. At Regal (Stuhlweissenburg), in the presence of two armies, as the
                    champion of the Christians, he fought on horseback and killed three Turkish
                    champions in succession. On 18th November 1602, at the battle of Rothenthurm, a
                    pass in Transylvania, where the Christians fought desperately against an
                    overpowering force of Crim Tatars, Smith was left wounded on the field of
                    battle. His rich dress saved him, for it showed that he would be worth a ransom.
                    As soon as his wounds were cured he was sold for a slave and then marched to
                    Constantinople, where he was presented to Charatza Tragabigzanda, who fell in
                    love with him. Fearing lest her mother should sell him, she sent him to her
                    brother Timor, pasha of Nalbrits, on the Don, in Tartary. “To her unkind brother
                    this kind lady wrote so much for his good usage that he half suspected as much
                    as she intended; for she told him, he should there but sojourn to learn the
                    language, and what it was to be a Turk, till time made her master of herself.
                    But the Timor, her brother, diverted all this to the worst of cruelty. For,
                    within an hour after his arrival, he caused his ‘ drubman ’ to strip him naked,
                    and shave his head and beard so bare as his hand. A great ring of iron, with a
                    long stalk bowed like a sickle, was riveted about his neck, and a coat [put on
                    him] made of ulgry’s hair, guarded about with a piece of an undressed skin.
                    There were many more Christian slaves, and nearly a hundred <hi rend="italic"
                        >fοrsados</hi> of Turks and Moors, and he being the last was the slave of
                    slaves to them all.” While at Nalbrits the English captain kept his eyes open,
                    and his account of the Crim Tatars is careful and accurate. “So long he lived in
                    this miserable estate, as he became a thresher at a grange in a great field,
                    more than a league from the Timor’s house. The pasha, as he oft used to visit
                    his granges, visited him, and took occasion so to beat, spurn, and revile him,
                    that forgetting all reason Smith beat out the Timor’s brains with his threshing
                    bat, for they have no flails, and, seeing his estate could be no worse than it
                    was, clothed himself in the Timor’s clothes, hid his body under the straw,
                    filled his knapsack with corn, shut the doors, mounted his horse, and ran into
                    the desert at all adventure.” For eighteen or nineteen days he rode for very
                    life until he reached a Muscovite outpost on the river Don; here his irons were
                    taken off him, and the Lady Callamata largely supplied all his wants. Thence he
                    passed, attracting all the sympathy of an escaped Christian slave, through
                    Muscovy, Hungary, and Austria until he reached Leipsic in December 1603. There
                    he met his old master, Prince Sigismund, who, in memory of his gallant fight at
                    Regal, gave him a grant of arms and 500 ducats of gold. Thence he wandered on,
                    sightseeing, through Germany, France, and Spain, until he came to Saffi, from
                    which seaport he made an excursion to the city of Morocco and back.</p>
                <p>While at Saffi he was blown out to sea on board Captain Merham’s ship, and had to
                    go as far as the Canaries. There Merham fought two Spanish ships at once and
                    beat them off. Smith came home to England with him, having a thousand ducats in
                    his purse.</p>
                <p>The third period, 1605-1609, is that of Captain Smith’s experiences in Virginia.
                    Throwing himself into the colonizing projects which were then coming to the
                    front, he first intended to have gone out to the colony on the Oyapok in South
                    America; but, Captain Ley dying, and the reinforcement miscarrying, “the rest
                    escaped as they could.” Hence Smith did not leave England on this account. But
                    he went heartily into the Virginian project with Captain Bartholomew Gosnold and
                    others. He states that what he got in his travels he spent in colonizing. “When
                    I went first to these desperate designs, it cost me many a forgotten pound to
                    hire men to go, and<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n190/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0190-0175"/> procrastination caused more to run away than
                    went. I have spared neither pains or money according to my ability, first to
                    procure His Majesty’s letters patents, and a company here, to be the means to
                    raise a company to go with me to Virginia, which beginning here and there cost
                    me nearly five years’ [1604-1609] work, and more than five hundred pounds of my
                    own estate, besides all the dangers, miseries, and incumbrances I endured
                    gratis.” Two colonizing associations were formed,—the London Company for South
                    Virginia and the Western Company for North Virginia. Smith was one of the
                    founders of the London Company. The colonies which Sir W. Raleigh had
                    established at Roanoke and other islands off the American coast had all
                    perished, mainly for want of a good harbour, so that really nothing at all was
                    known of the Virginian coast-line when the first expedition left London on 19th
                    December 1606; and therefore the attempt was bound to fail unless a convenient
                    harbour should be found. The expedition consisted of three ships (the “Susan
                    Constant,” 100 tons, Captain C. Newport; the “God Speed,” 40 tons, Captain B.
                    Gosnold; and a pinnace of 20 tons, Captain J. Ratcliffe), with about 140
                    colonists and 40 sailors. They made first for the West Indies, reaching Dominica
                    on 24th March 1607. At Nevis, their next stopping place, a gallows was erected
                    to hang Captain Smith on the false charge of conspiracy; but he escaped, and,
                    though afterwards the lives of all the men who plotted against him were at his
                    mercy, he spared them. Sailing northwards from the West Indies, not knowing
                    where they were, the expedition was most fortunately, in a gale, blown into the
                    mouth of Chesapeake Bay, discovering land on 26th April 1607. Anchoring, they
                    found the James river, and, having explored it, fixed upon a site for their
                    capital in the district of the chief or weroance of Paspaheh, its chief
                    recommendation being that there were 6 fathoms of water so near to the shore
                    that the ships could be tied to the trees. Orders had been sent out for the
                    government of the colony in a box, which was opened on 26th April 1607. Captains
                    B. Gosnold, E. M. Wingfield, C. Newport, J. Smith, J. Ratcliffe, J. Martin, and
                    G. Kendall were named to be the council to elect an annual president, who, with
                    the council, should govern. Wingfield was, on 13th May, elected the first
                    president; and the next day they landed at James Town and commenced the
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>All this while Smith was under restraint, for thirteen weeks in all. His enemies
                    would have sent him home, out of a sham commiseration for him; but he challenged
                    their charges, and so established his innocency that Wingfield was adjudged to
                    give him £200 as damages. After this, on 20th June 1607, Smith was admitted to
                    the council.</p>
                <p>As in going to America in those days the great difficulty was want of water, so
                    in those colonizing efforts the paramount danger was from want of food. “There
                    were never Englishmen left in a foreign country in such misery as we were in
                    this new discovered Virginia. We watched every three nights [every third night],
                    lying on the bare cold ground, what weather soever came, and warded all the next
                    day, which brought our men to be most feeble wretches. Our food was but a small
                    can of barley sodden in water to five men a day. Our drink, cold water taken out
                    of the river, which was, at a flood, very salt, at a low tide, full of slime and
                    filth, which was the destruction of many of our men.” So great was the mortality
                    that out of 105 colonists living on the 22d June 1607 67 died by the following
                    8th January. The country they had settled in was sparsely populated by many
                    small tribes of Indians, who owned as their paramount chief, Powhatan, who then
                    lived at Werowocomoco, a village on the Pamunkey river, about 12 miles by land
                    from James Town. Various boat expeditions left James Town, to buy food in
                    exchange for copper. They generally had to fight the Indians first, to coerce
                    them to trade, but afterwards paid a fair price for what they bought.</p>
                <p>On 10th December 1607 Captain Smith, of whom it is said “the Spaniard never more
                    greedily desired gold than he victail,” with nine men in the barge, left James
                    Town to get more corn, and also to explore the upper waters of the Chickahominy.
                    They got the barge up as far as Apocant. Seven men were left in it, with orders
                    to keep in midstream. They disobeyed, went into the village, and one of them,
                    George Cassen, was caught; the other six, barely escaping to the barge, brought
                    it back to James Town. It so happened that Opecanchanough (the brother of
                    Powhatan, whom he succeeded in 1618, and who carried out the great massacre of
                    the English on Good Friday 1622) was in that neighbourhood with two or three
                    hundred Indians on a hunting expedition. He ascertained from Cassen where Smith
                    was, who, ignorant of all this, had, with Jehu Robinson and Thomas Emery, gone
                    in a canoe 20 miles farther up the river. The Indians killed Robinson and Emery
                    while they were sleeping by the camp fire, and went after Smith, who was away
                    getting food. They surprised him, and, though he bravely defended himself, he
                    had at last to surrender. He then set his wits to confound them with his
                    superior knowledge, and succeeded. Opecanchanough led him about the country for
                    a wonder, and finally, about 5th January 1608, brought him to Powhatan at
                    Werowocomoco. “Having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could,
                    a long consultation was held; but the conclusion was two great stones were
                    brought before Powhatan; then as many as could laid hands on Smith, dragged him
                    to them, and thereon laid his head. And, being ready with their clubs to beat
                    out his brains, Pocahontas, the king’s dearest daughter, when no entreaty could
                    prevail, got his head in her arms and laid her own upon his to save him from
                    death. Whereat the emperor was contented Smith should live, to make him
                    hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; for they thought him as well of all
                    occupations [handicrafts] as themselves.”</p>
                <p>The truth of this story was never doubted till 1866, when the eminent antiquary,
                    Dr Charles Deane of Cambridge, Mass., in reprinting Smith’s first book, the <hi
                        rend="italic">True Relation</hi> of 1609, pointed out that it contains no
                    reference to this hairbreadth escape. Since then many American historians and
                    scholars have concluded that it never happened at all; and, in order to be
                    consistent, they have tried to prove that Smith was a blustering braggadocio,
                    which is the very last thing that could in truth be said of him. The rescue of a
                    captive doomed to death by a woman is not such an unheard-of thing in Indian
                    stories. If the truth of this deliverance be denied, how then did Smith come
                    back to James Town loaded with presents, when the other three men were killed,
                    George Cassen in particular, in a most horrible manner? And how is it, supposing
                    Smith’s account to be false, that Pocahontas afterwards frequently came to James
                    Town, and was next to Smith himself the salvation of the colony? The fact is,
                    nobody doubted the story in Smith’s lifetime, and he had enemies enough.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pocahontas never visited
                            James Town after Smith went to England in October 1609, until she was
                            brought there a state prisoner in April 1613 by Captain S. Argall, who
                            had obtained possession of her by treachery on the Potomac river. The
                            colony, while treating her well, used her as a means to secure peace
                            with the Indians. In the meantime, believing Smith to be dead, she fell
                            in love with an English gentleman, John Rolfe, apparently at that time a
                            widower. They were married about 1st April 1614. Subsequently she
                            embraced Christianity. Sir T. Dale, with Rolfe and his wife, landed at
                            Plymouth on 12th June 1616. Before she reached London, Smith <pb

                            Anne on her behalf; and it is in this petition of June 1616 that the
                            account of his deliverance by the Indian girl first appears. After a
                            pleasant sojourn of about seven months, being well received both by the
                            court and the people, Pocahontas with her husband embarked for Virginia
                            in the <hi rend="italic">George,</hi> Captain S. Argall (her old
                            captor), but she died off Gravesend about February 1617.</p></note><pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0191-0176"/> Space fails to describe how splendidly Smith
                    worked after his deliverance for the good of the colony, how he explored
                    Chesapeake Bay and its influents, how (when all others had failed) the
                    presidency was forced on him on 10th September 1608; how he tried to seize
                    Powhatan at Werowocomoco on 12th January 1609, but he fled to Orapakes, 40 miles
                    farther off; how with only eighteen men he cowed Opecanchanough in his own house
                    at Pamunkey, in spite of the hundreds of Indians that were there, and made him
                    sell corn; how well he administered the colony all through the spring and summer
                    of 1609.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the establishment of this forlorn hope in Virginia had stirred up a
                    general interest in England, so that the London Company were able in June 1609
                    to send out 9 ships with 500 colonists. Smith had now got the Indians into
                    splendid order; but from the arrival on 11th August of the newcomers his
                    authority came to an end. They refused to acknowledge him, and robbed and
                    injured the Indians, who attacked them in turn. Smith did his best to smooth
                    matters, while the rioters were plotting to shoot him in his bed. In the
                    meantime he was away up the river. On his return, “sleeping in his boat,
                    accidentally one fired his powder bag, which tore his flesh from his body and
                    thighs, 9 or 10 inches square, in a most pitiful manner; but to quench the
                    tormenting fire frying him in his clothes he leaped overboard into the deep
                    river, where, ere they could recover him, he was nearly drowned.” Thus disabled,
                    he was sent home on 4th October 1609 and never set foot in Virginia again.
                    Nemesis overtook the rioters the winter after he left, which is known in
                    Virginian story as “the starving time.” Out of 490 persons in the colony in
                    October 1609 all but 60 died by the following March.</p>
                <p>The rest of Smith’s life can only be briefly touched upon. The third period,
                    1610-1617, was chiefly spent in discovering Nusconcus, Canada, and Pemaquid in
                    North Virginia, to which, at his solicitation, Prince Charles gave the name of
                    New England. His first object was to fish for cod and barter for furs, his next,
                    to discover the coast-line with the view to settlement. Two attempts, in 1615
                    and 1617, to settle at Capawuck failed, but through no fault of his. It was in
                    connexion with these projects that the Western Company for North Virginia gave
                    him the title of admiral of New England. We cannot better conclude this sketch
                    of his active operations than in his own words printed in 1631. “Having been a
                    slave to the Turks; prisoner among the most barbarous savages; after my
                    deliverance commonly discovering and ranging those large rivers and unknown
                    nations with such a handful of ignorant companions that the wiser sort often
                    gave me up for lost; always in mutinies, wants, and miseries; blown up with
                    gunpowder; a long time a prisoner among the French pirates, from whom escaping
                    in a little boat by myself, and adrift all such a stormy winter night, when
                    their ships were split, more than £100,000 lost which they had taken at sea, and
                    most of them drowned upon the Isle of Rhé—not far from whence I was driven on
                    shore, in my little boat, Ac. And many a score of the worst winter months have
                    [I] lived in the fields; yet to have lived near thirty-seven years [1593-1630]
                    in the midst of wars, pestilence, and famine, by which many a hundred thousand
                    have died about me, and scarce five living of them that went first with me to
                    Virginia, and yet to see the fruits of my labours thus well begin to prosper
                    (though I have but my labour for my pains), have I not much reason, both
                    privately and publicly to acknowledge it, and give God thanks? <hi rend="italic"
                        >”</hi></p>
                <p>The last period, 1618-1631, of Smith’s life was chiefly devoted to authorship. In
                    1618 he applied (in vain) to Lord Bacon to be numbered among his servants. In
                    1619 he offered to lead out the pilgrim fathers to North Virginia; but they
                    would not have him, he being a Protestant and they Puritans. The London Virginia
                    Company became bankrupt for £200,000 in 1624. A list of his publications will be
                    found at the end of this article. Thus having done much, endured much, and
                    written much, while still contemplating a <hi rend="italic">History of the
                        Sea,</hi> Captain John Smith died on 21st June 1631, and was buried in St
                    Sepulchre’s Church, London.</p>
                <p>Two of the sixty survivors of “the starving time,” Richard Pots and William
                    Phettiplace, thus nobly expressed in print, so early as 1612, their estimate of
                    Smith: “What shall I say? but thus we lost him [4th October 1609] that in all
                    his proceedings made justice his first guide and experience his second; ever
                    hating baseness, sloth, pride, and indignity more than any dangers; that never
                    allowed more for himself than his souldiers with him; that upon no danger would
                    send them where he would not lead them himself; that would never see us want
                    what he either had, or could by any means get us; that would rather want than
                    borrow or starve than not pay; that loved actions more than words, and hated
                    falsehood and cozenage than death; whose adventures were our lives, and whose
                    loss our deaths.”</p>
