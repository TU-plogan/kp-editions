                    while she had an open eye for the beauties of art and nature. In his thirteenth
                    year the boy was sent to the evangelical seminary at Blaubeuren, near Ulm, to be
                    prepared for the study of theology. Amongst his school-fellows were youths
                    destined to become equally distinguished with himself, of whom he has given
                    sketches in his <hi rend="italic">Christian Märklin.</hi> Amongst the principal
                    masters in the school were Professors Kern and F. C. Baur, who infused into
                    their pupils above all a deep love of the ancient classics. In 1825 Strauss
                    passed from school to the university of Tübingen. The course of study was two
                    years of philosophy and history and three of theology. The professors of
                    philosophy failed to interest him, and he accordingly followed pretty much his
                    own devices in this field, devoting himself especially to Schelling, the writers
                    of the romantic school, Jacob Böhme, and even to somnambulistic and other modern
                    superstitions. In 1826 his previous teachers, Kern and Baur, removed to
                    Tübingen, and the latter introduced him to the writings of Schleiermacher, which
                    awoke his keen dialectical faculty and delivered him from the vagueness and
                    exaggerations of romantic and somnambulistic mysticism, while for a time he
                    found satisfaction for his religious nature in Schleiermacher’s idea of
                    religion. In the last year of his stay at Tübingen he read with Märklin Hegel’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Phänomenologie,</hi> which was the beginning of his
                    abandonment of Schleiermacher for Hegel. In 1830 he passed his examination
                    brilliantly, and became assistant to a country clergyman, and was greatly
                    beloved as preacher and pastor by the parishioners. After nine months in this
                    position he accepted the post of professor in the high school at Maulbronn,
                    having to teach Latin, history, and Hebrew. Here also he was most successful and
                    highly valued. But in October 1831 he resigned his office in order to study
                    under Schleiermacher and Hegel in Berlin. Hegel died just as he arrived, and,
                    though he regularly attended Schleiermacher’s lectures, it was only those on the
                    life of Jesus which exercised a very powerful influence upon him. It was amongst
                    the followers of Hegel that he found kindred spirits. Under the leading of
                    Hegel’s distinction between “Vorstellung” and “Begriff,” he had already
                    conceived the idea of his two principal theological works—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life of Jesus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Christian Dogmatics.</hi> In 1832
                    he returned to Tübingen and became repetent in the university, lecturing on
                    logic, history of philosophy, Plato, and history of ethics, with great success.
                    But in the autumn of 1833 he resigned this position in order to devote all his
                    time to the completion of his projected <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus.</hi> In
                    a year the manuscript was finished, and in 1834 the first volume and in 1835 the
                    second were given to the world. The work produced an immense sensation and
                    created a new epoch in the treatment of the rise of Christianity. The chief
                    replies to it were by Tholuck, Neander, A. Schweizer, Ullmann, and Bruno Bauer.
                    In 1837 Strauss replied to his critics (<hi rend="italic">Streitschriften zur
                    Verteidigung meiner Schrift über das Leben Jesu).</hi> In the third edition of
                    the work (1839), and in <hi rend="italic">Zwei friedliche Blätter,</hi> he made
                    important concessions to his critics, which he withdrew, however, in the fourth
                    edition (1840, translated into English by George Eliot, with Latin preface by
                    Strauss, 1846). In 1840 and the following year he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Christliche Glaubenslehre</hi> (2 vols.), the principle of which
                    is that the history of Christian doctrines is their disintegration. Between the
                    publication of this work and that of the <hi rend="italic">Friedliche
                    Blatter</hi> he had been elected to a chair of theology in the university of
                    Zurich. But the appointment provoked such a storm of popular ill-will in the
                    canton that the authorities considered it wise to pension him before he entered
                    upon his duties, although this concession came too late to save the Government.
                    With his <hi rend="italic">Glaubenslehre</hi> he took leave of theology for
                    upwards of twenty years. In August 1842 he married Agnes Schebest, a cultivated
                    and beautiful opera singer of high repute, but not adapted to be the wife of a
                    scholar and literary man like Strauss. Five years afterwards, when two children
                    had been born, a separation by arrangement was made. Strauss resumed his
                    literary activity by the publication of <hi rend="italic">Der Romantiker auf dem
                    Throne der Caesaren,</hi> in which he drew a satirical parallel between Julian
                    the Apostate and Frederick William IV. of Prussia (1847). In 1848 he was
                    nominated as member of the Frankfort parliament, but was defeated. He was
                    elected for the Würtemberg chamber, but his action was so conservative that his
                    constituents requested him to resign his seat. He forgot his political
                    disappointments in the production of a series of biographical works, which
                    secured for him a permanent place in German literature (<hi rend="italic"

                    With this last-named work (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reimarus)</hi> he returned
                    to theology, and two years afterwards (1864) published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leben Jesu für das Deutsche Volk</hi> (4th ed., 1877). It failed to produce an
                    effect comparable with that of the first <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> but the
                    replies to it were many, and Strauss answered them in his pamphlet <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Halben und die Ganzen</hi> (1865), directed specially against
                    Schenkel and Hengstenberg. His <hi rend="italic">Christus des Glaubens und der
                    Jesus der Geschichte</hi> (1865) is a severe criticism of Schleiermacher’s
                    lectures on the life of Jesus, which were then first published. From 1865 to
                    1872 Strauss resided in Darmstadt, where he made the personal acquaintance of
                    the princess Alice and the crown-princess of Germany, receiving from both ladies
                    many marks of esteem. In 1870 he published his lectures on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voltaire</hi> (3d ed., 1872), which were written for the princess Alice and
                    delivered before her. In the works of these years it seemed that the truth of
                    Christianity had become still more problematic to Strauss, and this was more
                    obvious than ever in his next and last important work, his confession, and final
                    summary answer to the four great questions—Are we Christians? Have we still
                    religion? What is our conception of the world? How are we to regulate our lives?
                    <hi rend="italic">(Der Alle und der Neue Glaube,</hi> 1872, 11th ed., 1881,
                    English translation by M. Blind, 1873). The work produced a greater sensation
                    than his first <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus,</hi> and not least amongst
                    Strauss’s own friends, who wondered at his one-sided view of Christianity, his
                    professed abandonment of all spiritual philosophy, the strange inconsistencies
                    of his thought, his scientific credulity, and the offensive form of his
                    negations. To the fourth edition of the book he added a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nachwort als Vorwort</hi> (1873). The same year symptoms of a fatal malady
                    appeared, and death followed February 7, 1874. Though his last book renounced in
                    almost frivolous language the hope of immortality, he read Plato’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> in the Greek during his last days, and Zeller says
                    “his friends bade him adieu with feelings such as Plato has described at the end
                    of that dialogue.”</p>
                <p>Strauss’s mind was almost exclusively analytical and critical, without depth of
                    religious feeling, or philosophical penetration, or historical sympathy. His
                    work was accordingly rarely constructive, and, save when he was dealing with a
                    kindred spirit, he failed as an historian, biographer, and critic, strikingly
                    illustrating Goethe’s profoundly true principle that loving sympathy is
                    essential for productive criticism. His first <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Jesus</hi> was directed against not only the traditional orthodox view of the
                    Gospel narratives, but likewise the rationalistic treatment of them, whether
                    after the manner of Reimarus or that of Paulus. The mythical theory that the
                    Christ of the Gospels, excepting the most meagre outline of personal history,
                    was the unintentional creation of the early Christian Messianic expectation he
                    applied with merciless rigour and mechanical inconsideration to the narratives.
                    But his operations were based upon fatal defects, positive and negative. He held
                    a narrow theory as to the miraculous, a still narrower as to the relation of the
                    divine to the human, and he had no true idea of the nature of historical
                    tradition, while, as C. F. Baur complained, his critique of the Gospel history
                    had not been preceded by the essential preliminary critique of the Gospels
                    themselves. With a broader and deeper philosophy of religion, juster canons of
                    historical criticism, with a more exact knowledge of the date and origin of the
                    Gospels, his rigorous application of the mythical theory with its destructive
                    results would have been impossible. In his second <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    Jesus,</hi> though conceding something to C. F. Baur, he adheres substantially
                    to his mythical theory, while he seeks to make good one defect of the first <hi
                    rend="italic">Life</hi> by supplying a previous examination of the Gospels. But
                    this examination shows little independent research, being scarcely more than the
                    adoption of the conclusions of C. F. Baur and his earlier disciples. Another
                    advance on the first work is the addition of a sketch of the historical facts of
                    the life of Jesus and of his religious character, but he adheres to his early
                    limited and shallow view of the relation of the divine and the human, and still
                    fails to apprehend the true mission of the founder of the Christian religion.
                    But the estimate of the religious mission of Jesus, and of the historical
                    trustworthiness of the Gospels, is far higher in this <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life</hi> than the final one in <hi rend="italic">Der Alte und der Neue
                    Glaube.</hi> As in his philosophical development he exhibited waver ing
                    uncertainty, so it is impossible to reconcile his views of Christ and
                    Christianity at different periods of his life. Some of the expressions of his
                    last book in this respect are in glaring contrast with the positions he
                    maintained in earlier years.</p>
