                    he sent to Clusius <hi rend="italic">{Exotic. Auctarium,</hi> p. 367). The word
                    being thence copied by Willughby has been generally adopted by English authors,

                    originally peculiar.</p></note> the name for a long while given to certain of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Laridse</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gull,</hi> vol. xi.
                    p. 274), which sufficiently differ in structure, appearance, and habits to
                    justify their separation as a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Stercorarius
                    (Lestris</hi> of some writers), or even Subfamily, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stercorariinae.</hi> Swift of flight, powerfully armed, but above all endowed
                    with extraordinary courage, they pursue their weaker cousins, making the latter
                    disgorge their already-swallowed prey, which is nimbly caught before it reaches
                    the water; and this habit, often observed by sailors and fishermen, has made
                    these predatory and parasitic birds locally known as “Teasers,”
                    “Boatswains,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This name
                    in seamen’s ornithology applies to several other kinds of birds, and, though
                    perhaps first given to those of this group, is nowadays most commonly used for
                    the species of <hi rend="smallcaps">Tropic-bird</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> the projecting middle feathers of the tail in each kind being
                    generally likened to the marlinespike that is identified with the boatswain’s
                    position; but perhaps the authoritative character assumed by both bird and
                    officer originally suggested the name.</p></note> and, from a misconception of
                    their intent, “Dunghunters.” On land, however, whither they resort to breed,
                    they seek food of their own taking, whether small mammals, little birds,
                    insects, or berries; but even here their uncommon courage is exhibited, and they
                    will defend their homes and offspring with the utmost spirit against any
                    intruder, repeatedly shooting down on man or dog that invades their haunts,
                    while every bird almost, from an Eagle downwards, is repelled by buffets or
                    something worse.</p>
                <p>The largest species known is the <hi rend="italic">Stercorarius catarrhactes</hi>
                    of ornithologists—the "Skooi” or “Bonxie” of the Shetlanders, a bird in size
                    equalling a Herring-Gull, <hi rend="italic">Larus argentatus.</hi> The sexes do
                    not differ appreciably in colour, which is of a dark brown, somewhat lighter
                    beneath; but the primaries have at the base a patch of white, visible even when
                    the wings are closed, and forming, when they are spread, a conspicuous band. The
                    bill and feet are black. This is a species of comparatively limited range,
                    breeding only in some two or three localities in the Shetlands, about half a
                    dozen in the Faeroes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    has long been subjected to persecution in these islands, a reward being paid for
                    its head. On the other hand, in the Shetlands a fine was exacted for its death,
                    as it was believed to protect the sheep against Eagles. Yet for all this it
                    would long ago have been extirpated there, and have ceased to be a British bird
                    in all but name, but for the special protection afforded it by several members
                    of two families</p><p>(Edmonston and Scott of Melby), whose exertions to that
                    effect deserve the praise and recognition of all ornithologists.</p></note> and
                    hardly more in Iceland. Out of the breeding-season it shows itself in most parts
                    of the North Atlantic, but never seems to stray further south than Gibraltar or
                    Morocco, and it is therefore a matter of much interest to find the Southern
                    Ocean inhabited by a bird—the “Port Egmont Hen” of Cook’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voyages—</hi> which so closely resembles the Skua as to have been for a long
                    while regarded as specifically identical with it, but is now usually recognized
                    as distinct under the name of <hi rend="italic">S. antarcticus.</hi> This bird,
                    characterized by its stout deep bill and want of rufous tint on its lower
                    plumage, has an extensive range, and would seem to exhibit a tendency to further
                    differentiation, since Mr Saunders, in a monograph of the group (<hi
                    rend="italic">Prοc. Zook Society,</hi> 1876, pp. 317-332), says that it presents
                    three local forms—one occurring from New Zealand to Norfolk Island and past
                    Kerguelen Land to the Cape of Good Hope, another restricted to the Falklands,
                    and the third hitherto only met with near the south-polar ice. On the western
                    coast of South America, making its way into the Straits of Magellan, and passing
                    along the coast so far as Rio Janeiro, is found <hi rend="italic">S.
                    chilensis,</hi> distinguished among other characters by the cinnamon tint of its
                    lower plumage. Three other smaller species of the genus are known, and each is
                    more widely distributed than those just mentioned, but the home of all is in the
                    more northern parts of the earth, though in winter two of them go very far
                    south, and, crossing the equator, shew themselves on the seas that wash the Cape
                    of Good Hope, Australia, New Zealand, and Peru. The first of them is <hi
                    rend="italic">S. pomatorhinus</hi> (often incorrectly spelt <hi rend="italic"
                    >pomarinus),</hi> about the size of a common Gull, <hi rend="italic">Larus
                    canus,</hi> and presenting, irrespective of sex, two very distinct phases of
                    plumage, one almost wholly sooty-brown, the other particoloured—dark above and
                    white on the breast, the sides of the neck being of a glossy straw-colour, and
                    the lower part of the neck and the sides of the body barred with brown; but a
                    singular feature in the adults of this species is that the two median
                    tail-feathers, which are elongated, have their shaft twisted towards the tip, so
                    that in flight the lower surfaces of their webs are pressed together vertically,
                    giving the bird the appearance of having a disk attached to its tail. The second
                    and third species so closely resemble each other, except in size, that their
                    distinctness was for many years unperceived, and in consequence their
                    nomenclature is an almost bewildering puzzle. Mr Saunders (<hi rend="italic"
                    >loc. cit.)</hi> thinks that the larger of them, which is about the size of a
                    Blackheaded Gull, should stand as <hi rend="italic">S. crepidatus,</hi> and the
                    smaller as <hi rend="italic">S. parasiticus,</hi> though the latter name has
                    been generally used for the larger when that is not termed, as it often is, <hi
                    rend="italic">S. richardsoni</hi> —a name that correctly applies only to
                    whole-coloured examples, for this species too is dimorphic. Even its proper
                    English name<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is the
                    “Fasgadair” of the Hebrides, the “Shooi” of the Shetlands, and the
                    “Scouti-allen” of the fishermen on the east coast of Scotland.</p></note> is
                    disputable, but it has been frequently called the Arctic Gull or Arctic Skua,
                    and it is by far the commonest of the genus in Britain, and perhaps throughout
                    the northern hemisphere. It breeds abundantly on many of the Scottish islands,
                    and in most countries lying to the northward. The nest is generally in long
                    heather, and contains two eggs of a dark olive-colour, suffused with still
                    darker brown patches. Birds of either phase of plumage pair indiscriminately,
                    and the young shew by their earliest feathers whether they will prove whole or
                    particoloured; but in their immature plumage the upper surface is barred with
                    pale reddish-brown. The smallest species, commonly known in English as the
                    Long-tailed or Buffon’s Skua, is not known to exhibit the remarkable dimorphism
                    to which the two preceding are subject. It breeds abundantly in some seasons on
                    the fells of Lapland, its appearance depending chiefly on the presence of
                    lemmings (<hi rend="italic">Lemmus norvegicus),</hi> on which it mainly preys.
                    All these three species occasionally visit the southern coasts of Europe in
                    large flocks, but their visitations are highly irregular. (A. N.)</p>
