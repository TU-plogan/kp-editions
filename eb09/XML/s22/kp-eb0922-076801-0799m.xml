                    case of man the power of swimming is acquired, not natural. As compared with the
                    lower animals, to most of which it comes perfectly easily, he is at a
                    disadvantage in its acquisition, owing not to his greater relative weight so
                    much as to the position of his centre of gravity, along with the fact that in
                    the case of quadrupeds the motions which serve to support and propel them in the
                    water are very similar to those of locomotion on land. No race of mankind,
                    however, can be mentioned to which the art is unknown, and in many barbarous
                    countries it is more widely diffused and carried to greater perfection than
                    amongst the civilized nations of the world.</p>
                <p>For learning to swim, a quiet sandy beach is the best place, as sea water is more
                    buoyant than fresh. All artificial aids, such as corks, air belts, cork jackets,
                    inflated bladders, and the like, may be avoided; they raise some parts of the
                    body too high above and so sink others too far below the natural plane of
                    flotation, whereas the first fundamental rule is that the mouth only should be
                    above water, and the legs close to the surface. Belts, &amp;c., are also apt to
                    become misplaced and so cause trouble and annoyance as well as danger. It is
                    best for beginners to take some instruction from a practical teacher, though
                    many have become adepts by merely watching good performers. Confidence in the
                    floating power of the body is the first thing to be acquired. The easiest way of
                    floating is to lie on the back (which should be slightly hollowed), the arms
                    being stretched out beyond the head but not lifted out of the water; this
                    attitude not only facilitates respiration but counterbalances the weight of the
                    lower limbs. The knees may be bent outward, the toes also pointing sideways, the
                    hips rigid, so assisting to keep the legs up as close as possible to the top of
                    the water. By easy breathing one will soon be convinced that, properly balanced
                    and with lungs kept charged, the body will assert its buoyancy.</p>
                <p>To further enable him to realize that water is capable of supporting the human
                    body, the learner may adopt the following plan. Walk down the steps of a bath,
                    or along a shelving beach on a calm day, into about 3 feet of water; turn and
                    face the shallow place, and, having taken a breath, stoop down and try to pick
                    an egg or some similar object (a handful of sand will suffice) from the bottom.
                    Repeat this several times leisurely, going farther out at each venture, till the
                    water reaches up to but not higher than the middle of the chest. It will soon be
                    found that the object is not so easy of recovery, and the beginner learns that
                    but little exertion is required to keep the body afloat. When this experience
                    has been gained the novice should commence with the <hi rend="italic">Breast
                    Stroke,</hi> which is nowadays some times unjustly set aside as the “old
                    stroke.” It is neat, natural, and graceful enough, though necessarily the
                    slowest, from the great resistance of the chest to the water and the fact that
                    part of the arm stroke is negatived by its own movement. Like walking in
                    pedestrianism, however, it forms the groundwork of every other branch of the
                    art, and cannot safely be overlooked. The stroke is commenced by placing the
                    hands with the backs upward, and the wrists bent so that the fingers will point
                    to the front, the insides of the wrist-joints between arm and thumbs touching
                    the breast not lower than 4 inches under water. Begin the stroke by pushing the
                    arms gently forward to their full extent, keeping the palms flat and the fingers
                    closed. Now turn the palms of both hands outward, and make a strong stroke to
                    the right and left by each arm through an angle of 90°; in this part of the
                    stroke the two arms describe a semicircle, of which the head may be termed the
                    centre. It must be most distinctly borne in mind that all depression of the
                    hands will tend to raise the body perpendicularly, whereas the only true
                    position in swimming is the horizontal, which propels it forward. To complete
                    the arm movement, bend the elbows backward and inward, until they come close to
                    (but not necessarily touching) the sides of the body. Carry the hands in a
                    straight line edgeways to the position from which they started in front of the
                    chest. Simultaneously with the stretching of the hands from the front of the
                    body the feet are struck out to the utmost width in a way cleft for them by the
                    toes. As the arms are being brought round in the semicircular motion the lower
                    limbs are stiffened and brought firmly together by grasping the water, so to
                    speak, with the whole of the leg, more especially between the knees, ankles, and
                    soles and toes of the feet. Whilst thus imparting forward motion to the swimmer,
                    they finish in a straight line behind the body. Then, when the arms are bent,
                    and the hands are being brought to the front of the body, the knees are turned
                    outward, heels kept together, toes also turned out, and the feet are carried up
                    to the body and in this position are once more ready for repeating the movements
                    as described. Beginners must be careful not to make the arm movements quicker
                    than those of the legs, and it must be distinctly remembered that the latter are
                    the great propellers. Unison of the movements as mentioned, and regularity in
                    each part of the stroke, are indispensable to perfection. All hurry and
                    excitement must be carefully avoided, and every complete stroke and kick gone
                    about with mechanical precision and neatness. The only part requiring strong
                    muscular exertion being the closing of the legs after they have been spread wide
                    apart,—the one strong propelling element,—every effort is to be made to ensure
                    correctness and power in its performance. The arm movements should be easy and
                    graceful, all jerkiness or suddenness of motion being carefully avoided.</p>
                <p>Breathing should be unrestrained and natural, without gasping, sputtering, or
                    short or sudden heavings. A safe rule is to have a full breath at every stroke,
                    its division being regulated as follows. Blow slowly outward when the first part
                    of the arm movement is being performed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, stretched
                    out in front; inspire as the hands are going outward and round. Then, as the
                    lungs are fully charged, no effort is necessary to suspend respiration while the
                    hands are carried in to the front of the body again. This regularity of
                    breathing is essential to pleasure, comfort, and gracefulness of action. The
                    nostrils and air-passages should always be thoroughly cleared, the mouth
                    cleansed, and the throat gargled before entering the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Swimming on the Back</hi> is a pleasant and useful branch of
                    the art; the chief requisite for its acquirement is confidence. The tyro should
                    begin practice in water reaching<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0800-0769"/> up to about the upper part of the chest, turn his
                    back shoreward, take a long breath, and lie gently backward in the water,
                    keeping the hands on the waist with the elbows extended outward, the chest being
                    expanded, and the breath held. As one lies well back the feet will be lifted off
                    the ground; they should then be spread outward as far apart as possible, in the
                    same position as when they are opened up in breast swimming. The body and legs
                    are thus lying extended at full length like the letter Y, the legs forming the
                    branches or fork. Now comes the propelling part of the movement. As in the front
                    stroke, the muscles are set, and the legs are by one strong motion brought
                    firmly and closely together. While this is being done the toes, by a slight
                    movement of the ankle, are turned upward, and so, as the movement is finished,
                    the great toes, inner ankles, and inside of the whole leg meet. This motion,
                    strongly but not jerkily executed, sends the body forward, and, when the impetus
                    obtained is nearly— not quite—expended, the legs are bent, so that the feet are
                    drawn close up to the trunk, with the knees outward and heels together. The
                    stroke is renewed by spreading apart, closing again, and so on. The breath is
                    exhaled when spreading and closing the legs, and inhaled as the feet are drawn
                    up to the body. If greater speed is wanted, the hands can be used as sculls by
                    carrying them outward from the body, but at the same time level with it, palms
                    facing downward. When the arms are sufficiently extended to be in a line across
                    from hand to hand, the wrists are turned to allow of the palms of the hands
                    facing toward the feet, thumbs upward. Elbows, wrists, and hands are now firmly
                    braced, and a strong pull towards the legs is made. This is the progressive
                    motion, and should be performed just as the legs are being closed.</p>
                <p>Another style is to bend the elbows downward, so as to allow of the hands being
                    carried upward along the sides of the body, thumbs inward, and palms facing the
                    bottom of the water. When the hands have been carried up to the armpits they are
                    spread apart to the full extent of the arms, and the propelling part is
                    performed as in the other method by pulling strongly toward the legs.</p>
                <p>A still more powerful stroke, and one used at competitions, is accomplished by
                    carrying the hands up to the armpits, as described in last method; then, turning
                    the wrist so as to allow of the palms of the hands facing upward, point the
                    fingers in the direction of progress, stretch both arms as far as possible in a
                    line with the body and beyond the head, and turn the wrists half round, until
                    the hands are back to back, thumbs upward. The propelling action is now
                    performed by sweeping both hands outward and round until they touch the legs and
                    the arms are once more straight along the sides of the body. There is a double
                    kick in this style, and the action is as follows. When the hands are being
                    carried up to the shoulder one kick is delivered; then as the arms are being
                    carried beyond the head the nether limbs are drawn up in position for another
                    kick, which is delivered as the arms are sweeping down on the stroke. This is no
                    mere ornamental stroke, but combines in its practice grace with power, and
                    enables the swimmer to move through the water at great speed.</p>
                <p>Another racing back stroke is performed by lifting hands and arms out of the
                    water at the finish of the pull downward, carrying them in the air, stretching
                    them at full length forward beyond the head, and then dipping them into the
                    water, executing the positive part of the stroke as in the last-described
                    method. In this stroke there is only a single kick to each pull of the arms, the
                    legs being drawn up as the arms are swung up in the air and closed as the arms
                    are pulled through the water. While this movement is much practised by some
                    experts, it is neither so graceful nor so speedy as the other, and there is much
                    splashing, while steering is, in the case of a close race, likely to become
                    rather erratic. Both are at the present time the fastest known methods of
                    swimming on the backhand, with moderately good turning and pushing in a swimming
                    bath, 100 yards should be covered in about 74 seconds, probably less.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">treading</hi> as a branch of swimming something should be
                    known by every one. It is the only department of the art that is at all natural;
                    and, if treading were resorted to in cases of accidental immersion,
                    three-fourths of the resulting deaths would be prevented. The essential
                    condition, of course, is that the hands be kept under water. When one falls into
                    water the legs sink and the body assumes a perpendicular position, the water
                    splashes over the face, and, once the eyes become filled or the mouth covered,
                    the inclination of any one unable to swim is to throw the hands up and make an
                    effort as if to creep along on the surface. These efforts only increase the
                    danger of the position. On becoming submerged one should keep perfectly inactive
                    for a brief time; the head will soon rise above the surface, and at this moment
                    one ought to beat downward with both hands alternately, never allowing them to
                    splash or disturb the surface, the head being leaned back so as to keep only the
                    face and nostrils clear. The back of the head and ears may be covered, but this
                    does not matter. The motions of the hands, exactly similar to those of a dog’s
                    forepaws when swimming and walking, are to be continued, the feet at the same
                    time striking down— not hurriedly, nor with sudden jerky movement, but easily
                    and gracefully, the ankles moving as if working treadles, so that the soles of
                    the feet act as sustaining and, it may be, propelling surfaces. The movements of
                    hands and feet may be altered by beating downward with both hands at once, or
                    both feet at once, but in cases of accident the former action is to be
                    recommended. Swimmers, when treading at competitions or for display, either fold
                    their arms across their chest or hold hands and arms above the surface. In
                    artistic swimming trials, as much as possible of the body should be shown above
                    the surface, and bobbing up and down ought to be avoided. Treading is of much
                    importance even to a good swimmer, as it allows him to divest himself of upper
                    clothing, and enables him to lay hold of anything, such as a rope or line that
                    does not quite reach the surface; it is also the most comfortable position in
                    which one can partake of refreshment in case of a long swim, and is useful for
                    purposes of conversation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Side Stroke</hi> may be said to hold in swimming a position
                    somewhat similar to that of running in pedestrianism; as it becomes better
                    known, the advantages of this style of aquatic progression are becoming more and
                    more appreciated. The practice of it, however, ought not to be begun until
                    complete proficiency has been attained in the primary stroke. Its main
                    recommendations are apparent almost at a glance. A good average side movement
                    will carry the swimmer a stroke in two seconds, each stroke covering a distance
                    of fully six feet. The method is said by some to have been introduced by George
                    Pewters about the year 1850. The body is turned on either side, but preferably
                    with the right side downward, as thereby the legs act more freely and naturally
                    and the heart has no weight on it to impede its action. The head is more
                    immersed and thereby reduced in weight, being supported by the water and not by
                    any muscular exertion of the neck or shoulder, and the lower extremities are
                    less immersed than in the breast stroke. If one is lying on the right side, the
                    right arm is thrown boldly out in front, with the palm of the hand downward and
                    on a level with the lower side of the head. When pushed out to the utmost it is
                    kept rigid, brought downward through the water in one strong movement, without
                    any bending of either wrist or elbow,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0801-0770"/> and this, the positive action, is finished when
                    the hand has reached the legs, and comes between these limbs at full stretch. It
                    is then carried up along the body to the chin, and the stroke renewed. The left
                    hand is formed into a scoop, turned outward by the wrist at right angles to the
                    fore-arm. The left arm, with the elbow bent, is then directed outward, and makes
                    a straight pulling (not circular nor swinging) stroke to the left hip. When one
                    arm is performing the negative the other is at the positive part of the stroke.
                    The action of the legs should be long and vigorous, and they should never cross
                    each other, but should work in unison with the arms and shoulders. The left knee
                    is brought up in front of the body, with the foot in front of and at right
                    angles to the body. Put the foot in a line with the front of the leg, and bring
                    it round to meet the other in a line with the body. Meanwhile stretch the right
                    or lower leg as far away as possible from the body toward the back and then
                    bring it down to meet the other by a powerful plain stroke. The legs are then
                    returned upward to the body, the heels touching, the knees apart, the toes of
                    the left foot forward and of the right foot downward. To learn this graceful and
                    useful side stroke some persons need long and steady practice; others acquire it
                    comparatively quickly. The swimmer steers with his left or right hand and arm as
                    the direction demands. The head and neck must be held in one position, not
                    raised nor turned at any part of the stroke. Bearings should be taken from what
                    can be seen in the line of vision away from and in front of the body, and only
                    very seldom indeed should the head be turned to look in advance. Breath is
                    inhaled as the under hand is pulling downward, and exhalation should take place
                    while the mouth is immersed, which is when the uppermost hand is performing the
                    stroke along the body.</p>
                <p>The coincident movement of arms and legs may be thus described. As the legs are
                    bent up to the body the upper or left hand has been stretched in front and the
                    right or lower arm has just finished the pull. As the top arm pulls downward the
                    legs are opened wide and almost in the same motion swung round and closed. It
                    will be apparent that the legs are returned upward with knees bent as the
                    downward pull is being performed with the lower arm. No effort is to be made to
                    sink the head, neither is it to be held up in any way. The turn of the body by
                    the power of the strokes will be quite enough to allow of the lips being
                    sufficiently clear of the water for the purpose of inspiration. There should be
                    no sudden pull at any part whatever of this complete stroke.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Overhand Stroke,</hi> when properly practised and acquired,
                    is the most useful and easy of all styles of swimming. Beginners, however,
                    should beware of acquiring it before they are thorough adepts with the side
                    stroke, otherwise they lose all power of speed and good appearance. Harry Gurr
                    is sometimes said to have been the inventor of this stroke in 1863, but Harry
                    Gardener, in August of the year previous, when he won the 500 yards championship
                    in Manchester, used the overhand or over-arm stroke. The only movements of the
                    side stroke which differ from those of the overhand are those of the left or
                    upper arm and hand. By carrying this arm in the air a lengthened reach is
                    obtained above the surface. As in the side stroke, the head lies as far as
                    possible into the water, the body, legs, and feet in a straight line level with
                    and close to the surface. The left arm is carried forward and stretched as far
                    as possible out of the water in a line with the face and in advance of the head.
                    The arm and hand re-enter the water, and are pulled through it with the
                    strongest propelling stroke. The limb out of water should be carried through the
                    air quietly, gracefully, and evenly till dipped for the stroke, not swung
                    uselessly round from the shoulder in a half circle. The left arm and hand being
                    in the air, the head lies deeper in the water than in the side stroke, and it is
                    reduced in weight. The legs work simultaneously with the left arm; that is, they
                    are drawn up as this arm reaches in front, and are at their nearest wide stretch
                    by the time it is in position for the pull; they are then pulled strongly
                    together as the upper arm is performing its strong movement. At no time when the
                    upper arm is being carried forward above the water should the hand be higher
                    than a very few (say about three) inches above the surface. The elbow alone is
                    elevated, and is the highest part of the arm. In fact, the hand is so close to
                    the surface that, on being lifted upward after the delivery of the stroke, the
                    wrist has to be bent; otherwise the fingers would actually touch the water.
                    Once, however, the hand comes opposite the eyes it is straightened in a line
                    with the fore-arm and in this position carried to the dipping point. Breathing
                    is regulated in precisely the same way as when swimming by means of the side
                    stroke.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Touching and Turning. —</hi> The methods of "touch and turn”
                    were brought into vogue by the now numerous swimming races in baths. Whether the
                    baths be long or short, from 10 to 15 feet in the push-off is gained at each end
                    of every length by all competitors. Assuming that the swimmer is using the side
                    or overhand stroke and going on the right side, the method to be adopted is as
                    follows. When within 3 feet of the end wall of the bath the left or upper hand
                    quits its propelling movement, and reaches in front of the head till it touches
                    the wall just above water-mark. The palm of the hand is then placed horizontally
                    on the wall, the fingers to the right, which is the direction to which one is
                    turning; the little finger is uppermost and thumb undermost. The knees are bent,
                    and the body, now close to the wall, is turned to the right on its own axis by
                    the left hand, after which the feet press against the wall under the hand. As in
                    diving and plunging, the body, arms, and hands are in a straight line, and the
                    head between the biceps, all under water. The thighs are doubled up under the
                    loins, the calves of the legs touching the back of the thighs, and the soles of
                    the feet pressing hard against the wall. A strong push-off is made by the feet
                    and legs, and the swimmer resumes his ordinary stroke and course for a new
                    length.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ocean Swimming.—</hi> Persons having from any cause to swim in
                    the heavy rolling breakers of mid ocean should use the side stroke when
                    available. No attempt should be made to breast or mount the waves. By taking
                    their direction a side-stroke swimmer is carried an unexpectedly long distance.
                    The large dangerous rollers come almost in regular succession after an interval
                    of small waves. The swimmer soon notices them, fills his lungs, swims into them,
                    ducking the head, and quickly emerges when the wave has passed. Then a fresh
                    supply of breath is inhaled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plunging.—</hi> In this the performer enters the water in
                    somewhat the same manner as when diving (see below), but at a flat angle, and
                    from the moment of doing so makes no active muscular movement whatever of any
                    part of the body under water. Plunging came into vogue as the most graceful and
                    practical method of starting in swimming races. From 3 to 5 feet above the
                    water-level makes the best springing point, whether from bank, board, or rock.
                    The knees should be kept together and slightly bent, with the weight on the
                    balls of the feet and the lungs fully charged. The spring forward at the signal
                    to start is given with all muscular power available. A swing of the arms from
                    behind is taken, and, as the feet quit their support, the arms are swung forward
                    so as to rise up to and straight beyond the head. The body is shot into mid-air
                    as far as possible, and, before touching the water, the head falls between the
                    arms till the chin just touches the chest and the ear grazes the inside of the
                    biceps. The body now glides gracefully and almost noiselessly into the water,
                    with the chest slightly hollowed, the shoulders contracted, and the arms rigidly
                    braced out straight. The hands are now laid flat and the thumbs locked, while
                    the hips and ankles are kept in one rigid straight line, with the soles of the
                    feet turned upward and level with the surface, the toes pointing straight
                    behind. The forward motion from the spring continues as long as the body will
                    float and the air in the lungs can be held, when the feet, followed by the arms,
                    begin to sink, and the plunger ends his performance by merely raising his head.
                    Adepts in this branch have saved themselves from a sinking vessel by a long
                    plunge from the ship’s side, and so by one effort have got clear out of the
                    vortex that is caused by her settling down and sinking.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diving.—</hi> The rule in diving, as distinguished from
                    plunging, is most explicit. In diving alone are the limbs allowed to make
                    muscular movements under water. When properly performed it is a most graceful
                    feat to the eye, and a good swimmer is, as a rule,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0802-0771"/> known by the way in which he enters the water.
                    The height of the end of the board from the surface of the water may be from 3
                    to 20 feet. If the water is taken properly a clean dive or header is made, but
                    some swimmers are careless and will flop into the water with the body contracted
                    like a ball, instead of straightened out like an arrow. The descent of good
                    divers into the water varies from 3 to 4 feet, of clumsy performers from 7 to 8
                    feet. The dive may be a standing or running one. The feet and legs are kept
                    together, with the chest inflated, the arms slightly swung to and fro twice or
                    so, and the body and legs bent towards the water. The lungs are charged, and the
                    dive is made immediately before the arms and hands are raised forward into the
                    air above the bent head. The feet are used with all the power possible in
                    springing off. When in mid air the diver straightens himself out from finger
                    tips to toes. The shoot downwards is made by declining the arms so as to enclose
                    the head, the chest is momentarily contracted, and the water is gracefully and
                    noiselessly entered fingers first. The instant the body is covered, throw up the
                    head and arms so as to reach the surface. The eyes instinctively close as they
                    enter the water; if it were otherwise, the force with which the surface is
                    struck might cause injury, especially in the case of high diving. As soon as the
                    water is entered the eyes should be opened, as swimming under water with them
                    closed may be attended with danger. The best method for novices is to begin from
                    a board 3 feet high; and, as confidence and a good style are acquired, the
                    height may be raised 1 or 1½ feet at a time. Running headers are accomplished by
                    running 10 or 12 paces before springing off, and the diver endeavours to clear
                    as long a distance as possible before entering the water. Muscles and weight
                    have nothing whatever to do with perfection in diving. Slim youths and heavy
                    middle-aged men and women have alike excelled in this branch of aquatics. The
                    important requisites are courage and strength of nerve, combined with
                    experimental knowledge of the behaviour of the body while in air and water. Do
                    not enter the water feet first. This is only done by those who have not the
                    courage to dive in the proper manner, and it sometimes causes harm to the
                    respiratory organs, while one may lose balance and so come on to the water quite
                    flat and be seriously injured in the stomach, ribs, or spine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Object Diving.—</hi> Some divers move over the bottom in
                    straight lines, and others search on no plan at all. The best way is to strike
                    to the right or left on the circumference of the circle surrounding the objects
                    and work spirally inwards to the centre of the circle. If the face be kept close
                    to the bottom and the eyes brought well into use success will reward one’s
                    efforts, and no object ought to be missed. For object diving the drawers should
                    have a pocket easily accessible to one hand, in order to receive the objects
                    raised. These are collected by swimming on the breast as quickly as possible.
                    All movements under water ought to be gone about with the utmost alacrity, but
                    at the same time without undue haste or flurry, otherwise the heart’s action
                    will be increased, the breath will suffer, and the stay under water will be
                    shortened.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plate Swimming.—</hi> This is a most interesting and enjoyable
                    branch of the art. From a very early period we find references to mechanical
                    appliances as aids to progression and support in the water, these helps
                    generally taking the form of large flat surfaces made of wood, tin, leather,
                    waterproof fabrics, or other similar materials. Sometimes they were flat, in
                    other instances slightly concave. Some were made banded like the covers of a
                    book, or hinged, others opened and closed with umbrella-like action, while quite
                    a large number were made web-like, to resemble a duck’s foot; nearly all were
                    more or less collapsible. From what can be gleaned of the style of these
                    articles it is evident that the inventors cannot have been familiar with the
                    principles of swimming, or aquatic propulsive action, and so, while a number of
                    the contrivances were undoubtedly the outcome of much thought and ingenuity,
                    they could not be regarded as in any way improving on the ordinary or primitive
                    swimming movements; and, while greater surface than is offered by hands and feet
                    was always given, with the evident intention of reducing “slip,” much resistance
                    took place at the neutral or negative part of the stroke. The one good effect in
                    most of these inventions was thus more than nullified by this “drag,” which,
                    besides being objectionable in itself, had the additional disadvantage of
                    bringing into requisition muscles of legs and arms the development of which was
                    antagonistic to perfection of swimming. In 1876 Mr R. H. Wallace-Dunlop, C.B.,
                    announced that he had invented swimming plates which afforded increased speed
                    without causing undue straining of the muscles; and these claims have been
                    justified by subsequent experience. The arrangements for a lateral movement of
                    the heels in the footboards or plates, with freedom of the ankles, showed at
                    once that Mr Dunlop had fully studied the details of the art of swimming, with
                    the effect of greatly reducing “slip” in the positive and altogether doing away
                    with “drag” in tho negative parts of the leg stroke. Slow swimmers, by the use
                    of the new appliances, move quickly and easily through the water, whilst
                    moderately fast swimmers have their speed increased to an almost wonderful
                    extent. To swim 100 yards in 70 seconds without artificial aid is regarded as a
                    good per formance: there are not half a dozen living swimmers who can reduce
                    this time by so much as five seconds. Yet about ten years ago a London swimmer,
                    not by any means the fastest, with the assistance of the plates covered the
                    distance of 100 yards in 60 seconds. It will thus be apparent that the invention
                    marks an important advance in the art of swimming. These plates are made of wood
                    —mahogany or American bass,—and are in shape somewhat like an artist’s palette,
                    with this difference, that the bay or indentation of the edge runs in to where
                    the thumb-hole would be. The straps are made of leather, and all buckles and
                    metal should be of bronzed or lacquered brass; the woodwork ought to be kept
                    well polished or varnished. The hand plates are at the thickest part <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> of an inch thick, but
                    those for the feet must be much stronger, as the whole weight of the body is
                    upon them while one is standing at or walking to the water’s edge. In learning
                    to use them, let the swimmer begin by lying flat on the water, straightening the
                    arms out about 24 inches apart. Spread the feet and legs well outward; then so
                    place the feet that the plates shall be vertical, and thus offer the soles as
                    resisting surfaces to the water; close the legs in such a way that the flat
                    parts will meet when the legs come together. The return of the feet to the body
                    is the same as in natural or unaided swimming, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by
                    bringing them heels first so that the plates are carried up edge ways. Next,
                    turn the ankles so as to allow of the soles facing outward, this being in plate
                    swimming the point from which the positive or propelling part of the stroke
                    actually starts. Now press outward and round until the plates meet as before,
                    and repeat. Practise slowly and steadily until sure that in the recovery there
                    is no drag, and that when spreading apart and closing the resisting surfaces are
                    squared so as to reduce slip to its minimum. The hands are moved as in. ordinary
                    swimming, with this difference, that they are all the time lying flat; on their
                    return to the body after the propelling movement no motion of wrist is to be
                    made, great care being taken to keep the hand plates perfectly parallel with the
                    surface of the water, as the slightest deviation from this rule, at any one part
                    of the arm stroke, will sink or raise the head and chest, and so alter the
                    natural and correct plane of the whole body. As the plates are lighter than the
                    water the feet will tend to come close to the surface, if not indeed sometimes
                    above it, causing splashing unless care be taken to avoid this. Floating in any
                    position is easy and comfortable with plates on, and diving, sculling, and back
                    swimming are all facilitated. The length of stroke in plateswimming is nearly
                    double that of ordinary water movements. The recommendations of the invention,
                    especially in sea and longdistance swims, may be summed up in four words—safety,
                    power, endurance, speed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Long Immersions.—</hi> It is on record that on October 6, 1835,
                    Samuel Brock, a Yarmouth fisherman, after being capsized, remained in the water
                    for 7½ hours before he was picked up. As a longdistance swimmer in ocean and
                    tidal waters no one has ever approached Matthew Webb (1848-83), of the British
                    mercantile marine service. His first great feat was plunging (April 23, 1873)
                    off the Cunard S. S. “Russia” into a heavy sea in the unsuccessful endeavour to
                    save a young sailor who had fallen overboard, when he passed 37 minutes in the
                    sea before the lifeboat relieved him. He received the silver medal from the
                    Royal Humane Society of London, the Stanhope gold medal, and a £100 purse
                    subscribed by the passengers of the “Russia.” In June 1874 he swam from Dover to
                    the north-east Varne buoy (9½ sea miles). On July 3, 1875, he went from
                    Blackwall Pier to Gravesend Town Pier on an ebb tide (18½ miles) in 4 h. 52 m.
                    44 s., and on July 19, 1875, from Dover to Ramsgate (15 sea miles) in 8¾ h. An
                    unsuccessful attempt to swim from Dover to Calais (17½ sea miles) in the
                    narrowest part of Dover Straits took place on August 12, 1875. He afterwards
                    successfully accomplished the feat on August 24-25, 1875, after 21 h. 44 m. 55
                    s. immersion, the distance swum having been as nearly as possible 39½ statute
                    miles. A foolhardy attempt to swim the whirlpool rapids of Niagara cost Webb his
                    life on July 24, 1883. On September 15, 1875, F. Cavil swam on the ebb of a
                    strong spring tide from Putney to Blackwall (13 miles 3 furlongs) in 3 hr. 50 m.
                    Miss Agnes Beckwith, of London, on the 17th July 1878, swam 20 miles in the
                    Thames, without any assistance whatever, in 6 hours 25 minutes. Horace
                    Davenport, of London, for years amateur champion of Great Britain, on 2d
                    September 1884, swam from Southsea, Portsmouth, to Ryde, Isle of Wight, and back
                    again in 5 h. 25 m.</p>

                    delegates from nearly all the swimming clubs in the metropolis. These have
                    framed rules and regulations for the conduct of clubs, races, and other
                    performances included under “swimming." The Professional Swimming Association
                    was successfully floated by Mr Robert Watson on July 6, 1881. The Amateur
                    Swimming Association was reinaugurated in 1886 by the amalgamation of the
                    Swimming Association of Great Britain and the Amateur Swimming Union. There are
                    annual competitions for the amateur championships at 500 yard-, ½ mile, 1 mile
                    in still water, and 5½ miles in the Thames. There are also the Associated
                    Swimming Clubs of Glasgow and the Associated Clubs of Dundee, each similar in
                    its objects and composition to the Amateur Swimming Association.</p>
