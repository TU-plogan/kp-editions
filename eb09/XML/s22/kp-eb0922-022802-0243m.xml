                        theological inquirer, was born at Siena on 29th January 1525. His family
                        descended from Sozzo, a banker at Percena, whose second son, Mino Sozzi,
                        settled as a notary at Siena in 1304. Mino Sozzi’s grandson, Sozzino (d.
                        1403), was the ancestor of a line of patrician jurists, of whom Mariano
                        Sozzini, senior (1397-1467), was the first and the most famous. Lelio was
                        the sixth son of Mariano Sozzini, junior (1482-1556), by his wife Camilla
                        Salvetti. The family name is variously spelled (usually “Soccini” by modern
                        writers); Lelio invariably uses the form “Sozini,” Latinizing it “Sozinus”;
                        his nephew <hi rend="smallcaps">Fausto</hi> (see below) writes “Sozzini” and
                        “Socinus.” Sozini was educated as a jurist under his father’s eye at
                        Bologna. According to Melanchthon, it was his desire to reach the <hi
                        rend="italic">fontes juris</hi> which led him to Biblical studies and hence
                        to the rejection of “the idolatry of Rome.” Later on he acquired some
                        knowledge of Hebrew and Arabic (he gave to Bibliander a manuscript of the
                        Koran) as well as Greek, but he was never a laborious student. His father
                        supplied him with means, and on coming of age he went to Venice, the
                        headquarters of the evangelical movement in Italy. A tradition first
                        published by Sand in 1678, and amplified by subsequent writers, makes Sozini
                        the leading spirit in certain alleged theological conferences at Vicenza,
                        about 1546, which are said to have forecast the main positions of the
                        Unitarian heresy; but the whole account, including the story of the flight
                        of Sozini, must be rejected as mythical. At this period the standpoint of
                        Sozini was that of evangelical Protestantism; his mental temper presents a
                        singular union of enthusiastic piety with a love for the subtleties of
                        theological speculation. It was at Chiavenna in 1547 that he came under the
                        influence of a gentle mystic, Camillo of Sicily, surnamed “Renato,” whose
                        teaching anticipated at many points that of the early Quakers. Pursuing his
                        religious travels, Sozini visited Switzerland, France, England, and Holland,
                        returning to Switzerland at the close of 1548. He had commendatory letters
                        to the Swiss churches from Nicolas Meyer, envoy from Wittenberg to Italy;
                        but his family name was a sufficient passport, and wherever he went his
                        personal charm won friends. We find him in 1549-50 at Geneva and Basel (with
                        Sebastian Münster), but chiefly at Zurich, where he lodges with Pellican. He
                        spends eleven months (July 1550 to June 1551) at Wittenberg, at first under
                        Melanchthon’s roof, then with Johann Forster for the improvement of his
                        Hebrew. From Wittenberg Sozini returned to Zurich (end of 1551) after
                        visiting Prague, Vienna, and Cracow. Political events attracted him back to
                        Italy in June 1552. Two visits to Siena (where freedom of speech was for the
                        moment possible, owing to the shaking off of the Spanish yoke) brought him
                        into fruitful contact with his young nephew Fausto. He was at Padua (not at
                        Geneva, as is often said) at the date of Servetus’s execution (27th October
                        1553). Thence he made his way to Basel (January 1554), Geneva (April), and
                        Zurich (May), where he took up his abode.</p>
                    <p>Calvin, as well as Melanchthon, received Sozini with open arms. Melanchthon
                        (though a phrase in one of his letters has been strangely misinterpreted)
                        never regarded him with theological suspicion. To Calvin’s keen glance
                        Sozini’s over-speculative tendency and the genuineness of his religious
                        nature were equally apparent. A passage often quoted from one of Calvin’s
                        letters to Sozini (1st January 1552) has been construed as a breaking off of
                        amicable intercourse; but, while more than once uneasy apprehensions arose
                        in Calvin’s mind, there was no breach of correspondence or of friendship. Of
                        all the Reformers Bullinger was Sozini’s closest intimate, his warmest and
                        wisest friend. Sozini’s theological difficulties turned upon the
                        resurrection of the body, predestination, the ground of salvation (these
                        were the points on which he corresponded with Calvin), the doctrinal basis
                        of the original gospel (queries addressed to Bullinger), the nature of
                        repentance<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0244-0229"/> (to Rudolph Gualther), the sacraments (to
                        Johann Wolff). Not till the fate of Servetus had directed his mind to the
                        question of the Trinity did he throw out any doubts upon this subject. At
                        Geneva, in April 1554, he had uttered incautious remarks on the common
                        doctrine, emphasized in a subsequent letter to Martinengo, the Italian
                        pastor. Bullinger, warned by several correspondents (including Calvin),
                        questioned Sozini as to his faith, and received from him an explicitly
                        orthodox confession, afterwards reduced to writing (15th July 1555), with a
                        frank reservation of the right of further inquiry. A month before this
                        Sozini had been sent with Martino Muralto to Basel to secure Ochino as
                        pastor of the Italian church at Zurich. There can be little doubt that the
                        minds of Sozini and Ochino (a thinker of the same order as Camillo, but with
                        finer dialectic skill) acted powerfully on each other in the radical
                        discussion of theological problems. Sozini lost his father in 1556, an event
                        which involved him in pecuniary anxieties. To what property he was entitled
                        does not appear; he got nothing under his father’s will. Fortified with the
                        most influential introductions (including one from Calvin), he visited in
                        1558 the courts of Vienna and Cracow to obtain support for his appeal to the
                        reigning duke of Florence. His object was to realize his own estate and
                        secure that of his family. It is a sufficiently curious circumstance that
                        Melanchthon’s letter introducing Sozini to Maximilian II. invokes the
                        historic parallel of the emperor Constans rendering a hospitable reception
                        to Athanasius, when he fled from Egypt to Treves. Well received out of
                        Italy, Sozini (who does not appear to have got beyond Venice) found he could
                        do nothing at home. The Inquisition had its eye on his family: his brother
                        Cornelio was imprisoned at Rome; his brothers Celso and Camillo and his
                        nephew Fausto were “reputati Luterani” at Siena, and Camillo had taken
                        refuge in flight. In August 1559 Sozini returned to Zurich, and we hear
                        little more of him. His brief career ended on 14th May 1562, at his lodging
                        in the house of Hans Wyss, silk-weaver.</p>
                    <p>The news of his death reached his nephew at Lyons through Antonio Maria
                        Besozzo. Fausto repaired to Zurich and got his uncle’s papers, comprising
                        very little connected writing, but a good many notes. Fausto has so often
                        been regarded as a plagiarist from Lelio that it may be well here to state
                        that his debt to Lelio, somewhat over-estimated by himself, was twofold. (1)
                        He derived from him in conversation (1552-53) the germ of his theory of
                        salvation; (2) Lelio’s paraphrase (1561) of <hi rend="italic">ἀρχή</hi> in
                        John i. 1 as “the beginning of the gospel” gave Fausto a hint of Biblical
                        exegesis by help of which he constructed a new Christology. Apart from these
                        suggestions, Fausto owed nothing to Lelio except a curiously far-fetched
                        interpretation of John viii. 58, and the stimulating remembrance of his pure
                        character and brilliant gifts. The two men were of totally different genius.
                        Lelio, impulsive and inquisitive, was in quest of the spiritual ground of
                        religious truth; the drier mind of Fausto sought in external authority a
                        basis for the ethical teaching of Christianity.</p>

                        most important will be found in Illgen and Trechsel, and (the earliest) in
                        the edition of Calvin’s works by Baum, Cunitz, and Reuss. Sand adds a <hi

                        Beza suspected that Sozini had a hand in the <hi rend="italic">De

                        ascriptions were not made till his nephew had identified his name with
                        active heresy, and are not supported by internal evidence. To Lelio also
                        Beza assigned (in 1567) an anonymous <hi rend="italic">Explicatio</hi>
                        (1562) of the proem of St John’s Gospel, which was the work of Fausto. This
                        error, adopted by</p>
                    <p>Zanchi, has been the chief source of the misconception which represents Lelio
                        as a heresiarch. In Franc. Guinio’s <hi rend="italic">Defensio Cath. Dock de
                        S. Trin.,</hi> 1590-91, is an anonymous <hi rend="italic">enumeratio</hi> of
                        motives for adhering to the doctrine of the Trinity, by some ascribed to
                        Lelio, by others, with somewhat more probability, to Fausto.</p>

                    <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fausto Paolo Sozzini</hi> (1539-1604), theological
                        writer, was born at Siena on 5th December 1539, the only son of Alessandro
                        Sozzini, “princeps subtilitatum,” by Agnese, daughter of Borghese Petrucci.
                        He was thus descended on the one side from the long line of great lawyers,
                        of whom Mariano the elder is traditionally said to have been the first
                        heretic of the family, on the other from Pandolfo Petrucci, the Cromwell of
                        Siena. His father died in 1541 at the early age of thirty-one. Fausto
                        received no regular education; he was brought up at home with his sister
                        Fillide. The influence of the able women of his family communicated a strong
                        moral impress to his thought. His youth was spent in desultory reading at
                        Scopeto, the country seat of his family. His early intellectual stimulus
                        came from his uncle Celso, an <hi rend="italic">esprit fort,</hi> though
                        always nominally a Catholic, and the founder of the Accademia dei Sizienti
                        (1554), of which Fausto was a member. In 1556 his grandfather’s will made
                        him independent by leaving him one-fourth of the family estates. Next year
                        he was enrolled in the famous Accademia degli Intronati, the centre of the
                        intellectual life of Siena. His academic name was “Il Frastagliato”; he took
                        as his badge “un mare turbato da venti,” with the motto “turbant sed
                        extollunt.” About this time Panzirolo <hi rend="italic">(De Claris Legg.
                        Interpp.,</hi> not published till 1637) describes him as a young man of fine
                        talent, and bespeaks for him a legal career. But Fausto despised the law,
                        and preferred the writing of sonnets. He was suspected of Lutheranism in
                        1558-59, soon after he came of age (1561) he went to Lyons, being probably
                        employed there in mercantile business; he revisited Italy after his uncle
                        Lelio’s death; we next find him enrolled for a short time in 1562 as a
                        member of the Italian church at Geneva; he returned to Lyons next year. The
                        evangelical position was not radical enough for him. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Explicatio</hi> (1562) of the proem to St John’s Gospel shows that already
                        he attributed to our Lord an official instead of an essential deity; a
                        letter of 1563 rejects the natural immortality of man (a position developed
                        long after in his disputation with Pucci). Towards the end of 1563 he
                        conformed again to the Catholic Church, and spent the next twelve years in
                        Italy, partly at court. Przypkowski, regardless of chronology, places him in
                        the service of Francesco, grand-duke of Tuscany. His unpublished letters
                        show that he was in the service only of Isabella de’ Medici, Francesco’s
                        sister. This portion of his life is obscure, and he afterwards regarded it
                        as wasted. Till 1567 he continued to give some attention to legal studies.
                        He found time to write (1570) his treatise <hi rend="italic">De Auctoritate
                        S. Scripturae.</hi> In 1571 he was in Rome, perhaps with his patroness. At
                        the end of 1575 he left Italy, and after Isabella’s death (strangled by her
                        husband in 1576) declined the overtures of Francesco, who pressed him to
                        return. Francesco was probably aware of the motives which led Sozzini to
                        quit Italy; for there is every reason to believe the statement of
                        Przypkowski that the grandduke agreed to protect him in the enjoyment of the
                        income of his property so long as he published nothing in his own name.
                        Sozzini now fixed himself at Basel, where he gave himself to close study of
                        the Bible, began a poetic version of the Psalms, edited posthumous dialogues
                        of Castellio, and, in spite of his increasing deafness, became a<pb

                        One of these discussions was on the doctrine of salvation, with Jacques
                        Couet. It resulted in a bulky treatise, <hi rend="italic">De Jesu Christo
                        Servatore</hi> (finished 12th July 1578), the circulation of which in
                        manuscript appears to have commended his powers to the notice of Giorgio
                        Biandrata (1515-1588), court physician in Transylvania, and an unscrupulous
                        ecclesiastical wire-puller.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Biandrata was Sozzini’s evil genius. Born of an old
                        family in Piedmont and educated in France, Biandrata had attached himself to
                        the left wing of Protestantism, and had moved here and there among the upper
                        circles of the Reformed, depending for professional advancement on a special
                        knowledge of the diseases of women. Driven eastwards a second time in 1558
                        (after fomenting antitrinitarian heresy in the Italian church of Geneva), he
                        had for twenty years been the confidential adviser of ladies of the reigning
                        house, first in Poland and then in Transylvania. In both countries he was a
                        dexterous meddler in church affairs; his policy was the establishment of a
                        kind of broad church, with a confession nakedly Scriptural in its terms, and
                        a resolute suppression of all compromising extremes.</p></note></p>
                    <p>Transylvania had for a short time (1559-71) enjoyed religious liberty under
                        an antitrinitarian prince, John Sigismund. But the existing ruler,
                        Christopher Báthori, favoured the Jesuits, and it was an object with
                        Biandrata to limit the “Judaic” tendencies of the antitrinitarian bishop,
                        Francis Dávid (1510-1579), with whom he had previously acted. By the alleged
                        discovery of a stain upon Biandrata’s morals of the gravest sort his
                        influence with Dávid was destroyed. Now Sozzini’s scheme of doctrine
                        encouraged the use of seemingly orthodox language in an heretical sense.
                        Christ was to be called God, and invoked with divine honours, though without
                        any inherent title to such homage, but as “un Dio subalterno, al quale in un
                        dato tempo il Dio supremo cedette il governo del mondo” (Cantù). It occurred
                        to Biandrata that, if Sozzini could convert the eloquent Dâvid to this view,
                        all would be well. Accordingly in November 1578 Sozzini reached Kolozsvár
                        (Klausenburg), and did his best, during a visit of four months and a half
                        under Dávid’s roof, to teach him the doctrine of the invocation of Christ.
                        Though Sozzini did not (as Biandrata desired) urge the absolute necessity of
                        this invocation, the result was a public explosion on Dávid’s part against
                        the cultus of Christ in any shape or form. His trial followed, on a charge
                        of innovation. Sozzini hurried off to Poland before it began. He cannot be
                        accused of a guilty complicity with what he calls the rage of Biandrata, for
                        he was no party to the incarceration of Dâvid at Déva, where the old man
                        miserably perished in prison. But he was willing that Dâvid should be
                        prohibited from preaching pending the decision of the controversy by a
                        general synod; and his references to the case show that (as in the later
                        instances of Jacobo Paleologo, Christian Franken, and Martin Seidel)
                        theological aversions, though they never made him uncivil, froze up his
                        kindness and blinded his perceptions of character. Biandrata ultimately
                        conformed to the Catholic Church; yet as late as 1584 Sozzini, always
                        constant to the leanings of friendship, sought his patronage for his
                        treatise <hi rend="italic">De Jesu Christi Natura,</hi> in reply to the
                        Calvinist Andrew Wolan. The remainder (1579-1604) of Sozzini’s life was
                        spent in Poland. Excluded at first by his views on baptism from the Minor or
                        Antitrinitarian Church (anabaptist in its constitution), he acquired by
                        degrees a predominant influence in its synods. He converted the Arians from
                        their avowal of our Saviour’s pre-existence and their refusal to honour Him
                        by invocation; he repressed the semi-Judaizers whom he could not convince.
                        Through correspondence with his friends in official places he ruled also the
                        policy of the Antitrinitarian Church of Transylvania. Forced to leave Cracow
                        in 1583, he found a home with a Polish noble, Christopher Morsztyn, whose
                        daughter Elizabeth he married (1586). She died in the following year, a few
                        months after giving birth to a daughter, Agnese, afterwards the wife of
                        Stanislau Wisz-owaty. In 1587 the grand-duke Francesco died, and to this
                        event Sozzini’s biographers attribute the loss of his Italian property. But
                        he was on good terms with Francesco’s successor, and might have continued to
                        receive his rents had not family disputes arisen respecting the
                        interpretation of his grandfather’s will. The holy office at Siena
                        disinherited him in October 1590; but he was allowed a pension, which does
                        not seem to have been paid. The failure of supplies from Italy dissolved the
                        compact under which his works were to remain anonymous. He began to publish
                        under his own name. The consequence was that in 1598 a mob expelled him from
                        Cracow, wrecking his house and grossly ill-using his person. Friends gave
                        him a ready welcome at Luslawice, 30 miles east from Cracow; and here,
                        having long been troubled with colic and the stone, he died on 4th March
                        1604. A limestone block, with illegible inscriptions, marks his grave.<note

                    <p>Sozzini’s works, as edited by his grandson Andrew Wiszowaty and the learned
                        printer F. Kuyper, are contained in two closely printed folios, Amsterdam,
                        1668. They are usually reckoned the first two volumes of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum,</hi> but in fact the works of
                        Crell and Schlichting preceded them in the series. They include all
                        Sozzini’s extant theological writings, except his essay <hi rend="italic">On
                        Predestination</hi> (in which he denies that God foresees the actions of
                        free agents), prefixed to Castellio’s <hi rend="italic">Dialogi IV,</hi>
                        1578 (reprinted 1613), and his revision of a school manual, <hi
                        rend="italic">Instnιmentum Doctrinarum Aristοtelicum,</hi> 1586. His
                        pseudonyms, easily interpreted, were Felix Turpio Urbevetanus, Prosper
                        Dysidaeus, Gratianus Prosper, and Gratianus Turpio Gerapolensis (=Senensis).
                        Some of his early poetry will be found in Ferentilli’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scielta di Stanze di Diversi Autori Toscani,</hi> 1579 (reprinted 1594);
                        other specimens are given in Cantù, and in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Athenaeum,</hi> 11th August 1877. Sozzini himself considered that his <hi
                        rend="italic">Contra Atheos,</hi> which perished in the riot at Cracow, was
                        his ablest work. In later life he began, but left incomplete, more than one
                        work intended to exhibit his system as a whole. His reputation as a thinker
                        must rest on (1) his <hi rend="italic">De Auctoritate S. Scripturae,</hi>
                        and (2) his <hi rend="italic">De Jesu Christo Servatore.</hi> The former was
                        first published at Seville (1588) by Lopez, a Jesuit, who claimed it as bis
                        own, but prefixed a preface in which, contrary to a fundamental position of
                        Sozzini, he maintains that man by nature has a knowledge of God. A French
                        version (1592) was approved by the ministers of Basel; and the English
                        translation (1731) by Edward Coombe was undertaken in consequence of the
                        commendation of the work in a charge (1728) by Bishop Smalbroke, who
                        observes that Grotius had laid it under contribution in his <hi
                        rend="italic">De Veritate Christ. Rel.</hi> In a small compass it
                        anticipates the whole argument of the “credibility” writers; but in trying
                        it by modern tests it should be remembered that Sozzini regarded it (in
                        1581) as not adequately meeting the cardinal difficulties attending the
                        proof of the Christian religion, and subsequently began to reconstruct its
                        argument in his unfinished <hi rend="italic">Lectiones Sacrae.</hi> His
                        treatise on salvation constitutes his main service to theology, placing
                        orthodoxy and heresy in new relations of fundamental antagonism, and
                        narrowing the conflict to the central interest of religion. Of the person of
                        Christ in this treatise he says nothing; he deals exclusively with the work
                        of Christ, which in his view operates upon man alone; and it is by the
                        persistency with which this idea tends to recur that we must estimate the
                        theological sagacity of Sozzini. Though his name has been attached to a
                        school of opinion (Socinianism),he disclaimed the rôle of a heresiarch, and
                        declined to give his unreserved adhesion to any one sect. The confidence
                        with which he relied upon the conclusions of his own mind has gained him the
                        repute of a dogmatist; but it was his constant aim to reduce and simplify
                        the fundamentals of Christianity, and it is not without ground that the
                        memorial tablet at Siena (inscription by Brigidi, 1879) characterizes him as
                        a vindicator of human reason against the supernatural. Of his
                        non-theological doctrines the most important is his assertion of the
                        unlawfulness, not only of war, but of the taking of human life in any
                        circumstances. Hence the comparative mildness of his proposals for dealing
                        with religious offenders; but it cannot be said that he had grasped the full
                        idea of toleration. Hence too his contention that magisterial office is
                        unlawful for a Christian.</p>
                    <p>For the biography of Sozzini the best materials are his letters. There is a
                        collection in his works; others are given by Cantù; some are unpublished. In
                        his correspondence he delineates himself freely, not sparing his weak points
                        of character or of attainment. The earliest life, prefixed (with engraved
                        portrait) to the works, is by Przypkowski (1636), translated into English by
                        Bidle (1653). This is the foundation of the article by Bayle, the <hi
