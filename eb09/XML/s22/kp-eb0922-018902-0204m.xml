                <p><label type="entry">SNAKES</label> constitute an order (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophidia)</hi> in the class of Reptiles which is characterized by an exceedingly
                    elongate body, cylindrical or sub-cylindrical, and terminating in a tapering
                    tail. The integuments are folded into flat imbricate scales, which are rarely
                    tubercular or granular. The spinal column consists of a very great number of
                    vertebrae, with which the numerous ribs are movably articulated. Limbs are
                    entirely absent, or only rudiments of the posterior occur more or less hidden
                    below the skin; there is no sternum. The bones of the palate and jaws are
                    movable; the mandibles are united in front by an elastic ligament and are very
                    distensible. Generally both jaws and the palate are toothed, the teeth being
                    thin and needlelike. There are no eyelids, no ear-opening. The vent is a
                    transverse slit.</p>
                <p>Great as is the difference in appearance between a typical snake and a typical
                    lizard, the two orders of Ophidians and Lacertilians are nearly allied; the
                    former is probably merely a specialized descendant of the latter or of the
                    pythonomorphous reptiles, or perhaps of both. Moreover, the living Lacertilians
                    include forms which approach the Ophidians by having a greatly increased number
                    of vertebrae, a much advanced degradation of the scapular and pelvic arches and
                    limbs, a simple dentition, and the absence of eyelids and external ear-opening.
                    And on the other hand we find Ophidians with a greatly diminished flexibility of
                    the vertebral column, with closely adherent, smooth and polished scales, with a
                    narrow mouth—totally unlike the enormous gape of the typical snakes—and even
                    without that longitudinal fold in the median line of the chin which is so
                    characteristic of the order <hi rend="italic">(Typhlopidae).</hi> Thus of the
                    Ophidian characters as given above only that taken from the loose connexion of
                    the bones of the skull remains as a sharp line of separation between snakes and
                    lizards. The mandibulary symphysis is not by suture but by an elastic band; the
                    intermaxillary, palatine, and pterygoid bones are so loosely attached to the
                    cranium that they can be easily pressed outwards and forwards, and the maxillary
                    and mandibulary of one side can be moved in those directions independently of
                    their fellows opposite. The intermaxillary is small, generally toothless, and
                    coalesces with the nasals and vomer into a single movable bone; finally, the
                    suspensory is much elongate and movable at both ends. This arrangement ensures
                    an extraordinary degree of mobility and elasticity of all parts of the gape,
                    which, however, varies in the different families of the order. For the other
                    characteristic points of their structure and for their distribution, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>The number of known species of snakes has been given as 1500 by some authorities
                    and as 1800 by others. The limits of their distribution seem to be the 70th
                    parallel N. lat. in Europe, the 54th in British Columbia, and the 40th parallel
                    S. lat. in the southern hemisphere. The number of species and of individuals in
                    a species is small in the temperate zones, but increases as the tropics are
                    approached. In the tropical zone they are abundant, especially where a
                    well-watered soil nourishes a rich vegetation, with glades open to the sun, and
                    where a variety of small animals serve as an abundant and easily obtained prey.
                    It is in the tropics also that the largest (boas, pythons) and the most
                    specialized kinds occur (tree snakes, sea snakes, the large poisonous snakes).
                    On the other hand, every variety of soil is tenanted by some kind of snakes:
                    they form a contingent in every desert fauna. In accordance with this general
                    distribution snakes show a great amount of differentiation with regard to their
                    mode of life and general organization; and from the appearance alone of a snake
                    a safe conclusion can be drawn as to its habits. The following categories may be
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>(1) Burrowing snakes, which live under ground and but rarely appear on the
                    surface. They have a cylindrical rigid body, covered with generally smooth and
                    polished scales; a short strong tail; a short rounded or pointed head with
                    narrow mouth; teeth few in number; small or rudimentary eye; no abdominal scutes
                    or only narrow ones. They feed chiefly on invertebrate animals, and none are
                    poisonous. (2) Ground snakes, living chiefly on the ground, and rarely ascending
                    bushes or entering water. Their body is cylindrical, flexible in every part,
                    covered with smooth or keeled scales, and provided with broad ventral and
                    subcaudal scutes. All the various parts of their body and head are well
                    proportioned; the non-poisonous kinds of ground snakes are in fact the typical
                    and least specialized snakes, and more numerous than any of the other kinds.
                    They feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates. The majority are non-poisonous;
                    but the majority of poisonous snakes must be referred to this category. (3) Tree
                    snakes, which are able to climb bushes or trees with facility or pass even the
                    greater part of their existence on trees. Their body is rarely cylindrical,
                    generally compressed and slender; their broad ventral scutes are often carinate
                    on the sides. Those kinds which have a less elongate and cylindrical body
                    possess a distinctly prehensile tail. The eye is generally large. Their
                    coloration consists often of bright hues, and sometimes resembles that of their
                    surroundings. They feed on animals which likewise lead an arboreal life, rarely
                    on eggs. Poisonous as λvell as innocuous snakes are represented in this
                    category. (4) Freshwater snakes, living in or frequenting fresh waters; they are
                    excellent swimmers and divers. The nostrils are placed on the top of the snout
                    and can be closed whilst the animal is under water. Their body is cylindrical,
                    moderately long, provided with narrow ventral scutes; the tail tapering; head
                    flat, rather short; and the eyes of small size. They feed on fish, frogs, and
                    other aquatic animals, and are innocuous and viviparous. (5) Sea snakes are
                    distinguished by the compressed, rudder-shaped tail, supported by erect neural
                    and haemal spines. They never leave the sea (with the exception of one genus)
                    and are unable to move on land. They feed on fishes, are viviparous and
                    poisonous.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0205-0190"/> The majority of snakes are active during the day,
                    their energy increasing with the increasing temperature of the air; whilst some
                    delight in the moist sweltering heat of dense tropical vegetation, others expose
                    themselves to the fiercest rays of the midday sun. Not a few, however, lead a
                    nocturnal life, and many of them have, accordingly, their pupil contracted into
                    a vertical or more rarely a horizontal slit. Those which inhabit temperate
                    latitudes hibernate. Snakes are the most stationary of all vertebrates; as long
                    as a locality affords them a sufficiency of food and some shelter to which they
                    can readily retreat, they have no inducement to change it. Their dispersal,
                    therefore, must have been extremely slow and gradual. Although able to move with
                    extreme rapidity, they cannot maintain it for any length of time. Their organs
                    of locomotion are the ribs, the number of which is very great, nearly
                    corresponding to that of the vertebrae of the trunk. They can adapt their
                    motions to every variation of the ground over which they move, yet all varieties
                    of snake locomotion are founded on the following simple process. When a part of
                    the body has found some projection of the ground which affords it a point of
                    support, the ribs are drawn more closely together, on alternate sides, thereby
                    producing alternate bends of the body. The hinder portion of the body being
                    drawn after, some part of it (c) finds another support on the rough ground or a
                    projection; and, the anterior bends being stretched in a straight line, the
                    front part of the body is propelled (from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">d)</hi> in consequence. During this peculiar locomotion the
                    numerous broad shields of the belly are of great advantage, as by means of their
                    free edges the snake is enabled to catch and use as points of support the
                    slightest projections of the ground. A pair of ribs corresponds to each of these
                    ventral shields. Snakes are not able to move over a perfectly smooth surface.
                    Thus it is evident that they move by dragging their body over the ground, or
                    over some other firm base, such as the branch of a tree; hence the conventional
                    representation of the progress of a snake, in which its undulating body is
                    figured as resting by a series of lower bends on the ground whilst the alternate
                    bends are raised above it, is an impossible attitude. Also the notion that
                    snakes when attacking are able to jump off the ground is quite erroneous; when
                    they strike an object, they dart the fore part of their body, which was
                    retracted in several bends, forwards in a straight line. And sometimes very
                    active snakes, like the cobra, advance simultaneously with the remainder of the
                    body, which, however, glides in the ordinary fashion over the ground; but no
                    snake is able to impart such an impetus to the whole of its body as to lose its
                    contact with the ground. Some snakes can raise the anterior part of their body
                    and even move in this attitude, but it is only about the anterior fourth or
                    third of the total length which can be thus erected.</p>
                <p>With very few exceptions, the integuments form imbricate scale-like folds
                    arranged with the greatest regularity; they are small and pluriserial on the
                    upper parts of the body and tail, large and uniserial on the abdomen, and
                    generally biserial on the lower side of the tail. The folds can be stretched
                    out, so that the skin is capable of a great degree of distension. The scales are
                    sometimes rounded behind, but generally rhombic in shape and more or less
                    elongate; they may be quite smooth or provided with a longitudinal ridge or <hi
                    rend="italic">keel</hi> in the middle line. The integuments of the head are
                    divided into non-imbricate shields or plates, symmetrically arranged, but not
                    corresponding in size or shape with the underlying cranial bones or having any
                    relation to them. The form and number of the scales and scutes, and the shape
                    and arrange ment of the head-</p>
                <p>shields, are of great value in distin guishing the genera and species, and it
                    will therefore be useful to explain in the accompanying woodcut (fig. 3) the
                    terms by which these parts are de signated. The skin does not form eye lids; but
                    the epi dermis passes over the eye, forming a transparent disk, concave like the
                    glass of a watch, behind which the eye moves. It is the first part which is cast
                    off when the snake sheds its skin; this is done several times in the year, and
                    the epidermis comes off in a single piece.</p>
                <p>The tongue in snakes is narrow, almost worm-like, generally of a black colour and
                    forked; that is, it terminates in front in two extremely fine filaments. It is
                    often exserted with a rapid motion, sometimes with the object of feeling some
                    object, sometimes under the influence of anger or fear.</p>
                <p>Snakes possess teeth in the maxillaries, mandibles, palatine, and pterygoid
                    bones, sometimes also in the intermaxillary; they may be absent in one or the
                    other of the bones mentioned. In the innocuous snakes the teeth are simple and
                    uniform in structure, thin, sharp like needles, and bent backwards; their
                    function consists merely in seizing and holding the prey. In some all the teeth
                    are nearly of the same size; others possess in front of the jaws (Lycodonts) or
                    behind in the maxillaries (Diacrasterians) a tooth more or less conspicuously
                    larger than the rest; whilst others again are distinguished by this larger
                    posterior tooth being grooved along its outer face. The snakes with this grooved
                    kind of tooth have been named <hi rend="italic">Opisthoglyphi,</hi> and also <hi
                    rend="italic">Suspecti,</hi> because some herpetologists were of opinion that
                    the function of the groove of the tooth was to facilitate the introduction of
                    poisonous saliva into a wound. The venomous nature of these snakes, however, has
                    never been proved, and persons are frequently bitten by them without any evil
                    consequences. Nevertheless as the depth of the groove, the length of the tooth,
                    and the development of the salivary glands in its vicinity vary greatly, it is
                    quite possible that the function and the physiological effect of this apparatus
                    are not the same in all Opisthoglyphs. In the true poisonous snakes the
                    maxillary dentition has undergone a special modification. The so-called
                    Colubrine Venomous snakes, which retain in a great measure an external
                    resemblance to the innocuous snakes, have the maxillary bone not at all, or but
                    little, shortened, armed in front with a fixed, erect fang, and provided with a
                    deep groove or closed<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0206-0191"/> canal for the conveyance of the poison, the fluid
                    being secreted by a special poison-gland. One or more small ordinary teeth may
                    be placed at some distance behind this poison-fang. In the other venomous snakes
                    (Viperines and Crotalines) the maxillary bone is very short, and is armed with a
                    single very long curved fang with a canal and aperture at each end. Although
                    firmly anchylosed to the bone, the tooth, which when at rest is laid backwards,
                    is erectile,—the bone itself being mobile and rotated round its transverse axis
                    by muscles. One or more reserve teeth, in various stages of development, lie
                    between the folds of the gum and are ready to take the place of the one in
                    function whenever it is lost by accident, or shed, which seems to happen at
                    regular intervals. The gland which secretes the poison is described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> (vol. xx. p. 457).</p>
                <p>All snakes are carnivorous, and as a rule take living prey only; a few feed
                    habitually or occasionally on eggs. Many swallow their victim alive; others
                    first kill it by smothering it between the coils of their body (constriction).
                    The effects of a bite by a poisonous snake upon a small mammal or bird are
                    almost instantaneous, preventing its escape; and the snake swallows its victim
                    at its leisure, sometimes hours after it has been killed. The prey is always
                    swallowed entire, and, as its girth generally much exceeds that of the snake,
                    the progress of deglutition is very laborious and slow. Opening their jaws to
                    their fullest extent, they seize the animal generally by the head, and pushing
                    alternately the right and left sides of the jaws forward, they press the body
                    through their elastic gullet into the stomach, its outlines being visible for
                    some time through the distended walls of the abdomen. Digestion is quick and
                    much accelerated by the quantity of saliva which is secreted during the progress
                    of deglutition, and in venomous snakes probably also by the chemical action of
                    the poison. The primary function of the poison-apparatus in the economy of
                    snakes is without doubt to serve as the means of procuring their food. But, like
                    the weapons of other carnivorous animals, it has assumed the secondary function
                    of an organ of defence. Only very few poisonous snakes (like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophiophagus elaps)</hi> are known to resent the approach of man so much as to
                    follow him on his retreat and to attack him. Others, as if conscious of their
                    fearful power of inflicting injury, are much less inclined to avoid collision
                    with man than innocuous kinds, and are excited by the slightest provocation to
                    use that power in self-defence. They have thus become one of the greatest
                    scourges to mankind, and Sir J. Fayrer<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The Thanatophidia of India,</hi> fol.,
                    London, 1872.</p></note> has demonstrated that in India alone annually some
                    20,000 human beings perish from snake-bites. Therefore it will not be out of
                    place to add here a few words on snake-poison and on the best means (ineffectual
                    though they be in numerous cases) of counteracting its deleterious effects.</p>
                <p>Chemistry has not yet succeeded in separating the active principle of
                    snake-poison or in distinguishing between the secretions of different kinds of
                    poisonous snakes; in fact it seems to be identical in all, and probably not
                    different from the poison of scorpions and many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hymenoptera.</hi> The physiological effects of all these poisons on
                    warm-blooded Vertebrates are identical, and vary only in degree, the smallest
                    quantities of the poison producing a local irritation, whilst in serious cases
                    the whole mass of the blood is poisoned in the course of some seconds or
                    minutes, producing paralysis of the nerve-centres. That there is some
                    difference, however, in the action of the poisons upon the blood has been shown
                    by Fayrer, who found that the poison of Viperine snakes invariably destroys its
                    coagulability, whilst nothing of the kind is observed in animals which perished
                    from the bite of a Colubrine Venomous snake. The same observer has also
                    experimentally demonstrated that the blood of a poisoned warm-blooded animal
                    assumes poisonous properties, and, when injected, kills like the poison itself,
                    although the bodies of the animals may be eaten by man with impunity. On the
                    other hand, he has proved that the opinion generally adopted since Redi’s time,
                    viz., that snake-poison is efficacious only through direct injection into the
                    blood, is fallacious, and that it is readily absorbed through mucous and serous
                    membranes, producing the same effects, though in a milder degree.</p>
                <p>The degree of danger arising from a snake-bite to man depends in the first place
                    on the quantity of poison injected: a large vigorous snake which has not bitten
                    for some time is more to be feared than one of small size or one which is weakly
                    or has exhausted its stock of poison by previous bites. The bite of some of the
                    smaller Australian Diemenias and <hi rend="italic">Hoplocephali</hi> is followed
                    by no worse consequences than those arising from the sting of a wasp or a
                    hornet, while immediately fatal cases are on record of persons bitten by the
                    cobra or the large South-American Crotalines. In the second place it depends on
                    the strength of the individual bitten: a man of strong physical constitution and
                    energetic mental disposition is better able to survive the immediate effects of
                    the bite than a child or a person wanting in courage. Thirdly, it depends on the
                    position and depth of the bite: the bite may be merely a superficial scratch, or
                    may penetrate into tissue having few blood-vessels, and thus be almost harmless;
                    or it may be deep in vascular tissue or even penetrate a vein, producing
                    immediate and fatal effects. It must be mentioned also that Fayrer is distinctly
                    of opinion that the poison of some kinds is more powerful than that of others.
                    The mere shock produced by the bite of a snake upon a nervous person may be
                    sufficiently severe to be followed by symptoms of collapse, although no actual
                    poisoning of the blood has taken place, or although the bite was that of an
                    innocuous snake. It is said that persons have actually died under such
                    circumstances from mere fright. The local appearances in the neighbourhood of a
                    poisoned wound, which soon after the bite is much swollen and discoloured and
                    very painful, readily prove its char acter; but this can be often ascer tained
                    also immediately after the bite by the inspection of the wound,</p>
                <p>—the teeth, which are so differently arranged in poisonous and non-</p>
                <p>poisonous snakes, leaving a different pattern on the skin. As a non-</p>
                <p>poisonous snake has four rows of teeth in the upper jaw, the pattern of its bite
                    will more or less resemble fig. 4, whilst a poisonous snake leaves two rows of
                    more distinctly marked punctured wounds in the place of the two outer series in
                    the non-poisonous (see fig. 5). Of course, there may be modifications of these
                    patterns, as, for instance, when one fang only hits or penetrates the part aimed
                    at, or when the direction of the stroke is slanting, producing merely a
                    scratch.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately no antidote is known capable of counteracting or neutralizing the
                    action of snake-poison. Some years ago injections of ammonia or liquor potassae
                    were recommended, but there is the obvious objection that hardly in one out of a
                    thousand cases of snake-bite would either the appliances or the operator be at
                    hand. Fayrer’s experiments, however, have distinctly disproved the efficacy of
                    this remedial measure. Equally useless is permanganate of potassium; it is
                    indeed true that a solution of this compound destroys the properties of
                    snake-poison when mixed with it; and therefore such of the poison as remains in
                    the wound will be neutralized by the external application or injection of the
                    permanganate, but the remedy is entirely without effect after the poison has
                    passed into the circulation. Treatment is therefore limited to endeavours to
                    prevent by mechanical means the poison from entering the circulation, or by
                    chemical agencies to destroy or remove as much of it as possible that remains in
                    the wound, and to save the patient from the subsequent mental and physical
                    depression by the free use of stimulants. Whatever is or can be done must be
                    done immediately, as a few seconds suffice to carry the poison into the whole
                    vascular system, and the slightest delay diminishes the chances of the patient’s
                    recovery. Courageous persons badly bitten in a finger or toe are known to have
                    saved their lives by the immediate amputation of the wounded member. To the mode
                    of treatment summarized by Günther<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Reptiles of British India,</hi> London,
                    1864, 4to.</p></note> but little can be added. (1) If the wound is on some part
                    of the extremities, one or more ligatures should be made as tightly as possible
                    at a short distance above the wound, to stop circulation; this is most
                    effectually done by inserting a stick under the ligature and twisting it to the
                    uttermost. The ligatures are left until means are taken to destroy the virus in
                    the wound and other remedial measures are resorted to, or until the swelling
                    necessitates their removal. (2) The punctured wounds should be enlarged by deep
                    incisions, to cause a free efflux of the poisoned blood, or should be cut out
                    entirely. (3) The wound should be sucked either by the patient<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n207/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0207-0192"/> or some other person whose mouth is free from any
                    solution of continuity. Cupping-glasses, where they can be applied, answer the
                    same purpose, but not with the same effect. (4) By cauterization with a red-hot
                    iron a live coal, nitrate of silver or carbolic or mineral acid, or by
                    injections of permanganate of potassium, the poison which remains in the wound
                    can be destroyed or neutralized. Ammonia applied to the wound as a wash and
                    rubbed into the neighbouring parts is likewise undeniably of great benefit,
                    especially in less serious cases, since it alleviates the pain and reduces the
                    swelling. (5) Internally, stimulants are to be taken freely; they do not act as
                    specifics against the virus, but are given to excite the action of the heart,
                    the contractions of which become feeble and irregular, to counteract the
                    physical and mental depression, and to prevent a complete collapse. Brandy,
                    whisky, and ammonia in any of its officinal forms should be taken in large doses
                    and at short intervals. The so-called “snake-stones” can have no other effect
                    than, at the best, to act as local absorbents, and can be of use only in the
                    very slightest cases.</p>
                <p>Snakes are oviparous; they deposit from ten to eighty eggs of an ellipsoid shape,
                    covered with a soft leathery shell, in places where they are exposed to and
                    hatched by moist heat. The parents pay no further attention to them, except the
                    pythons, which incubate their eggs by coiling their body over them, and fiercely
                    defend them. In some families, as many freshwater snakes, the sea snakes, <hi
                    rend="italic">Viperidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crotalidae,</hi> the eggs
                    are retained in the oviduct until the embryo is fully developed. These snakes
                    bring forth living young, and are called “ovo-viviparous.”</p>
                <p>The order of snakes may be divided into the following sub-orders and families or

                    numerous, are made to it every year; but the discoveries of late years have not
                    revealed any new important modifications of structure, but rather have
                    undermined the distinctions hitherto made be tween genera, groups, and families,

                    which are most frequently brought to the notice of the observer or reader. The
                    snakes most remote from the true Ophidian type are the members of the first

                <p>They are a small degraded form, adapted for burrowing and leading a subterranean
                    life like worms. Their body is cylindrical, rigid, covered with smooth, short,
                    highly polished, and closely fitting scales, without broad ventral scutes; tail
                    very short; head joined to the trunk without neck-like constriction behind, and
                    short, rounded, or with an acute rostral shield,—the principal instrument for
                    burrowing in loose soil or mould. Their eye is quite rudimentary and can only
                    give them a general perception of light. Their mouth is narrow, small, armed
                    with but a few teeth in one of the jaws, and not distensible, allowing them only

                    insects. They are found in all tropical countries and the parts adjoining, and
                    some of the small species have a wide range, having been probably transported by
                    accident on floating objects to distant countries. Some species attain to a

                    quite harmless and soon becomes tame in captivity. The shields on its head
                    readily distinguish it from the viper. Its chief food consists of lizards, and

                    being one-third or rather more; it is easily recognized by having three loreal
                    shields, one above the other two; its scales are arranged in seven teen rows.
                    Its food consists of mammals, birds, and frogs; and it frequently enters the
                    dwellings of man, rendering itself useful by clearing them of rats and mice. It
                    is of fierce habits, always ready to bite; when irritated it utters a peculiar
                    diminuendo sound, not unlike that produced by a tuning-fork when struck
                    gently.</p>
                <p>Aesculapius’s Snake <hi rend="italic">(Coluber aesculapii)</hi> was probably the
                    species held in veneration by the ancient Romans. It grows to a length of about
                    5 feet, is of mild disposition, and can be readily domesticated. Its original
                    home is Italy, where it is common, but it has extended its range northwards
                    across the Alps into the south of France, and thence into northern Spain.
                    Following the course of the Inn and the Danube, it has reached the Black</p>
                <p>Sea; and it is also now common in several local ities along the middle parts of
                    the Rhine. From direct observations made during the last twenty years there can
                    be no doubt that it is still extending its range. Naturalists believed formerly
                    that the occurrence of this snake at widely distant and isolated localities was
                    due to its introduction by the Romans, who had settlements in those
                    localities.</p>
                <p>The common British Snake or Ring Snake <hi rend="italic">(Tropidonotus
                    natrix)</hi> is extremely common all over Europe (except in the northern parts),
                    and belongs to a genus extremely rich in species, which are spread over Europe,
                    Asia, India, Australia, and North America. Some of the species, like the Indian
                    <hi rend="italic">T. quincunciatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. stolatus</hi>
                    and the North-American <hi rend="italic">T. ordinatus,</hi> are perhaps more
                    abundant as regards the number of individuals than any other snake. <hi
                    rend="italic">T. natrix</hi> is easily recognized even at a distance by two
                    yellow or white spots which it has behind its head. It grows rarely to a length
                    of 4 feet; it never bites, and feeds chiefly on frogs and toads. Its eggs, which
                    are of the size and shape of a dove’s egg, and from fifteen to thirty in number,
                    are deposited in mould or under damp leaves, and are glued together into one
                    mass.</p>
                <p>A very peculiar genus of snakes, <hi rend="italic">Dasypeltis,</hi> represented
                    by three species only, is the type of a separate family and is restricted in its
                    distribution to Central and South Africa. In Cape Colony these snakes are well
                    known under the name of “eyervreter,” <hi rend="italic">i.e., "</hi>
                    egg-eaters.” Their principal diet seems to consist of eggs, their mouth and
                    oesophagus being so distensible that an individual scarcely 20 inches in length,
                    and with a body not surpassing a man’s little finger in circumference, is able
                    to swallow a hen’s egg. The teeth in the jaws are very small and few in number;
                    but the inferior processes of the posterior cervical vertebrae are prolonged and
                    provided with a cap of enamel, and penetrate the oesophagus, forming a kind of
                    saw. As the egg passes through the oesophagus its shell is broken by this
                    apparatus, and, whilst its contents are thus retained and swallowed without
                    loss, the hard fragments of the shell are rejected. This peculiar apparatus
                    occurs also in another snake, <hi rend="italic">Elachistodon,</hi> which belongs
                    to the Indian fauna and has been referred (provisionally) to the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblycephalidae.</hi> Also two prominences at the base of the
                    skull of the Indian Coronelline <hi rend="italic">Nymphophidium</hi> probably
                    have the same function. Besides the snakes mentioned, we have observed species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Dipsas</hi> feeding on eggs of parrots, the eggs reaching
                    the stomach entire, as these<pb break="no"

                    shell. The Indian cobra also is said to rob birds of their eggs.</p>
                <p>The Tree Snakes <hi rend="italic">(Dendrophidae)</hi> are among the greatest
                    ornaments of tropical fauna. The graceful form of their body, the elegance and
                    rapidity of their movements, and the exquisite beauty of their colours have been
                    the admiration of all who have had the good fortune to watch them in their
                    native haunts. The majority lead an exclusively arboreal life; only a few
                    descend to the ground in search of their food. They prey upon every kind of
                    arboreal animal,—birds, tree-frogs, tree-lizards, &amp;c. All seem to be
                    diurnal, and the larger kinds attain to a length of about 4 feet. The most
                    beautiful of all snakes are perhaps certain varieties of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysopelea ornata,</hi> a species extremely common in the Indian Archipelago
                    and many parts of the continent of tropical Asia. One of these varieties is
                    black, with a yellow spot in the centre of each scale; these spots are larger on
                    the back, forming a series of tetrapetalous flowers; the head is similarly
                    ornamented. Another variety has a red back, with pairs of black cross bars, the
                    bands of each pair being separated by a narrow yellow space; sides brown, dotted
                    with black; belly dark green, the outer portion of each ventral shield being
                    yellow, with a blackish spot.</p>
                <p>The features by which the tree snakes are distinguished are still more developed
                    in the family of Whip Snakes <hi rend="italic">(Dryophidae),</hi> whose
                    excessively slender body has been compared to the cord of a whip. Although
                    arboreal, like the former, they are nocturnal in their habits, having a
                    horizontal instead of a round pupil of the eye. They are said to be of a fierce
                    disposition, feeding chiefly on birds; and indeed a long tooth placed about the
                    middle of the maxillary seems to assist them much in penetrating the thick
                    covering of feathers and in obtaining a firm hold on their victims. In some of
                    the species the elongate form of the head is still more exaggerated by a pointed
                    flexible appendage of the snout <hi rend="italic">(Passerita),</hi> which may be
                    nearly half an inch in length, and leaf-like, as in the Madagascar <hi
                    rend="italic">Langaha.</hi></p>
                <p>The well-defined family of <hi rend="italic">Lycodontidae</hi> is chiefly
                    composed of ground snakes, but a few of its members have a sufficiently elongate
                    body to indicate arboreal habits. The Indian genera are principally
                    reptilivorous, while the African prey upon mice, rats, and other small nocturnal
                    mammals. Scarcely any other snake is so common in collections as the Indian <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycodon aulicus,</hi> which inhabits the continent of India and
                    Ceylon, some of the islands of the East Indian Archipelago (Timor), and the
                    Philippines. It occurs in many varieties, but generally is of a uniform brown,
                    or with some whitish crossbands on the anterior part of the body. Although only
                    2 feet long, it is a fierce snake, which when surprised bites readily, but its
                    bite is innocuous.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Boidae</hi> are so similar in their habits to the Pythons
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Python,</hi> vol. xx. p. 144) that it is sufficient to
                    refer in a few words to the species most frequently mentioned in the literature
                    dealing with the fauna of the virgin forests of tropical</p>
                <p>America. The real <hi rend="italic">Boa constrictor</hi> is com mon from the
                    north ern parts of Central</p>
                <p>America to southern</p>
                <p>Brazil, and is fre quently brought alive to Europe. Generally it is only about 7
                    feet long; but the present writer has seen skins of specimens which must have
                    been nearly twice that length. The gigantic snakes of from</p>
                <p>20 to 30 feet in length mentioned in books of South-American travels belong to a
                    different species, the Anaconda or <hi rend="italic">B. murina,</hi> which has
                    the same habits as the <hi rend="italic">B. constrictor,</hi> haunting the banks
                    of rivers and lakes and lying in wait for peccaries, deer, and other mammals of
                    similar size, which come to the water to drink. It has already been stated (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles)</hi> that this family is not restricted to South
                    America, but is well represented in the tropical Pacific region. The Boid most
                    common in that region is <hi rend="italic">Enygrus,</hi> which ranges all over
                    New Guinea, the Fiji Islands, the Solomon group, Samoa, and many other Pacific
                    islands; it is of small size, scarcely 30 inches long.</p>
                <p>We pass now to the Venomous Colubrine snakes, that is, snakes which combine with
                    the possession of a perfect poison apparatus the scutellation and general
                    appearance of the typical non-poisonous snakes. It is a remarkable<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0211-0196"/> fact, however, that the snakes of this sub-order
                    agree in the absence of the small shield on the side of the snout, the so-called
                    “loreal ”; and this is all the more remarkable as the same shield has by no
                    means a similar taxonomic significance in the non-venomous snakes, many of which
                    are without it, although it is present in the majority. No snake of this
                    sub-order is more widely known and more dreaded than the species of the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Naja</hi> or cobras. Probably more than two species should be
                    distinguished; but the two which cause the greatest loss of life are the Indian
                    Cobra or Cobra di Capello or Naga (W. <hi rend="italic">tripudians)</hi> and the
                    African Cobra (<hi rend="italic">N</hi>. <hi rend="italic">haje).</hi> In a
                    report to the Bengal Government the commissioner of Burdwan states that he has
                    ascertained from statistics collected during a series of nine years that above
                    1000 persons are killed annually by snakes in a population of nearly 6,000,000,
                    the majority being bitten by the cobra, which is by far the most common. And
                    other districts in India seem to suffer still more severely, although it is
                    difficult to obtain information of all the accidents caused by snakes. The cobra
                    is found throughout India, extending westwards to the Sutlej and eastwards to
                    the Chinese island of Chusan; in the Himalayan alps it reaches an altitude of
                    8000 feet; it occurs also in abundance in many of the islands of the East Indian
                    Archipelago, and is here joined by another apparently distinct species (<hi
                    rend="italic">N</hi>. <hi rend="italic">sputatrix),</hi> whilst in the central
                    portions of Asia, which geographically separate it from the African cobra, it is
                    replaced by a fourth, <hi rend="italic">N. oxi-</hi><hi rend="italic">ana.</hi>
                    The Indian cobra appears in many varieties of colour, which are distinguished by
                    separate names in the nomenclature of the Hindu snake-charmers. The ground
                    colour varies from a yellowish olive to brown and to black with or without
                    whitish or white crossbands on the back, and with from one to four or without
                    any black bars across the anterior part of the belly. Some of these varieties
                    are characterized by a pair of very conspicuous white, black-edged
                    spectacle-like marks on the expansible portion of the neck, called the “hood”;
                    but these marks may lose their typical form and become merely a pair of
                    ocellated spots, or be confluent into a single ocellus, or may be absent
                    altogether. All these varieties, however, are the same species, which generally
                    attains to a length of 5 feet, but sometimes exceeds 6. It is more of nocturnal
                    than of diurnal habits, feeding on every kind of small Vertebrates and also
                    eating eggs. The cobra and the other species of this genus have the anterior
                    ribs elongated, and can move them so as to form a right angle with the spine.
                    The effect of this movement is the dilatation of that part behind the head which
                    is generally ornamented with the spectacles or ocelli. When the cobra is
                    irritated or excited it spreads its “hood,” raising the anterior third of the
                    body from the ground, gliding along with the posterior two-thirds, and holding
                    itself ready to strike forwards or sidewards. All accounts agree that the cobra
                    is not aggressive unless interfered with or impelled by a sense of danger. It is
                    said to share the habitations of man where superstition prevents people from
                    molesting it, and to live peaceably with the inmates; and there is no doubt that
                    professional snake-charmers exercise a certain control over them, for, although
                    generally the cobras exhibited are rendered harmless by the removal of the
                    poison-fangs, they very rarely attempt to injure their masters even after the
                    fangs have been reproduced. Of the natural enemies of the cobra, the mongoos
                    (see vol. xii. p. 629) does probably the greatest amount of execution; many are
                    destroyed by fowls shortly after being hatched. The cobra is oviparous,
                    depositing from eighteen to twenty-five eggs in the year. The African cobra is
                    extremely similar to its Indian congener in size, form, and habits, and varies
                    in coloration to the same extent. It inhabits the whole of Africa, from Egypt to
                    the Cape of Good Hope, but has been nearly exterminated in the cultivated
                    districts of the Cape Colony. One of its greatest enemies (as indeed of all
                    snakes) is the secretary bird of South Africa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Serpentarius),</hi> which, therefore, is protected by law. Accidents from this
                    snake do not appear to be of common occurrence; they happen more frequently to
                    domestic animals than to man. In the Egyptian hieroglyphics the cobra occurs
                    constantly with the body erect and hood expanded; its name was <hi rend="italic"
                    >ouro,</hi> which signifies “king,” and the animal appears in Greek literature
                    as <hi rend="italic">ouraios</hi> and <hi rend="italic">basiliscus.</hi> With
                    the Egyptian snake-charmers of the present day the cobra is as great a favourite
                    as with their Hindu colleagues. They pretend to change the snake into a rod, and
                    Geoffroy St-Hilaire maintains that the supple snake is made stiff and rigid by a
                    strong pressure upon its neck, and that the animal does not seem to suffer from
                    this operation, but soon recovers from the cataleptic fit into which it has been
                    temporarily thrown.</p>
                <p>More dangerous than either of the species of cobra, which it exceeds in size, is
                    <hi rend="italic">Hamadryas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ophiophagus elaps,</hi>
                    the largest poisonous snake of the Old World, attaining to a length of 14 feet.
                    It has almost the same geographical range as the cobra, but is much scarcer; it
                    greatly resembles it also in general habit, but differs from it in scutellation,
                    possessing three large shields behind the occipitals. It has the reputation of
                    occasionally attacking and pursuing man; its favourite food consists of other
                    snakes. Snake-charmers prize it highly for exhibition on account of its size and
                    its docility in captivity, but are always careful to extract the fangs. It lives
                    in captivity for many years.</p>
                <p>The species of <hi rend="italic">Bungarus,</hi> four in number, are extremely
                    common in India, Burmah, and Ceylon, and are distinguished by having only one
                    row of undivided sub-caudal shields. Three of the species have the body
                    ornamented with black rings, but the fourth and most common <hi rend="italic"
                    >(B. coeruleus),</hi> the “krait” of Bengal, possesses a dull and more uniform
                    coloration. The fangs of the bungarums are shorter than those of the cobras, and
                    cannot penetrate so deeply into the wound. Their bite is therefore less
                    dangerous and the effect on the general system slower, so that there is more
                    prospect of recovery by treatment. Nevertheless, according to Fayrer, the krait
                    is probably, next to the cobra, the most destructive snake to human life in
                    India.</p>
                <p>Several genera of this sub-order of Venomous Colubrines are similar to the
                    innocuous <hi rend="italic">Calamariidse,</hi> in general habit; that is, their
                    body is of a uniform cylindrical shape, terminating in a short tail, and covered
                    with short polished scales; their head is short, the mouth rather narrow, and
                    the eye small. They are the tropical American <hi rend="italic">Elaps,</hi> the
                    Indian <hi rend="italic">Callophis,</hi> the African <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poecilophis,</hi> and the Australian <hi rend="italic">Vermicella.</hi> The
                    majority are distinguished by the beautiful arrangement of their bright and
                    highly ornamental colours; many species of <hi rend="italic">Elaps</hi> have the
                    pattern of the so-called coral snakes, their body being encircled by black, red,
                    and yellow rings,—a pattern which is peculiar to snakes, venomous as well as
                    non-venomous, of the fauna of tropical America. Although the poison of these
                    narrowmouthed snakes is probably as virulent as that of the preceding, man has
                    much less to fear from them, as they bite only under great provocation.
                    Moreover, their bite must be frequently without serious effect, owing to their
                    narrow mouth and the small size of their poison-fangs. They are also
                    comparatively of small size, only a few species rarely exceeding a length of 3
                    feet.<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n212/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0212-0197"/> No part of the world possesses so many snakes of
                    this sub-order as Australia, where, in fact, they replace the non-venomous
                    Colubrine snakes. Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Diemenia</hi> six species, of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pseudechis</hi> three, and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoplocephalus</hi> some twenty species have been described, and many of them
                    are extremely common and spread over a considerable area.</p>
                <p>Fortunately the majority are of small size, and their bites are not followed by
                    more severe effects than those from the sting of a hornet, especially if the
                    simple measures of sucking or cauterizing the wound are resorted to. Only the
                    following are dangerous to man and larger animals: —the Brown Snake (<hi
                    rend="italic">Diemenia superciliosa),</hi> found all over Australia and
                    attaining to a length of over 5 feet; the Black Snake <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pseudechis porphyriacus),</hi> likewise common throughout the Australian
                    continent, especially in low marshy places, and upwards of 6 feet in length; it
                    is black, with each scale of the outer series red at the base; when irritated it
                    raises the fore part of its body and flattens out its neck like a cobra; the
                    Brown-banded Snake <hi rend="italic">{Hoplocephalus curtus),</hi> with a similar
                    distribution, and also common in Tasmania, from 5 to 6 feet long, and considered
                    the most dangerous of the tribe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Good descriptions and figures of all these snakes are given

                <p>The small family <hi rend="italic">Causidae</hi> contains two African genera well
                    known to and much feared by the inhabitants of South Africa. One, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sepedon haemachates,</hi> is named by the Boers “roode koper
                    kapel” or “Ring-Neck Snake,” the latter name being, however, often applied also
                    to the cobra. It resembles in colour some varieties of the latter snake, and,
                    like this, it has the power, though in a less degree, of expanding its hood. But
                    its scales are keeled and its form is more robust. It is equally active and
                    courageous, not rarely attacking persons who approach too near to its
                    resting-place. In confinement it evinces great ferocity, opening its mouth and
                    erecting its fangs, from which the poison is seen to flow in drops. During such
                    periods of excitement it is even able, by the pressure of the muscles on the
                    poison-duct, to eject the fluid to some distance; hence it shares with the cobra
                    a third Dutch name, that of “spuw slang” (Spitting Snake). It grows to a length
                    of 2 or 3 feet. The second African snake of this family is the “schapsticker”
                    (Sheep Stinger), <hi rend="italic">Causus rhombeatus.</hi> It is extremely
                    common in South Africa and extends far northwards along the eastern as well as
                    western coast. It is of smaller size than the preceding and causes more injury
                    to animals, such as sheep, dogs, &amp;c., than to man. It varies in colour, but
                    a black mark on the head like an inverted V remains nearly always visible.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dinophidae</hi> are the arboreal type of this sub-order;
                    they resemble non-venomous tree snakes in their gracile form, narrow scales,
                    generally green coloration, and in their habits; nevertheless the perfect
                    development of their poison-apparatus, their wide mouth, their large size (they
                    grow to a length of 7 feet), leave no doubt that they are most dangerous snakes.
                    They do not appear to be common, but are spread over all districts of tropical
                    Africa in which vegetation flourishes.</p>
                <p>Of Sea Snakes (<hi rend="italic">Hydrophidae)</hi> some fifty species are known.
                    All are inhabitants of the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean, and most numerous in and
                    about the Persian Gulf, in the East Indian Archipelago, and in the seas between
                    southern China and northern Australia. One species which is extremely common
                    (<hi rend="italic">Pelamis bicolor),</hi> and which is easily recognized by the
                    black colour of its upper and the yellowish tints of its lower parts (both
                    colours being sharply defined), has extended its range westwards to the sea
                    round Madagascar, and eastwards to the Gulf of Panama.</p>
                <p>Sea snakes are viviparous and pass their whole life in the water; they soon die
                    when brought on shore. The most striking feature in their organization is their
                    ele vated and compressed tail. The hind part of the body is compressed, and the
                    belly forms a more or less sharp ridge. The ventral shields would be of no use
                    to snakes moving through a fluid, and there fore they are either only
                    rudimentary or entirely absent. The genus <hi rend="italic">Piaturus,</hi> how
                    ever, is a most remarkable exception in having broad ventral shields; probably
                    these serpents frequently go on shore, sporting or hunting over marshy
                    ground.</p>
                <p>In many sea snakes the hind part of the body is curved and prehensile, so that
                    they are able to secure a hold by twisting this part of the body round corals,
                    sea weed, or any other projecting object. Their tail answers all the purposes of
                    the same organ in fish, and their motions in the water are almost as rapid as
                    they are un certain and awkward when the animals are removed out of their proper
                    element.</p>
                <p>Their nostrils are placed quite at the top of the snout, as in crocodiles and in
                    fresh water snakes, so that they are enabled to breathe whilst the entire body
                    and the greater part of the head are immersed in the water. These openings are
                    small and subcrescentic, and are provided with a valve interiorly, which is
                    opened during respiration, and closed when the animal dives. They have very
                    capacious lungs, extending backwards to the anus, and consequently all their
                    ribs are employed in performing the respiratory function; by retaining air in
                    these extensive lungs they are able to float on the surface of the water without
                    the slightest effort, and to remain under water for a considerable length of
                    time. The scales of sea snakes are frequently very different from those of other
                    snakes: they overlap one another in only a few species; in others they are but
                    little imbricate and are rounded behind; and in others they are of a
                    subquadrangular or hexagonal form, placed side by side, like little shields. The
                    less imbricate they are the more they have lost the polished surface which we
                    find in other snakes, and are soft, tubercular, sometimes porous. Sea snakes
                    shed their skin very frequently; but it peels off in pieces as in lizards, and
                    not as in the freshwater snakes, in which the integuments come off entire.
                    Several species are remarkable for the extremely slender<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n213/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0213-0198"/> and prolonged anterior part of the body, which is
                    termed the “neck,” and terminates in a very small head. The eye is small, with
                    round pupil, which is so much contracted by the light when the snake is taken
                    out of the water that the animal becomes blinded and is unable to hit any object
                    it attempts to strike. The tongue is short, and the sheath in which it lies
                    concealed opens near to the front margin of the lower jaw; scarcely more than
                    the two terminating points are exserted from the mouth when the animal is in the
                    water. The mouth shuts in a somewhat different way from that of other snakes:
                    the middle of the rostral shield is produced downwards into a small lobule,
                    which prevents the water from entering the mouth; there is generally a small
                    notch on each side of the lobule for the passage of the two points of the
                    tongue. Cantor says that when the snake is out of the water and blinded by the
                    light it freely makes use of its tongue as a feeler. The food of sea snakes
                    consists entirely of small fish; the present writer has found all kinds of fish
                    in their stomach, among them species with very strong spines <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Apogon,</hi> Siluroids). As all these animals are killed by the poison of the
                    snake before they are swallowed, and as their muscles are perfectly relaxed,
                    their armature is harmless to the snake, which commences to swallow its prey
                    from the head, and depresses the spines as deglutition proceeds. There cannot be
                    the slightest doubt that sea snakes belong to the most poisonous species of the
                    whole order. Russell and Cantor have ascertained it by direct observation:
                    tortoises, other snakes, and fish died from their bite in less than an hour, and
                    a man succumbed after four hours. Accidents are rarely caused by them, because
                    they are extremely shy and swim away on the least alarm; but, when surprised in
                    the submarine cavities forming their natural retreats, they will, like any other
                    poisonous terrestrial snake, dart at the disturbing object; and, when out of the
                    water, they attempt to bite every object near them, even turning round to wound
                    their own bodies (Cantor). They cannot endure captivity, dying in the course of
                    two or three days, even when kept in capacious tanks. The greatest size to which
                    some species attain, according to positive observation, is about 12 feet, and
                    therefore far short of the statements as to the length of the so-called sea
                    serpents (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sea-serpent).</hi> The largest examples the
                    present writer has seen measured only 8 feet.</p>
                <p>Passing over Rattlesnakes (fig. 16) and Vipers, which are treated of in separate
                    articles, we notice the following types of the fourth sub-order, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ophidii Viperiformes.</hi></p>
                <p>The sole representative of the sub-order in Australia is the Death Adder (<hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthophis antarctica),</hi> a short stout snake having a similar
                    habitus and habits to vipers and scarcely attaining 3 feet in length. It differs
                    from the other Viperines in having the poison-fang permanently erect. Although
                    much feared, and justly, there is reason to believe that its bite is not so
                    dangerous as has been represented, and that the majority of the fatal accidents
                    ascribed to it are in fact caused by other snakes, probably <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoplocephalus curtus.</hi> It occurs throughout the whole of Australia, except
                    Tasmania and perhaps South Australia. Generally it is of a uniform grey colour,
                    relieved by some forty dark rings of irregular outline.</p>
                <p>The “tic-polonga” of the Singalese (<hi rend="italic">Daboia russellii)</hi> is
                    beautifully marked: on a light chocolate ground colour three series of large
                    black white-edged rings run along the back and sides of the body, a yellow line
                    borders the surface of the head on each side, the two lines being convergent on
                    the snout. It attains to a length of 50 inches, and occurs locally in abundance
                    in southern India, where it is called “cobra monil”; in Bengal, where it is
                    called “jessur”; in the plains of central India, as well as in the Himalayas to
                    an altitude of 6000 feet; and in Burmah. It is highly poisonous, probably
                    causing many deaths.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0214-0199"/> Fortunately its loud hissing when disturbed warns
                    those who come within dangerous proximity to it.</p>
                <p>The small Viperine snake, <hi rend="italic">Echis carinata</hi> (fig. 17), which
                    scarcely exceeds a length of 20 inches, shares with the preceding part of its
                    range, being found in the arid districts of southern India, and extending
                    through the intervening parts of Asia to North Africa. It is a desert type,
                    having the lateral scales curiously arranged, strongly keeled, with the tips
                    directed downwards. It produces with their aid a rustling sound. Whilst some
                    observers deny that fatal consequences have resulted from its bite, Dr Imlach
                    reports that it (the “kuppur”) is “the most deadly poisonous snake in Sind.”
                    This desert type is replaced farther south in Africa where vegetation flourishes
                    by a closely allied genus, <hi rend="italic">Atheris,</hi> which, however,
                    possesses a prehensile tail and vivid coloration and has assumed truly arboreal
                    habits.</p>
                <p>Of the pit vipers without rattles the largest and most formidable inhabit
                    tropical America. <hi rend="italic">Trigonocephalus iararaca, T. atrox,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">T. lanceolatus</hi> attain to a length of 6 feet, the first
                    two being common in Brazil and northwards to Central America. The last is
                    limited to some islands in the West Indies, especially Martinique and St Lucia,
                    and is generally known by the name of “fer de lance,” which has been given to it
                    from the markings on its head. It infests the sugar-plantations, and has greatly
                    multiplied in consequence of the protection which the cover of the cane-fields
                    afforded it, and the abundance of food supplied by the rats which swarm on the
                    plantations. Thus, whilst it did a certain amount of good by the destruction of
                    vermin, it caused a great number of deaths among the black labourers who were
                    engaged in the fields. These three species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigonocephalies</hi> are sur passed in size by <hi rend="italic">Lachesis
                    mutus,</hi> probably the largest of terrestrial poisonous snakes, which is said
                    to exceed a length of 10 feet, and is bulky in proportion. It is confined to the
                    hottest parts of tropical America. Similar snakes, but smaller in size, inhabit
                    the warmer and temperate parts of North America, viz., the Copper-head <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cenchris contortrix)</hi> and the Crater-mocassin <hi
                    rend="italic">(C. piscivorus),</hi> the former of terrestrial habits, the latter
                    being always found near water and feeding chiefly on aquatic animals. Both are
                    much feared and cause accidents more frequently than rattlesnakes, being more
                    aggressive and striking the intruder without previously warning him of their
                    presence. In the Indian region this type of pit vipers without rattles is
                    likewise well represented, one genus <hi rend="italic">(Trimeresurus)</hi> being
                    adapted for an arboreal life, like <hi rend="italic">Atheris</hi> among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Viperidae.</hi> Their body (fig. 18) is not more elongate than
                    that of other ground Crotalines, but their tail is prehensile, and their colour
                    generally resembles that of the bright foliage among which they live. Sometimes
                    bright yellow or red markings render these snakes still more pleasing to the
                    eye. Accidents caused by them are of not uncommon occurrence, but fortunately
                    only a few individuals exceed a length of 2 feet, and the consequences of their
                    bite are less to be dreaded than of that of other allied genera. Indeed,
                    numerous cases are on record which show that the constitutional symptoms caused
                    by their poison were of short duration, lasting only from two to forty-eight
                    hours, and being confined to nausea, vomiting, and fever. The bite of larger
                    specimens, of from 2 to 3 feet long, is more dangerous and has occasionally
                    proved fatal. They feed on frogs, mammals, and birds. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
