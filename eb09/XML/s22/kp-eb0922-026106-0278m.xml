                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0279-0262"/> of ingenuity. Although in a language like the
                    English it does no doubt require considerable ingenuity to construct a
                    satisfactory sonnet of octave and sestet running upon four rhymes, this
                    ingenuity is only a means to an end, the end being properly that a single wave
                    of emotion, when emotion is either too deeply charged with thought, or too much
                    adulterated with fancy, to pass spontaneously into the movements of pure lyric,
                    shall be embodied in a single metrical flow and return. Whether any given sonnet
                    be composed like that of Pier delle Vigne (of two quatrains with rhymes running
                    a, b, a, b, a, b a, b, and of two tercets with rhymes running c, d, e, c, d, e),
                    or whether the verses be arranged (on the authority of Shakespeare and Drayton)
                    in three quatrains of alternate rhymes clinched by a couplet, or, as in the
                    sonnet of Petrarch, in an octave of two rhymes and a sestet of either two or
                    three rhymes, —in each case the peculiar pleasure which the ear derives from the
                    sonnet as a metrical form lies in the number and arrangement of the verses being
                    <hi rend="italic">prescribed,</hi> and distinctly recognizable as being
                    prescribed. That the impulse to select for the rendering of single phases of
                    feeling or reflexion a certain recognized form is born of a natural and
                    universal instinct is perhaps evidenced by the fact that even when a metrical
                    arrangement discloses no structural law demanding a prescriptive number and
                    arrangement of verses, the poet will nevertheless, in certain moods, choose to
                    restrict himself to a prescribed number and arrangement, as in the cases of the
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">stornello,</hi> the Welsh <hi rend="italic"
                    >triban,</hi> and the beautiful rhymeless short ode of Japanese poetry, for the
                    knowledge of which we are indebted to Mr Chamberlain. And perhaps, if space
                    permitted us to probe the matter deeply, we should find that the recognized
                    prescription of form gives a sense of oneness that nothing else save the refrain
                    can give to a poem which, being at once too long for a stanza in a series and
                    too short to have the self-sustaining power of the more extended kinds of poetic
                    art, suffers by suggesting to the ear a sense of the fragmentary and the
                    inchoate. It is not then merely the number of the verses, it is also their
                    arrangement as to rhymes,—an arrangement leading the ear to expect a prescribed
                    sequence and then satisfying that expectation,—which entitles a form of fourteen
                    verses to be called a sonnet.</p>
                <p>Hence the so-called irregular sonnets of S. T. Coleridge, which lead the ear of
                    the reader to expect the pleasure of a prescribed arrangement when what they
                    have to offer is a pleasure of an exactly opposite kind—the pleasure of an
                    absolute freedom from prescribed arrangement—are unsatisfactory, while (as the
                    present writer has often pointed out) the same poet’s fourteen-line poem, “Work
                    without Hope,” in which the reader expects and gets freedom from prescription,
                    is entirely satisfactory. This same little poem of Coleridge’s also affords an
                    excellent illustration of another point in connexion with the sonnet. If we
                    trace the history and the development of the sonnet from Pier delle Vigne to
                    Rossetti we shall find that the poet’s quest from the very first has been to
                    write a poem in fourteen verses so arranged that they should, better than any
                    other number and arrangement of verses, produce a certain melodic effect upon
                    the ear, and an effect, moreover, that should bear iteration and reiteration in
                    other poems similarly constructed. Now if we ask ourselves whether, beautiful as
                    is this poem, “Work without Hope,” taken as a single and original metrical
                    arrangement, we should get out of a series of poems modelled line for line upon
                    it that pleasure of iteration which we get out of a series of Petrarchan
                    sonnets, we shall easily see why the regular sonnet of octave and sestet on the
                    one hand, and what is called the Shakespearean sonnet on the other, have
                    survived all other competing forms.</p>
                <p>In modern Europe the sonnet has always had a peculiar fascination for poets of
                    the first class—poets, that is, in whom what we have called poetic energy (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Poetry)</hi> and plastic power are equally combined. It
                    would seem that the very fact that the sonnet is a recognized structure
                    suggestive of mere art—suggestive in some measure, indeed, of what Schiller
                    would call “sport” in art—has drawn some of the most passionate poets in the
                    world to the sonnet as the medium of their sincerest utterances. Without being
                    coldly artificial, like the rondeau, the sestina, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ballade,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">villanelle,</hi> &amp;c., the sonnet is yet
                    so artistic in structure, its form is so universally known, recognized, and
                    adopted as being artistic, that the too fervid spontaneity and reality of the
                    poet’s emotion may be in a certain degree veiled, and the poet can whisper, as
                    from behind a mask, those deepest secrets of the heart which could otherwise
                    only find expression in purely dramatic forms.</p>
                <p>That the sonnet was invented, not in Provence, as French critics pretend, but in
                    Italy in the 13th century, is pretty clear, but by whom is still perhaps an open
                    question. Mr S. Waddington <hi rend="italic">(Sonnets of Living Writers)</hi>
                    and several other contemporary critics attribute to Fra Guittone the honour of
                    having invented the form. But Mr J. A. Symonds has reminded us that the sonnet
                    beginning <hi rend="italic">Perd ch' amore,</hi> attributed to Pier delle Vigne,
                    secretary of state in the Sicilian court of Frederick, has claims which no
                    student of early Italian poetry can ignore.</p>
                <p>As regards English sonnets, whether the Petrarchan and the Shakespearean are
                    really the best of all possible forms we need not inquire. But, inasmuch as they
                    have become so vital and so dominant over other sonnet forms that whenever we
                    begin to read the first verse of an English sonnet we expect to find one or
                    other of these recognized rhyme-arrangements, any departure from these two
                    arrangements, even though the result be such a magnificent poem as Shelley’s
                    “Ozymandias,” disappoints the expectation, baffles the ear, and brings with it
                    that sense of the fragmentary and the inchoate to which we have before alluded.
                    If, however, some writer should arise with sufficient originality of metrical
                    endowment and sufficient poetic power to do what Keats, in a famous experiment
                    of his tried to do and failed,—impress the public ear with a new sonnet
                    structure, impress the public ear so powerfully that a new kind of expectance is
                    created the moment the first verse of a sonnet is recited,—then there will be
                    three kinds of English sonnets instead of two.</p>
                <p>With regard to the Petrarchan sonnet, all critics are perhaps now agreed that,
                    while the form of the octave is invariable, the form of the sestet is absolutely
                    free, save that the emotions should govern the arrangement of the verses. But as
                    regards the division between octave and sestet, Mr Mark Pattison says, with
                    great boldness, but perhaps with truth, that by blending octave with sestet
                    Milton missed the very object and end of the Petrarchan scheme. Another critic,
                    however, Mr Hall Caine, in his preface to <hi rend="italic">Sonnets of Three
                    Centuries,</hi> contends that by making “octave flow into sestet without break
                    of music or thought” Milton consciously or unconsciously invented a new form of
                    sonnet; that is to say, Milton, in his use of the Petrarchan octave and sestet
                    for the embodiment of intellectual substance incapable of that partial
                    disintegration which Petrarch himself always or mostly sought, invented a
                    species of sonnet which is English in impetus, but Italian, or partially
                    Italian, in structure. Hence this critic, like Mr William Sharp <hi
                    rend="italic">(Sonnets of this Century),</hi> divides all English sonnets into
                    four groups :—(1) sonnets of Shakespearean structure; (2) sonnets of octave and
                    sestet of Miltonic structure; (3) sonnets of contemporary structure, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, all sonnets on the Petrarchan model in which the
                    metrical and intellectual “wave of flow and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0280-0263"/> ebb” (as originally formulated by the present
                    writer in a sonnet on the sonnet, which has appeared in most of the recent
                    anthologies) is strictly observed, and in which, while the rhyme-arrangement of
                    the octave is invariable, that of the sestet is free; (4) sonnets of
                    miscellaneous structure.</p>
                <p>With regard to what is called the contemporary form, —a Petrarchan arrangement
                    with the sestet divided very sharply from the octave,—the crowning difficulty
                    and the crowning triumph of the sonnet writer has always been to so handle the
                    rhythm of the prescribed structure as to make it seem in each individual sonnet
                    the inevitable and natural rhythm demanded by the emotion which gives the
                    individual sonnet birth, and this can perhaps only be achieved when the richness
                    and apparent complexity of the rhyme-arrangement is balanced by that perfect
                    lucidity and simplicity of syntax which is the special quest of the “sonnet of
                    flow and ebb.”</p>
                <p>The wave theory has found acceptance with most recent students of the sonnet,
                    such as Rossetti and the late Mark Pattison, Mr J. A. Symonds, Mr Hall Caine,
                    and Mr William Sharp. Mr Symonds, indeed, seems to hint that the very name given
                    by the Italians to the two tercets, the volta or turn, indicates the metrical
                    meaning of the form. “The striking metaphorical symbol,” says he, “drawn from
                    the observation of the swelling and declining wave can even in some examples be
                    applied to sonnets on the Shakespearean model; for, as a wave may fall gradually
                    or abruptly, so the sonnet may sink with stately volume or with precipitate
                    subsidence to its close. Rossetti furnishes incomparable examples of the former
                    and more desirable conclusion; Sydney Dobell, in <hi rend="italic">Home in War
                    Time,</hi> yields an extreme specimen of the latter.”</p>
                <p>And now as to the Shakespearean sonnet. Some very acute critics have spoken as if
                    this form were merely a lawless succession of three quatrains clinched by a
                    couplet, and as if the number of the quatrains might just as well have been two
                    or four as the present prescribed number of three. If this were so, it would
                    unquestionably be a serious impeachment of the Shakespearean sonnet, for save in
                    the poetry of ingenuity no metric arrangement is otherwise than bad unless it be
                    the result of a deep metrical necessity.</p>
                <p>If the prescriptive arrangement of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> quatrains
                    clinched by a couplet is not a metrical necessity, if it is not demanded in
                    order to prevent the couplet from losing its power, such an arrangement is idle
                    and worse than idle; just as, in the case of the Petrarchan sonnet, if it can be
                    shown that the solid unity of the outflowing wave can be maintained as
                    completely upon three rhymes as upon two, then the restriction of the octave to
                    two rhymes is simple pedantry. But he who would test the metrical necessity of
                    the arrangement in the Shakespearean sonnet has only to make the experiment of
                    writing a poem of two quatrains with a couplet, and then another poem of four
                    quatrains with a couplet, in order to see how inevitable is the metrical
                    necessity of the Shakespearean number and arrangement for the achievement of the
                    metrical effect which Shakespeare, Drayton, and others sought. While in the poem
                    of two quatrains the expected couplet has the sharp epigrammatic effect of the
                    couplet in ordinary stanzas (such as that of <hi rend="italic">ottava rima,</hi>
                    and as that of the <hi rend="italic">Venus and Adonis</hi> stanza), destroying
                    that pensive sweetness which is the characteristic of the Shakespearean sonnet,
                    the poem of four quatrains is just sufficiently long for the expected pleasure
                    of the couplet to be dispersed and wasted.</p>
                <p>The quest of the Shakespearean sonnet is not, like that of the sonnet of octave
                    and sestet, sonority, and, so to speak, metrical counterpoint, but sweetness;
                    aud the sweetest of all possible arrangements in English versification is a
                    succession of decasyllabic quatrains in alternate rhymes knit together and
                    clinched by a couplet—a couplet coming not so far from the initial verse as to
                    lose its binding power, and yet not so near the initial verse that the ring of
                    epigram disturbs the “linked sweetness long drawn out” of this movement, but
                    sufficiently near to shed its influence over the poem back to the initial verse.
                    A chief part of the pleasure of the Shakespearean sonnet is the expectance of
                    the climacteric rest of the couplet at the end (just as a chief part of the
                    pleasure of the sonnet of octave and sestet is the expectance of the answering
                    ebb of the sestet when the close of the octave has been reached); and this
                    expectance is gratified too early if it comes after two quatrains, while, if it
                    comes after a greater number of quatrains than three, it is dispersed and wasted
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>The French sonnet has a regular Petrarchan octave with a sestet of three rhymes
                    beginning with a couplet. The Spanish sonnet is also based on the pure Italian
                    type, and is extremely graceful and airy. The same may be said of the Portuguese
                    sonnet—a form of which the illustrious Camoens has left nearly three hundred
                    examples. (τ. w.)</p>
