                <p><label type="entry">SOLE</label>. Soles are a group of Flat-Fishes <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pleuronectidae),</hi> which is represented by numerous species in
                    all suitable localities within the temperate and tropical zones; they become,
                    however, scarce in the southern parts of the southern temperate zone, and are
                    absent altogether in some districts—for instance, on the coasts of southern
                    Australia. Many of the species enter fresh water freely, and some have become
                    thoroughly acclimatized in it. Soles are a highly specialized type of flat-fish;
                    their mouth is very narrow, twisted round to the blind side, and small teeth are
                    developed on that side only. As they always lie or swim on one side, the
                    pectoral fins have ceased to have a function, and consequently these organs are
                    reduced in size, and in many of the species are mere rudiments or are lost
                    entirely. The eyes are small, invariably on the right side of the fish, the
                    upper occupying a position more or less in advance of the lower. Soles are
                    littoral fishes, inhabiting sandy bottoms, shifting with the season from shallow
                    into somewhat deeper water. Like all flat-fishes they are carnivorous, but feed
                    on small animals only; none attain to a large size, scarcely exceeding that of 2
                    feet. Of the forty species known of the genus <hi rend="italic">Solea,</hi> four
                    are found on the British coast; the one most generally known and commercially
                    most important is the Common Sole <hi rend="italic">(Solea solea)</hi>; it seems
                    to occur in greater or less abundance on all flat coasts of Europe, but its
                    numbers have been considerably thinned within the last quarter of a century, at
                    least on the British coasts, doubtless in consequence of the introduction of the
                    trawl. At any rate, that over-fishing is the cause of the decrease of this
                    valuable table fish is amply proved by the fact that simultaneously with the
                    quantity the average weight of the fish has been diminished, soles of 12 inches
                    in length and of 8 ounces in weight being now in many localities the largest
                    that can be obtained. At present young specimens form the majority of the soles
                    in the market, and are sold under the names of “slips” or “tongues.” During the
                    breeding-season, which falls in the months from February to April, soles lose
                    much of their flavour. It is a singular fact that male soles seem to be almost
                    unknown, and some ichthyologists account for it by supposing that the males
                    remain much smaller than the females, and are overlooked in consequence. The
                    Lemon Sole <hi rend="italic">(Solea aurantiaca)</hi> is much less esteemed than
                    the common sole, and more rarely seen in the market, probably because it is
                    locally distributed in deeper water. It is of a yellow colour, marbled with
                    brown and irregularly spotted with black; the pectoral fin is ornamented with an
                    ovate black spot on its hinder half. Even when this bright coloration has
                    disappeared in the fish after death, it may always be distinguished from the
                    common sole by its large dilated nasal opening on the blind side, which is
                    surrounded by a broad fringe. The Variegated Sole <hi rend="italic">(Solea
                    variegata)</hi> is at times taken in considerable numbers<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0265-0250"/> on the south coast by means of the trawl, and
                    esteemed as a table fish. It differs from the two preceding species by the
                    rudimentary condition of the pectoral fins, that of the blind side being minute.
                    The colour is brown; darker bands cross the body, and are darkest on the dorsal
                    and anal fins, where they appear as a row of about six large spots. It does not
                    appear to grow to the same size as the common sole. The fourth British species,
                    <hi rend="italic">Solea minuta,</hi> is still smaller, not much exceeding 5
                    inches in length; it is therefore not of commercial importance, although it may
                    be caught at times in the trawl in large numbers. As in the preceding species,
                    the pectoral on the blind side is minute, but that of the right side is large
                    enough to show a distinct black spot. The colour of the body is brownish or
                    greyish, with small black spots, and every sixth or seventh ray of the dorsal
                    and anal fins is black.</p>
                <p>Flat-fishes resembling soles abound on the shores of the Indian Ocean beside the
                    true soles, but they have the eyes on the left side of the head and lack
                    pectoral fins altogether. They have been referred, therefore, to distinct
                    genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Plagusia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynoglossus.</hi></p>
