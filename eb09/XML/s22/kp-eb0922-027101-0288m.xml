                    and died 406 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> As in the case of other Athenian
                    celebrities, various particulars of his life are handed down, few of which,
                    however, deserve much attention, even the reports attributed to contemporaries
                    being mostly trivial if not puerile. He is known to have reached old age, and
                    his career as a dramatist is believed to have extended over more than sixty
                    years (468-406). His father’s name was Sophillus, of the deme Colonus Hippius,
                    the aristocratic quarter, where the Government of the Four Hundred was
                    afterwards constituted. The family burial-place is said by the anonymous
                    biographer to have been ten stadia from the city, on the Decelean Way. These
                    facts run counter to the tradition, which seems to have been already discredited
                    by Alexandrian critics, that Sophillus was an artisan. The date assigned for the
                    poet’s birth is in accordance with the tale that young Sophocles, then a pupil
                    of the musician Lamprus, was chosen to lead the chorus of boys <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ᾐφέωv λεκτοί, (Eel. Tyr.,</hi> 18) in the celebration of the victory of
                    Salamis (480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The time of his death is fixed by
                    the allusions to it in the <hi rend="italic">Frogs</hi> of Aristophanes and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Muses,</hi> a lost play of Phrynichus, the comic poet,
                    which were both produced in 405 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> shortly before
                    the capture of the city. And the legend which implies that Lysander allowed him
                    funeral honours is one of those which, like the story of Alexander and Pindar’s
                    house at Thebes, we can at least wish to be founded on fact, though we -should
                    probably substitute Agis for Lysander. Apart from tragic victories, the event of
                    Sophocles’s life most fully authenticated is his appointment at the age of
                    fifty-five as one of the generals who served with Pericles in the Samian War
                    (440-439 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Conjecture has been rife as to the
                    possibility of his here improving acquaintance with Herodotus, whom he probably
                    met some years earlier at Athens (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Herodotus).</hi> But
                    the distich quoted by Plutarch—</p>
                <p>'Ωιδὴv 'Ηροδότῳ τευξεv Σoφoκλης ἐτέωv ὢv ∏έvτ' ἐπὶ πεvτήκovτα—</p>
                <p>is a slight ground on which to reject the stronger tradition according to which
                    Herodotus was ere this established at Thurii; and the coincidences in their
                    writings may be accounted for by their having drawn from a common source. The
                    fact of Sophocles’s generalship is the less surprising if taken in connexion
                    with the interesting remark of his biographer (whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life,</hi> though absent from the earliest MS. through some mischance, bears
                    marks of an Alexandrian origin) that he took his full share of civic duties, and
                    even served on foreign embassies :—Καλώς √ ∈7rαιδ∈υ(h7 και <hi rend="italic"

                    πptσβ(ιaι&lt;s efητaζeτo.</hi> The large acquaintanceship which this implies,
                    not only in Athens, but in Ionic cities generally, is a point of main importance
                    in considering the opportunities of information at his command. And, if we
                    credit this assertion, we are the more at liberty to doubt the other statement,
                    though it is not incredible, that his appointment as general was due to the
                    political wisdom of the <hi rend="italic">Antigone.</hi></p>
                <p>The testimony borne by Aristophanes to the amiability of the poet’s temper (ό δ
                    ∈υκoλoς <hi rend="italic">p.iv èvGàH, eυκο∖ος</hi> δ’ eκcι) agrees with the
                    record of his biographer that he was universally beloved. And the anecdote
                    recalled by Cephalus in Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic,</hi> that Sophocles
                    welcomed the release from the passions which is brought by age, accords with the
                    spirit of his famous Ode to Love in the <hi rend="italic">Antigone.</hi> The
                    Sophocles who, according to Aristotle <hi rend="italic">(Rhet.,</hi> iii. 18),
                    said of the Government of the Four Hundred that it was the better of two bad
                    alternatives (probably the same who was one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prοbuli)</hi> may or may not have been the poet. Other gossiping stories are
                    hardly worth repeating,—as that Pericles rebuked his love of pleasure and
                    thought him a bad general, though a good poet; that he humorously boasted of his
                    own “generalship” in affairs of love; or that he said of Aeschylus that he was
                    often right without knowing it, and that Euripides represented men as they are,
                    not as they ought to be. Such trifles rather reflect contemporary or subsequent
                    impressions of a superficial kind than tell us anything about the man or the
                    dramatist. The gibe of Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">(Pax,</hi> 695 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.),</hi> that Sophocles in his old age was become a very
                    Simonides in his love for gain, may turn on some perversion of fact,<note

                    that in spite of pressing invitations he refused to leave Athens for kings’
                    courts. And the story of his indictment by his son Iophon for incompetence to
                    manage his affairs,—to which Cicero has given some weight by quoting it in the
                    <hi rend="italic">De Senectute,—</hi> appears to be really traceable to Satyrus
                    <hi rend="italic">(flor. c.</hi> 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> the same
                    author who gave publicity to the most ridiculous of the various absurd accounts
                    of the poet’s death,—that his breath failed him for want of a pause in reading
                    some passage of the <hi rend="italic">Antigone.</hi> Satyrus is at least the
                    sole authority for the defence of the aged poet, who, after reciting passages
                    from the <hi rend="italic">(Ed. Col.,</hi> is supposed to have said to his
                    accusers, “If I am Sophocles I am no dotard, and if I dote I am not Sophocles.”
                    On the other hand, we need not the testimony of biographers to assure us that he
                    was devoted to Athens and renowned for piety. He is said to have been priest of
                    the hero Alcon (or Halon) in his old age, and himself to have received divine
                    honours after death.</p>
                <p>That the duty of managing the actors as well as of training the chorus belonged
                    to the author is well known. But did Aeschylus act in his own plays? This
                    certainly is implied in the tradition that Sophocles, because of the weakness of
                    his voice, was the first poet who desisted from doing so. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Thamyras,</hi> however, he is said to have performed on the lyre
                    to admiration, and in his <hi rend="italic">Nausicaa</hi> (perhaps as
                    coryphaeus) to have played gracefully the game of ball. Various minor
                    improvements in decoration and stage carpentry are attributed to him,—whether
                    truly or not who can tell? It is more interesting, if true, that he wrote his
                    plays having certain actors in his eye; that he formed an association (6iασor)
                    for the promotion of liberal culture; and that he was the first to introduce
                    three actors on the stage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">If this was so, it must have been previous to the

                    authority of Aristoxenus that Sophocles was also the first to employ Phrygian
                    melodies. And it is easy to believe that <hi rend="italic">Aj.,</hi> 693 <hi

                    Ancient critics had also noted his familiarity with Homer, especially with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> his power of selection and of extracting an
                    exquisite grace from all he touched (whence he was named the “Attic Bee ”), his
                    mingled felicity and boldness, and, above all, his subtle delineation of human
                    nature and feeling. They observed that the balanced proportions and fine
                    articulation of his work are such that in a single half line or phrase he often
                    conveys the impression of an entire character.<pb break="no"

                    reversed by modern criticism. The object of the present article, however, is not
                    to praise Sophocles, but rather to describe him. And it is time to turn from
                    Alexandrian or Byzantine fancies and judgments to the poet’s extant works.</p>
                <p>His minor poems, elegies, paeans, &amp;c., have all perished; and of his hundred
                    and odd dramas only seven remain. These all belong to the period of his maturity
                    (he had no decline); and not only the titles (as Lessing said) but some scanty
                    fragments of more than ninety others have been preserved. Several of these were,
                    of course, satyric dramas. And this recalls a point of some importance, which
                    has been urged on the authority of Suidas, who says that “Sophocles began the
                    practice of pitting play against play, instead of the tetralogy.” If it were
                    meant that Sophocles did not exhibit tetralogies, this statement would have
                    simply to be rejected. For the word of Suidas (950 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> has no weight against quotations from the lists of tragic victories
                    (<hi rend="italic">διδασκαλίαι</hi>) "which there is no other reason for
                    discrediting. The remark might be due to the impression made on some critics by
                    the greater complexity and completeness of a play of Sophocles—say the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oedipus Tyrannus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antigone—</hi> as
                    compared, say, with the <hi rend="italic">Persae</hi> or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Septem contra Thebas.</hi> It is distinctly asserted, for example, on the
                    authority of the <hi rend="italic">διδασκαλίαι</hi>, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacchae</hi> of Euripides, certainly as late as any play of Sophocles, was one
                    of a trilogy or tetralogy. And if the custom was thus maintained for so long it
                    was clearly impossible for any single competitor to break through it. But it
                    seems probable that the trilogy had ceased to be the continuous development of
                    one legend or cycle of legends,—“presenting Thebes or Pelops’ line,”—if, indeed,
                    it ever was so exclusively; and if, as Schöll and others have suggested, a
                    Sophoclean tetralogy was still linked together by some subtle bond of tragic
                    thought or feeling, this would not affect the criticism of each play considered
                    as an artistic whole. At the same time it appears that the satyric drama lost
                    its grosser features and became more or less assimilated to the milder form of
                    tragedy. And these changes, or something like them, may have given rise to the
                    statement in Suidas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    advantages and defects of the trilogy as a dramatic form are admirably stated by

                    The srnall number of victories attributed to Sophocles, in proportion to the
                    number of his plays, is only intelligible on the supposition that these were
                    presented in groups.</p></note></p>
                <p>If the diction of Sophocles sometimes reminds his readers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> the subjects of his plays were more frequently
                    chosen from those later epics which subsequently came to be embodied in the epic
                    cycle,—such as the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Little Iliad,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ilvupersis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cypria,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Nosti,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Telegonia</hi> (all revolving round the tale of Troy), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thebaica,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Οἰχαλίας ἅλωσις</hi>, and others,
                    including probably, though there is no mention of such a thing, some early
                    version of the Argonautic story. In one or other of these heroic poems the
                    legends of all the great cities of Hellas were by this time embodied; and,
                    though there must also have been a cloud of oral tradition floating over many a
                    sacred spot, the dramatic poet does not seem, unless in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus Coloneus,</hi> to have directly drawn from this. He was content to
                    quarry from the epic rhapsodies the materials for his more concentrated art,
                    much as Shakespeare made use of Hollingshed or Plutarch, or as the subjects of
                    Tennyson’s <hi rend="italic">Idylls of the King</hi> have been taken from Sir
                    Thomas Malory. As Sophocles has been accused of narrowing the range of tragic
                    sympathy from Hellas to Athens, it deserves mention here that, of some hundred
                    subjects of plays attributed to him, fifteen only are connected with Attica,
                    while exactly the same number belong to the tale of Argos, twelve are
                    Argonautic, and thirty Trojan. Even Corinthian heroes (Bellerophon, Polyidus)
                    are not left out. It seems probable on the whole that, within the limits allowed
                    by convention, Sophocles was guided simply by his instinctive perception of the
                    tragic capabilities of a particular fable. This was evidently Lessing’s view,
                    and may be confirmed by quoting his striking remarks upon the subject of one of
                    the lost tragedies, the <hi rend="italic">Thyestes at Sicyon :—</hi></p>
                <p>“Nach der abscheulichen Mahlzeit, die ihm sein Bruder bereitete, flog er nach
                    Sicyon. Und hier war es wo er, auf Befragung des Orakels, wie er sich an seinem
                    Bruder rächen sollte, die Antwort bekam, er sollte seine eigne Tochter entehren.
                    Er überfiel dies auch unbekannter Weise; und aus diesem Beischlafe ward Aegisth,
                    der den Atreus hernach umbrachte, erzeugt. Die Verzweiflung einer geschändeten
                    Prinzessin! Von einem Unbekannten! In welchem sie endlich ihren Vater erkennt!
                    Eine von ihrem Vater entehrte Tochter! Und aus Rache entehrt! Geschändet, einen
                    Mörder zu gebären! Welche Situationen! welche Scenen!”</p>
                <p>To say that subsidiary or collateral motives were never present to Sophocles in
                    the selection of a subject would, however, be beyond the mark. His first drama,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Triptolemus,</hi> must have been full of local colouring;
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> appealed powerfully to the national pride; and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus Coloneus</hi> some faint echoes even of
                    oligarchical partisanship may be possibly discerned. But, even where they
                    existed, such motives <hi rend="italic">were</hi> collateral and subsidiary;
                    they were never primary. All else was subordinated to the dramatic, or, in other
                    words, the purely human, interest of the fable. This central interest is even
                    more dominant and pervading in Sophocles than the otherwise supreme influence of
                    religious and ethical ideas. The idea of destiny, for example, was of course
                    inseparable from Greek tragedy. Its prevalence was one of the conditions which
                    presided over the art from its birth, and, unlike Aeschylus, who wrestles with
                    gods, our poet simply accepts it, both as a <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> of
                    tradition and a fact of life. But in the free handling of Sophocles even fate
                    and providence are adminicular to tragic art. They are instruments through which
                    sympathetic emotion is awakened, deepened, intensified. And, while the vision of
                    the eternal and unwritten laws was holier yet, for it was not the creation of
                    any former age, but rose and culminated with the Sophoclean drama, still to the
                    poet and his Periclean audience this was no abstract notion, but was inseparable
                    from their impassioned contemplation of the life of man—so great and yet so
                    helpless, aiming so high and falling down so far, a plaything of the gods and
                    yet essentially divine. This lofty vision subdued with the serenity of awe the
                    terror and pity of the scene, but from neither could it take a single tremor or
                    a single tear. Emotion was the element in which Greek tragedy lived and moved,
                    albeit an emotion that was curbed to a serene stillness through its very depth
                    and intensity.</p>
                <p>The final estimate of Sophoclean tragedy must largely depend upon the mode in
                    which his treatment of destiny is conceived. That Aeschylus had risen on the
                    wings of faith to a height of prophetic vision, from whence he <hi rend="italic"
                    >saw</hi> the triumph of equity and the defeat of wrong as an eternal process
                    moving on toward one divine event,—that he realized sin, retribution,
                    responsibility, as no other ancient did,—may be gladly conceded. But it has been
                    argued<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Günther,</hi> op. cit.</p></note> that because Sophocles is saddened by
                    glancing down again at actual life,—because in the fatalism of the old fables he
                    finds the reflexion of a truth,—he in so far takes a step backward as a tragic
                    artist. Now is this altogether just? His value for what is highest in man is
                    none the less because he strips it of earthly rewards, nor is his reverence for
                    eternal law less deep because he knows that its workings are sometimes pitiless.
                    Nor, once more,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0290-0273"/> does he disbelieve in providence, because
                    experience has shown him that the end towards which the supreme powers lead
                    forth mankind is still unseen. We miss something of the exultant energy of the
                    Marathonian man, but under the grave and gentle guidance of his successor we
                    lose nothing of the conviction that, “because right is right, to follow right
                    were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.” Not only the utter devotion of
                    Antigone, but the lacerated innocence of Oedipus and Deianira, the tempted truth
                    of Neoptolemus, the essential nobility of Ajax, leave an impress on the heart
                    which is ineffaceable, and must elevate and purify while it remains. In one
                    respect, however, it must be admitted that Sophocles is not before his age.
                    There is an element of unrelieved vindictiveness, not merely inherent in the
                    fables, but inseparable from the poet’s handling of some themes, which is only
                    too consistent with the temper of the “tyrant city.” Aeschylus represents this
                    with equal dramatic vividness, but he associates it, not with heroism, but with
                    crime.</p>
                <p>Sophocles is often praised for skilful construction. But the secret of his skill
                    depends in large measure on the profound way in which the central situation in
                    each of his fables has been conceived and felt. Concentration is the
                    distinguishing note of tragedy, and it is by greater concentration that
                    Sophocles is distinguished from other tragic poets. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Septem contra Thebas</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi> there is
                    still somewhat of epic enlargement and breadth; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hecuba</hi> and other dramas of Euripides separate scenes have an idyllic
                    beauty and tenderness which affect us more than the progress of the action as a
                    whole, a defect which the poet sometimes tries to compensate by some novel
                    denouement or catastrophe. But in following a Sophoclean tragedy we are carried
                    steadily and swiftly onward, looking neither to the right nor to the left; the
                    more elaborately any scene or single speech is wrought the more does it
                    contribute to enhance the main emotion, and if there is a deliberate pause it is
                    felt either as a welcome breathing space or as the calm of brooding
                    expectancy.</p>
                <p>The result of this method is the union, in the highest degree, of simplicity with
                    complexity, of largeness of design with absolute finish, of grandeur with
                    harmony. Superfluities are thrown off without an effort through the burning of
                    the fire within. Crude elements are fused and made transparent. What look like
                    ornaments are found to be inseparable from the organic whole. Each of the plays
                    is admirable in structure, not because it is cleverly put together, but because
                    it is so completely alive.</p>
                <p>The spectator of a Sophoclean tragedy was invited to witness the supreme crisis
                    of an individual destiny, and was possessed at the outset with the circumstances
                    of the decisive moment. Except in the <hi rend="italic">Trachiniae,</hi> where
                    the retrospective soliloquy of Deianira is intended to emphasize her lonely
                    position, this exposition is effected through a brief dialogue, in which the
                    protagonist may or may not take part. In the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus
                    Tyrannus</hi> the king’s entrance and his colloquy with the aged priest
                    introduce the audience at once to the action and to the chief person. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ajax</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philoctetes</hi> the entrance or
                    discovery of the hero is made more impressive by being delayed. Immediately
                    after the prologos the chorus enter, numbering fifteen, either chanting in
                    procession as in the <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oed.
                    Tyr.,</hi> or dispersedly as in the <hi rend="italic">Oed. Col.</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Philoctetes,</hi> or, thirdly, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Electra,</hi> where, after entering silently during the monody of the heroine,
                    and taking up their position in the orchestra, they address her one by one. With
                    a remarkable exception, to be noted presently, the chorus having once entered
                    remain to the end. They always stand in some carefully adjusted relation to the
                    principal figure. The elders of Thebes, whose age and coldness throw into relief
                    the fervour and the desolation of Antigone, are the very men to realize the
                    calamity of Oedipus, and, while horror-stricken, to lament his fall. The rude
                    Salaminian mariners are loyal to Ajax, but cannot enter into his grief. The
                    Trachinian maidens would gladly support Deianira, who has won their hearts, but
                    they are too young and inexperienced for the task. The noble Argive women can
                    sympathize with the sorrows of Electra, but no sympathy can soothe her
                    distress.</p>
                <p>The parodos of the chorus is followed by the first scene or epeisodion, with
                    which the action may be said to begin. For in the course of this the spectator’s
                    interest is strongly roused by some new circumstance involving an unforeseen
                    complication,—the awakening of Ajax (<hi rend="italic">Aj</hi>.), the burial of
                    Polynices (<hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi>) the dream of Clytemnestra <hi
                    rend="italic">(El.),</hi> the dark utterance of Tiresias <hi rend="italic">(Oed.
                    Tyr.),</hi> the arrival of Lichas with Iole <hi rend="italic">(Trach.),</hi> the
                    report of Ismene announcing Creon’s coming <hi rend="italic">(Oed. Col.),</hi>
                    the sudden entreaty of Philoctetes crossed by the entrance of the pretended
                    mariner <hi rend="italic">(Phil.).</hi> The action from this point onwards is
                    like a steadily flowing stream into which a swift and turbulent tributary has
                    suddenly fallen, and the interest advances with rapid and continuous climax
                    until the culmination is reached and the catastrophe is certain. The manner in
                    which this is done, through the interweaving of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ῥήσεις</hi> and <hi rend="italic">στιχoμυφία</hi> of the dialogue with the <hi

                    and <hi rend="italic">κομματικά</hi> (where there is interchange between the
                    chorus and the persons), is very different in different dramas, one of the
                    principal charms of Sophocles being his power of ingenious variation in the
                    employment of his resources. Not less admirable is the strength with which he
                    sustains the interest after the <hi rend="italic">peripeteia,</hi><note

                    the soliloquy that precedes his suicide.</p>
                <p>No such general description as has been here attempted can give even a remote
                    impression of the march of Sophoclean tragedy,—by what subtle yet firm and
                    strongly marked gradations the plot is unfolded; how stroke after stroke
                    contributes to the harmonious totality of feeling; what vivid interplay, on the
                    stage, in the orchestra, and between both, builds up the majestic, ever-moving
                    spectacle. Examine, for example, the opening scene or <hi rend="italic"
                    >πρόλογος</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus Tyrannus.</hi> Its function is
                    merely to propound the situation; yet it is in itself a miniature drama. First
                    there is the silent spectacle of the eager throng of suppliants at the palace
                    gate,—young children, youths, and aged priests. To them the king appears, with
                    royal condescension and true public zeal. The priest expresses their heartfelt
                    loyalty, describes the distress of Thebes, and, extolling Oedipus’s past
                    services, implores him to exercise his consummate wisdom for the relief of his
                    people. The king’s reply unveils yet further his incessant watchfulness and
                    anxious care for his subjects. And he discloses a new object to their expectancy
                    and hope. Creon, a royal person, had been sent to Delphi, and should ere then
                    have returned with the response of Apollo. At this all hearts are trembling in
                    suspense, when a figure is seen approaching. He is wreathed with Apollo’s
                    laurel; he looks cheerfully. What has Phoebus said? Another moment of suspense
                    is interposed. Then the oracle is repeated,—so thrilling to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0291-0274"/> the spectator who understands the story, so full
                    of doubt and hope and dread to all the persons of the drama: “It is for the
                    blood of Laius—his murderers are harboured in the land of Thebes. The country
                    must be purged.” That is the culminating point of the little tragedy. While
                    Oedipus asks for information, while in gaiety of heart he undertakes the search,
                    while he bids the folk of Cadmus to be summoned thither, the spectators have
                    just time to take in the full significance of what has passed, which every word
                    that is uttered sends further home. All this in 150 lines!</p>
                <p>Or, once more, consider the employment of narrative by this great poet. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tyrannus</hi> might be again adduced, but let us turn instead to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Trachiniae.</hi>
                    The speech of the messenger in the <hi rend="italic">Antigone,</hi> the speeches
                    of Hyllus and the Nurse in the <hi rend="italic">Trachiniae,</hi> occur at the
                    supreme crises of the two dramas. Yet there is no sense of any retardation in
                    the action by the report of what has been happening elsewhere. Much rather the
                    audience are carried breathlessly along, while each speaker brings before their
                    mental vision the scene of which he had himself been part. It is a drama within
                    the drama, an action rising from its starting point in rapid climax, swift,
                    full, concentrated, until that wave subsides, and is followed by a moment of
                    thrilling expectation. Nor is this all. The narrative of the messenger is
                    overheard by Eurydice, that of Hyllus is heard by Deianira, that of Nurse by the
                    chorus of Maidens. And in each case a poignancy of tragic significance is added
                    by this circumstance, while the <hi rend="italic">pησL&lt;s</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antigone,</hi> and that of Hyllus in a yet higher degree, bind
                    together in one the twofold interest of an action which might otherwise seem in
                    danger of distracting the spectator.</p>
                <p>So profound is the contrivance, or, to speak more accurately, such is the
                    strength of central feeling and conception, which secures the grace of unity in
                    complexity to the Sophoclean drama.</p>
                <p>The proportion of the lyrics to the level dialogue is considerably less on the
                    average in Sophocles than in Aeschylus, as might be expected from the
                    development of the purely dramatic element, and the consequent subordination of
                    the chorus to the protagonist. In the seven extant plays the lyrical portion
                    ranges from one-fifth to nearly one-third, being highest in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antigone</hi> and lowest in the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus
                    Tyrannus.</hi> The distribution of the lyrical parts is still more widely
                    diversified. In the <hi rend="italic">Electra,</hi> for instance, the chorus has
                    less to do than in the <hi rend="italic">Oedipus Tyrannus,</hi> although in the
                    former the lyrics constitute one-fourth, and in the latter only one-fifth of the
                    whole. But then the part of Electra is favourable to lyrical outbursts, whereas
                    it is only after the tragic change that Oedipus can appropriately pass from the
                    stately senarius to the broken language of the dochmiac and the “lamenting”
                    anapaest. The protagonists of the <hi rend="italic">Ajax</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philoctetes</hi> had also large opportunities for vocal
                    display.</p>
                <p>The union of strict symmetry with freedom and variety which is throughout
                    characteristic of the work of Sophocles is especially noticeable in his handling
                    of the tragic metres. In the iambics of his dialogue, as compared with those of
                    Aeschylus, there is an advance which may be compared with the transition from
                    “Marlowe’s mighty line” to the subtler harmonies of Shakespeare. Felicitous
                    pauses, the linking on of line to line, trisyllabic feet introduced for special
                    effects, alliteration both hard and soft, length of speeches artfully suited to
                    character and situations, adaptation of the caesura to the feeling expressed,
                    are some of the points which occur most readily in thinking of his <hi
                    rend="italic">senarii.</hi> A minute speciality may be noted as illustrative of
                    his manner in this respect. Where a line is broken by a pause towards the end,
                    and the latter phrase runs on into the following line, elision sometimes takes
                    place between the lines, <hi rend="italic">e.g. {Oed. Tyr.,</hi> 332-3) :—</p>
                <p>’Εγώ <hi rend="italic">ο∖&gt;τ' ιμαυτbv οtiτe d aKyυvw.</hi> τf ταΰτ’</p>
                <p>⅛λλωs eλeγχeιs;</p>
                <p>This is called <hi rend="italic">synaphea,</hi> and is peculiar to Sophocles.</p>
                <p>He differentiates more than Aeschylus does between the metres to be employed in
                    the <hi rend="italic">κομμοί</hi> (including the <hi rend="italic"
                    >κομματίκά)</hi> and in the choral odes. The dochmius, cretic, and free anapaest
                    are employed chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">κομμοί.</hi> In the stasima he has
                    greatly developed the use of logaoedic and particularly of glyconic rhythms, and
                    far less frequently than his predecessor indulges in long continuous runs of
                    dactyls or trochees. The light trochaic line</p>
                <p>_z_ <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi><hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> _z_ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> w</hi> _, so frequent in Aeschylus, is comparatively rare in
                    Sophocles. If, from the very severity with which the choral element is
                    subordinated to the purely dramatic, his lyrics have neither the magnificent
                    sweep of Aeschylus nor the “linked sweetness” of Euripides, they have a
                    concinnity and point, a directness of aim, and a truth of dramatic keeping, more
                    perfect than is to be found in either. And even in grandeur it would be hard to
                    find many passages to bear comparison with the second stasimon, or central ode,
                    either of the <hi rend="italic">Antigone</hi> (eυδαιpoveς oισt <hi rend="italic"
                    >κaκωv)</hi> or the first <hi rend="italic">Oedipus (cl μοL ζvveig
                    ψίροντι).</hi> Nor does anything in Euripides equal in grace and sweetness the
                    famous eulogy on Colonus (the poet’s birthplace) in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oedipus Coloneus.</hi></p>
                <p>Sophocles was edited (probably from the Venetian MSS.) by Aldus Manutius, with
                    the help of Muslims, in 1502. The Juntine editions, in which the text of Aldus
                    was slightly modified with the help of Florentine MSS., were published in 1522,
                    1547, respectively. An edition of the Scholia, very nearly corresponding to
                    those on the margin of the Medicean or chief Laurentian MS. (La or L) had
                    previously appeared at Rome in 1518. The first great modification of the text
                    was due to Turnebus, who had access to the Parisian MSS.; but he was not
                    fortunate in his selection. The earliest editors had been aware that the
                    traditional arrangement of the metres was faulty, but little way had been made
                    towards a readjustment. Now it so happens that the Parisian MS. T, which is a
                    copy of the recension of Triclinius, an early 14th-century scholar, contains
                    also the metrical views of the same editor; and, having found (as he erroneously
                    supposed) a sound authority, Turnebus blindly adopted it, and was followed in
                    this by H. Stephanus (1568), Capperonier, and Vauvillers in France, and Canter
                    in Holland (who was the first to mark the correspondence of strophe and
                    antistrophe). This error was to a large extent corrected by Brunck (1786), who
                    rightly preferred Par. A (2712), a 13th-century MS., belonging, as it happened,
                    to the same family with Ven. 467, which Aldus had mainly followed. Thus after
                    nearly three centuries the text returned (though with many conjectural
                    variations, some of which were due to Scaliger, Auratus, and other earlier
                    scholars) into nearly the same channel as at first. Meanwhile the study of Greek
                    metres had greatly advanced, and, while much licence was given to conjecture (in
                    which Valcknaer and Porson were especially happy), documentary evidence was also
                    better weighed and sifted. The collation of the Laurentian MS. by Peter Elmsley
                    in 1825 (with his transcription of the Scholia) may be said to mark the most
                    important epoch in the textual criticism of Sophocles. But the great work of
                    Gottfried Hermann, whose editions (1823-1830), which are critical in every sense
                    of the word, are adorned with an ample Latin commentary, made perhaps the
                    longest step in advance. Since Hermann the editors of Sophocles have been very
                    numerous. The list, from Schneidewin to Wecklein and Pappageorgius amongst
                    Continental scholars and from Linwood to Jebb (who is last, not least) amongst
                    our own, is too long for insertion here. (L. C. )</p>
