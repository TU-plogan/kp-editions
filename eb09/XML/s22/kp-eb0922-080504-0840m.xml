                    in the army of the Parliament. He completed his Oxford course in 1648,
                    graduating as bachelor of medicine, and about the same time he was elected a
                    fellow of All Souls College. It was not until nearly thirty years later (1676)
                    that he graduated as M.D., not at Oxford, but at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where
                    his eldest son was then an undergraduate. His interest in medicine seems to have
                    been aroused at an early age. Nothing is known of Sydenham’s life between 1648
                    and 1663; but it is probable that he spent part of the time at Oxford. It is
                    said also (on the authority of one Desault, in a work published at Bordeaux in
                    1733) that he studied at Montpellier, although it is not so stated by himself in
                    his dedicatory letter to Dr Mapletoft, among the other autobiographical facts
                    there given. In 1663 he passed the examinations of the College of Physicians for
                    their licence to practise in Westminster and 6 miles round; but it is probable
                    that he had been settled in London for some time before that. This minimum
                    qualification to practise was the single bond between Sydenham and the College
                    of Physicians throughout the whole of his career. He seems to have been
                    distrusted by the heads of the faculty because he was an innovator and something
                    of a plaindealer. In his letter to Mapletoft he refers to a class of detractors
                    “qui vitio statim vertunt si quis novi aliquid, ab illis non prius dictum vel
                    etiam inauditum, in medium proferat”; and in a letter to Robert Boyle, written
                    the year before his death (and the only authentic specimen of his English
                    composition that remains), he says, “I have the happiness of curing my patients,
                    at least of having it said concerning me that few miscarry under me; but [I]
                    cannot brag of my correspondency with some other of my faculty. . . . Though
                    yet, in taking fire at my attempts to reduce practice to a greater easiness,
                    plainness, and in the meantime letting the mountebank at Charing Cross pass
                    unrailed at, they contradict themselves, and would make the world believe I may
                    prove more considerable than they would have me.” Sydenham attracted to him in
                    warm friendship some of the most discriminating men of his time, such as John
                    Locke and Robert Boyle. His first book, <hi rend="italic">Methodus Curandi
                    Febres,</hi> was published in 1666; a second edition, with an additional chapter
                    on the plague, in 1668; and a third edition, much enlarged and bearing the
                    better-known title of <hi rend="italic">Observationes Medicae,</hi> in 1676. His
                    next publication was in 1680 in the form of two <hi rend="italic">Epistolae
                    Responsoriae,</hi> the one, “On Epidemics,” addressed to Brady, regius professor
                    of physic at Cambridge, and the other, “On the Lues Venerea,” to Paman, public
                    orator at Cambridge and Gresham professor in London. In 1682 he issued another
                    <hi rend="italic">Dissertatio Epistolaris,</hi> on the treatment of confluent
                    smallpox and on hysteria, addressed to Dr Cole of Worcester. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tractatus de Podagra et Hydrope</hi> came out in 1683, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schedula Monitoria de Novae Febris Ingressu</hi> in 1686. His last
                    completed work, <hi rend="italic">Processus Integri,</hi> is an outline sketch
                    of pathology and practice; twenty copies of it were printed in 1692, and, being
                    a compendium, it has been more often republished both at home and abroad than
                    any other of his writings separately. A fragment on pulmonary consumption was
                    found among his papers. His collected writings occupy about 600 pages 8vo in the
                    original Latin.</p>
                <p>Hardly anything is known of Sydenham’s personal history in London. He died in an
                    acute paroxysm of gout in December 1689. He was buried in the church of St
                    James’s, Piccadilly, where a mural slab was put up by the College of Physicians
                    in 1810.</p>
                <p>Although Sydenham was a highly successful practitioner and saw more than one new
                    edition of his various tractates called for, besides foreign reprints, in his
                    lifetime, his fame as the father of English medicine, or the English
                    Hippocrates, was decidedly posthumous. For a long time he was held in vague
                    esteem for the success of his cooling (or rather expectant) treatment of
                    smallpox, for his laudanum (the first form of a tincture of opium), and for his
                    advocacy of the use of Peruvian bark in quartan agues. There were, however,
                    those among his contemporaries who understood something of Sydenham’s importance
                    in larger matters than details of treatment and pharmacy, chief among them being
                    the talented Morton. But the attitude of the academical medicine of the day is
                    doubtless shown forth in Lister’s use of the term “sectaries” for Sydenham and
                    his admirers, at a time (1694) when the leader had been dead five years. If
                    there were any doubt that the opposition to him was quite other than political,
                    it would be set at rest by the testimony of Dr Andrew Brown,<note

                    his <hi rend="italic">Vindicatory Schedule concerning the New Cure of
                    Fevers.</hi> In the series of Harveian orations at the College of Physicians,
                    Sydenham is first mentioned in the oration of Arbuthnot (1727), who styles him
                    “aemulus Hippocratis.” Boerhaave, the Leyden professor, was wont to speak of him
                    in his class (which had always some pupils from England and Scotland) as
                    “Angliae lumen, artis Phoebum, veram Hippocratici viri speciem.” Haller also
                    marked one of the epochs in his scheme of medical progress with the name of
                    Sydenham. He is indeed famous because he inaugurated a new method and a better
                    ethics of practice, the worth and diffusive influence of which did not become
                    obvious (except to those who were on the same line with himself, such as Morton)
                    until a good many years afterwards. It remains to consider briefly what his
                    innovations were.</p>
                <p>First and foremost he did the best he could for his patients, and made as little
                    as possible of the mysteries and traditional dogmas of the craft. All the
                    stories told of him are characteristic. Called to a gentleman who had been
                    subjected to the lowering treatment, and finding him in a pitiful state of
                    hysterical upset, he “conceived that this was occasioned partly by his long
                    illness, partly by the previous evacuations, and partly by emptiness. I
                    therefore ordered him a roast chicken and a pint of canary.” A gentleman of
                    fortune who was a victim to hypochondria was at length told by Sydenham that he
                    could do no more for him, but that there was living at Inverness a certain Dr
                    Robertson who had great skill in cases like his; the patient journeyed to
                    Inverness full of hope, and, finding no doctor of the name there, came back to
                    London full of rage, but cured withal of his complaint. Of a piece with this is
                    his famous advice to Blackmore. When Blackmore first engaged in the study of
                    physic he inquired of Dr Sydenham what authors he should read, and was directed
                    by that physician to <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> “which,” said he, “is a
                    very good book; I read it still.” There were cases, he tells us, in his practice
                    where “I have consulted my patient’s safety and my own reputation most
                    effectually by doing nothing at all.” It was in the treatment of smallpox that
                    his startling innovations in that direction made most stir. It would be a
                    mistake, however, to suppose that Sydenham wrote no long prescriptions, after
                    the fashion of the time, or was entirely free from theoretical bias. Doctrines
                    of disease he had, as every practitioner must have; but he was too much alive to
                    the multiplicity of new facts and to the infinite variety of individual
                    constitutions to aim at symmetry in his theoretical views or at consistency
                    between his practice and his doctrines; and his treatment was what he found to
                    answer best, whether it were <hi rend="italic">secundum artem</hi> or not. His
                    fundamental idea was to take diseases as they presented themselves in nature and
                    to draw up a complete picture (“krankheitsbild” of the Germans) of the objective
                    characters of each. Most forms of ill-health, he insisted, had a definite type,
                    comparable to the types of animal and vegetable species. The conformity of type
                    in the symptoms and course of a malady was due to the uniformity of the cause.
                    The causes that he dwelt upon were the “evident and conjunct causes,” or, in
                    other words, the morbid phenomena; the remote causes he thought it vain to seek
                    after. Acute diseases, such as fevers and inflammations, he regarded as a
                    wholesome conservative effort or reaction of the organism to meet the blow of
                    some injurious influence operating from without; in this he followed the
                    Hippocratic teaching closely as well as the Hippocratic practice of watching and
                    aiding the natural crises. Chronic diseases, on the other hand, were a depraved
                    state of the humours, mostly due to errors of diet and general manner of life,
                    for which we ourselves were directly accountable. Hence his famous dictum: <hi
                    rend="italic">“acutos</hi> dico, qui ut plurimum Deum habent authorem, sicut
                    chronici ipsos nos.” Sydenham’s nosological method is essentially the modern
                    one, except that it wanted the morbid anatomy part, which was first introduced
                    into the “natural history of disease” by Morgagni nearly a century later. In
                    both departments of nosology, the acute and the chronic, Sydenham contributed
                    largely to the natural history by his own accurate observation and philosophical
                    comparison of case with case and type with type. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observationes Medicae</hi> and the first <hi rend="italic">Epistola
                    Responsoria</hi> contain evidence of a close study of the various fevers,
                    fluxes, and other acute maladies of London over a series of years, their
                    differences from year to year and from season to season, together with
                    references to the prevailing weather,—the whole body of observations being used
                    to illustrate the doctrine of the “epidemic constitution” of the year or season,
                    which he considered to depend often upon inscrutable telluric causes. The type
                    of the acute disease varied, he found, according to the year and season, and the
                    right treatment could not be adopted until the type was known. There had been
                    nothing quite like this in medical literature since the Hippocratic treatise, ∏
                    <hi rend="italic">ερὶ ἀέρων, ύδάτων, τόπωv</hi>; and there are probably some
                    germs of truth in it still undeveloped, although the modern science of
                    epidemiology has introduced a whole new set of considerations. Among other
                    things Sydenham is credited with the first diagnosis of scarlatina and with the
                    modern definition of chorea (in <hi rend="italic">Sched. Monit.).</hi> After
                    smallpox, the diseases to which he refers most are hysteria and gout, his
                    description of the latter</p>
                <p>(from the symptoms in his own person) being one of the classical pieces of
                    medical writing. While Sydenham’s “natural history” method has doubtless been
                    the chief ground of his great posthumous fame, there can be no question that
                    another reason for the admiration of posterity was that which is indicated by R.
                    G. Latham, when he says, “I believe that the moral element of a liberal and
                    candid spirit went hand in hand with the intellectual qualifications of
                    observation, analysis, and comparison.”</p>
                <p>The most critical biography is that by Dr R. G. Latham prefixed to his
                    translation of Sydenham’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (2 vols., London, 1848,
                    Syd. Soc.). Dr John Brown’s “Locke and Sydenham," in <hi rend="italic">Horae
                    Subsecivae,</hi> Edinburgh, 1858, is more of the nature of eulogy. Many
                    collected editions of his works have been published, as well as three English
                    translations. Dr W. A. Greenhill's Latin text (London, 1844, Syd. Soc.) is a
                    model of editing and indexing. There have been foreign monographs on Sydenham by
                    Goeden (Berlin, 1827), Rovers (Dort, 183S), F. Jahn (Eisenach, 1840), and
                    Hvasser (Upsala, 1846). The most interesting summary of doctrine and practice by
                    the author himself is the introduction to the 3d ed. of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observationes Medicae</hi> (1676). (C. C.)</p>
