                <p><label type="entry">SUN</label>. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astronomy</hi> (vol. ii. p. 768 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> the sun has been
                    considered as a member of the solar system, and references are given to various
                    discoveries which have been made from time to time relating to its physical and
                    chemical constitution. In the present article we propose to consider the sun as
                    a star, and to state as briefly as may be the views at present held regarding
                    its structure, and subsequently to refer to the most recent observations dealing
                    with the physics and chemistry of the various phenomena which are open to our
                    study.</p>
                <p>The sun as ordinarily visible to us, bounded by the photosphere, is only a small
                    part of the real sun: from observations made during eclipses it is now known
                    that outside the photosphere are—first, an envelope, namely the chromosphere,
                    which is mainly composed of hydrogen, and outside this another envelope, called
                    the corona, while there is evidence that outside these, and especially along the
                    plane of the sun’s equator, there is a considerable extension of matter which
                    may or may not be of the same nature as that of which the corona is
                    composed.</p>
                <p>These various parts of the solar economy have been examined by the spectroscope,
                    and from this examination two widely divergent views have arisen.</p>
                <p>According to the first view, the true atmosphere of the sun is limited by the
                    chromosphere, and the constituents of that atmosphere consist essentially of the
                    vapours of the chemical elements recognized on the earth. It will be seen that
                    on this view the corona and the equatorial extension observed occasionally are
                    merely solar appendages. In the other view the atmosphere of the sun is extended
                    to the confines of the corona, the temperature naturally increasing as we
                    descend; and it is held that towards the photosphere the temperature is so high
                    that the chemical elements are dissociated into finer forms of matter, so that
                    descending vapours get more simple, ascending vapours get more complex, and it
                    is only in the cooler regions of the atmosphere that vapours resembling those of
                    our terrestrial elements can exist, while near the confines of the corona these
                    vapours give place to solid particles and masses. Broadly stated, these
                    divergent views have arisen from the application of two distinct methods of
                    inquiry. In one method, light coming from every portion of the sun, and
                    reflected, let us say, by a cloud into the spectroscope, gives us a spectrum
                    full of absorption lines, and these lines are practically constant from year to
                    year. In the other method, each minute portion of the solar economy has been
                    examined bit by bit, and thus we have the spectrum of the spots, the spectrum of
                    the prominences, the spectrum of the chromosphere, the spectrum of the corona.
                    All these spectra vary enormously, not only among themselves, but from year to
                    year; and, when we consider merely the spots and prominences, we may say that
                    they vary from spot to spot and from prominence to prominence.</p>
                <p>It will be obvious that the true mean density of the sun cannot be the same on
                    the two hypotheses to which we have referred. If the atmosphere is practically
                    limited by the photosphere, it has been found that the density of the sun is
                    L444, water being taken as unity. If we include the corona in the sun’s
                    atmosphere, and assume that its height is half a million of miles above the
                    photosphere, then the volume of the sun is ten times that bounded by the
                    photosphere, and the density is reduced to a tenth of the value given above.</p>
                <p>We next proceed to discuss the chemical results obtained by the first method of
                    inquiry to which reference has been made. For these results we are of course
                    dependent upon comparisons of the lines given by various incandescent vapours
                    with the Fraunhofer lines seen in the ordinary spectrum of the sun. If by such
                    means complete evidence is afforded of the existence of one of our chemical
                    elements in the sun, it is obvious that no information is given as to its
                    precise locality; further, if the high temperatures used in our laboratories to
                    produce a spectrum should break up the molecules of the vapours as known to the
                    chemist into finer ones, and if the temperature of the sun were to do the same,
                    there would still be a considerable similarity between the solar and the
                    terrestrial spectrum of any one substance.</p>

                <p>When we come to bring the chemical evidence together which has been acquired by
                    the examination of separate parts of the solar economy, we find, as has been
                    already hinted, that the apparent similarity in chemical structure suggested by
                    the foregoing tables entirely breaks down. Not only is the chemical nature of
                    each separate solar phenomenon different from that of any other, but the facts
                    of observation are in all cases entirely new and strange, so that very little
                    light is obtained towards the understanding of them from ordinary laboratory
                    work.</p>
                <p>We will consider the chemistry of the chief solar features in order.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemistry of the Constituent Parts.</hi></p>
                <p>The spectrum of the spots differs from that of the ordinary surface of the sun
                    chiefly by the widening of certain of the Fraunhofer lines in the spot
                    spectrum,— some being excessively widened. The lines which are most widened
                    change from spot to spot and from year to year. The most extensive sun-spot
                    observations of this nature have been carried on in Kensington, and the
                    conclusions derived from 700 observations on spots between 1879 and 1885 are as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>(1) The spot spectra are very unlike the ordinary spectrum of the sun: some
                    Fraunhofer lines are omitted; new lines appear; and the intensities of the old
                    lines are changed.</p>
                <p>(2) Only very few lines, comparatively speaking, of each chemical element, even
                    of those which have many among the Fraunhofer lines, were seen to be most
                    widened. It was as if on a piano only a few notes were played over and over
                    again, always producing a different tune.</p>
                <p>(3) An immense variation from spot to spot was observed between the most widened
                    lines seen in the first hundred observations. Change of quality or density will
                    not account for this variation. To investigate this point the individual
                    observations of lines seen in the spectrum of iron were plotted out on strips of
                    paper, and an attempt made to arrange them in order, but without success, for,
                    even when the observations were divided into six groups, about half of them were
                    left outstanding.</p>
                <p>(4) If we consider the lines of any one substance, there is as much inversion
                    between them as between the lines of any two metals. By the term “inversion” is
                    meant that of any three lines, A, B, C, we may get A and B without C, A and C
                    without B, B and C without A.</p>
                <p>(5) Very few lines are strongly affected at the same time in the same spot,
                    although a great many lines of the same substance may be affected, besides the
                    twelve recorded as most widened on each day.</p>
                <p>(6) Many of the lines seen in the spots are visible at low temperatures (some in
                    the oxy-hydrogen flame), and none are brightened or intensified when we pass
                    from the temperature of the electric arc to that of the electric spark.</p>
                <p>(7) Certain lines of a substance have indicated rest, while other adjacent lines
                    seen in the spectrum of the same substance in the same field of view have shown
                    change of wave-length.</p>
                <p>(8) A large number of the lines seen in spots are common to two or more
                    substances with the dispersion employed.</p>
                <p>(9) The lines of iron, cobalt, chromium, manganese, titanium, calcium, and nickel
                    seen in the spectra of spots are usually coincident with lines in the spectra of
                    other metals with the dispersion employed, whilst the lines of tungsten, copper,
                    and zinc seen in spots are not coincident with lines in other spectra.</p>
                <p>(10) The lines of iron, manganese, zinc, and titanium most frequently seen in
                    spots are different from those most frequently seen in flames, whilst in cobalt,
                    chromium, and calcium the lines seen in spots are the same as those seen in
                    flames.</p>
                <p>(11) Towards the end of the first series of investigations there appeared among
                    the most widened lines a few which are not represented, so far as is known,
                    among the lines seen in the spectra of terrestrial elements. This change took
                    place when there was a marked increase in the solar activity.</p>
                <p>(12) The most widened lines in sun spots change with the sunspot period.</p>
                <p>(13) At and slightly after the minimum the lines are chiefly known lines of the
                    various metals.</p>
                <p>(14) At and slightly after the maximum the lines are chiefly of unknown
                    origin.</p>
                <p>(15) On the hypothesis under discussion the change indicates an increased
                    temperature in the spots at the sun-spot maximum.</p>
                <p>The general result is that in passing from minimum to maximum the lines most
                    affected change from those of the ordinary chemical elements to lines whose
                    significance are not known. The accompanying diagram represents graphically the
                    disappearance of the lines of iron, nickel, and titanium and the simultaneous
                    appearance of unknown lines in the spot spectra in passing from minimum to
                    maximum. In the region of the spectrum for which the curves are drawn six lines
                    were recorded in each observation, and therefore 600 in each series of 100
                    observations. In the curves the vertical ordinates represent not merely the
                    number of individual lines recorded but the number of occurrences of lines of
                    each substance. The dotted curve shows the variation in the frequency of the
                    iron lines; at the minimum in 1879 practically all the 600 lines observed were
                    iron lines; towards the end of 1881 they had dwindled down to 30; and during the
                    three following years they fell to 10. The dot and dash curve shows a similar
                    variation in the nickel lines, and the double line curve that of the titanium
                    lines during the same periods. The continuous curve shows the gradual increase
                    in the number of occurrences of unknown lines in passing from the minimum in
                    1879 to the maximum in 1884.</p>
                <p>The chromosphere when quite quiescent merely gives us a spectrum of hydrogen
                    together with a line in the yellow, which, from its proximity to D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and D <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is called D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The chromosphere is disturbed in two ways,—first, by
                    prominences, of which more hereafter, and second, by the formation gradually and
                    peacefully of domes, which are of no great height but sometimes extend over
                    large areas and last for weeks. These last-named phenomena have been termed
                    “wellings up,” the idea being that they were produced by the gradual uprise of
                    vapours from below; but it is clear that the same phenomena might be<pb

                    above. The spectrum of these higher portions of the chromosphere, whether
                    produced from below or above, is more complicated than the ordinary one. The
                    following table (C) gives the principal lines which have been recorded up to

                <p>The first new line in this table is called in spectroscopic language 1474,
                    because when this work was begun the only maps available were those made by
                    Professor Kirchhoff, and this particular line fell at 1474 on his scale. Since
                    then these artificial scales have been discarded in favour of the natural one,
                    which is given by the wavelengths of light of different colours. In this the
                    reference number of the same line is 5315·9, which represents the wave-length in
                    ten-millionths of a millimètre of that particular quality of light. After this
                    we observe three lines of magnesium, only 3 out of 7; next a line of nickel, one
                    only, however, out of 34; then two lines of sodium, although we might naturally
                    expect to get all the 8 lines; then two lines of barium out of 26; and so on.
                    Almost all the other lines have origins which are absolutely unknown: that is to
                    say, we never get them in our terrestrial laboratories, and never, therefore,
                    are able to match the bright lines in the chromosphere of the sun with any
                    chemical substance. In 1871 the sun was more active, and this activity resulted
                    in the addition of new lines, all, however, absolutely unknown to us, except
                    one, which represents a line in the spectrum of titanium; but in that case we
                    get one line out of 201 in exactly the same way as we get two only of iron out
                    of 460. It is most important to note that practically none of the lines shown in
                    table C are among those which are widened in spots.</p>
                <p>The prominences are of two kinds—those which are relatively quiet and give almost
                    exclusively the lines of hydrogen and those in which the motions are as a rule
                    very violent. The spectrum of the latter class generally includes a large number
                    of metallic lines; hence they are generally called metallic prominences. The
                    first stage of metallic prominence is usually the appearance of three lines of
                    the following wave-lengths—4943, 5031, 5315·9. As the prominence increases in
                    magnitude and violence other lines are added, until at times the spectrum seems
                    full of lines. The rate of uprush of these prominences sometimes reaches 250
                    miles per second, or nearly a million miles an hour,—figures which convey an
                    idea of the enormous energies involved. The lines seen in these prominences,
                    although many are present in the spectra of the metallic elements, appear with
                    greatly changed intensities: the lines seen brightest in the prominences are
                    frequently dim lines in the terrestrial spectrum. Again it may be remarked that
                    these are not the lines which are most widened in spots. In the case of the
                    spectrum of any one substance the number of lines seen usually in the
                    prominences is very small.</p>
                <p>The general conclusions which have been derived from a discussion of the
                    prominence observations made by Profs. Tacchini and Riccò, in connexion with the
                    sun-spot observations already mentioned, are as follows.</p>
                <p>(1) The chromospheric and prominence spectrum of any one substance, except in the
                    case of hydrogen, is unlike the ordinary spectrum of the substance. For
                    instance, we get two lines of iron out of 460.</p>
                <p>(2) There are inversions of lines in the same elements in the prominences, as
                    there are inversions in the spots: in certain prominences we see certain lines
                    of a substance without others; in certain other prominences we see the other
                    lines without the first.</p>
                <p>(3) Very few lines are strongly affected at once, as a rule, and a very small
                    proportion altogether,—smaller than in the case of spots.</p>
                <p>(4) The prominences are less subject to sudden changes than spots, so far as
                    lines of the same element are concerned.</p>
                <p>(5) There is a change in the lines affected according to the sun’s spot
                    period.</p>
                <p>(6) The lines of a substance seen in the prominences are those which in our
                    laboratories become considerably brightened when we change the arc spectrum for
                    the spark spectrum.</p>
                <p>(7) None of the iron lines ordinarily visible in prominences are seen at the
                    temperature of the oxy-hydrogen flame. Some of the oxy-hydrogen flame lines are
                    seen in the spots, but none have ever been seen in the prominences.</p>
                <p>(8) A relatively large number of the lines ordinarily seen are of unknown
                    origin.</p>
                <p>(9) Many of the lines seen are not ordinarily seen amongst the Fraunhofer lines.
                    Some are bright lines.</p>
                <p>(10) As in the spots the H and K lines of calcium in the ultraviolet are always
                    bright in the spot spectrum, the other lines of calcium and the other substances
                    being darkened and widened, so it would appear that the lines H and K of calcium
                    are always bright in the prominences in which the other lines are generally
                    unaffected.</p>
                <p>(11) Many of the lines are common to two or more elements with the dispersion
                    which has been employed.</p>
                <p>The spectrum of the inner corona indicates that it is chiefly composed of
                    hydrogen. All the hydrogen lines are seen in it, and up to a certain height the
                    H and K lines of calcium, proving the presence either of calcium or of something
                    that exists in calcium which we cannot get at in our temperature.</p>
                <p>In the outer corona most of the hydrogen lines disappear; but one, the green line
                    F, remains for a considerable height side by side with the 1474 line,
                    indicating, as far as we can see where everything is so doubtful, that the
                    constituents of the outer corona consist most probably of hydrogen in a cool
                    form and the unknown stuff which gives the 1474 line. We also know that the
                    outer corona contains particles which reflect the ordinary sunlight to us,
                    because in 1871 Dr Janssen, and in 1878 Professor Barker and others, saw the
                    dark Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the corona. We must imagine, therefore,
                    that some part of that spectrum depends for its existence on solid particles
                    which not only give a spectrum like that of the lime-light but have the faculty
                    of reflecting to us the light of the underlying photosphere. It was also put
                    beyond all question in the eclipse of 1882 in Egypt that this corona has another
                    spectrum of its own. There are bright bands in the spectrum, showing that with
                    these additions it is not a truly continuous spectrum like that of the
                    lime-light, and that its origin is therefore in all probability very
                    complex.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Association and Distribution of Phenomena.</hi></p>
                <p>Observations of prominences, spots, and other phenomena which require continuous
                    investigation have been carefully made from day to day for several years, and
                    one conclusion arrived at is that when and where the (disturbed) spots are at
                    the maximum the faculae and metallic prominences are also at the maximum. When
                    the maximum changes from north to south latitude in the spots it also changes
                    from north to south in the metallic<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0675-0648"/> prominences and the faculae. These observations,
                    therefore, establish not only an important connexion between spots, metallic
                    prominences, and faculae but also the fact of the wonderful localization of
                    these phenomena upon the sun. The spots are never seen higher in latitude than
                    40° north or south, and they are invariably seen in smaller quantity at the
                    equator. Similarly, the faculae and metallic prominences do not go much beyond
                    40° north or south, and their minima are also at the equator. But this does not
                    hold good for prominences of the quiet sort and the veiled spots,—that is, spots
                    without umbrae or very highly developed penumbrae. They extend from one pole of
                    the sun to the other; hence there must exist a great difference between metallic
                    and quiet prominences and between disturbed and veiled spots.</p>
                <p>Although the more important of these solar phenomena are limited to certain zones
                    of the sun’s surface, and although they vary very violently, they have a cycle
                    or regular succession of changes, during which the particular zone of the sun on
                    which they appear alters. When there is the smallest number of spots on the
                    sun—that is to say, when there is a sun-spot minimum—the spots that appear are
                    seen in a high latitude, and the latitude decreases gradually until we arrive at
                    the next minimum. Thus there are two perfectly distinct spotted areas, one
                    corresponding to the end of the old period, the other to the beginning of the
                    new period. At the maximum period of sun spots the latitude of the spot zone is
                    about 15°. Activity in the solar atmosphere, therefore, appears to begin in a
                    high latitude—say about 30° or 35°—and very soon reaches the maximum in about
                    latitude 15°; then it gradually dies away until spots, metallic prominences, and
                    faculae—all of reduced intensity—cling pretty near to the solar equator, and at
                    the same time we get a new wave of activity, beginning again in a high latitude.
                    This association of what may be called localized phenomena is quite in harmony
                    with a similar association of phenomena which are more or less generally
                    distributed over the whole surface of the sun.</p>
                <p>Pores, which are in reality nothing but small sun spots, may occur in any part of
                    the sun, and are always accompanied by a slight waviness in the chromosphere.
                    Veiled spots—spots which never attain full development—are also universally
                    distributed over the sun’s surface and are accompanied by small prominences (see
                    below).</p>
                <p>The main periodicity on the sun is that of about eleven years which elapses
                    between two successive maxima or minima. When the sun is quietest, there are
                    very few of the ordinary tree-like prominences visible, and there is an especial
                    dearth of them near the poles and the equator. There are faculae, but they do
                    not present their usual bright appearance, and are confined to the regions
                    between latitudes 20° N. and 20° S. On examining the chemical nature of the
                    materials in the chromosphere at such a period by means of a spectroscope, we
                    see only the four lines of hydrogen and the line D <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    whose chemical significance we do not know. Practically speaking, there are no
                    spots visible and the disk appears to be perfectly pure, except the darkening
                    towards the limb produced by absorption in the sun’s atmosphere. As there are no
                    spots, or only very small ones in high latitudes, it follows that there are no
                    metallic prominences. The spectroscope searching right round the limb of the sun
                    gathers no indications of violent action—no region giving many lines —nothing
                    but the simple spectrum of hydrogen. Observations and photographs of the corona
                    taken at solar eclipses occurring at minimum spot periods indicate that at two
                    different sun-spot minima the appearances presented by the corona are very much
                    alike. A drawing made during the eclipse of 1867, before the application of
                    photography to solar investigations, exhibits a similar appearance to an
                    absolutely trustworthy photograph obtained at the eclipse of 1878. At the
                    minimum period the chief feature is a very great extension of the corona in the
                    direction of the solar equator, and a wonderfully exquisite outcurving right and
                    left at both poles. It is probable that the equatorial extension pictured in the
                    above-mentioned photograph is, after all, only a part of a much more extended
                    phenomenon, one going to almost incredible distances from the sun itself. At the
                    eclipse of 1878 precaution was taken to shield the eye of the observer from the
                    intense light of the inner corona, which is sometimes so bright as to be
                    mistaken for the sun’s limb, by erecting a screen which covered the moon and a
                    space 12' high around it. The observer, Professor Newcomb, saw on both sides of
                    the dark moon a tremendous extension of the sun’s equator, far greater than that
                    recorded in the photographs taken at the same time. But the extended portions
                    may have been so delicately illuminated that they could not impress their image
                    on the photographic plate during the time it was exposed, or that the light
                    itself is poor in chemically active rays. The extension, as observed by the
                    shielded eye, amounted to six or seven times the diameter of the dark moon. In a
                    more favourable situation the same extension, but to a less extent, was observed
                    without the aid of a screen. At a sun-spot minimum, therefore, there exists a
                    great equatorial extension of the corona east and west.</p>
                <p>The time between the minimum and the maximum sunspot periods is three or four
                    years, and that from maximum to minimum seven or eight years, so that the sun
                    increases in activity much more rapidly than it afterwards decreases in passing
                    to the next minimum. Starting, then, about half way between minimum and maximum,
                    we find an increased activity in every direction. The quiet prominences,
                    consisting of hydrogen, are more numerous, and the faculae are brighter. If at
                    this time we examine the spectrum of the chromosphere, we find hydrogen and D
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> are not the only constituents: we get other short
                    lines, the chief being the three lines of magnesium <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic

                    latitude, having moved from near 35° to about 25°. Metallic prominences now
                    constantly accompany the spots; and the number of bright lines visible in their
                    spectra gradually increases from month to month. These changes are accompanied
                    by changes in the corona, which affect not only its form but also its spectrum.
                    At the minimum spot period the corona gives an almost continuous spectrum,
                    differing only in the presence of a few dark lines, and occasionally a few not
                    very obvious bright lines, whence we conclude that at the minimum the corona is
                    not entirely gaseous. In passing from the minimum to the maximum the spectrum is
                    no longer continuous: bright lines begin to appear, emanating from the
                    incandescent gaseous portions of the corona, and at the same time there is an
                    increase in brilliancy. At this period there is no longer any remarkable
                    equatorial extension, although here and there streamers of strange outlines
                    occur. A drawing of the eclipse of 1858, a period between minimum and maximum,
                    shows in middle latitudes, both north and south, four remarkable luminous cones
                    standing with their bases on the chromosphere. The amount of light and structure
                    in the corona has increased to such an extent that the beautiful double curves
                    seen at the poles at the minimum are now hidden in a strong radiance.</p>
                <p>During the maximum period all the solar forces are doing their utmost, and we see
                    in prominences and spots, and indeed in every outcome of action that we can
                    refer to, indications of the most gigantic energies being at work. The ordinary
                    prominences, instead of clinging to<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0676-0649"/> the equator, now occur most frequently at the
                    poles. The faculae are brighter and are more widely distributed, and the
                    chromosphere is richer in lines. The spots at this period occupy broad zones
                    with mean latitudes of about 18° N. and 18° S. There are no spots near the poles
                    and none near the equator; but large spots, indicating a state of violent
                    agitation, surrounded by gigantic faculae, follow each other in these zones.
                    Each of these indicators of solar activity is accompanied by a prominence. At
                    this time also we note the greatest velocities of down-rush in the vapours which
                    form the spots and of up-rush in those which form the prominences. These changes
                    are accompanied by corresponding changes in the corona; and, fortunately, we
                    have photographic records for two periods of maximum,—1871 and 1882. In these
                    the streamers, instead of being limited to the equator or to mid-latitudes,
                    exist in all latitudes, so that they practically extend to every part of the
                    sun. Their directions, which may be called lines of force, are very varied, some
                    being straight and some curved; but it is difficult to unravel the appearances,
                    because what we see are only projections of the actual things, and this is
                    especially the case when the sun’s pole is tipped towards or away from the earth
                    to the greatest extent. In the eclipse of 1882 the corona indicated a more equal
                    distribution of action than that of 1871, but the general result was the
                    same.</p>
                <p>After the maximum period there is a gradual falling off of all the various
                    energies, the mean latitudes of the spots decreasing until they reach 8° N. and
                    8° S.; then another series of spots breaks out about 35° N. and 35° S. lat., and
                    the cycle begins anew.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Theory.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been very generally accepted for some time that sun-spots are depressions
                    in the photosphere, produced by downfalls of cool material. The following sketch
                    shows how, if we accept this view and also the hypothesis that the chemical
                    elements are dissociated in the lower parts of the solar atmosphere, many of the
                    more important solar phenomena may be explained and correlated.</p>
                <p>We know that small meteorites in our own cold atmosphere are heated to
                    incandescence by friction, that is, by the conversion of their kinetic energy
                    into heat, and it is therefore not difficult to imagine that enormous masses,
                    falling with great velocities through the sun’s highly heated atmosphere, would
                    be competent to give rise to such disturbances as those with which we are
                    familiar on the sun’s surface. This cool material is produced by the
                    condensation, in the upper cool regions of the sun’s atmosphere, of the hot
                    ascending vapours produced at the lower levels, and this is probably the main
                    source of supply of spot-producing material. The faculae and other disturbances
                    of the general surface do not precede but follow the formation of a spot, so
                    that a spot may be considered as the initial disturbance of the photosphere in
                    the region where it is observed. Large spots almost invariably appear first as
                    little dots, frequently in groups, and then suddenly grow large. The little
                    dots, according to the view of spot formation now under discussion, are formed
                    by small masses which precede the main fall. The heat produced by friction with
                    the atmosphere and the arrested motion causes up-rushes of heated vapours, which
                    eventually cool and condense, and afterwards fall to the photosphere and produce
                    fresh disturbances. Down-rushes of cool material must take place all over the
                    sun’s surface, and, although the most violent results of such falls are
                    restricted to certain regions, minor disturbances are distributed over the whole
                    surface. These generally distributed phenomena are well known to be merely
                    different degrees of the same kind of energies that operate in producing the
                    more restricted ones.</p>
                <p>We will now review the several phenomena in turn, beginning with the most widely
                    distributed.</p>
                <p>Besides the general darkening near the edge of the sun’s disk, the surface is
                    seen to he strangely mottled near the poles, near the equator, and in fact
                    universally. Moreover, small black specks, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >granulations</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pores,</hi> are everywhere visible, and
                    spectroscopic examination shows that every one of these is a true spot, The fine
                    mottlings frequently indicate the existence of powerful currents in that they
                    take definite directions, sometimes in straight lines, sometimes in lines
                    suggesting cyclonic swirls. In addition to the pores spots of a smudgy kind,
                    called <hi rend="italic">veiled spots,</hi> are sometimes seen, and it is
                    probable that in such cases the force of the down-rush is insufficient to
                    depress the photosphere to an extent competent to give rise to the ordinary dark
                    spots. Some spots appear as large pores, that is, they consist of nothing but
                    umbra; others appear as Well-developed veiled spots, consisting almost entirely
                    of penumbra. The obvious large spots consisting of umbra and penumbra follow
                    next in order of intensity, and, as has been previously pointed out, their
                    appearance is confined to definite spot zones. Minute observation, therefore,
                    shows that the whole of the sun’s surface is traversed by down-rashes of varying
                    intensities, from almost infinitesimal dimensions to the most powerful that we
                    can conceive. Some of the ordinary spots do not appear to be in any violent
                    state of agitation: the penumbra and umbra are well defined, and the ridge of
                    faculae round such a spot does not indicate any disturbance by either lateral or
                    convexion currents. Other spots, however, indicate very violent commotion, the
                    penumbra and umbra being tremendously contorted and mixed up. In this kind of
                    spot the disturbance often affects enormous areas of the sun’s surface; one spot
                    in 1851 was 140,000 miles across, and the commotions were so great that they
                    could be detected by eye observation with the telescope. It appears as if the
                    material carried in the first instance below the level of the photosphere
                    produces a disturbance in the interior regions, which exhibits itself at the
                    surface by an increase in the quantity and brilliancy of the surrounding
                    faculae. As a spot dies away it is replaced by faculae, and these remain long
                    after the spot has closed up. It often happens that new spots break out in the
                    places occupied by previous spots. The spot-producing material in its descent is
                    dissociated either before or when it reaches the photosphere, and the rapidity
                    and energy of the dissociation depend upon the velocity with which it travels.
                    Gravitation is of course the main factor operating in the production of a
                    down-rush. The velocity produced by gravitation in matter falling from great
                    heights above the photosphere must be very great, and in consequence the kinetic
                    energy of the moving mass must also be great. The motion is impeded by friction
                    with the gases in the sun’s atmosphere, and some or perhaps all the kinetic
                    energy becomes heat. The heat thus developed must produce sudden expansions, and
                    the initial down-rash is surrounded by up-rashes along the lines of least
                    resistance. The effects of such down-rashes vary in degree according to the
                    quantity of matter falling and the height from which it falls.</p>
                <p>Equally too there are observed different degrees of the effects of up-rushes. All
                    over the sun’s surface are seen domes of faculae, either separate or in groups,
                    and there is indication that they are hotter than the rest of the surface, for
                    the bright lines of hydrogen are seen to surmount them. It is probably owing to
                    this that the chromosphere exhibits a billowy outline when under conditions of
                    little disturbance. The next condition of increased action exhibits itself in
                    the growing complexity of the chemical nature and of the form of the
                    chromosphere. Occasionally the whole level of the chromosphere over a large
                    region seems to be quietly raised, and observation proves this to be due to the
                    intrusion of other vapours. There is either a gradual evaporation from the
                    photosphere or a gradual vaporization or expansion of slowly falling material
                    over large regions, raising the level of the sea of hydrogen. The chromosphere
                    then appears to contain different layers, and the lower we descend towards the
                    photosphere the less we know about the substances that exist there. The next
                    degree of disturbance is seen in what are called the <hi rend="italic">quiet
                    prominences,</hi> which very frequently occur in regions where the beginning of
                    a disturbance has been previously indicated by the appearance of domes and
                    metallic strata. As a rale the quiet prominences are not very high—not higher
                    than 40,000 miles—and many of them resemble trees. They are almost entirely
                    composed of hydrogen, or at least of a substance which gives some of the lines
                    observed in the spectrum of hydrogen. Such a prominence grows upwards from the
                    photosphere, being first of a small height, then getting higher and often
                    broader, and finally a kind of condensation cloud may form at the top. The
                    upward velocity of the gases forming these prominences is seldom very great.
                    When a prominence disappears it does not follow that tl∣e substances of which it
                    was composed have also disappeared, and there is evidence to show that the
                    apparent disappearance is due to a reduction of temperature. The most intense
                    degree of action of an up-rash is exhibited by the metallic prominences,
                    which<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0677-0650"/> contain other substances in addition to hydrogen.
                    They are seen mounting upwards to enormous heights with almost incredible
                    velocities, aud their ascent is accompanied by violent lateral motions. Such
                    prominences have been seen with an upward velocity of 250 miles a second, and of
                    a height as great as 400,000 miles. There is also evidence that some prominences
                    consist of mixed up-rushes and down-rushes, and it may turn out eventually that
                    this is the case in all the metallic prominences.</p>
                <p>According to the gravitation-dissociation theory of the formation of spots, we
                    ought to find that the effects, in various degrees, produced by down-rushes of
                    associated matter are related to the effects, in like degrees, produced by the
                    corresponding up-rushes of dissociated materials. Comparing, then, the facts
                    already stated, we have :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>It is a fact that the pores and domes are very closely associated over all parts
                    of the sun, and that the domes are most prominent in places previously occupied
                    by spots. All large spots are seen to be accompanied by metallic prominences,
                    when observed at the edge of the sun. There is also a strict relationship
                    between the intensity of action going on in a spot and the associated
                    prominence, so much so that a very violent change in a spot on the disk
                    sometimes causes the bright prominence lines to become visible in its spectrum.
                    The ordinary metallic prominences, as already stated, may consist of both
                    ascending and descending material; this will be best understood by likening the
                    whole phenomenon to a splash.</p>
                <p>We have previously seen that spots and metallic prominences are very intimately
                    connected as regards their occurrence in zones, and this intimacy is easy to
                    explain by supposing things to happen in the way here set forth. The height of
                    the solar atmosphere is greater over the equator than at the poles; particles
                    condensed on the outside at the poles have therefore a relatively small velocity
                    when they fall into the photosphere, and are able to produce only pores or
                    veiled spots. Over the equator the particles attain a higher velocity in their
                    fall, but they also have to pass through a much greater thickness of atmosphere
                    and undergo so much dissociation that on reaching the photosphere they are
                    incompetent to produce spots. In mid-latitudes, therefore, the falls of
                    condensed particles should be most effective in producing spots. In this way the
                    absence of spots at the poles and equator is explained,—one of the best-known
                    facts of solar physics. The falls of the condensed particles, or meteoric
                    matter, iuto the sun increase the temperature of the atmosphere over the spots
                    and prominences which they produce, so that other falls in the same region are
                    not effective in producing spots on account of the increased dissociation which
                    they must undergo before reaching the photosphere. If the material condensed in
                    those regions is to produce a spot, it must be removed to some place where it
                    can reach the photosphere without being dissociated. Hence from the first
                    appearance of spots after a sun-spot minimum there is a continual change of
                    latitude. From minimum to minimum there is a regular decrease in the latitude of
                    spots; hence it is clear that there must be currents from the poles towards the
                    equator in the upper atmosphere of the sun, causing the removal of condensed
                    materials to lower and relatively cooler latitudes. Assuming the existence of
                    such currents, we ought to find that successive spots have a tendency to form
                    along the same meridians, for the polar currents would carry the condensed
                    materials to lower latitudes in a nearly meridional direction. Examination of
                    sun-spot records for 1878-79 shows that there is a marked tendency for spots to
                    follow each other in meridians. The existence of such currents is further
                    supported by the outcurving of the corona at the solar poles as observed in
                    several eclipses. If these currents exist, there must also be compensating
                    currents towards the poles in the lower parts of the sun’s atmosphere, carrying
                    incandescent vapours along with them. Small prominences often give indication of
                    motion towards the poles which such currents would produce, and examination of
                    sun-spot records also shows that the tendency of the proper motion of the spots
                    is polewards. Hence, although the existence of these currents has not been
                    definitely proved, there is strong evidence that there exists some circulation
                    of this nature in the solar atmosphere.</p>
                <p>When once the falls have commenced, if this hypothesis is true, they should
                    rapidly increase in intensity, for, as it is the falls which increase the
                    temperature of the lower atmosphere by the conversion of their kinetic energy
                    into heat, the more falls there are the more material will be taken first to the
                    poles and then towards the equator, and therefore there will be more available
                    spot-forming material. But we know that this increase in intensity does not go
                    on for ever, aud there must therefore be some regulating influence. The in
                    crease of temperature and possibly of the height of the solar atmosphere, due to
                    the increased falls, will eventually become such that the descending materials
                    are dissociated before they reach the photosphere. The production of spots must
                    therefore gradually diminish until they finally disappear and end the spot
                    cycle. At the minimum period, therefore, pores and veiled spots, due to less
                    powerful energies, are at a maximum.</p>
                <p>Records of eclipses, occurring when the sun was quietest, show that the
                    condensing and condensed materials brought to the equator by the polar currents
                    probably extend far beyond the true atmosphere of the sun and are there
                    collected, possibly in the form of a more or less regular ring the section of
                    which widens towards the sun, the widest part being within the boundary of the
                    sun’s atmosphere. If we assume such a ring under absolutely stable conditions,
                    there will be no fall of material, and therefore no prominences or spots. But
                    suppose a disturbance caused, as before, by collisions, whieh most likely occur
                    where the particles brought by the polar currents meet the surface of the ring.
                    These particles then fall from where the ring first meets the atmosphere on to
                    the photosphere, and form the first spots. Eclipse records show that this action
                    takes place about 30° lat. According to this view, there are usually no spots
                    above 30° lat., because there is no ring, and because the atmosphere is too low
                    to give the height of fall necessary to produce spots. There are no spots at the
                    equator for the reason that the condensed matter has to pass for perhaps
                    millions of miles through strata of increasing temperature, and do not therefore
                    reach the photosphere before being dissociated. Accordingly, we ought to find
                    that at and after the maximum the corona is brighter and more truly a gaseous
                    body on account of the increased temperature. This is in strict accordance with
                    eclipse observations extending over twenty years. According to this view of the
                    solar economy, the sun ought to give out more heat at a maximum than at a
                    minimum period, when the number of falls is greatest; on this point see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 167 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi><hi rend="italic">The Sun’s Place among the
                    Stars.</hi></p>
                <p>The relative nearness of the sun makes it convenient as a type of those stars
                    which on account of their great distance are less accessible to minute
                    observation. If the sun were at a greater distance, its spectrum would become
                    much fainter and would not show so much detail, but its general character would
                    not be altered: its dark lines would not become bright ones. In the atmospheres
                    of the various members of the solar system, including the earth, there is a very
                    considerable absorption of blue light. We know also that this condition applies
                    to the sun. The light we receive under present conditions we call white; but, if
                    its own atmosphere and ours were removed or became so changed as to no longer
                    absorb blue light, the sun would appear blue. If, on the other hand, the blue
                    absorption were enormously increased, so that it extended into the green, the
                    sun would appear red, because every other kind of light would be absorbed. If
                    two kinds of absorption—one in the red, the other in the blue —were going on
                    together, as they sometimes do in our laboratories, the sun would then appear
                    green. Although these changes are not of actual occurrence in the sun, we find
                    each of these conditions represented among the stars. In the coloured stars,
                    which may be red, green, or blue, we are simply dealing with this kind of
                    absorption phenomena. This difference in the conditions of absorption in the
                    stars, however, is by no means the most important one: the difference of
                    temperature as indicated by the spectrum is of primary importance. As in our
                    laboratories the spectrum of a substance is changed by a variation of
                    temperature, and always in a regular way, so the nature of a star’s spectrum
                    furnishes a clue to its probable state as regards heat. For example, we may
                    submit carbon vapour to a low temperature, and we shall then obtain what is
                    called a spectrum of flutings; on increasing the temperature, the flutings are
                    replaced wholly or partially by lines, according to the amount of increase. From
                    hundreds of observations of this kind, both on carbon and other substances, it
                    may be safely inferred that a fluted spectrum indicates a lower temperature than
                    a line spectrum. There are doubtless substances in the sun’s atmosphere which,
                    although represented by lines in its<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n678/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0678-0651"/> spectrum, can be submitted to low conditions of
                    temperature so as to give fluted spectra. There can be little doubt, therefore,
                    that a cooling of the sun would be followed by a change in its spectrum, which
                    would cease to be one of lines and become one of flutings. While the sun was
                    acquiring its present intensely heated state, it must at some period of its
                    history have been in a condition of temperature in which its spectrum would
                    consist of flutings, and similarly it must give a fluted spectrum at some future
                    period when it has further cooled.</p>
                <p>The ordinary Fraunhofer spectrum gives the sum total of the line absorptions of
                    all the various layers in the sun’s atmosphere, but by examining individual
                    layers just off the edge of the disk we can single out the absorption lines
                    produced by the lower layers. Thus the absorption produced by the hottest layer,
                    the chromosphere— hottest because nearest the photosphere—is indicated by its
                    usually simple radiation spectrum when examined in this way. If the sun were
                    made hotter, therefore, the gases which give the simple chromosphere spectrum
                    would have a larger share in the absorption, and the main features of the
                    Fraunhofer spectrum would be the few dark lines corresponding to these bright
                    ones. This being so, a star which gives practically the same absorption spectrum
                    as the chromosphere of the sun must be hotter than the average temperature of
                    the sun’s atmosphere,—as hot as the hottest part of it. The bright central part
                    of the sun is not very much less than the whole volume, but it is so much hotter
                    that it gives out thousands of times more light than the atmosphere. The cool
                    vapours in the atmosphere give the dark Fraunhofer lines by their absorption,
                    and even if they are hot enough to give bright lines when seen on the sun’s edge
                    they can only reduce the intensity of the dark lines. Here the difference of
                    area between the disk representing the central mass and that representing the
                    sun’s atmosphere is very small, and, the light from the central mass being so
                    much more intense, we do not ordinarily see the evidences of radiation, but, in
                    place of it, the absorption of the atmosphere. If, however, we suppose the
                    central mass to be very small compared with its atmosphere, the total radiation
                    of the atmosphere may be sufficiently powerful to overcome the intensity of the
                    light from the smaller central part, so that the spectrum of such a star would
                    contain bright lines from the exterior mixed up with the dark lines from the
                    interior. The spectrum of a star, therefore, does not always depend upon its
                    total diameter, but upon the relative diameters of the central mass and the
                    outer atmosphere. It is a question of sectional areas.</p>
                <p>Observations of the spectra of a large number of stars show that, although there
                    is a great difference between individual spectra, they still admit of
                    arrangement in family groups. While some stars give line absorption spectra,
                    others give fluted spectra, and others again give bright lines. They may be
                    conveniently arranged as follows :—</p>

                <p>This classification probably represents the stars in order of temperature, class
                    I. being the hottest.</p>
                <p>Although different stars may contain lines of identical wavelengths, the
                    thickness of these lines is very liable to variation in passing from one star to
                    another. The thickest lines in the solar spectrum are H and K in the
                    ultra-violet, both of equal thickness; on passing to some of the stars, however,
                    we find H broad with K thin, and in others H without K. This is similar to what
                    occurs in our laboratories when we study the spectrum of calcium, the substance
                    which gives the lines H and K: at the temperature of the electric arc the blue
                    line of calcium is very intense, while H and K are scarcely visible; but on
                    passing to a higher temperature, that of the induction spark, H and K appear. In
                    those stars which give H without K, namely, those in class I., it is probable
                    that there is a very high temperature competent to separate H and K, just as H
                    and K were conjointly separated from the blue line. A further indication of high
                    temperature in the stars belonging to class I. is that the few lines which do
                    occur in their spectra are almost the exact counterparts of those which occur in
                    the hottest layer of the sun, hydrogen lines being especially prominent. The
                    passage from class I. to class II. is by no means sudden: there are stars with
                    every gradation of broad and fine lines. It will readily be understood that the
                    stars of class II. are probably not so hot as those belonging to class I., and
                    the change in the spectrum is supposed to be due to new combinations of the
                    original substances, rendered possible by a reduction of temperature; that is,
                    new lines are formed at the expense of the old ones. The hydrogen lines are very
                    prominent in class II., though not so intense as in class I. The stars of these
                    two classes may be grouped together and called hydrogen stars. Stars belonging
                    to class III. exhibit unmistakable evidence of carbon vapour. Sodium and iron
                    are also often present. All the stars in this class, of which fifty-five are
                    known, agree in having a reddish tint. They are usually faint, and seldom exceed
                    the fourth magnitude. There is evidence of the existence of carbon vapour in the
                    sun’s atmosphere, depending upon one solitary fluting, and hence stars of this
                    class probably represent what the sun would become if it were cooled. Class III.
                    therefore represents a lower temperature than classes II. and I. Class IV.,
                    containing 475 known members, includes the stars giving fluted spectra with the
                    darkest edges of the flutings towards the violet. The origin of the substances
                    of which they are mainly composed is not at present known. All the principal
                    bands are absolutely unchanging in position, although there is considerable
                    variation in the intensities. The bands in the spectrum appear to result from
                    the rhythmical vibrations of the same substance, probably a complex one. Besides
                    this unknown substance, there are also metallic lines in many of the stars, the
                    complete spectrum consisting of the banded spectrum superposed upon the line
                    spectrum. The metallic lines are generally seen in the spectra of sodium, iron,
                    magnesium, or calcium; the hydrogen lines are very inconspicuous.</p>
                <p>These considerations suggest the question of stellar evolution. Comets and
                    nebulae are now supposed to consist of clouds of stones or small meteorites, and
                    the difference between their spectra may be due to a difference of temperature,
                    that of the nebulae being highest. Comets ordinarily give the spectrum of
                    carbon, and, if we imagine such cometary matter to surround a central bright
                    nucleus, we have the spectrum of a star of the third class. On the nebular
                    hypothesis, starting with ordinary cometary materials, the small masses
                    resulting from the first condensations gravitate towards each other, and their
                    energy becomes heat by the retardation of their motion on coming in contact. As
                    soon as the condensed mass is hot enough, it gives a fluted spectrum, like stars
                    of the third class. As the energy of condensation increases, the temperature is
                    raised and the spectrum passes from that of a third class star to that of a
                    second class star, and then to that of a first class star. On the subsequent
                    cooling of what is then a star the successive stages will be again passed
                    through in inverse order. According to this view, we ought to find fewer
                    hydrogen stars than carbon stars, because every star is a carbon star at two
                    periods of its existence, but a hydrogen star only once. On this point, however,
                    nothing definite can be stated, as the stars of classes I. and II. have, in
                    consequence of their greater brightness, received more attention than carbon
                    stars.</p>
                <p>In 1866 a star of the tenth magnitude in the constellation Corona suddenly
                    flashed up iuto a star of nearly the first magnitude; its spectrum as a tenth
                    magnitude star differed from its spectrum as a first or second,—the latter
                    containing bright lines of hydrogen. In about a month it again became a tenth
                    magnitude star and appeared as if nothing had happened to it. There can be
                    little doubt that here there was a sudden increase of temperature, as evidenced
                    by the spectrum becoming like that of the chromosphere of the sun. Ten years
                    afterwards a new star appeared in Cygnus; it had never been seen before, but
                    appeared suddenly as a third or fourth magnitude star. In about a year it
                    gradually dwindled down to the tenth magnitude, and its spectrum became that of
                    a nebula. This mass was at a stellar distance, but it cannot be considered to
                    have been a large mass of incandescent material, for in that case it would have
                    taken millions of years, instead of only one, to cool down to the tenth
                    magnitude. A possible explanation of most of the new and variable stars is to be
                    found in the meteorite theory: the innumerable components of one group of
                    meteorites colliding with those of another group would be competent to give out
                    light sufficient to make the whole appear as a star. Each meteorite gives only a
                    little light, but the total must be very considerable. The new star in Corona,
                    and similarly all new stars, may have been the result of a collision of two
                    groups of meteorites. They die out quickly because the components are small and
                    far apart. The sudden increase in the brilliancy of the star in Cygnus would be
                    produced by a collision of a meteor swarm with the star already existing. (J. N.
