                    (1622-1683), was the second son of Robert, second earl of Leicester, and of
                    Dorothy Percy, daughter of Henry, earl of Northumberland, and was born at
                    Penshurst, Kent, in 1622. As a boy he showed much talent, which was carefully
                    trained under his father’s eye. In 1632 with his elder brother he accompanied
                    his father on his mission as ambassador extraordinary to Christian IV. of
                    Denmark, whom he saw at Rendsburg. In May 1636 Sidney went with his father to
                    Paris, where he became a general favourite, and from there to Rome. In October
                    1641 he was given a troop in his father’s regiment in Ireland, of which his
                    brother, Lord Lisle, was in command. In August 1643 the brothers returned to
                    England. At Chester their horses were taken by the Royalists, whereupon they
                    again put out to sea and landed at Liverpool. Here they were detained by the
                    Parliamentary commissioners, and by them sent up to London for safe custody.
                    Whether this was intended by Sidney or no, it is certain that from this time he
                    ardently attached himself to the Parliamentary cause. On 10th May 1644 he was
                    made captain of horse in Manchester’s army, under the Eastern Association. He
                    was shortly afterwards made lieutenant-colonel, and charged at the head of his
                    regiment at Marston Moor (2d July), where he was wounded and rescued with
                    difficulty. On 2d April 1645 he was given the command of a cavalry regiment in
                    Cromwell’s division of Fairfax’s army, was appointed governor of Chichester on
                    10th May, and in December was returned to parliament for Cardiff. In July 1646
                    his regiment was ordered to Ireland, and he was made lieutenant-general of horse
                    in that kingdom and governor of Dublin. Leaving London on 1st February 1647,
                    Sidney arrived at Cork on the 22d. He was soon (8th April), however, recalled by
                    a resolution of the House passed through the interest of Lord Inchiquin. On 7th
                    May he received the thanks of the House of Commons. On 13th October 1648 he was
                    made lieutenant of Dover castle, of which he had previously been appointed
                    governor. He was at this time identified with the Independents as opposed to the
                    Presbyterian party. He was nominated one of the commissioners to try Charles I.,
                    but took no part in the trial, retiring to Penshurst until sentence was
                    pronounced. That Sidney approved of the trial, though not of the sentence, there
                    can, however, be little doubt, for in Copenhagen he publicly and vigorously
                    expressed his concurrence. On 15th May 1649 he was a member of the committee for
                    settling the succession and for regulating the election of future parliaments.
                    Sidney lost the governorship of Dover, however, in March 1651, in consequence,
                    apparently, of a quarrel with his officers. He then went to The Hague, where he
                    quarrelled with Lord Oxford at play, and a duel was only prevented by their
                    friends. He returned to England in the autumn, and henceforward took an active
                    share in parliamentary work. On 25th November Sidney was elected on the council
                    of state and was evidently greatly considered. In the usurpation of Cromwell,
                    however, he utterly refused all concurrence, nor would he leave his place in
                    parliament except by force when Cromwell dispersed it on 19th April 1653. He
                    immediately retired to Penshurst, where he was concerned chiefly with family
                    affairs. In 1654 he again went to The Hague, and there became closely acquainted
                    with De Witt. On his return he kept entirely aloof from public affairs, and it
                    is to this period that the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Love</hi> is ascribed.</p>
                <p>Upon the restoration of the Long Parliament, 7th May<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0049-0034"/> 1659, Sidney again took his seat, and was
                    placed on the council of state. He showed himself in this office especially
                    anxious that the military power should be duly subordinated to the civil. On 5th
                    June he was appointed one of three commissioners to mediate for a peace between
                    Denmark supported by Holland and Sweden. He was probably intended to watch the
                    conduct of Montague, who was in command of the Baltic squadron. Of his character
                    we have an interesting notice from Whitelocke, who refused to accompany him on
                    the ground of his “overruling temper and height.” Upon the conclusion of the
                    treaty he went to Stockholm as plenipotentiary; and in both capacities he
                    behaved with resolution and address. When the restoration of Charles II. took
                    place Sidney left Sweden, 28th June 1660, bringing with him from the king of
                    Sweden a rich present in testimony of the estimation in which he was held.
                    Sidney went first to Copenhagen, and then, being doubtful of his reception by
                    the English court, settled at Hamburg. From there he wrote a celebrated letter
                    vindicating his conduct, which will be found in the Somers <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tracts.</hi> He shortly afterwards left Hamburg, and passed through Germany
                    by way of Venice to Rome. His stay there, however, was embittered by
                    misunderstandings with his father and consequent straits for money. Five
                    shillings a day, he says, served him and two men very well for meat, drink, and
                    firing. He devoted himself to the study of books, birds, and trees, and speaks
                    of his natural delight in solitude being largely increased. In 1663 he left
                    Italy, passed through Switzerland, where he visited Ludlow, and came to Brussels
                    in September, where his portrait was painted by Van Egmondt; it is now at
                    Penshurst. He had thoughts of joining the imperial service, and offered to
                    transport from England a body of the old Commonwealth men; but this was refused
                    by the English court. It is stated that the enmity against him was so great that
                    now, as on other occasions, attempts were made to assassinate him. On the
                    breaking out of the Dutch war Sidney, who was at The Hague, urged an invasion of
                    England, and shortly afterwards went to Paris, where he offered to raise a
                    rebellion in England on receipt of 100,000 crowns. Unable, however, to come to
                    terms with the French Government, he once more went into retirement in
                    1666,—this time to the south of France. In August 1670 he was again in Paris,
                    and Arlington proposed that he should receive a pension from Louis; Charles II.
                    agreed, but insisted that Sidney should return to Languedoc. In illustration of
                    his austere principles it is related that, Louis having taken a fancy to a horse
                    belonging to him and insisting on possessing it, Sidney shot the animal, which,
                    he said, “was born a free creature, had served a free man, and should not be
                    mastered by a king of slaves.” His father was now very ill, and after much
                    difficulty Sidney obtained leave to come to England in the autumn of 1677. Lord
                    Leicester died in November; and legal business connected with other portions of
                    the succession detained Sidney from returning to France as he had intended. He
                    soon became involved in political intrigue, joining, in general, the country
                    party, and holding close communication with Barillon, the French ambassador. In
                    the beginning of 1679 he stood for Guildford, and was warmly supported by
                    William Penn, with whom he had long been intimate, and to whom he afforded
                    assistance in drawing up the constitution of Pennsylvania. He was defeated by
                    court influence, and his petition to the House, complaining of an undue return,
                    never came to a decision. His <hi rend="italic">Letters to Henry Sarnie,</hi>
                    written at this period, are of great interest. He was in Paris, apparently only
                    for a short while, in November 1679. Into the prosecution of the Popish Plot
                    Sidney threw himself warmly, and was among those who looked to Monmouth, rather
                    than to</p>
                <p>Orange, to take the place of James in the succession, though he afterwards
                    disclaimed all interest in such a question. He now stood for Bramber (Sussex),
                    again with Penn’s support, and a double return was made. He is reported on 10th
                    August 1679 as being elected for Amersham (Buckingham) with Sir Roger Hill. When
                    parliament met, however, in October 1680, his election was declared void. But
                    now, under the idea that an alliance between Charles and Orange would be more
                    hostile to English liberty than would the progress of the French arms, he acted
                    with Barillon in influencing members of parliament in this sense, and is twice
                    mentioned as receiving the sum of 500 guineas from the ambassador. Of this there
                    is no actual proof, and it is quite possible that Barillon entered sums in his
                    accounts with Louis which he never paid away. In any case it is to be remembered
                    that Sidney is not charged with receiving money for advocating opinions which he
                    did not enthusiastically hold.</p>
                <p>Upon the dissolution of the last of Charles’s parliaments the king issued a
                    justificatory declaration. This was at once answered by a paper entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">A Just and Modest Vindication, &amp;c.,</hi> the first sketch
                    of which is imputed to Sidney. It was then, too, that his most celebrated
                    production, the <hi rend="italic">Discourses concerning Government,</hi> was
                    concluded, in which he upholds the doctrine of the mutual compact and traverses
                    the High Tory positions from end to end. In especial he vindicates the propriety
                    of resistance to kingly oppression or misrule, upholds the existence of an
                    hereditary nobility interested in their country’s good as the firmest barrier
                    against such oppression, and maintains the authority of parliaments. In each
                    point the English constitution, which he ardently admires, is, he says,
                    suffering: the prerogatives of the crown are disproportionately great; the
                    peerage has been degraded by new creations; and parliaments are slighted.</p>
                <p>For a long while Sidney kept himself aloof from the duke of Monmouth, to whom he
                    was introduced by Lord Howard. After the death of Shaftesbury, however, in
                    November 1682, he entered into the conferences held between Monmouth, Russell,
                    Essex, Hampden, and others. That treasonable talk went on seems certain, but it
                    is probable that matters went no further. The watchfulness of the court was,
                    however, aroused, and on the discovery of the Rye House Plot, Sidney, who had
                    always been regarded in a vague way as dangerous, was arrested while at dinner
                    on 26th June 1683. His papers were carried off, and he was sent at once to the
                    Tower on a charge of high treason. For a considerable while no evidence could be
                    found on which to establish a charge. Jeffreys, however, was made lord
                    chief-justice in September; a jury was packed; and, after consultations between
                    the judge and the crown lawyers, Sidney was brought to listen to the indictment
                    on 7th November. The trial, which began on 21st November, was conducted with a
                    shameless absence of equity: Sidney was refused a copy of the indictment, in
                    direct violation of law, and—more shameful still—he was refused the assistance
                    of counsel. Hearsay evidence and the testimony of the perjured informer Lord
                    Howard, whom Sidney had been instrumental in introducing to his friends, were
                    first produced. This being insufficient, partial extracts from papers found in
                    Sidney’s study, and supposed only to be in his handwriting, in which the
                    lawfulness of resistance to oppression was upheld, were next relied on. He was
                    indicted for “conspiring and compassing the death of the king.” Sidney conducted
                    his case throughout with great skill; he pointed especially to the fact that
                    Lord Howard, whose character he easily tore to shreds, was the only witness
                    against him as to treason, whereas the law required two, that the treason was
                    not accurately defined, that no proof had been given that the papers produced<pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n50/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0050-0035"/> were his, and that, even if that were proved,
                    these papers were in no way connected with the charge. Against the determination
                    to secure a conviction, however, his courage, eloquence, coolness, and skill
                    were of no avail, and the verdict of “guilty” was given. On 25th November Sidney
                    presented a petition to the king, praying for an audience, which, however, under
                    the influence of James and Jeffreys, Charles refused. On the 26th he was brought
                    up for judgment, and again insisted on the illegality of his conviction. Upon
                    hearing his sentence he gave vent to his feelings in a few noble and beautiful
                    words. Jeffreys having suggested that his mind was disordered, he held out his
                    hand and bade the chief-justice feel how calm and steady his pulse was. By the
                    advice of his friends he presented a second petition, offering, if released, to
                    leave the kingdom at once and for ever. The supposed necessity, however, of
                    checking the hopes of Monmouth’s partisans, caused the king to be inexorable.
                    The last days of Sidney’s life were spent in drawing up his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apology</hi> and in discourse with Independent ministers. He was beheaded
                    on the morning of 7th December 1683. His remains were buried at Penshurst. (o.
