                <p><label type="entry">SKATING</label>, as at present practised, may be defined as a
                    mode of progression (usually rapid) upon smooth ice, by the aid of steel blades
                    attached to the soles of the feet. It probably originated in the far north of
                    Europe, in Scandinavia and Germany, where it is still in common use. In Russia
                    it has never been a national pastime, as no smooth ice is formed in the rapidly
                    running rivers. Even in St Petersburg it is mainly engaged in by English and
                    Germans. The earliest skates appear to have been certain bones of large animals,
                    but wood was also used from an early period.</p>
                <p>In modern skating there are two totally distinct styles, which require different
                    skates differently attached to the feet, and different extents and qualities of
                    ice. The first, the “running” or “fen” style, simply consists in going straight
                    ahead at the highest possible speed. Its home is on the fiords of Scandinavia,
                    the fens of Lincolnshire, and the large rivers and lakes of North America. In
                    Holland, Denmark, and North America it is the medium for carrying a large winter
                    market traffic. It first became common in England in 1662 after the return of
                    the Stuarts. The wooden part or stock of a running skate is from 8 to 12 inches
                    long, according to the length of the foot. The blade is made of the best steel,
                    with an average width of <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    32</hi> inch. The heel is at right angles to the surface of the ice. The prow
                    begins to rise off the ice at the fore end of the stock, at a gradually
                    increasing angle, and projects 4 inches. The entire skate is attached to the
                    foot by an iron screw in the heel of the stock which enters the skater’s boot
                    heel and two long straps which pass through slots in the stock and fasten round
                    the ankle and toes of the skater. The length of the heel strap varies from 22 to
                    32 inches, and that of the toe strap from 15 to 23 inches. Formerly the bottoms
                    of the blades were fluted. A concavity is now effected by grinding; and, when in
                    motion, the blade is rarely flat on the ice. The curve should be slight, and the
                    depth<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n120/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0120-0105"/> no greater than will ensure a curve being made
                    without touching the ice. The feet are placed at right angles to each other with
                    the toes turned out and the body bent slightly forward. Each foot is then raised
                    alternately and set down slightly on the inside edge. It immediately acquires a
                    forward motion, which is increased by pushing with the other foot, that being at
                    right angles and having no sliding motion. The feet must be kept perfectly level
                    when raised and set down, and the skate carried in the same manner an inch above
                    the ice when going forward. The forward stroke is made on the outer edge, and
                    the pressure applied to the inner edge of the other foot. The arms are swung
                    across the chest from side to side, and opposite to the direction of the
                    striking leg in order to balance the weight. The quickest method of stopping is
                    to place the feet parallel, dig the heels into the ice, and arch the back. A
                    longer but more graceful method is to turn the toes inwards, thus spreading the
                    outside edges athwart the line of going. The feet should never be looked at, as
                    the balance of the body is thereby disturbed. The eye should always be on a line
                    with the horizon.</p>
                <p>The fastest skating times recorded, from a standing start, and with no rear wind,
                    have all been made in the United States, at New York, as follows:—100 yards, 10

                    4 h. 13 m. 36 s. The best running high jump on skates recorded is 3 ft. 1 ¾ in.,
                    and running long jump 15 ft. 2 in.</p>
                <p>The second style, termed “figure skating,” is quite modern and purely English in
                    its origin. This may be practised on any small pond, provided the ice is clear
                    of snow and perfectly smooth. The more numerous opportunities thus afforded make
                    it the more popular style in Great Britain, where the large streams seldom
                    freeze. Figure skating consists in cutting arcs, circles, figures, letters,
                    serpentines, and spirals,—either forwards or backwards, slowly or rapidly, on
                    one or both feet, singly or in combination. The style can ultimately be analysed
                    into four kinds of strokes, all made on the edges of the blade— the inside
                    forward, the outside forward, the inside backward, and the outside backward. The
                    variety of evolutions which can be developed from these four movements is
                    endless. The figure skate is made entirely of metal, is strapless and fixed to
                    the boots by clamps or like devices. Unlike the running skate, it can be
                    instantly put on or taken off. Many kinds have been invented, but the “Acme,”
                    first produced in Canada, is generally acknowledged the best. The blade projects
                    the merest trifle beyond the length of the foot and is rounded off in an upward
                    direction from the ice at both toe and heel. The bottom is ¼ inch wide, and the
                    best curve for grinding it is to that of a seven-foot radius, equal throughout
                    and not increased at either end. In stopping, the end of one skate is placed at
                    right angles to the other.</p>
                <p>Summer skating has been occasionally provided in “glaciariums” by means of
                    artificially produced ice.</p>
                <p>The London Skating Club, founded in 1830, is the leading skating society of Great
                    Britain. Comprising hut 170 members, including 20 ladies, and practising on
                    exclusively private water in Regent’s Park, it countenances figure skating only
                    and gives no encouragement whatever to the spread or teaching of a national
                    pastime. The National Skating Association was formed in the year 1879, and, on
                    December 8, held the first race for the running championship at Thorney,
                    Cambridgeshire. The objects of the association are as follows :—</p>
                <p>To promote, ascertain, and reward speed in skating,—by the establishment and
                    management of amateur and open skating championships of England; by stimulating
                    and supplementing local action in holding of skating matches; by establishing an
                    order of merit for speed skaters, and awarding badges for the same; by assisting
                    in providing facilities for skating by the shallow flooding of land in each
                    locality where local branches exist; and by collecting through corresponding
                    members information of the existence of ice on which skating is practicable, and
                    the supplying of such information to its members; and to promote and encourage
                    figure skating, by the establishment of standards at which figure skaters may
                    aim, by bestowing badges of merit on those who attain these standards, and by
                    promoting and assisting in the formation of skating clubs. To provide rules and
                    regulations for the game of hockey on the ice. Also to promote the establishment
                    of international skating contests in various countries under the direction of an
                    international council.</p>
                <p>In the United States and Canada large and shallow artificial ponds under cover,
                    termed “rinks,” are in winter frozen by filling them with water. Each night the
                    surface is covered with a layer of water, which gives a fresh sheet of ice by
                    morning. The covers protect the rinks from snow, another great advantage.</p>
                <p>As regards a substitute for ice and ice skating on wooden or asphalt floors, the
                    only invention that has ever been found even partially successful is that of
                    James L. Plimpton of New York in 1869. The implements may be described as skates
                    with two parallel wheels at the toe and heel, so hung that the wheel axles are
                    moved out of parallel by the transverse rocking of the skater’s foot, the wheels
                    setting squarely on the surface whether the skater be upright or canted. The
                    fatigue caused by these “roller skates” is quadruple that of ordinary ice
                    skating.</p>
