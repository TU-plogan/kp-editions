                    father, Dr Jesper Svedberg, subsequently professor of theology at Upsala and
                    bishop of Skara, was a pious, learned, and a brave man, who did not escape the
                    charge of heterodoxy, and believed himself to be in constant intercourse with
                    angels. Emanuel shared as a child his father’s piety, and his parents thought
                    that “angels spoke through him.” His education embraced the Latin, Greek, and
                    Hebrew languages, and, above all, mathematics with the natural sciences, but
                    seems to have been curiously defective in theology. Endowed with unusual
                    intellectual powers and an iron constitution, he acquired vast stores of
                    learning in all those branches. Having completed his university course at
                    Upsala, in 1710 he commenced the customary European tour, visiting England,
                    Holland, France, and Germany, studying especially natural philosophy, though
                    alternating it with the composition of Latin verses, little of the poet as there
                    was in his nature. In 1715 he returned to Upsala, and devoted himself to natural
                    science and various engineering works. From 1716 to 1718 he published a
                    scientific periodical, called <hi rend="italic">Daedalus Hyperboreus,</hi> a
                    record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. In 1716 he was
                    introduced to Charles XII., who appointed him assessor in the Swedish college of
                    mines. Two years later he distinguished himself at the king’s siege of
                    Frederikshall by the invention of machines for the transport of boats and
                    galleys overland from Stromstadt to Iddefjord, a distance of 14 English miles.
                    The same year he published various mathematical and mechanical works. At the
                    death of</p>
                <p>Charles XII. Queen Ulrica elevated him and his family to the rank of nobility, by
                    which his name was changed from Svedberg to Swedenborg. The next years were
                    devoted to the duties and studies connected with his office, which involved the
                    visitation of the Swedish, Saxon, Bohemian, and Austrian mines. In 1724 he was
                    offered the chair of mathematics in the university of Upsala, which he declined.
                    Gradually his inquiring and philosophical mind led him to wider studies than
                    those of his profession. As early as 1721 he was seeking to lay the foundation
                    of a scientific explanation of the universe, when he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Prodromus Principiorum Kerum Naturalium</hi> and had already
                    written his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> in its first form. Thirteen years
                    later, in 1734, appeared in three volumes <hi rend="italic">Opera Philosophica
                    et Mineralia,</hi> the first volume of which (his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia)</hi> contained his view of the first principles of the universe, a
                    curious mechanical and geometrical theory of the origin of things. The same year
                    followed <hi rend="italic">Prodromus Philosophiae ratiocinantis de Infinito et
                    Causa Finali Creationis,</hi> which treats of the relation of the finite to the
                    infinite and of the soul to the body, seeking to establish a nexus in each case
                    as a means of overcoming the difficulty of their relation. From this time he
                    applied himself to the problem of discovering the nature of soul and spirit by
                    means of anatomical studies. He travelled in Germany, France, and Italy in quest
                    of the most eminent teachers and the best books dealing with the human frame,
                    and published, as the results of his inquiries, among other works, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeconomia Regni Animalis</hi> (London, 1740-41) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Regnum Animale</hi> (The Hague, 1744-45, London, 1745). But a
                    profound change was coming over<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0790-0759"/> him, which was to make of the scientific inquirer
                    the supernaturalist prophet. Neither by geometrical, nor physical, nor
                    metaphysical principles had he succeeded in reaching and grasping the infinite
                    and the spiritual, or in elucidating their relation to man and man’s organism,
                    though he had caught glimpses of facts and methods which he thought only
                    required confirmation and development. Late in life he wrote to Oetinger that
                    “he was introduced by the Lord first into the natural sciences, and thus
                    prepared, and, indeed, from the year 1710 to 1744, when heaven was opened to
                    him.” This latter great event is described by him as “the opening of his
                    spiritual sight,” “the manifestation of the Lord to him in person,” “his
                    introduction into the spiritual world.” Before his illumination he had been
                    instructed by dreams, and enjoyed •extraordinary visions, and heard mysterious
                    conversations. According to his own account, the Lord filled him with His spirit
                    to teach the doctrines of the New Church by the word from Himself; He
                    commissioned him to do this work, opened the sight of his spirit, and so let him
                    into the spiritual world, permitting him to see the heavens and the hells, and
                    to converse with angels and spirits for years; but he never received anything
                    relating to the doctrines of the church from any angel but from the Lord alone
                    while he was reading the word (<hi rend="italic">True Christian Religion,</hi>
                    No. 779). He elsewhere speaks of his office as principally an opening of the
                    spiritual sense of the word. His friend Robsahm reports, from Swedenborg’s own
                    account to him, the circumstances of the first extraordinary revelation of the
                    Lord, when He appeared to him and said, “I am God the Lord, the Creator and
                    Redeemer of the world. I have chosen thee to unfold the spiritual sense of the
                    Holy Scripture. I will Myself dictate to thee what thou shalt write.” From that
                    time he gave up all worldly learning, and laboured solely to expound spiritual
                    things. But it was some time before he became quite at home in the spiritual
                    world. In the year 1747 he resigned his post of assessor of the college of mines
                    that he might devote himself to his higher vocation, requesting only to be
                    allowed to receive as a pension the half of his salary. He took up afresh his
                    study of Hebrew, and began his voluminous works on the interpretation of the
                    Scriptures. The principal of these is the <hi rend="italic">Arcana
                    Coelestia</hi> in eight quarto volumes, which he printed in London between 1749
                    and 1756, professing to have derived the whole of it by direct illumination from
                    the Almighty Himself, and not from any spirit or angel. His later work <hi
                    rend="italic">De Caelo et de Inferno</hi> (London, 1758) consists of extracts
                    and portions of the <hi rend="italic">Arcana.</hi> His MS. work <hi
                    rend="italic">Apocalypsis Explicata,</hi> expounding the doctrines of the New
                    Church, was prepared in 1757-59. In 1763 appeared his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sapientia Angelica de Divino Amore et de Divina Sapientia,</hi> containing the
                    most philosophical brief account of the principles of the New Church. The long
                    list of his subsequent writings will be found in the works mentioned below. His
                    life from 1747 was spent alternately in Sweden, Holland, and London, in the
                    composition of his works and their publication, till his death, which took place
                    in London, March 29, 1772.</p>
                <p>He was a man who won the respect, confidence, and love of all who came into
                    contact with him. Though people might disbelieve in his visions, they feared to
                    ridicule them in his presence. His manner of life was simple in the extreme; his
                    diet consisted chiefly of bread and milk and large quantities of coffee. He paid
                    no attention to the distinction of day and night, and sometimes lay for days
                    together in a trance, while his servants were often disturbed at night by
                    hearing what he called his conflicts with evil spirits. But his intercourse with
                    spirits was often perfectly calm, in broad daylight, and with all his faculties
                    awake. Three extraordinary instances are produced by his friends and followers
                    in proof of his seership and admission into the unseen world. But there exists
                    no account at first hand of the exact facts, and Swedenborg’s own reference to
                    one of these instances admits of another explanation than the supernatural one.
                    The philosopher Kant was struck by them in 1763, but in 1765, after further
                    inquiries, con cluded that two of them had “uo other foundation than common
                    report <hi rend="italic">(gemeine Sage).”</hi> See Kehrbach’s edition of Kant’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Träume eines Geistersehers</hi> (Leipsic, 1880).</p>
                <p>Swedenborg’s theosophic system is most briefly and comprehensively presented in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Divine Love and Divine Wisdom.</hi> Tho point of view from
                    which God must be regarded is that of His being the Divine Man. His <hi
                    rend="italic">esse</hi> is infinite love; His manifestation, form, or body is
                    infinite wisdom. Divine love is the self-subsisting life of the universe. From
                    God emanates a divine sphere, which appears in the spiritual world as a sun, and
                    from this spiritual sun again proceeds the sun of the natural world. The
                    spiritual sun is the source of love and intelligence, or life, and the natural
                    sun the source of nature, or the receptacles of life; the first is alive, the
                    second dead. The two worlds of nature and spirit are perfectly distinct, but
                    they are intimately related by analogous substances, laws, and forces. Each has
                    its atmospheres, waters, and earths, but in the one they are natural and in the
                    other spiritual. In God there are three infinite and uncreated "degrees” of
                    being, and in man and all things corresponding three degrees, finite and
                    created. They are love, wisdom, use; or end, cause, and effect. The final ends
                    of all things are in the Divine Mind, the causes of all things in the spiritual
                    world, and their effects in the natural world. By a love of each degree man
                    comes into conjunction with them and the worlds of nature, spirit, and God. The
                    end of creation is that man may have this conjunction and become the image of
                    his Creator and creation. In man are two receptacles for God,—the will for
                    divine love and the understanding for divine wisdom, —that love aud wisdom
                    flowing into both so that they become human. Before the fall this influx was
                    free and unhindered, and the conjunction of man with God and the creation
                    complete, but from that time the connexion was interrupted and God had to
                    interpose by successive dispensations. At last the power and influence of the
                    spirits of darkness, with whom man associates himself by his sin, became so
                    great that the existence of the human race was threatened, and Jehovah was
                    necessitated to descend into nature to restore the connexion between Himself and
                    man. He could not come in His unveiled Divinity, for the “hells” would have then
                    perished, whom he did not seek to destroy but only to subjugate. Another purpose
                    of Jehovah’s incarnation was the manifestation of His divine love more fully
                    than ever before. Swedenborg wholly rejects the orthodox doctrine of atonement;
                    and the unity of God, as opposed to his idea of the trinity of the church, is an
                    essential feature of his teaching. Another distinctive feature is that Jehovah
                    did not go back to heaven without leaving behind Him a visible representative of
                    Himself in the word of the Scripture. This word is an eternal incarnation, with
                    its threefold sense—natural, spiritual, celestial. And Swedenborg is the
                    divinely commissioned expounder of this threefold sense of the word, and so the
                    founder of the New Church, the paraclete of the last dispensation. That he might
                    perceive and understand the spiritual and the celestial senses of the word he
                    enjoyed immediate revelation from the Lord, was admitted into the angelic world,
                    and had committed to him the key of “correspondences” with which to unlock the
                    divine treasures of wisdom. Swedenborg claimed also to have learnt by his
                    admission into the spiritual world the true states of men in the next life, the
                    scenery and occupations of heaven and hell, the time doctrine of Providence, the
                    origin of evil, the sanctity and perpetuity of marriage, and to have been a
                    witness of the “last judgment,” or the second coming of the Lord, which took
                    place in the year 1757. It was then that the New Church, or the New Jerusalem,
                    was inaugurated, and Swedenborg claimed to be the divinely appointed prophet and
                    teacher of its doctrines, and maintained that his revelations excel all that
                    preceded them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Swcdenborgianism.—</hi> Swedenborgianism, as professed by
                    Swedenborg’s followers, is based on the belief of Swedenborg’s claims to have
                    witnessed the last judgment, or the second advent of the Lord, with the
                    inauguration of the New Church through the new system of doctrine promulgated by
                    him and derived from the Scriptures, into the true sense of which he was the
                    first to be introduced. The doctrines of the New Church are those of the
                    internal sense of the word as revealed to Swedenborg, who received them iuto his
                    understanding and published them through the press and not as a preacher. They
                    are briefly—(1) that the Lord Jesus Christ is the only God, that in Him there is
                    the Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Father being His infinite divine
                    nature or soul, the Son His glorified human nature or divine body, and the Holy
                    Spirit the life proceeding from His divine humanity for the salvation of man;
                    (2) that the Father in His eternal humanity descended as the Lord Jesus Christ
                    to the earth, assuming fallen human nature, that in it he might conquer hell and
                    deliver mankind from its influence; (3) that the Sacred Scriptures are the true
                    word of God, accommodated to the understanding of angels and men, and
                    constituting the perpetual medium between heaven and the church, the law of
                    correspondence having been revealed by the Lord to Swedenborg as the key for
                    their interpretation; (4) that man is not saved by faith alone but by a life
                    according to the word, the summary of which is the decalogue; (5) that heaven is
                    made up of those who<pb break="no"

                    kingdom, and hell of those who love themselves and the world; (6) that the
                    spiritual world—heaven and hell—holds the same relation to the natural world and
                    its inhabitants as the soul to the body, being in and around the natural world
                    and its life, and that after the death of the body the spirit continues to live
                    in the spiritual world it had previously though unconsciously inhabited.
                    Swedenborgians now constitute a widely spread and considerable society, with a
                    regularly constituted ecclesiastical organization and a zealous missionary
                    activity. Soon after Swedenborg’s death students of his works in England and
                    Sweden began to translate them from the Latin and to spread his views. First in
                    time and activity amongst these early Swedenborgians was the Rev. John Clowes,
                    rector of St John’s, Manchester, who translated the whole of several treatises.
                    The first public meeting of Swedenborgians, from which dates the foundation of
                    the society, was held in London December 5, 1783, and was attended by five
                    persons. The separation of the society from the "old church” as a religious
                    body, with its distinct creed, worship, and ecclesiastical organization, took
                    place May 7, 1787, and its first place of worship was in Great Eastcheap,
                    London. The first general conference of the New Church was held April 17, 1789,
                    in this chapel, when a series of resolutions concerning the creed, the
                    sacraments, and ecclesiastical order of the society were adopted. At the same
                    time churches began to be formed in various towns in England and in America.
                    Towards the end of the century Swedenborg’s doctrines obtained a considerable
                    degree of acceptance on the Continent, separate societies having arisen here and
                    there. Meantime the Manchester Printing Society, under Mr Clowes, printed and
                    distributed Swedenborg’s works in large numbers. In 1810 a London Printing
                    Society was formed, which has been very active in the same way to the present
                    time. In 1817 a convention of tho American New Church was held in Philadelphia,
                    which gave proof of the growth of the body in the United States. The same year
                    the tenth general conference of the English section of the church was attended
                    by twenty-seven delegates and ministers of various societies, and in 1821 there
                    were upwards of fifty-two of these in Great Britain. At the general conference
                    in 1885 it was reported that there were sixty-five societies or churches in
                    Great Britain connected with the conference, having 5700 registered members, the
                    net increase of the year being 119. The names of thirty-two ordained ministers
                    appear in the report; the investments of the society amount to £60,453; and
                    there are a dozen educational and missionary institutions in connexion with it.
                    Some of the New Church day schools are amongst the largest and most efficient in
                    the kingdom. From the same report it appears that the New Church has societies
                    or institutions in most British colonies as well as in the principal countries
                    of Europe. The report of the General Convention of the New Jerusalem in the
                    United States, 1885, gives the names of 116 societies in America, with nearly
                    the same number of ordinary ministers. In Italy, Sweden, and Prussia there is a
                    Swedenborg mission sustained by help from England and America. In South Germany
                    there exist congregations of the New Church, and the librarian of the university
                    of Tübingen, Dr Immanuel Tafel, was exceedingly active until his death (1863) in
                    the publication and translation of Swedenborg’s works, and in the vindication of
                    the doctrines of the New Church. In Austria, Norway, and Switzerland also there
                    are congregations. But, in addition to full converts to Swedenborgianism, a
                    considerable number of prominent theologians and other thinkers have been
                    attracted by Swedenborg’s works and parts of his system. While the extravagant
                    anthropomorphism, the mechanical materialism, the theological narrowness, the
                    wild allegorizing, the entire absence of historical knowledge, and the
                    astounding prophetic claims of the man and his system,—in a word, the Gnosticism
                    of Swedenborg and his followers,—must be offensive to philosophical minds, they
                    can discover in his writings and the drift of his thought fine ethical views,
                    profound glances of insight into the depths of the universe,—God, nature, man,
                    and his destiny. The names of Oetinger, Herder, Goerres, Coleridge, Emerson, J.
                    D. Morell may be given as proof of this. Such thinkers were attracted by one or
                    more of the dominant and pervading principles or tendencies of his extraordinary
                    mind. For he felt, if he did not adequately expound, the harmony of the
                    universe, the fundamental unity of being and thought, of knowledge and will, of
                    the divine and the human; and his wild system of allegory, with his equally wild
                    communications with the unseen world, failed to conceal a deep moral and
                    intellectual revolt against the most irrational forms of traditional orthodoxy,
                    while his deep spiritual nature spurned the shallow intellectualism of the
                    rationalists of the 18th century.</p>
