                    1549), Italian painter. <hi rend="smallcaps">Giannantonio Bazzi</hi> (who until
                    recent years was erroneously named <hi rend="smallcaps">Razzi)</hi> appears to
                    have borne also the name of “Sodona” as a family name; it is signed upon some of
                    his pictures. While “Bazzi” was corrupted into “Razzi,” “Sodona” was corrupted
                    into “Sodoma”; and Vasari, followed by other writers on art, accounts for the
                    latter name by giving various and explicit details which we leave undiscussed,
                    for, if the painter did not really pass by the appellation of “Sodoma,” we may
                    fairly infer that explanations which would have been germane to that appellation
                    are not germane to the man himself. Bazzi was born at Vercelli in Piedmont
                    towards 1479, and appears to have been in his native place a scholar of the
                    painter Giovenone. Acquiring thus the strong colouring and other distinctive
                    marks of the Lombard school, he was brought to Siena towards the close of the
                    15th century by some agents of the Spannocchi family; and, as the bulk of his
                    professional life was passed in this Tuscan city, he counts as a member of the
                    Sienese school, although not strictly affined to it in point of style. He does
                    not seem to have been a steady or laborious student in Siena, apart from some
                    attention which he bestowed upon the sculptures of Jacopo della Quercia. Along
                    with Pinturicchio, he was one of the first to establish there the matured style
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Cinquecento.</hi> His earliest works of repute are
                    seventeen frescos in the Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto, on the road
                    from Siena to Rome, illustrating the life of St Benedict, in continuation of the
                    series which Luca Signorelli had begun in 1498; Bazzi completed the set in 1502.
                    Hence he was invited to Rome by the celebrated Sienese merchant Agostino Chigi,
                    and was employed by Pope Julius II. in the Camera della Segnatura in the
                    Vatican. He executed two great compositions and various ornaments and
                    grotesques. The latter are still extant; but the larger works did not satisfy
                    the pope, who engaged Raphael to substitute his Justice, Poetry, and Theology.
                    In the Chigi palace (now Farnesina) Sodona painted some subjects from the life
                    of Alexander the Great; Alexander in the Tent of Darius and the Nuptials of the
                    Conqueror with Roxana are more particularly noticed. When Leo X. was made pope
                    (1513) Bazzi presented him with a picture of the Death of Lucretia (or of
                    Cleopatra, according to some accounts); Leo gave him a large sum of money in
                    recompense and created him a cavaliere. Bazzi afterwards returned to Siena, and
                    at a later date went in quest of work to Pisa, Volterra, and Lucca. From Lucca
                    he returned to Siena, not long before his death, which took place on 14th
                    February 1549 (the older narratives say 1554). He had squandered his property
                    and died in penury in the great hospital of Siena. Bazzi had married in youth a
                    lady of good position, but the spouses disagreed and separated pretty soon
                    afterwards. A daughter of theirs married Bartolommeo Neroni, named also Riccio
                    Sanese or Maestro Riccio, one of Bazzi’s principal pupils.</p>
                <p>It is said that Bazzi jeered at the <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Painters</hi> written by Vasari, and that Vasari consequently traduced him;
                    certainly he gives a bad account of Bazzi’s morals and demeanour, and is
                    niggardly towards the merits of his art. According to Vasari, the ordinary name
                    by which Sodona was known was “Il Mattaccio” (the Madcap, the Maniac),—this
                    epithet being first bestowed upon him by the monks of Monte Oliveto. He dressed
                    gaudily, like a mountebank; his house was a perfect Noah’s ark, owing to the
                    strange miscellany of animals which he kept there. He was a cracker of jokes and
                    fond of music, and sang some poems composed by himself on indecorous subjects.
                    In his art Vasari alleges that Bazzi was always negligent,—his early success in
                    Siena, where he painted many portraits, being partly due to want of competition.
                    As he advanced in age he became too lazy to make any cartoons for his frescos,
                    but daubed them straight off upon the wall. Vasari admits, nevertheless, that
                    Bazzi produced at intervals some works of very fine quality, and during his
                    lifetime his reputation stood high.</p>
                <p>The general verdict is that Sodona was an able master in expression, motion, and
                    colour. His taste was something like that of Da Vinci, especially in the figures
                    of women, which have grace, sweetness, and uncommon earnestness. He is not
                    eminent for drawing, grouping, or general elegance of form. His easel pictures
                    are rare. His most celebrated works are in Siena. In S. Domenico, in the chapel
                    of St Catherine of Siena, are two frescos painted in 1526, showing Catherine in
                    ecstasy and fainting as she is about to receive the Eucharist from an angel,—a
                    beautiful and pathetic treatment. In the oratory of S. Bernardino, scenes from
                    the history of the Madonna, painted by Bazzi in conjunction with Pacchia and
                    Beccafumi (1536 to 1538)—the Visitation and the Assumption—are noticeable. In S.
                    Francesco are the Deposition from the Cross (1513) and Christ Scourged; by many
                    critics one or other of these paintings is regarded as Bazzi’s masterpiece. In
                    the choir of the cathedral at Pisa is the Sacrifice of Abraham, and in the
                    gallery of Florence a St Sebastian.</p>
