                    What he has to tell us of the history of South Palestine was derived from oral
                    tradition. His grandfather, as he himself tells us, lived at Bethel near Gaza,
                    and became a Christian, probably under Constantius, through the influence of
                    Hilarion, who among his other miracles had miraculously healed an acquaintance
                    of the grandfather, one Alaphion. Both men with their families became zealous
                    Christians and conspicuous for their virtues. The historian’s grandfather became
                    within his own circle a highly esteemed interpreter of Scripture, and held fast
                    his profession even in the time of Julian. The descendants of the wealthy
                    Alaphion founded churches and convents in the district, and were particularly
                    active in promoting monasticism. Sozomen himself had conversed with one of
                    these, a very old man. He was brought up under monkish influences; so he
                    expressly states, and his history bears him out. As a man he retained the
                    impressions of his youth, and his great work was to be also a monument of his
                    reverence for the monks in general and for the disciples of Hilarion in
                    particular. He became a lawyer and advocate in Constantinople, where as such he
                    wrote his Έ <hi rend="italic">κκλησιαστικὴ</hi> 'I <hi rend="italic">στωρία</hi>
                    about the year 440. The nine books of which it is composed begin with
                    Constantine and come down to the death of Honorius (423); but according to his
                    own statement the author intended to continue it as far as the year 439. From
                    Sozomen himself (iv. 17), and statements of his excerptors Nicephorus and
                    Theophanes, it can be made out that the work did actually come down to that
                    year, and that consequently it has reached us only in a somewhat mutilated
                    condition, at least half a book being wanting. A flattering and bombastic
                    dedication to Theodosius II. is prefixed. When compared with the history of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Socrates</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v)</hi> it is plainly seen to
                    be a plagiarism from that work, and that on a large scale. Some three-fourths of
                    the<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n313/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0313-0292"/> materials, essentially in the same arrangement,
                    have simply been appropriated from his predecessor without his being so much as
                    named even once, the other sources to which Sozomen was indebted being, however,
                    expressly cited. All that can be said to the credit of Sozomen is that he has
                    been himself at the trouble to refer to the principal sources used by Socrates
                    (Rufinus, Eusebius, Athanasius, Sabinus, the collections of epistles,
                    Palladius), and has not unfrequently supplemented Socrates from them, and also
                    that he has adduced some new authorities, in particular sources relating to
                    Christianity in Persia, Arian history, monkish histories, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vita Martini</hi> of Sulpicius, books of Hilarius; the whole of the ninth book
                    is entirely drawn from Olympiodorus.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to discern the motive for a work which was merely an enlarged
                    edition of Socrates. But it is probable that Sozomen did not approve of
                    Socrates’s freer attitude towards Greek science, and that he wished to present a
                    picture in which the clergy should be still further glorified, and, above all,
                    monasticism brought into still stronger prominence. In Sozomen everything is a
                    shade more ecclesiastical—but only a shade—than in Socrates. Perhaps also he
                    wrote for a different circle,— say, the monks in Palestine,—and could be sure
                    that in it the work of his predecessor would not be known.</p>
                <p>Sozomen is everywhere an inferior Socrates. What in Socrates still betrays some
                    vestiges of historical sense, his moderation, his reserve in questions of dogma,
                    his impartiality,—all this is wanting in Sozomen. In many cases he has repeated
                    the exact words of Socrates, but with him they have passed almost into mere
                    phrases. The inferiority of Sozomen to Socrates as an historian appears as much
                    in the manner in which he transcribed him as in those passages where he
                    introduces something new. The chronological scrupulosity of the earlier writer
                    has made no impression on his follower; he has either wholly omitted or
                    inaccurately repeated the chronological data. He writes more wordily and
                    diffusely. In his characterizations of persons, borrowed from Socrates, he is
                    more dull and colourless. After Socrates he has indeed repeated the caution not
                    to be too rash in discerning the linger of God; but his way of looking at things
                    is throughout mean and rustic. Two souls inhabit his book: one, the better, is
                    borrowed from Socrates; another, the worse, is his own. Wherever he abandons his
                    leader he frequently falls into mere retailing of stories, and prostrates
                    himself in reverence before the poorest products of the religious fantasy of a
                    degenerating age. Evidence of a boundless credulity with regard to all sorts of
                    monkish fables is to be met with everywhere. Raisings of the dead are quite
                    common occurrences with him, and he repeatedly gives accounts of enormous
                    dragons. In the finding of the bones of saints he takes the highest interest,
                    and even believes in the rediscovery of the tombs of the Old Testament
                    prophets.</p>
                <p>Where we still possess Socrates’s account that of Sozomen very seldom has any
                    consequence, but some of the additions he has made are instructive and
                    important. The number of new acts of councils introduced by him is small. His
                    monkish histories are as sources almost utterly valueless; his account of the
                    Christians in Persia absolutely swarms with mistakes. It must, however, be noted
                    that for the period from Theodosius I. onward he has emancipated himself more
                    fully from Socrates and has followed Olympiodorus in part, partly also oral
                    tradition; here accordingly his statements possess greater value.</p>
