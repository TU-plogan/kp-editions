                <p><label type="entry">SWIFT</label>, a bird so called from the extreme speed of its
                    flight, which apparently exceeds that of any other British species, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Hirundo apus</hi> of Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Cypselus
                        apus or muramus of</hi> modern ornithologists, who have at last learned that
                    it has only an outward resemblance but no near affinity to the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Swallow</hi><hi rend="italic">(ante,p.</hi> 729) or its
                    allies. Well known as a summer-visitor throughout the greater part of Europe, it
                    is one of the latest to return from Africa, and its stay in the country of its
                    birth is of the shortest, for it generally disappears from England very early in
                    August, though occasionally to be seen for even two months later.</p>
                <p>The Swift commonly chooses its nesting-place in holes under the eaves of
                    buildings, but a crevice in the face of a quarry, or even a hollow tree, will
                    serve it with the accommodation it requires. This indeed is not much, since
                    every natural function, except sleep, oviposition, and incubation, is performed
                    on the wing, and the easy evolutions of this bird in the air, where it remains
                    for hours together, are the admiration of all who witness them. Though
                    considerably larger than a Swallow, it can be recognized at a distance less by
                    its size than by its peculiar shape. The head scarcely projects from the
                    anterior outline of the pointed wings, which form an almost continuous curve, at
                    right angles to which extend the body and tail, resembling the handle of the
                    crescentic cutting-knife used in several trades, while the wings represent the
                    blade. The mode of flight of the two birds is also unlike, that of the Swift
                    being much more steady, and, rapid as it is, ordinarily free from jerks. The
                    whole plumage, except a greyish-white patch under the chin, is a sooty black,
                    but glossy above. Though its actual breeding-places are by no means numerous,
                    its extraordinary speed and discursive habits make the Swift widely distributed;
                    and throughout England scarcely a summer’s day passes without its being seen in
                    most places. A larger species, <hi rend="italic">C. melba</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">C. alpinus,</hi> with the lower parts dusky white, whieh has
                    its home in many of the mountainous parts of central and southern Europe, has
                    several times been observed in Britain, and two examples of a species of a very
                    distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Acanthyllis</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chaetura),</hi> which has its home in northern Asia, but regularly
                    emigrates thence to Australia, have been obtained in England (<hi rend="italic"

                            the year 1825 that it may not be amiss to state that its origin dates
                            only from 1826, the same year in which Boie established the commensurate
                            genus <hi rend="italic">Acanthyllis.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Among other peculiarities the Swifts, as long ago described (probably from John
                    Hunter’s notes) by Home (<hi rend="italic">Phil. Tran</hi> s., 1817, pp. 332 <hi
                        rend="italic">et seqq.,</hi> pl. xvi.), are remarkable for the development
                    of their salivary glands, the secretions of which serve in most species to glue
                    together the materials of which the nests are composed, and in the species of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Collocalia</hi> form almost the whole substance of
                    the structure. These are the “edible” nests so eagerly sought by Chinese
                    epicures as an ingredient for soup, and their composition, though announced many
                    years since by Home <hi rend="italic">{ut supra),</hi> whose statement was
                    confirmed by Bernstein <hi rend="italic">{Act. Soc. Sc. Indo-Néerlandicae,</hi>

                    111-119), has of late been needlessly doubted in favour of the popular belief
                    that they were made of some kind of sea-weed, <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> or
                    other vegetable matter collected by the birds.<note anchored="true"

                                rend="italic">Collocalia fuciphaga.</hi></p></note> It may be hoped
                    that the examination and analysis made by Mr J. R. Green <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Journal of Physiology,</hi> vi. pp. 40-45) have settled that question for
                    all time. These remarkable nests consist essentially of mucus, secreted by the
                    salivary glands above mentioned, which dries and looks like isinglass. Their
                    marketable value depends on their colour and purity, for they are often
                    intermixed with feathers and other foreign substances. The Swifts that construct
                    these “edible” nests form a genus <hi rend="italic">Collocalia,</hi> of which
                    the number of species is uncertain; but they inhabit chiefly the islands of the
                    Indian Ocean from the north of Madagascar eastward, as well as many of the

                    Marquesas,—one species occurring in the hill-country of India. They breed in
                    caves, to which they resort in great numbers, and occupy them jointly and yet
                    alternately with Bats—the mammals being the lodgers by day and the birds by
                        night.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr H. Pryer
                            has given one of the latest accounts of some of these caves in North

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Cypselus,</hi> as noted by Willughby, with its
                    American ally <hi rend="italic">Panyptila,</hi> exhibits a form of pedal
                    structure not otherwise observed among birds. Not only is the hind-toe
                    constantly directed forwards, but the other three toes depart from the rule
                    which ordinarily governs the number of phalanges in the Bird’s foot,—a rule
                    which applies to even so ancient a form as <hi rend="italic">Archseopteryx</hi>
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 728),—and in the two
                    Cypseline genera just named the series of digital phalanges is 2, 3, 3, 3,
                    instead of 2, 3, 4, 5, which generally obtains in the Class <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aves.</hi> Other Swifts, however, do not depart from the normal
                    arrangement, and the exception, remarkable as it is, must not be taken as of
                    more value than is needed for the recognition of two sections or subgenera
                    admitted by Mr Sclater in his monographical essay on the Family (Proc. <hi
                        rend="italic">Zool. Society,</hi> 1865, pp. 593-617). There seem to be about
                    half a dozen good genera of <hi rend="italic">Cypselidae,</hi> and from fifty to
                    sixty species. Their geographical distribution is much the same as that of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Hirundinidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Swallow,</hi><hi rend="italic">ut supra);</hi> but it should be always and
                    most clearly borne in mind that, though so like Swallows in many respects, the
                    Swifts have scarcely any part of their structure which is not formed on a
                    different plan; and, instead of any near affinity existing between the two
                    groups, it can scarcely be doubted by any unprejudiced investigator that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cypselidae</hi> not only differ far more from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Hirundinidae</hi> than the latter do from any other Family of
                        <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> but that they belong to what in the present
                    state of ornithology must be deemed a distinct Order of Birds—that which in the
                    present series of articles has been called <hi rend="italic">Picarae.</hi> That
                    the relations of the <hi rend="italic">Cypselidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"

                    and Nitzsch, Dr Burmeister and Prof. Huxley, is denied by Dr Shufeldt <hi
