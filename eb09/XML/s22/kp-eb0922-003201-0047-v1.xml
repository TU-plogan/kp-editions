                    English actress, was the eldest of twelve children of Roger Kemble, the manager
                    of a company of strolling players, and his wife Sarah Ward, and was born in the
                    “Shoulder of Mutton” public-house, Brecon, Wales, 5th July 1755. Through the
                    special care of her mother in sending her to the schools in the towns where the
                    company played she received a remarkably good education, although she was
                    accustomed to make her appearance on the stage while still a mere child. She
                    became attached to William Siddons, an actor of the company; but this was
                    discountenanced by her parents, who wished her to accept the offer of a squire.
                    Siddons was dismissed from the company, and she was sent to a situation as
                    lady’s maid in Warwickshire; at last, however, the necessary consent was
                    obtained and the marriage took place at Trinity Church, Coventry, on 26th
                    November 1773. It was while playing at Cheltenham in the following year that Mrs
                    Siddons met with the earliest decided recognition of her great powers as an
                    actress, when by her representation of Belvidera in <hi rend="italic">Venice
                        Preserved</hi> she moved to tears a party of “people of quality” who had
                    come to “scoff.” Her merits<pb break="no"

                    his deputy to Cheltenham to report regarding her abilities, the result being
                    that she was engaged to appear at Drury Lane at a salary of £ <hi rend="italic"
                        >5</hi> a week. Owing to inexperience as well as other circumstances, her
                    first appearances as Portia and in other parts were unfortunate, and when, after
                    playing with success in Birmingham, she was about to return to town she received
                    a note from the manager of Drury Lane stating that her services would not be
                    required. Thus, in her own words, “banished from Drury Lane as a worthless
                    candidate for fame and fortune,” she again in the beginning of 1777 went “on the
                    circuit” in the provinces. After a very successful engagement at Bath from 1778
                    to 1782, she again accepted an offer from Drury Lane, when her appearance in
                    Southern’s <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> was one continued triumph, only
                    equalled in the history of the English stage by that of Garrick’s first night at
                    Drury Lane in 1741 and that of Edmund Kean’s in 1814. In her earlier years it
                    was in scenes of a tender and melting character that she exercised the strongest
                    sway over an audience; but in the performance of Lady Macbeth, in which she
                    appeared February 1785, it was the grandeur of her exhibition of the more
                    terrible passions as related to one awful purpose that held them spellbound. In
                    Lady Macbeth she found the highest and best scope for her gifts. It fitted her
                    as no other character did, and as perhaps it will never fit another actress. Her
                    extraordinary and peculiar physical endowments—tall and striking figure,
                    brilliant beauty, powerfully expressive eyes, and solemn dignity of
                    demeanour—enabled her to confer a weird majesty on the character which
                    inexpressibly heightened the tragic awe surrounding her fate. After Lady Macbeth
                    she played Desdemona, Rosalind, and Ophelia, all with great success; but it was
                    in Queen Catherine—which she first played on her brother’s spectacular revival
                    of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII.</hi> in 1788—that she discovered a part almost
                    as well adapted to her peculiar powers as that of Lady Macbeth. In her early
                    life she had attempted comedy, but her gifts in this respect were very limited.
                    It was of course inevitable that comparisons should be made between her and her
                    only compeer Rachel, who undoubtedly excelled her in intensity and the portrayal
                    of fierce passion, but was a less finished artist and lacked Mrs Siddons’s
                    dignity and pathos. Though Mrs Siddons’s minute and systematic study perhaps
                    gave a certain amount of stiffness to her representations, it conferred on them
                    a symmetry and proportion to which Rachel never attained. Mrs Siddons formally
                    retired from the stage 29th June 1812, but occasionally appeared on special
                    occasions even when advanced in years. In private life she enjoyed the
                    friendship and respect of a wide circle, including many of the most eminent
                    persons of her time. She died at London on 8th June 1831.</p>
