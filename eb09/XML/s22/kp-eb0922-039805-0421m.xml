                    which seems to have formed one of the most durable aromatic ingredients in the
                    costly unguents used by the Romans and Eastern nations. The ointment prepared
                    from it (“ointment of pistic nard”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    3-5) as being “very costly,” a pound of it being valued at more than 300 denarii
                    (over £10). This appears to represent the prices then current for the best
                    quality of nard, since Pliny (<hi rend="italic">H.N</hi>., xii. 26) mentions
                    that nard spikes reached as much as 100 denarii per lb, and, although he does
                    not mention the price of nard ointment, he states (xiii. 2) that the “unguentum
                    cinnamominum,” a similar preparation, ranged from 25 to 300 denarii according to
                    its quality. Nard ointment also varied considerably in price from its liability
                    to sophistication (Id., xii. 26, 27; xiii. 2). The ingredients of the genuine
                    ointment <hi rend="italic">(unguentum nardinum sive foliatum),</hi> Pliny tells
                    us (xiii. 2), were Indian nard, juncus (the leaves of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andropogon Schοenanthus,</hi> L.), costus (the root of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aplotaxis auriculata,</hi> DC.), amomum (the fruits of <hi rend="italic">Amomum
                    Cardamomum,</hi> L.), myrrh (the gum-resin of <hi rend="italic">Balsamodendron
                    Myrrha,</hi> Nees), balm (the oleo-resin of <hi rend="italic">Balsamodendron
                    Opobalsamum),</hi> omphacium or oleum omphacinum (the oil expressed from unripe
                    olives), and balaninum (derived from <hi rend="italic">Balanites
                    aegyptiaca</hi>? <hi rend="italic">).</hi> Dioscorides (i. 75) also remarks that
                    malabathrum (the leaf of <hi rend="italic">Cinnamomum Tamala,</hi> Nees) was
                    sometimes added. Of these ingredients costus and amomum were most relied upon
                    for increasing the fragrance and the nard for the stimulating and other virtues
                    of the unguent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0422-0399"/> The exact botanical source of the true or Indian
                    nard was long a matter of uncertainty, the descriptions given by ancient authors
                    being somewhat vague. Theophrastus <hi rend="italic">(De Odor.,</hi> 28) classes
                    nard amongst roots, and states that it came from India <hi rend="italic">(Hist.
                    Plant.,</hi> ix. 7, 2), had a biting and hot taste, and resembled iris root in
                    perfuming the air near it <hi rend="italic">(De Odor.,</hi> 12, 56). He also
                    remarks <hi rend="italic">(l.c.,</hi> 42) that the ointment was one of the most
                    durable of perfumes. Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi> xii. 26, 27) gives a
                    somewhat confused account, from which it appears that both “spike” and leaf were
                    in use, although it is not clear whether the spike <hi rend="italic"
                    >(spica)</hi> consisted of the flower-head or the fibrous lower portion of the
                    stem. The only definite statement he makes concerning it is that the “sincere”
                    nard is known by its red colour, sweet smell, and especially taste, “for it
                    drieth the tongue and leaveth a pleasant relish behind it.” Dioscorides (i. 6)
                    states that the true nard came from India and was collected on mountains beside
                    which the river Ganges flowed. He describes it as blackish with short spikes,
                    smelling something like cyperus. Linnaeus, Blane, Hatchett, and other writers
                    have supposed that spikenard was an Indian grass of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Andropogon</hi> (<hi rend="italic">A</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Nardus,</hi> L.);
                    but Sir W. Jones <hi rend="italic">(As. Res.,</hi> ii. 416, iv. 97) has given
                    convincing reasons for identifying it with <hi rend="italic">Nardostachys
                    Jatamansi,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    plant figured by Sir W. Jones is <hi rend="italic">Valeriana Ηardιwickii</hi>
                    (probably the inferior Gangetic nard of Dioscorides and the ozaenitis of Pliny);
                    the true plant is figured by Royle and Lambert.</p></note> a plant of the
                    Valerian order, the fibrous rootstocks or “spikes” of which are still collected
                    in the mountains of Bhotan and Nepal. Further evidence is afforded by Lambert
                    <hi rend="italic">(Illustr. of the Genus Cinchona,</hi> App., p. 177), who found
                    the root under the name of “spikenard” in one of the oldest chemist’s shops in
                    London, also by Dymock <hi rend="italic">(Mat. Med.</hi> IF. <hi rend="italic"
                    >India,</hi> 2d ed., p. 347), who states that the principal use of the drug at
                    the present time is for making hair washes and ointments, the popular opinion
                    being that it promotes the growth and blackness of the hair. The name of “spike”
                    applied to the Indian nard appears to be derived from its resemblance in shape
                    to a spike or ear of bearded corn. The root is crowned by the bases of several
                    stems, each about 2 inches or more in length and as thick as the finger. To
                    these the fibrous tissue of former leaves adheres and gives them a peculiar
                    bristly appearance. It is this portion that is chiefly collected.</p>
                <p>Other and inferior varieties of nard are mentioned by Dioscorides and subsequent
                    writers. Celtic nard, obtained from the Ligurian Alps aud Istria, consisted of
                    the roots of plants also belonging to the Valerian order (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Valerianα celtiea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">V. salicina).</hi> This was
                    exported to the East and thence to Egypt, and was used in the preparation of
                    baths. Mountain nard was collected in Cilicia and Syria, and is supposed to have
                    consisted of the root of <hi rend="italic">Valeriana tuberosa.</hi> The false
                    nard of Dauphiné, used in later times, and still employed as a charm in
                    Switzerland, is the root-stock of <hi rend="italic">Allium Victorialis.</hi> It
                    presents a singular resemblance to the spikes of Indian nard, but is devoid of
                    fragrance. It is remarkable that all the nards belong to the natural order <hi
                    rend="italic">Valerianaceae,</hi> the odour of valerian being considered
                    disagreeable at the present day; that of <hi rend="italic">Nardostachys
                    Jatamansi</hi> is intermediate between valerian and patchouli, although more
                    agreeable than either.</p>
                <p>The name “spikenard” has also been applied in later times to several plants. The
                    spikenard of the United States is <hi rend="italic">Aralia racemosa,</hi> and
                    another species of the same genus, <hi rend="italic">A. nudicaulis,</hi> is
                    known as “false spikenard.” In the West Indies <hi rend="italic">Hyptis
                    suaveolens</hi> is called “spikenard,” and in Great Britain the name
                    “ploughman’s spikenard” is given to <hi rend="italic">Inula Conyza.</hi> (E. M.
