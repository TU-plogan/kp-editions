                <p><label type="entry">SODIUM <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi> SODA</label>. Sodium is
                    one of the two principal alkali metals, regarding the general properties of
                    which the reader is referred to <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi> (vol. v. p.
                    524) and the introductory portion of <hi rend="smallcaps">Potassium</hi> (vol.
                    xix. p. 588). In combination sodium is a generally diffused and most abundant
                    element. The salt dissolved in sea water consists chiefly of chloride of sodium
                    (NaCl), and according to Dittmar’s calculation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sea
                    Water)</hi> the oceans of the world contain of sodium calculated as chloride not
                    less than 36,000 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e</hi>., 36,000 million million) tons, whilst of potassium calculated as
                    sulphate the amount in sea water is 1141 × 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi>
                    (1141 million million) tons. From sea water have been deposited the enormous
                    beds of rock salt found in many parts of the world (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Salt).</hi> Sodium carbonates are also widely dispersed in nature, forming
                    constituents of many mineral waters, and occurring as principal saline
                    components in natron or trona lakes, as efflorescences in Lower Egypt, Persia,
                    and China, and as urao in Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela. The solid crusts
                    found at the bottom of the salt lakes of the Araxes plain in Armenia contain
                    about 16 per cent. of carbonate and 80 of sulphate of soda. In New Granada there
                    occurs a double salt, Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> + CaCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O,
                    known as gay-lussite. In Wyoming, California, and Nevada enormous deposits of
                    carbonates, mixed in some cases with sulphate and with chloride, occur. About
                    Szegedin in Hungary and all over the vast pusztas (steppes) between the Theiss
                    and the Danube, and from the Theiss up to and beyond Debreczin, the soil
                    contains sodium carbonate, which frequently assumes the form of crude alkaline
                    crusts, called “szekso,” and of small saline ponds. A purified specimen of such
                    Debreczin soda was found to contain as much as 90 per cent. of real carbonate
                    (NaCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) and 4 of common salt. Natural sulphate
                    occurs in an anhydrous condition as thenardite (Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) at Tarapaca, Peru, and in the rocksalt deposits
                    at Espartinas near Aranjuez, Spain. Hydrated sulphates occur at several
                    localities in the province of Madrid and in other provinces of Spain, and at
                    Mühlingen in Aargau, and copious deposits of glauberite, the double sulphate of
                    sodium and calcium, are met with in the salt-mines of Villarrubia in Spain, at
                    Stassfurt, and in the province of Tarapaca, Peru, &amp;c. A native nitrate of
                    soda is obtained in great abundance in the district of Atacama and the province
                    of Tarapaca, and is imported into Europe in enormous quantities as cubical nitre
                    for the preparation of saltpetre (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nitrogen,</hi> vol.
                    xvii. p. 518). Cryolite, a fluoride of aluminium and sodium, AlF <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 3NaF, is extensively mined in Greenland for
                    industrial purposes. These form the principal natural sources of sodium
                    compounds,—the chloride as rock salt and in sea water being of such
                    predominating importance as quite to outweigh all the others. But it is
                    questionable whether taken altogether the mass of sodium they represent is as
                    much as that disseminated throughout the rocky crust in the form of soda felspar
                    (<hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., as silicate of soda) and in other soda-containing
                    rocks. From this source all soils contain small proportions of sodium in soluble
                    forms, hence the ashes of plants, although they preferably imbibe potassium
                    salts, contain traces and sometimes notable quantities of sodium salts. Sodium
                    salts also form essential ingredients in all animal juices.</p>
                <p>Considered industrially, by far the most important bodies are the carbonates, the
                    sulphates, and caustic soda (sodium hydrate), the manufacture of which forms the
                    basis of the soda industry. Immense quantities of these bodies are used in the
                    manufacture of soap and glass, and under the name of “washing soda” or “soda
                    crystals” the consumption of the hydrated carbonate for domestic washing is also
                    very great. There are indeed few chemical industries in which soda in one form
                    or another does not play an important part, and the combinations of economic
                    value into which it enters are numberless. It will be convenient to treat of the
                    manufacture as a whole by itself, after speaking of sodium and its salts in
                    their chemical relations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sodium,</hi> in German <hi rend="italic">Natrium</hi> (symbol,
                    Na; atomic weight, 23·053; O = 16), is a univalent metal. It occurs nowhere in
                    nature in an uncombined condition, and was first isolated in 1807 by Sir
                    Humphrey Davy through the medium of voltaic electricity. It is prepared by
                    distillation of an intimate mixture of carbonate of soda with charcoal. The
                    process is quite analogous to that followed in making metallic potassium <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Potassium,</hi> vol. xix. p. 590), but much easier of
                    execution, and free from certain dangers which attend the preparation of the
                    other. The distillation is conducted in cylindrical iron retorts protected
                    against the fire by means of fireclay tubes fitting closely round them. In the
                    charge is included a certain proportion of chalk, which, giving off carbonic
                    acid, aids in driving over the metallic vapour and protects the distillate
                    against oxidation. The metal cast into the form of cakes or ingots is protected
                    from the air by a coating of paraffin and secured in closely fitting soldered-up
                    tinned-iron boxes. Metallic sodium is very similar in properties and appearance
                    to potassium. The principal points of difference are its pure white colour,<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n256/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0256-0241"/> its specific gravity (0·9735 at 13°·5 C.), and
                    its fusing point (95°·6 C.). In thin layers its vapour is colourless, but dense
                    fumes have a purple tint. It decomposes water violently, but the hydrogen
                    evolved does not take fire, although the reaction is more dangerous than the
                    corresponding phenomena developed by potassium, because it leads frequently to
                    most violent explosions. Yet the process serves in practice for the preparation
                    of pure soda hydrate. In this operation a piece of sodium is placed in a silver
                    basin standing in a shallow cold-water bath. Drop by drop water is added—the
                    metal between the additions being allowed to expend its energy—till the desired
                    quantity of hydrate is formed. The process, in short, is so conducted that,
                    except at first, the metal never touches water in any other form than that of a
                    strong soda lye. Sodium is largely made for use as an agent in the manufacture
                    of aluminium and magnesium, and as a reagent in laboratory operations. The metal
                    does not affect carbonic oxide at any temperature; it acts on hydrogen as
                    potassium does; but the compound is less stable. On ammonia gas it acts, as in
                    the parallel case of potassium, with the formation of NH <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> Na, only the reaction is less energetic. Sodium has less powerful
                    affinity to oxygen than potassium; in dry air or oxygen it burns into the
                    dioxide Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,—a
                    product obtainable also by heating the nitrate or nitrite. A white solid soluble

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 8H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is obtainable in
                    crystals, the solution of which is strongly alkaline. With acids it yields
                    sodium salts and peroxide of hydrogen. Sodium tetroxide (Na <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) is not known to exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caustic Soda</hi> (NaHO) is prepared from carbonate by means of
                    caustic lime, just as caustic potash is made from its carbonate (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Potassium).</hi> The analogy between the two caustic alkalis is
                    so perfect that we need only summarize the points of difference between them.
                    Compared with caustic potash, caustic soda is less easily soluble in water, less
                    caustic, less energetically basilous, less prone when fused in air to pass into
                    peroxide, hence less destructive to platinum, iron, nickel, and silver
                    vessels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sodium Chloride</hi> (NaCl) occurs in nature in a nearly pure
                    state. Absolutely pure salt is made from commercial salt by precipitating from a
                    solution the lime and magnesia by pure carbonate of soda, filtering,
                    neutralizing with pure hydrochloric acid, concentrating by evaporation, and then
                    precipitating the pure salt by a stream of hydrochloric acid gas. The
                    crystalline precipitate is collected over glass wool, washed with pure fuming
                    hydrochloric acid, and dried by heating in a platinum basin. It forms
                    non-hygroscopic crystals, free from combined water, having a specific gravity at
                    16° C. of 2·162 (Stolba), and according to Carnelley fusing at 776° C. The

                    3</hi>) is a salt of some industrial importance, from its use in the manufacture
                    of aniline black. It may be made from the potash salt (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                    by decomposing this with hydrofluosilicic acid (which precipitates the potassium
                    as fluosilicate and yields a solution of chloric acid), and neutralizing the
                    chloric acid solution with soda, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) by double

                    of soda remains in solution. According to Weldon, it is best manufactured from
                    caustic soda by the direct action of chlorine, the two salts NaCl and NaClO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> being separated by crystallization. Chlorate of soda
                    forms cubes which often exhibit tetrahedral faces; 100 parts of water dis solve
                    at 0° 81·9, at 20° 99, and at 100° C. 233 parts of the salt. Hence it is much
                    more soluble than the potash salt, on which account it is preferred for aniline
                    black printing.</p>

                    manufacturing operations, although it is regarded principally as an intermediate
                    product. The anhydrous salt readily combines with water into a crystalline

                <p>As the temperature rises beyond about 33°, the solubility decreases (Gay-Lussac).
                    Glauber’s salt, when exposed to dry air, especially in summer heat, gradually
                    falls into a powder of anhydrous sulphate. It is much less volatile than the

                <p>Of all sodium compounds, except common salt, the carbonates are by far the most

                    Carnelley, it fuses at 818° C. (dull red heat) into a colourless liquid. On
                    fusing it loses some of its carbonic acid, and at a bright red heat it
                    volatilizes appreciably. The porous salt absorbs water from the air; when
                    moistened with water it gives off heat and unites into crystalline hydrates, of

                    assumes the form of lower hydrates, hence the diminution in solubility at higher

                <p>The ancients probably did not know soda in other than its native forms, and till
                    about the end of the 18th century potash was, of the two alkalis, the more
                    abundant and generally used substance. Indeed it was not till well into that
                    century that the chemical distinctions of the alkalis were established; they
                    were previously spoken of indifferently as nitrum, natron, kali, alkali, and
                    soda, names simply meaning a fixed alkali. Soda has properly a separate history
                    only from 1736, when Duhamel established the fact that common salt and mineral
                    alkali have the same base,—a body different from the salt of tartar or vegetable
                    alkali. Yet soda, from both mineral and vegetable sources, had long previously
                    been used in Europe, the Arabs having probably brought into Spain a knowledge of
                    the alkali and its sources. Apart from the trona and soda lakes, &amp;c.,
                    already alluded to, the only source till the close of the 18th century was the
                    ashes of certain plants which grow on the sea-coast and in salt-impregnated
                    soils. These plants, principally species of <hi rend="italic">Salsola</hi> and a
                    few other genera of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Atripliceae,</hi> on
                    incineration yield an ash containing in some cases about 50 per cent. of
                    carbonate of soda. The ash of these plants, fluxed by red heat into a pasty mass
                    and broken into convenient lumps, forms the barilla of commerce, which in former
                    times was a product of the first importance on the shores of Spain, Sicily,
                    Sardinia, and other coasts of the Mediterranean. In 1834 as much as 12,000 tons
                    of barilla were introduced into England from Spain alone, and, in spite of the
                    cheapness of artificial soda, the manufacture of barilla is still—or at least
                    was till recently—carried on at various localities on the Mediterranean. On the
                    west coasts of Scotland and Ireland large amounts of impure soda carbonate were
                    obtained from the kelp burned from certain sea-weeds; but the introduction of
                    artificial soda early extinguished that industry, although in connexion with the
                    production of iodine and other products a small quantity of sea-weed soda
                    continues to be made in Scotland till the present day.</p>
                <p>The increasing price of potash salts and the discovery of Duhamel led to
                    strenuous attempts to produce the carbonate from common salt. In 1775 the French
                    Academy of Sciences offered a prize of 2400 livres for a practical method of
                    converting salt into soda. But it was never awarded, although the problem was
                    soon triumphantly solved. Indeed in that same year Scheele succeeded in making
                    soda from common salt by means of litharge. Several claims were made for the
                    prize, the first being based on a process invented by a Benedictine monk,
                    Malherbe, in 1778, which was worked with some success for several years. Some
                    time about or before 1787 De la Métherie proposed a plan for calcining with
                    charcoal the sulphate prepared from chloride,—an impracticable proposal, because
                    nearly all the resulting product is sulphide.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is well established, however, that
                    carbonate of soda can be produced in this manner. It was Liebig, we believe, who
                    showed that the first step in the Le Blanc process is approximately thus —
                    2NaSO+ 6C = NaS+ NaCO+ 5CO, only the disulphide and the carbonate on continued
                    heating act on each other and on the carbon to form NaS.—NaS+ NaCO+ 2C = 2NaS +

                    products evolved, it became the basis of a series of important industries, and
                    many interesting collateral processes have been grafted on the manufacture. Its
                    origin was contemporaneous with the introduction of bleaching-powder (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chlorine,</hi> vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">v.</hi> p. 678), and
                    the hydrochloric, acid given off in the conversion of chloride into sulphate of
                    soda became the raw material of that industry, the two processes being worked in
                    conjunction. Since the days of Le Blanc many other methods for more directly
                    manufacturing artificial soda have been proposed; but only one—the so-called
                    “ammonia process ”—has seriously threatened to supplant it.</p><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Le Blanc's Process.—</hi> This consists of two stages. In the
                    first stage common salt is converted into sulphate of soda by the action of
                    sulphuric acid. At first acid sulphate of soda is produced thus— 2NaCl + HSO=
                    HCl + NaHSO+ NaCl; but subsequently at a sufficient temperature the acid
                    sulphate decomposes the remainder of the salt thus—NaHSO+ NaCl = NaSO+ HCl, so
                    that all the chlorine is expelled as hydrochloric acid with formation of normal
                    sulphate of soda. In the second stage the sulphate mixed with limestone and coal
                    (charcoal in Le Blanc’s original proposal) is calcined in a reducing flame,
                    whereby a mixture of sulphide of calcium (CaS) and carbonate of soda is formed,
                    oxygen being generally supposed to pass off as carbonic oxide, CO. According to
                    Lunge, however, the gas produced consists chiefly of carbonic acid, so that the
                    reaction should correspond essentially to the equation NaSO+ 2C + CaCO=NaCO+ CaS
                    + 2CO. The sulphide of calcium being practically insoluble in water and only
                    very slowly acted on by a solution of carbonate of soda at temperatures under
                    45° C., the carbonate is extracted by systematic lixiviation with water at a
                    temperature under that limit and is recovered from the solution by evaporation.
                    If an excess of lime is used, more or less of the soda assumes the caustic form
                    (NaHO). All crude soda-ash lyes contain some caustic alkali besides the
                    following impurities :— chloride of sodium, sulphate of soda, sulphide of sodium
                    combined with sulphide of iron into a soluble green compound which occasions
                    much trouble to the manufacturer. This solution contains also occasionally
                    cyanide or ferrocyanide of sodium, produced by the action of cyanide on the
                    soluble form of sulphide of iron.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Salt Cake
                    Making.—</hi> The conversion of the salt into sulphate, called “salt cake,” is
                    effected by means of sulphuric acid of about 60 per cent. (chamber acid), and
                    may be, and still very commonly is, carried out in reverberatory furnaces having
                    flat soles of cast iron, attached to one end of which is a pan of the same
                    material. The waste heat from the reverberatory furnace is utilized to heat the
                    charge placed in the pan, where the first part of the change is effected, the
                    reaction beginning briskly with evolution of copious fumes of hydrochloric acid
                    immediately the acid and salt are mixed. Before the Alkali Act of 1863
                    hydrochloric acid was freely allowed to escape through the stalk with the smoke
                    and fire gases, carrying destruction to the vegetation of vast tracts around the
                    works; but now all the acid is everywhere carefully collected, both because it
                    is a source of profit and from sanitary considerations. Hence in modern “open
                    roasters,” as these reverberatory furnaces are called, the pan and the calcining
                    sole are separated, so that the comparatively pure and undiluted fumes from the
                    pan can be led away and collected by themselves, leaving the mixed air, fire
                    gases, and acid fumes from the furnace hearth to be separately dealt with. In
                    another class of furnace, called a “blind roaster,” the calcination of the
                    half-finished sulphate is carried out in a muffle, so that none of the
                    hydrochloric acid is mixed with air and fire gases. Certain advantages attend
                    each class of furnace. In working these hand-furnaces there is much unpleasant
                    manual labour, to avoid which mechanical furnaces have been devised, in which
                    the stirring of the charge, &amp;c., is accomplished by machinery. The first
                    mechanical roaster actually used was patented by Jones &amp; Walsh in 1875. In
                    it the whole operation from beginning to end is carried out on the sole of a
                    large cast-iron pan heated from above. Through the roof of the chamber enclosing
                    the pan passes a vertical shaft geared to rotate, to which are attached four
                    horizontal arms, and to these slanting rods are fixed which terminate in
                    scrapers. These scrapers are fixed at different lengths from the shaft centre,
                    so that when the shaft is in motion they pass through and turn over the whole of
                    the charge strewn over the sole of the pan. The acid is passed into the pan by a
                    pipe from a tank situated above the roaster. The hot mixture of fire gases and
                    acid fumes is led through a long pipe to cool down before reaching the
                    condensers.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hargreaves's Process</hi> for making
                    sulphate without the direct use of sulphuric acid is based on the employment of
                    sulphurous acid obtained by the ignition of pyrites aided by air and steam. In
                    this way Mr Hargreaves may be said to get his sulphuric acid <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex tempore.</hi> The process has only been elaborated as the result of a most
                    extensive series of investigations and experiments carried out in conjunction
                    with Mr Robinson, their first patent having been obtained in January 1870. The
                    reaction on which the process depends may be thus formulated—2NaCl + SO+ HO + O
                    = NaSO+ 2HC1. The salt used is rendered porous by first moistening it with water
                    and then redrying it by passing it through a hot-air channel</p></note> But this
                    proposal has historical importance, because from the published account of it Le
                    Blanc received in 1787, according to his own statement, the first suggestion of
                    his process,—probably the most valuable and fertile chemical discovery of all
                    times. Nicolas Le Blanc, born at Issoudun (Indre) in 1753, was private surgeon
                    to the duke of Orleans. He was a chemist as well as a surgeon, and the prospect
                    of the Academy prize attracted his attention to the soda problem. He added to
                    the sulphate and charcoal mixture proposed by De la Methérie a certain
                    proportion of chalk, and by fluxing the mixture in crucibles succeeded in
                    effecting the desired transformation. The chemist D’Arcet and his assistant
                    Dizé, having recognized the soundness of the process, the duke of Orleans, early
                    in 1790, agreed to provide a capital of 200,000 francs for working the process.
                    In September 1791 the National Assembly granted Le Blanc a patent for fifteen
                    years, and under the superintendence of Le Blanc himself, with Dizé and Henri
                    Shée, the steward of the duke of Orleans, a work was established at Saint Denis.
                    But on the fall and execution of his patron Le Blanc, and all others owning and
                    working soda processes, were ordered to resign them to the state for the public
                    benefit, he receiving the miserable compensation of 4000 francs. In 1800 his
                    works were reconveyed to him, but in 1806, broken in hope, health, spirit, and
                    resource, he perished by his own hand in a workhouse.</p>
                <p>Le Blanc’s process continued to hold the field against all competing schemes till

                    prepared is distributed in a range of not less than eight cast-iron cylinders,
                    which are pervaded successively by a current of mixed superheated steam and
                    sulphurous acid given off by pyrites. The reaction begins at about 400° C. and
                    increases in energy with the rise of temperature, but it is impracticable to
                    force the heat beyond 500° to 550°, as the charge then begins to fuse and ceases
                    to be permeable by gases.</p>
                <p>The condensation of the hydrochloric acid given off in these processes is
                    effected by a variety of means according to the purpose in view in securing the
                    gas. In Continental works a favourite method is to pass the gas through a range
                    of Woulfe’s bottles arranged in an ascending series,—fresh water entering the
                    topmost and passing through the whole, till in the last and lowest, highly
                    charged with acid, it meets the gas coming direct from the roaster. After
                    leaving the last and highest bottle the gas is generally washed thoroughly out
                    by passing it into a small coke tower, in which it meets a downward trickle of
                    water. In English works Woulfe’s bottles are not employed, and the gases are
                    commonly conducted by a long range of piping, in which they are cooled, to one
                    or a series of coke towers, in which they are exposed to an enormously extended
                    condensing surface of water trickling over the coke, stones, or brick with which
                    the interiors of the towers are filled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Black Ash Making.—</hi> The conversion of the crude sulphate or
                    salt cake into carbonate of soda, peculiarly the process of Le Blanc, is
                    conducted in what is termed a “balling furnace.” In its simplest form this
                    consists of a long reverberatory furnace in which the fuel occupies a lower
                    grating at one extremity of the flat sole, on which the whole reaction is
                    carried out. This sole has usually two beds, that more distant from the
                    fire-bridge being a little higher than the front division; and on front and back
                    beds two separate charges at different stages of advancement are treated
                    simultaneously. The salt-cake is taken as it comes from the roaster, mixed with
                    limestone or chalk (crushed to pieces not bigger than a walnut) and with coal or
                    anthracite in the form of slack or culm. The proportions of these ingredients
                    used in different works vary widely; but, generally stated, to each 100 parts of
                    sulphate there are added from 100 to 140 parts of chalk or limestone and from 40
                    to 70 of coal. These ingredients roughly mixed are passed by a hopper into the
                    back bed of the furnace, where they become dried and heated, while a previous
                    charge is being finished on the hot front or working bed. When the charge on the
                    working bed has been withdrawn, the mixture on the back bed is pushed forward
                    and spread over the highly heated sole. During the time it is exposed to the
                    flames the ball-furnaceman is constantly at work with a paddle or rake turning
                    over and exposing equally the whole charge to the action of the flame. Very soon
                    the mixture begins to soften and fuse on the surface, and by degrees the whole
                    mass assumes a stiff pasty form. Meantime bubbles of carbonic acid gas are
                    copiously given off, the material becoming of thinner consistence; but
                    afterwards the charge becomes again stiff, and carbonic oxide instead of
                    carbonic acid is evolved, which as it is given off burns in long pointed flames,
                    called “pipes” or “candles.” The copious appearance of these flames indicates
                    the completion of the operation, and the ball of black ash must now be withdrawn
                    without delay. The time required for working off a charge is from forty to fifty
                    minutes.</p>
                <p>The manual labour of black ash balling is extremely hard and trying, while it
                    demands for its success considerable judgment and experience. On these accounts
                    the efforts of manufacturers were early directed to the introduction of
                    mechanical furnaces; and in 1848 W. W. Pattinson patented a rotating
                    ball-furnace, which, however, owing to severe tear and wear, was unsuccessful.
                    Improvements on the revolving furnace were effected by Elliot &amp; Russell,
                    Stevenson &amp; Williamson, Mactear, and others, which have rendered the working
                    of revolvers a complete success. In its general features a revolver consists of
                    a large boiler-like cylinder of cast iron, lined internally with fire-bricks,
                    and suspended horizontally so that it can be made to rotate about its axis. One
                    of the two open ends communicates with a furnace, which sends its flame through
                    the cylinder. From the other end the hot gases are led away for evaporating
                    black-ash liquor. The cylinder is surmounted by a platform or railway from which
                    it receives the charge through a manhole in its side. The charge is made in two
                    separate instalments,—the whole of the chalk and two-thirds of the coal being
                    first introduced, and the cylinder slowly rotated till a portion of the chalk
                    has been burned to lime. Then the sulphate and the remainder of the coal, well
                    mixed, are added, the revolver going slowly at first, but more rapidly as the
                    end approaches, the whole balling being completed in from two to two and a half
                    hours. The manhole door being opened, the revolver is turned round to allow the
                    fluid black ash to pour out by it into a series of vessels placed beneath it.
                    Under Mactear’s improved process the whole of the charge is introduced into the
                    revolver at first, and after the decomposition is complete a small proportion of
                    caustic lime is thrown in and quickly mixed with the charge, which is thereon at
                    once drawn.</p>
                <p>The lixiviation of the black ash is conducted in a systematic manner so as to
                    extract all the soda with the minimum of water. The apparatus generally
                    employed—the Buff-Dunlop system—</p>
                <p>consists of a series of at least four tanks each provided with a false bottom and
                    two outlet pipes, and so arranged that the liquid part of the contents can be
                    made to flow from any one of the tanks into any other. The method of working
                    consists in making fresh water meet nearly exhausted ash, and the liquid,
                    passing on through the series of tanks and becoming gradually stronger, meets
                    ash less and less exhausted, till in the last tank of the series the watery
                    solution in its most concentrated state comes in contact with fresh black ash.
                    As soon as the ash in the first tank is completely exhausted the waste residue
                    is withdrawn and a fresh charge introduced. It then becomes the last of the
                    series, number two taking the first place; and so the work goes on in regular
                    rotation. The lye obtained is allowed to clear in large tanks, from which it is
                    drawn for evaporation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boiling Down.—</hi> The evaporation of the tank-liquor is
                    generally effected in flat iron pans, heated from the top by the waste heat of
                    the black-ash furnaces. So soon as a certain degree of concentration is passed,
                    soda begins to separate out in the form of granular crystals. These are ladled
                    out and allowed to drain for subsequent calcination and conversion into soda
                    ash. The purity of the granular salt decreases as the evaporation proceeds,
                    chloride and sulphate of sodium, with the sulphides of iron and sodium,
                    separating out with the carbonate. The red liquor which remains with the salt
                    owes its colour to the iron sulphide it contains. It is intensely caustic,
                    containing much caustic soda. In draining from the soda it carries off with it
                    much of the sulphide and minor impurities from the tanks. The impure soda
                    obtained from the evaporating pans is known as black salt and consists
                    essentially of a monohydrate, Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. A process for
                    evaporation from the bottom is also worked in Lancashire and on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carbonating.—</hi> Salts that are fished out of the evaporating
                    pan in the early stage of boiling down, being comparatively pure, require little
                    treatment for finishing as soda ash. They have simply to be dried at a moderate
                    heat to expel the water of crystallization. But with the ordinary black salt,
                    which contains a considerable amount of both caustic soda and sodium sulphide, a
                    special purifying and finishing treatment, called “carbonating,” has to be
                    adopted. For carbonating black salt the strong lye in the evaporating tanks is
                    mixed with sawdust and evaporated down to dryness. The mixture is then
                    introduced into a carbonating furnace, where the heat is gradually raised till
                    the whole of the sawdust it contains is burnt off, and by the agency of the
                    carbonic acid given off in its combustion the sulphide of sodium and the caustic
                    soda present are converted into carbonate. Mechanical carbonating furnaces have
                    been introduced, the most successful of which is that of Mactear, in which there
                    is a rotating circular hearth acted on by scrapers or ploughs. Ordinary soda ash
                    is at best an impure product containing always some caustic soda, which,
                    however, considering the purposes for which it is used, can scarcely be regarded
                    as an impurity or defect. Its value is determined by analysis and is calculated
                    from the amount of anhydrous soda (Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O) it
                    contains as carbonate or hydrate.</p>
                <p>In many soda-works the black-ash process is purposely so conducted as to produce
                    much caustic soda, and the red liquor is then worked up into caustic soda in the
                    following manner. It is first highly concentrated by boiling in a deep iron pan.
                    To the concentrated solution nitrate of soda is added, which decomposes the
                    sulphide present with evolution of ammonia and formation of sulphate, thus Na
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S + NaNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + NaHO. The
                    evaporation is continued till practically all the water is expelled, and the
                    heat is forced till fusion sets in. Then the remaining sulphide of sodium with
                    the cyanide is oxidized by the nitrate, which breaks up thus—2NaNO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + 2N + 5O, with
                    formation of sulphate of soda and oxide of iron. Part of the carbon of the
                    cyanogen separates as graphite (Pauli). The fused mass is allowed to stand, when
                    the suspended matter, including, singularly, most of the alumina, settles down,
                    leaving a perfectly clear liquid, which is run into iron drums, where it
                    solidifies. By means of this process, which has been principally elaborated by
                    Herr Ph. Pauli of Höchst near Wiesbaden, a remarkably pure product can be
                    obtained from a very dirty liquor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refined Alkali.—</hi> Ordinary soda ash is sufficiently pure
                    for most purposes for which the alkali is required in bulk; but for glass
                    making, &amp;c., it is necessary to remove all traces of iron. For this purpose
                    the ash is dissolved in water, and if a well-carbonated ash is under treatment
                    it is merely well agitated and allowed to stand quietly till impurities settle.
                    By some manufacturers a small amount of carbonate of lime is added to the
                    settling tank to carry down the impurities. Ash containing iron salts, sulphide,
                    and coloured impurities is treated with a small proportion of chloride of lime
                    to oxidize the iron and cause its precipitation as hydrated ferric oxide. The
                    settled liquor is boiled down, the crystals drained, dried, and heated in a
                    reverberatory furnace, and finally ground for the market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soda Crystals</hi> (washing soda) are similarly prepared, by
                    forming a strong solution of soda ash, allowing the liquor to settle, and
                    running it into large coolers or crystallizing cones, in which the crystals form
                    in from one to two weeks, according to the coolness of the position. When the
                    crystallization is complete the crust is<pb break="no"

                    amount of soda, is run off for future use, and the crystals are broken up,
                    drained, and dried for packing and use. Soda crystals contain 63 per cent. of
                    water, and their principal employment is for domestic washing, for which their
                    comparative non-causticity well fits them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sulphur Recovery.—</hi> Of the several raw materials of the Le
                    Blanc process, sulphur, now always used in the form of pyrites, is by far the
                    most expensive. The sulphuric acid employed passes out in valueless combination
                    as crude sulphide of calcium, and accumulates in huge mounds. Under the
                    influence of rain sulphide of calcium in these heaps gradually assumes the forms
                    of sulphide of hydrogen and hydrated oxide of calcium,—CaS + 2H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = CaOH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S. The hydrogen sulphide combines in its turn with
                    another quantity of sulphide of calcium into CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which being soluble in water runs off as yellow
                    liquor to contaminate streams and give off sulphuretted hydrogen gas with its
                    disgusting smell. By the action of atmospheric oxygen part of the CaS <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> loses its hydrogen as
                    water, and the remaining CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> passes into
                    thiosulphate of calcium, CaS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>, with simultaneous formation of polysulphides. Upon this latter
                    tendency Mond founded his original method for recovering sulphur. He hastened
                    the oxidation by blowing air through the moist waste till a certain proportion
                    of the sulphide was converted into thiosulphate, and the residue into
                    sulphhydrate CaH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, or
                    polysulphide. The mass is lixiviated with water, the liquor decanted off, and
                    mixed with excess of hydrochloric acid, which produces H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> S, and in general sulphur, from the sulphhydrate and sulphides of
                    calcium, with SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and sulphur from the thiosulphate.
                    But 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S + SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    decompose each other into 3S + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Hence it is
                    obvious that, if the process of oxidation is stopped at the right point, the
                    whole of the sulphur will be recovered as such. The precipitated sulphur is
                    mixed with water placed in a closed cylinder and fused by raising the
                    temperature of water round it in an outer casing above the melting point of
                    sulphur. The sulphur then runs together in the lower part of the cylinder,
                    whence it is drawn off by a pipe and cast into rolls. The Mond process, of all
                    the many sulphur-recovery processes yet introduced, is the best; but even it no
                    more than pays working expenses, and enables the manufacturer to end his process
                    with an innocuous chloride of calcium (CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)
                    without actual loss of money.</p>
                <p>About 1880 considerable excitement was caused by a sulphur-recovery process
                    patented by Schaffner aud Helbig in 1878, which was expected to revolutionize
                    the soda trade. As these hopes have not been realized, we merely state the
                    principle of the process. The soda waste is digested with a solution of chloride
                    of magnesium, which in the first instance leads to the formation of CaCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and MgS. But the latter is at once decomposed, with
                    formation of magnesia and sulphuretted hydrogen,—MgS + 2H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O = MgOH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    S. The sulphuretted hydrogen is caused to act on sulphurous acid within a
                    solution of chloride of calcium, when the sulphur settles in a filtrable form.
                    The liquor remaining after the expulsion of H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> S
                    from the mixture of waste and chloride of magnesium consists of a precipitate of
                    magnesia and a solution of chloride of calcium. By blowing carbonic acid into
                    the mixture the following decomposition is effected—MgO + CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = CaCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + MgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> —so that the
                    magnesium is recovered in its original form and the calcium of the waste
                    obtained as carbonate, which may again be returned to the black ash roaster.
                    This very pretty and complete process might probably have been worked out as a
                    practical success had the conviction not arisen that even with profitable
                    sulphur recovery the Le Blanc process will not long be able to hold its own
                    against the ammonia process.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ammonia Soda Process.—</hi> This process is based on the fact
                    that bicarbonate of ammonia, when added to a strong solution of common salt,
                    decomposes the salt with formation of a precipitate of bicarbonate of soda and a
                    solution of ammonium chloride (sal-ammoniac), thus NaCl + (NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>)HCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> C1 + NaHCO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The ammonia is
                    recoverable from the sal-ammoniac by distillation with lime, and, supposing no
                    waste to occur, is usable <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum.</hi> From bicarbonate
                    the normal salt is easily prepared by the application of heat —2NaHCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = Na <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> CO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Thus by theory one-half of the carbonic acid is
                    recovered, and, supposing the quicklime for the decomposition of the
                    sal-ammoniac to be made by heating limestone, the loss of carbonic acid is made
                    up incidentally from that source. The only waste product which remains for
                    disposal is the entirely innocuous chloride of calcium made in recovering
                    ammonia by means of lime from sal-ammoniac. The ammonia process was first
                    enunciated and patented in England by Dyar &amp; Hemming in 1833; and works on
                    the system were established in Cheshire and some localities on the Continent,
                    where it attracted great attention. Numerous patents, both English and
                    Continental, followed, and many experimental works were erected, which all
                    failed to sustain themselves in competition with the Le Blanc works. The
                    principal difficulties to be overcome were imperfect conversion of the salt, and
                    more especially the loss of ammonia; and it was not till 1861 that real
                    economical success in the ammonia recovery apparatus was attained by Ernest
                    Solvay of Couillet near Charleroi, Belgium. Works on the Solvay principle were
                    established at Couillet in 1863; and since that date by the inventor and others,
                    among whom ought to be men tioned Ludwig Mond, the process has been so perfected
                    that its general adoption now appears to be only a matter of time. Already on
                    the Continent it has practically displaced the Le Blanc process, but in the
                    United Kingdom there is as yet only one establishment manufacturing ammonia
                    soda.</p>
                <p>The first essential stage in Solvay’s process consists in saturating the brine
                    with ammonia. The brine, treated with milk of lime and ammonium carbonate to
                    precipitate magnesium and calcium salts, and of proper density, is placed in two
                    cylindrical close iron tanks, which communicate by pipes at top and bottom with
                    the ammonia dissolver placed between them. The ammonia dissolver is a
                    cylindrical vessel having the same height as the tanks and provided with a
                    perforated false bottom, down to which a tube is led through the centre of the
                    vessel, and by this tube the ammonia gas is introduced. Coiled within the
                    cylinder is a worm pipe, through which cold water circulates. Each brine tank is
                    put alternately in connexion with the dissolver. Circulation from the brine tank
                    into the dissolver is kept up by mechanical agitation. As the ammonia becomes
                    absorbed by the brine the temperature of the liquid rises rapidly, and the cold
                    water circulating within the coiled pipe keeps the temperature down. As soon as
                    sufficient ammonia lias been passed into the brine the stirrers in the brine
                    tank are stopped; the sludge of lime and magnesia precipitate is drawn off as it
                    settles at the bottom of the brine tank, or when such precipitate is abundant it
                    is settled and withdrawn in a special decanting tank. The decanted liquor is
                    filtered through fine cloth by pressure, and the filtrate is cooled down in a
                    refrigerating apparatus previous to the next operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treating the Ammoniacal Brine with Carbonic Acid.—</hi> For
                    this purpose a cylindrical tower is employed, divided internally into a series
                    of superimposed segments by diaphragms consisting of perforated dome-shaped
                    plates. The tower is about 40 to 50 feet in height and is kept nearly full of
                    liquid, which is introduced by a pipe half way up its side. Carbonic acid under
                    a pressure 1·5 to 2 atmospheres is forced in at the bottom of the tower and
                    works its way gradually upwards through the perforations in the diaphragms, thus
                    coming into intimate contact with the ammoniacal brine. Every half hour a part
                    of the pasty mixture of bicarbonate of soda and ammonium chloride solution is
                    drawn off and replaced by fresh liquor. The solid bicarbonate is separated out
                    either by centrifugal action or by a vacuum filter; as thus obtained it is still
                    contaminated with ammonia, of which it smells. To free the bicarbonate from this
                    impurity water is squirted over it till the smell almost entirely
                    disappears.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conversion into Soda Ash</hi> of the bicarbonate is essential,
                    because there is a comparatively limited demand for bicarbonate, and that salt,
                    moreover, obstinately retains an ammoniacal odour, which lessens its value. The
                    preparation of soda ash is attended with considerable practical difficulties,
                    owing to the necessity of retaining the contained ammonia. The bicarbonate is
                    first exposed to a comparatively low heat in a closed roaster, after which it is
                    finished in a muffle furnace at a bright red heat. The gases given off are drawn
                    by an air-pump into a washing apparatus, where the ammonia is retained, and the
                    carbonic acid, which passes on, is conducted to the absorption tower for again
                    impregnating the ammoniacal brine. By this process the whole of the chlorine of
                    common salt comes away as waste in the form of chloride of calcium. To obtain
                    that body in combination as hydrochloric acid, Solvay proposed in his patent of
                    1872 to employ magnesia in place of lime in the decomposition of the
                    sal-ammoniac, the solution of chloride of magnesium remaining after the
                    distillation is boiled to dryness, and being by the action of steam separated
                    into magnesia and hydrochloric acid,—MgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = MgO + 2HC1. The magnesia theoretically works in a
                    circle, being changed into chloride on the liberation of the ammonia from the
                    sal-ammoniac, and recovered again as magnesia with the formation of hydrochloric
                    acid, as above indicated. But the expense of the process has hitherto been
                    greater than the value of the product obtained, and the one weak point of the
                    Solvay process is the loss of the hydrochloric acid, which forms an important
                    element in the Le Blanc cycle. The loss of ammonia calculated as sulphate in the
                    early days of the Solvay process was as much as 9 per cent. on the carbonate of
                    soda produced; but by successive improvements it has been reduced to not more
                    than 5 per cent. The Solvay plant is very expensive, amounting, according to his
                    own estimate, to £1600 per ton of soda ash produced daily; but other authorities
                    put the capital expenditure as high as £2400 per ton worked daily.</p>

                    above mentioned, which have been proposed for soda-making, the only one
                    practically employed is that in which cryolite forms the raw material. Cryolite,
                    a fluoride of aluminium and sodium, A1F <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 3NaF, is
                    a mineral substance found in extensive deposits at Ivikat (Ivigtut) (61° 34' N.
                    lat.) in south-west Greenland. For sodamaking the mineral is treated by a
                    process discovered in 1850 by Professor Julius Thomsen of Copenhagen. It is
                    ignited with chalk or limestone, whereby carbonic acid is driven off and
                    fluoride of calcium and aluminate of soda are formed—2(AlF <hi rend="subscript">

                    by lixiviation, and the solution so obtained is decomposed by treatment with
                    carbonic acid, which produces a precipitate of alumina available for
                    alum-making, &amp;c., leaving a solution of carbonate of soda. About 8000 tons
                    of cryolite are annually treated in Pennsylvania and in Denmark.</p>
