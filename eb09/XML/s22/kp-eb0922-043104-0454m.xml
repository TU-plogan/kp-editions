                    His father, Andrew Spottiswoode, who was descended from an ancient Scottish
                    family, represented Colchester in parliament for some years, and in 1831 became
                    junior partner in the firm of Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, printers. William was
                    educated at Laleham, Eton, Harrow, and Balliol College, Oxford. His bent for
                    science showed itself while he was still a schoolboy, and indeed his removal
                    from Eton to Harrow is said to have been occasioned by an accidental explosion
                    which occurred whilst he was performing an experiment for his own amusement. At
                    Harrow he obtained in 1842 a Lyon scholarship, and at Oxford in 1845 a
                    first-class in mathematics, in 1846 the junior and in 1847 the senior university
                    mathematical scholarship. In 1846 Spottiswoode left Oxford to take his father’s
                    place in the business, in which he was engaged until his death. In 1847 he
                    issued five pamphlets entitled <hi rend="italic">Meditationes Analytics,.</hi>
                    This was his first publication of original mathematical work; and from this time
                    scarcely a year passed in which he did not give to the world further
                    mathematical researches. In 1856 Spottiswoode travelled in eastern Russia, and
                    in 1860 in Croatia and Hungary; of the former expedition he has left an
                    interesting record entitled <hi rend="italic">A Tarantasse Journey through
                    Eastern Russia in the Autumn of 1856</hi> (London, 1857). In 1870 he was elected
                    president of the London Mathematical Society. In 1871 he began to turn his
                    attention to experimental physics, his earlier researches bearing upon the
                    polarization of light and his later work upon the electrical discharge in
                    rarefied gases. He wrote a popular treatise upon the former subject for the
                    “Nature” series (1874). In 1878 he was elected president of the British
                    Association, and in the same year president of the Royal Society, of which he
                    had been a fellow since 1853. He died of fever on 27th June 1883, and was buried
                    in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>As a mathematician he occupied himself with many branches of his favourite
                    science, more especially with higher algebra, including the theory of
                    determinants, with the general calculus of symbols, and with the application of
                    analysis to geometry and mechanics. The following brief review of his
                    mathematical work is quoted from the obituary notice which appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</hi> (vol. xxxviii. p. 34):—“The
                    interesting series of communications on the contact of curves and surfaces which
                    are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of 1862
                    and<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n455/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0455-0432"/> subsequent years would alone account for the high
                    rank he obtained as a mathematician. . . . The mastery which he had obtained
                    over the mathematical symbols was so complete that he never shrank from the use
                    of expressions, however complicated—nay, the more complicated they were the more
                    he seemed to revel in them—provided they did not sin against the ruling spirit
                    of all his work,— symmetry. To a mind imbued with the love of mathematical
                    symmetry the study of determinants had naturally every attraction. In 1851 Mr
                    Spottiswoode published in the form of a pamphlet an account of some elementary
                    theorems on the subject. This having fallen out of print, permission was sought
                    by the editor of <hi rend="italic">Crelle</hi> to reproduce it in the pages of
                    that journal. Mr Spottiswoode granted the request and undertook to revise his
                    work. The subject had, however, been so extensively developed in the interim
                    that it proved necessary not merely to revise it but entirely to rewrite the
                    work, which became a memoir of 116 pages. To this, the first elementary treatise
                    on determinants, much of the rapid development of the subject is due. The effect
                    of the study on Mr Spottiswoode’s own methods was most pronounced; there is
                    scarcely a page of his mathematical writings that does not bristle with
                    determinants.” The Royal Society’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Scientific
                    Papers</hi> (vols. i. - viii. ) shows a list of 49 papers by Spottiswoode, to
                    which must be added about 66 more, the titles of which have not yet been printed
                    in that catalogue. These were published principally in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions, Proceedings of the Royal Society, Quarterly Journal
                    of Mathematics, Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Crelle,</hi> aud one or two in the <hi rend="italic">Comptes
                    Rendus</hi> of the Paris Academy. Another list of his papers, arranged according
                    to the several journals in which they originally appeared, with short notes upon
                    the less familiar memoirs, is given in <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> vol.
