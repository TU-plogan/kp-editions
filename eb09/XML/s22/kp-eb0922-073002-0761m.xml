                    highly esteemed for the table, and it was under especial enactments for its
                    preservation, and regarded as a “Bird Royal” that no subject could possess
                    without licence from the crown, the granting of which licence was accompanied by
                    the condition that every bird in a “game” (to use the old legal term) of Swans
                    should bear a distinguishing mark of ownership (<hi rend="italic"
                    >cygninota)</hi> on the bill. Originally this privilege was conferred on the
                    larger freeholders only, but it was gradually extended, so that in the reign of
                    Elizabeth upwards of 900 distinct Swan-marks, being those of private persons or
                    corporations, were recognized by the royal Swanherd, whose jurisdiction extended
                    over the whole kingdom. It is impossible here to enter into further details on
                    this subject, interesting as it is from various points of view.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At the present time the Queen
                    and the Companies of Dyers and Vintners still maintain their Swans on the
                    Thames, and a yearly expedition is made in the month of August to take up the
                    young birds—thence called “Swan-upping” and corruptly “Swan-hopping” —and mark
                    them. The largest Swannery in England, indeed the only one worthy of the name,
                    is that belonging to Lord Ilchester, on the water called the Fleet, lying inside
                    the Chesil Bank on the coast of Dorset, where from 700 to double that number of
                    birds may be kept—a stock doubtless too great for the area, but very small when
                    compared with the numbers that used to be retained on various rivers in the
                    country. The Swanpit at Norwich seems to be the only place now existing for
                    fattening the Cygnets for the table—an expensive process, but one fully
                    appreciated by those who have tasted the results. The English Swan-laws and
                    regulations have been concisely but admirably treated by the late Serjeant
                    Manning <hi rend="italic">(Penny Cyclopaedia,</hi> xxiii. pp. 271, 272), and the
                    subject of Swan-marks, elucidated by unpublished materials in the British Museum
                    and other libraries, is one of which a compendious account, from an antiquarian
                    and historical point of view, would be very desirable.</p></note> It is enough
                    to remark that all the legal protection afforded to the Swan points out that it
                    was not indigenous to the British Islands, and indeed it is stated (though on
                    uncertain authority) to have been introduced to England in the reign of Richard
                    Coeur de Lion; but it is now so perfectly naturalized that birds having the full
                    power of flight remain in the country. There is no evidence to shew that its
                    numbers are ever increased by immigration from abroad, though it is known to
                    breed as a wild bird not further from our shores than the extreme south of
                    Sweden and possibly in Denmark, whence it may be traced, but with considerable
                    vacuities, in a southeasterly direction to the valley of the Danube and the
                    western part of Central Asia. In Europe, however, no definite limits can be
                    assigned for its natural range, since birds more or less reclaimed and at
                    liberty consort with those that are truly wild, and either induce them to settle
                    in localities beyond its boundary, or of themselves occupy such localities, so
                    that no difference is observable between them and their untamed brethren. From
                    its breeding-grounds, whether they be in Turkestan, in south-eastern Europe, or
                    Scania, the Swan migrates southward towards winter, and at that season may be
                    found in north-western India (though rarely), in Egypt, and on the shores of the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>The Swan just spoken of is by some naturalists named the Mute or Tame Swan, to
                    distinguish it from one to be presently mentioned, but it is the Swan simply of
                    the English language and literature. Scientifically it is usually known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Cygnus olor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C. mansuetus.</hi> It needs
                    little description: its large size, its spotless white plumage, its red bill,
                    surmounted by a black knob (technically the “berry ”) larger in the male than in
                    the female, its black legs and stately appearance on the water are familiar,
                    either from figures innumerable or from direct observation, to almost every one.
                    When left to itself its nest is a large mass of aquatic plants, often piled to
                    the height of a couple of feet and possibly some six feet in diameter. In the
                    midst of this is a hollow which contains the eggs, generally from five to nine
                    in number, of a greyish-olive colour. The period of incubation is between five
                    and six weeks, and the young when hatched are clothed in sooty-grey down, which
                    is succeeded by feathers of dark sooty-brown. This suit is gradually replaced by
                    white, but the young birds are more than a twelvemonth old before they lose all
                    trace of colouring and become wholly white.</p>
                <p>It was, however, noticed by Plot <hi rend="italic">(N. H. Staffordshire,</hi> p.
                    228) 200 years and more ago that certain Swans on the Trent had white Cygnets;
                    and it was subsequently observed of such birds that both parents and progeny had
                    legs of a paler colour, while the young had not the blue bill” of ordinary Swans
                    at the same age that has in some parts of the country given them a name, besides
                    offerιng a few other minor differences. These being examined by Yarrell led him
                    to announce <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1838, p. 19) the birds
                    presenting them as forming a distinct species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    immutabilis,</hi> to which the English name of “Polish” Swan had already been
                    attached by the London poulterers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    attributing this name to the <hi rend="italic">“fourreurs</hi>” (furriers) of
                    London, and of reading it <hi rend="italic">“Cygne du pôle”</hi> (polar, and not

                    exists as to their bearing in regard to the validity of the so-called “species.”
                    Though apparently wild birds, answering fairly to the description, occasionally
                    occur in hard winters in Britain and some parts of the European Continent,<note

                    not yet been ascertained,—for the epithet "Polish" is but fanciful,—and most of
                    the information respecting them is derived only from reclaimed examples, which
                    are by no means common. Those examined by Yarrell are said to have been
                    distinctly smaller than common Swans, but those recognized of late years are as
                    distinctly larger. The matter requires much more investigation, and it may be
                    remarked that occasionally Swans, so far as is known of the ordinary stock, will
                    produce one or more Cygnets differing from the rest of the brood exactly in the
                    characters which have been assigned to the so-called Polish Swans as
                    specific—namely, their white plumage slightly tinged with buff, their pale legs,
                    and flesh-coloured bill. It may be that here we have a case of far greater
                    interest than the mere question of specific distinction,<note anchored="true"

                <p>Thus much having been said of the bird which is nowadays commonly called Swan,
                    and of its allied form, we must turn to other species, and first to one that
                    anciently must have been the exclusive bearer in England of the name. This is
                    the Whooper, Whistling, or Wild Swan<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    or <hi rend="italic">C. ferus</hi> of most authors, which was doubtless always a
                    wintervisitant to this country, and, though nearly as bulky and quite as purely
                    white in its adult plumage, is at once recognizable from the species which has
                    been half domesticated by its wholly different but equally graceful carriage,
                    and its bill—which is black at the tip and lemon-yellow for a great part of its
                    base. This entirely distinct species is a native of Iceland, eastern Lapland,
                    and northern Russia, whence it wanders southward in autumn, and the musical
                    tones it utters (contrasting with the silence that has caused its relative to be
                    often called the Mute Swan) have been celebrated from the time of Homer to our
                    own. Otherwise in a general way there is little difference between the habits of
                    the two, and very closely allied to the Whooper is a much smaller species, with
                    very well marked characteristics, known as Bewick’s Swan, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    bewicki.</hi> This was first indicated as a variety of the last by Pallas, but
                    its specific validity is now fully established. Apart from size, it may be
                    externally distinguished from the Whooper by the bill having only a small patch
                    of yellow, which inclines to an orange rather than a lemon tint; while
                    internally the difference of the vocal organs is well marked, and its cry,
                    though melodious enough, is unlike. It has a more easterly home in the north
                    than the Whooper, but in winter not unfrequently occurs in Britain.</p>
                <p>Both the species last mentioned have their representatives in North America, and
                    in each case the trans-Atlantic bird is considerably larger than that of the Old
                    World. The first is the Trumpeter-Swan, <hi rend="italic">C. buccinator,</hi>
                    which has the bill wholly black, and the second the <hi rend="italic">C.

                    Falkland Islands, is the smallest species known,—pure white in colour except the

                    >Voyage</hi> (p. 52). It was subsequently found on the Falkland Islands during
                    the French settlement there in 1764-65, as stated by Pernetty <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Voyage,</hi> ed. 2, ii. pp. 26, 99), and was first technically described in

                    234, 344). Its range seems to be much the same as that of the Cascaroba, except
                    that it comes further to the northward, to the coast of southern Brazil on the
                    east, and perhaps into Bolivia on the west. It is a very handsome bird, of large
                    size, with a bright red nasal knob, a black neck, and the rest of its plumage
                    pure white. It has been introduced into Europe, and breeds freely in
                    confinement.</p>
                <p>A greater interest than attaches to the South-American birds last mentioned is
                    that which invests the Black Swan of Australia. Considered for so many centuries
                    to be an impossibility, the knowledge of its existence seems to have impressed
                    (more perhaps than anything else) the popular mind with the notion of the
                    extreme divergence—not to say the contrariety—of the organic products of that
                    country. By a singular stroke of fortune we are able to name the precise day on
                    which this unexpected discovery was made. The Dutch navigator Willem de Vlaming,
                    visiting the west coast of Zuidland (Southland), sent two of his boats on the
                    6th of January 1697 to explore an estuary he had found. There their crews saw at
                    first two and then more Black Swans, of which they caught four, taking two of
                    them alive to Batavia; and Valentyn, who several years later recounted this
                    voyage, gives in his work<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    representing the ship, boats, and birds, at the mouth of what is now known from
                    this circumstance as Swan River, the most important stream of the thriving
                    colony of West Australia, which has adopted this very bird as its armorial
                    symbol. Valentyn, however, was not the first to publish this interesting
                    discovery. News of it soon reached Amsterdam, and the burgomaster of that city,
                    Witsen by name, himself a fellow of the Royal Society, lost no time in
                    communicating the chief facts ascertained, and among them the finding of the
                    Black Swans, to Martin Lister, by whom they were laid before that society in
                    October 1698, and printed in its <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> (xx. p. 361). Subsequent voyagers, Cook and others, found that
                    the range of the species extended over the greater part of Australia, in many
                    districts of which it was abundant. It has since rapidly decreased in numbers,
                    and will most likely soon cease to exist as a wild bird, but its singular and
                    ornamental appearance will probably preserve it as a modified captive in most
                    civilized countries, and perhaps even now there are more Black Swans in a
                    reclaimed condition in other lands than are at large in their mother-country.
                    The species scarcely needs description: the sooty black of its general plumage
                    is relieved by the snowy white of its flight-feathers and its coral-like bill
                    banded with ivory.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cygninae</hi> admittedly form a well-defined group of the
                    Family <hi rend="italic">Anatidae,</hi> and there is now no doubt as to its
                    limits, except in the case of the Cascaroba above mentioned. This bird would
                    seem to be, as is so often found in members of the South-American fauna, a more
                    generalized form, presenting several characteristics of the <hi rend="italic"

                    penetration of the sternum by the trachea nearly to the posterior end of the
                    keel, whence it returns forward and upward again to revert and enter the lungs;
                    but in the two larger of these species, when adult, the loop of the trachea
                    between the walls of the keel takes a vertical direction, while in the two
                    smaller the bend is horizontal, thus affording an easy mode of recognizing the
                    respective species of each.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The correct scientific nomenclature of the Swans is a matter that offers
                    many difficulties, but they are of a kind far too technical to have any interest
                    for the general reader. Dr Stejneger, in his learned “Outlines of a Monograph”
                    of the group (<hi rend="italic">ut supra),</hi> has employed much research on
                    the subject, with the result (which can only be deemed unhappy) of upsetting
                    nearly all other views hitherto existing, and propounding some which few
                    ornithologists outside of his adopted country are likely to accept, since the
                    principles on which he has gone are not those commonly received, nor (it may
                    perhaps be added) are based on common sense. In the text, as above written, care
                    has been taken to use names which will cause little if any misunderstanding, and
                    this probably is all that can be said in the present state of
                    confusion.</p></note> Fossil remains of more than one species of Swan have been
