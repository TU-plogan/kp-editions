                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1506-1556), the annalist of the Reformation, was born at
                    Schleiden (now a small village in the Oleffthal, about 42 miles south-west of
                    Cologne) in 1506 or 1508. Passing from the village school, he studied at Liége,
                    Cologne (?), Louvain (where he became tutor to the son of Count Manderscheid of
                    Schleiden), Paris, and Orleans (where he studied law). In 1536 he became
                    secretary to Cardinal du Bellay, minister of Francis I., and spent five years
                    with him and with his brother Cardinal Guillaume du Bellay. The cardinals Du
                    Bellay belonged to that party among the French nobility who desired on political
                    grounds an alliance between the German Protestants and Francis against the
                    emperor Charles V., and who employed the leaders of the Strasburg citizens as
                    intermediaries. Sleidanus, whilst among the humanists of Liège, had adopted
                    Protestant opinions, had learned to distrust the Romanist policy of Charles V.,
                    and was himself a strong supporter on religious and political grounds of the
                    plans of the brothers Du Bellay. Their confidence in him was such that he was
                    sent (1540) to watch the conduct of the French ambassador at Hagenau, and this
                    brought him into personal relation with the German Protestant leaders. Next year
                    Du Bellay sent him to confer with the heads of the Schmalkaldic League, when he
                    found his patron’s ideas unacceptable. Philip of Hesse and the elector of Saxony
                    would make no alliance with a foreign power against the emperor, and distrusted
                    Francis personally because of his persecution of French Protestants. It is
                    possible that this news made Du Bellay feel that he had no further need for his
                    secretary, for we find Sleidanus leading a wandering life for two years, and
                    finally making Strasburg his home, although he still kept up a political
                    correspondence with France. Sleidanus had been accustomed to copy all documents
                    bearing upon the Reformation to which he had access, and Bucer, who had seen his
                    collection, proposed to Philip of Hesse to appoint him historian of the
                    Reformation, giving him a salary and access to all necessary documents. After
                    some delay the heads of the Schmalkaldic League agreed to Bucer’s proposal, and
                    Sleidanus began his great work and finished the first volume in 1545. In that
                    year he was again recalled to diplomacy and went to England in a French embassy
                    to Henry VIII. While there he diligently collected materials for his history. On
                    his return to Strasburg he was sent by that city as one of its representatives
                    to the diets of Frankfort and Worms; and thence he proceeded to Marburg to
                    explore the archives of Philip of Hesse. The Schmalkald War interfered with this
                    work and also prevented the payment of Sleidanus, who in his difficulties
                    applied to England for aid, and at Cranmer’s intercession received a yearly
                    pension (not long continued) from Edward VI. In 1551 Sleidanus went to the
                    council of Trent as representative from Strasburg, charged also with full powers
                    to act for the imperial cities Esslingen, Ravensburg, Reutlingen, Biberach, and
                    Lindau. On his return his friends got him appointed professor of law in
                    Strasburg, and he was once more able to give his whole attention to his great
                    work, which he finished for the press<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0174-0159"/> in 1554. But want of money, the death of his
                    wife— whom he had married in 1546 on his return from the diet of Frankfort — and
                    other misfortunes compelled him to delay printing. The book at length appeared,—
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentariorum de statu religionis et reipublicae, Carolo V.
                    Caesare, Libri XXVI.</hi> (translated into English by John Daws in 1560 and by
                    G. Bohum in 1689). But the troubles of Sleidanus were not ended. The work was
                    too impartial to please any one, and even the gentle Melanchthon was unable to
                    praise it. It remains notwithstanding the most valuable contemporary history of
                    the times of the Reformation, and contains the largest collection of important
                    documents. The author died at Strasburg in October 1556 in poverty, and
                    inconsolable since the death of his wife.</p>
