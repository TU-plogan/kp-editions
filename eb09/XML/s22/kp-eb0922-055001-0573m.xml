                    Theodosius, when dying, made Stilicho and Serena the guardians of Honorius and
                    his other children. Honorius, in 398, was married to Stilicho’s daughter Maria,
                    and in 408 to her sister Thermantia. It was by Stilicho that Alaric in 396 was
                    compelled to quit the Peloponnesus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alaric),</hi> and
                    that in 398 the revolt of the Mauretanian prince Gildo was repressed. Stilicho
                    again encountered Alaric at Pollentia in 402, and at Verona in 403, compelling
                    his retreat into Illyria, and was rewarded with a triumph on his return to Rome.
                    In 405 he almost annihilated the army of Radagaisus, the leader of the
                    Ostrogoths, at Fiesole. The arrangements into which he subsequently entered with
                    Alaric (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alaric)</hi> were made use of by his enemies to
                    alienate the emperor from him, and when at last revolt was the only course that
                    might possibly have saved him his continued loyalty proved fatal. Abandoned by
                    his troops he fled to Ravenna, and, having been induced by false promises to
                    quit the church in which he had taken sanctuary, he was beheaded on August 23,
                    408. Stilicho is the hero of much of the poetry of <hi rend="smallcaps"
