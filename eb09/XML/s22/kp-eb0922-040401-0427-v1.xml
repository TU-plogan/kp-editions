                        rend="italic">Speier),</hi> the chief town of the Rhenish palatinate,
                    Bavaria, and formerly a free imperial city, is situated on the left bank of the
                    Rhine, at the mouth of the Speyerbach, 21 miles to the south of Worms. The
                    principal streets are broad but irregular, and the general appearance of the
                    town little corresponds to its high antiquity, owing to the fact that it was
                    burned by the French in 1689. The only important ancient building that has
                    survived the flames is the cathedral, a very large and imposing basilica of red
                    sandstone, and one of the noblest examples of Romanesque architecture now
                    extant. Beyond the general interest attaching to it as one of the old</p>
                <p>Romanesque churches of the Rhineland, Spires cathedral has a peculiar importance
                    in the history of architecture as probably the earliest Romanesque basilica in
                    which the nave as well as the side arcades was vaulted from the first. Built in
                    1030-61 by Conrad II. and his successor, this church has had a chequered
                    history, its disasters culminating in 1689, when the soldiers of Louis XIV.
                    burned it to the bare walls and scattered the ashes of the eight German emperors
                    who had been interred in the kings’ choir. Restored in 1772-84 and provided with
                    a vestibule and façade, it was again desecrated by the French in 1794; but in
                    1846-53 it was once more thoroughly restored and adorned in the interior with
                    gorgeous frescos at the expense of the king of Bavaria. The large cathedral bowl
                    (Domnapf) in front of the west façade formerly marked the boundary between the
                    episcopal and municipal territories. Each new bishop on his election had to fill
                    the bowl with wine, while the burghers emptied it to his health. The heathen
                    tower to the east of the church, on foundations supposed to be Roman, was
                    probably part of the town wall built in 1080 by Bishop Rudger. Of the Retscher,
                    or imperial palace, so called because built after the model of the Hradschin at
                    Prague, only a mouldering fragment of wall remains. It was in this palace that
                    the famous diet of Spires met in 1529, at which the Reformers first received the
                    name of Protestants. The Altpörtel (alta porta), a fine old gateway of 1246, is
                    a relic of the free imperial city. Among the modern buildings are several
                    churches and schools, a museum and picture gallery, Ac. Spires, although rebuilt
                    in 1697, has never recovered from the cruel injuries inflicted by the French in
                    1689. Its trade is insignificant, although it still has a free harbour on the
                    Rhine. Its manufactures include paper, tobacco and cigars, sugar, sugar of lead,
                    vinegar, beer, and leather. Vines and tobacco are grown in the neighbourhood.
                    The population in 1880 was 15,589 and in 1885 16,228.</p>
                <p>Spires, known to the Romans as <hi rend="italic">Augusta Nemetum</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Nemetae,</hi> and to the Gauls as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Naνiomagus,</hi> is one of the oldest towns on the Rhine. The modern name
                    appears first, under the form Spira, about the 7th century. Captured by Julius
                    Caesar in 47 B.c., it was repeatedly destroyed by the barbarian hordes in the
                    first few centuries of the Christian era. The town had become an episcopal seat
                    in the 4th century; but heathenism supervened, and the present bishopric dates
                    from 610. In 830 Spira became part of the Frankish empire, the emperors having a
                    “palatium” here; and it was especially favoured by the Salic imperial house. The
                    contentions between the bishops and the citizens were as obstinate and severe as
                    in any other city of Germany. The situation of the town opposite the mouths of
                    several roads through the Rhine valley early fostered its trade; in 1294 it rose
                    to be a free imperial city, although it owned no territory beyond its walls and
                    had a population of less than 30,000. It enjoyed great renown as the seat of the
                    imperial supreme court from 1527 till 1689; it was fifth among the free cities
                    of the Rhine, and had a vote in the Upper Rhenish diet. Numerous imperial diets
                    assembled here. From 1801 till 1814 it was the capital of a department of
                    France; but it was restored to Bavaria in the latter year. By the peace of
                    Spires in 1544 the Hapsburgs renounced their claims to the crown of
                    Sardinia.</p>
