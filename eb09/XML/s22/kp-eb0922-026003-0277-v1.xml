                    (1780-1872), scientific writer, was the daughter of Admiral Sir William George
                    Fairfax, and was born 26th December 1780 in the manse of Jedburgh, the house of
                    her mother’s sister, wife of Dr Thomas Somerville, author of <hi rend="italic"
                        >My Own Life and Times,</hi> whose son was her second husband. She received
                    a rather desultory education, and mastered algebra and Euclid in secret after
                    she had left school, and without any extraneous help. In 1804 she married her
                    cousin Captain Samuel Greig, who died in 1806; and in 1812 she married another
                    cousin, Dr William Somerville, inspector of the army medical board, who
                    encouraged and greatly aided her in the study of the physical sciences. After
                    her marriage she made the acquaintance on the Continent and in London of the
                    most eminent scientific men of the time, among whom her talents had attracted
                    attention before she had acquired general fame, Laplace paying her the
                    compliment of stating that she was the only woman who understood his works.
                    Having been requested by Lord Brougham to translate for the Society for the
                    Diffusion of Useful Knowledge the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Celeste</hi> of
                    Laplace, she greatly popularized its form, and its publication in 1831 under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">The Mechanism of the Heavens</hi> at once made her
                    famous. She was elected an honorary member of the Royal Astronomical Society,
                    and her bust by Chantrey was placed in the hall of the Royal Society of London.
                    Her other works are the <hi rend="italic">Connection of the Physical
                        Sciences</hi> (1834), <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography</hi> (1848), and
                        <hi rend="italic">Molecular and Microscopic Science</hi> (1869). Much of the
                    popularity of her writings is due to their clear and crisp style, and the
                    underlying enthusiasm for her subject which pervades them. In 1835 she received
                    a pension of £300 from Government. She died at Naples 28th November 1872. In the
                    following year there appeared her <hi rend="italic">Personal Recollections,</hi>
