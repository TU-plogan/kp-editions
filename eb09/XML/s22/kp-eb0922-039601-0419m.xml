                    riotous, until Plato’s example led him to reform his ways. In later life he was
                    conspicuously temperate and amiable. He was succeeded by Xenocrates.</p>
                <p>Of Speusippus’s many philosophical writings nothing survives except a fragment of
                    a treatise <hi rend="italic">On Pythagorean Numbers.</hi> Nor have secondary
                    authorities preserved to us any general statement or conspectus of his system.
                    Incidentally, however, we learn the following details. (A) In regard to his
                    theory of being,—(1) whereas Plato postulated as the basis of his system a cause
                    which should be at once Unity, Good, and Mind, Speusippus distinguished Unity,
                    the origin of things, from Good, their end, and both Unity and Good from
                    controlling Mind or Reason; (2) whereas Plato recognized three kinds of numbers—
                    firstly, ideal numbers, the formal causes of the ideas; secondly, mathematical
                    numbers, the abstractions of mathematics; and thirdly, sensible numbers, numbers
                    embodied in things—Speusippus rejected the ideal numbers, and consequently the
                    ideas; (3) Speusippus traced number, magnitude, and soul each to a distinct
                    principle of its own.</p>
                <p>(B) In regard to his theory of knowledge,—(4) he held that a thing cannot be
                    known apart from the knowledge of all things besides; for, that we may know what
                    a thing is, we must know how it differs from other things, which other things
                    must therefore be known; (5) accordingly, in the ten books of a work called Ὅ
                    <hi rend="italic">μοια</hi>, he attempted a classification of plants and
                    animals; (6) the results thus obtained he distinguished at once from “knowledge”
                    (<hi rend="italic">ἐπιστήμη</hi>) and from “sensation” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >αἴσθησις</hi>), holding that “scientific observation” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >ἐπιστημovικὴ αἴσθησις</hi>), though it cannot attain to truth, may
                    nevertheless, in virtue of a certain acquired tact, frame “definitions”
                    (λόγοι).</p>
                <p>(C) In regard to his theory of ethics,—(7) he denied that pleasure was a good,
                    but seemingly was not prepared to account it an evil.</p>
                <p>In default of direct evidence, it remains for us to compare these scattered
                    notices of Speusippus’s teaching with what we know of its original, the teaching
                    of Plato, in the hope of obtaining at least a general notion, firstly, of
                    Speusippus’s system, and, secondly, of its relations to the systems of Plato, of
                    contemporary Platonists, such as Aristotle, and of the later Academy.</p>
                <p>It has been suggested elsewhere <hi rend="smallcaps">(Socrates,</hi> p, 238 <hi
                    rend="italic">supra)</hi> that the crude and unqualified “realism” of Plato’s
                    early manhood gave place in his later years to a theory of natural kinds founded
                    upon a “thoroughgoing idealism,” and that in this way he was led to recognize
                    and to value the classificatory sciences of zoology and botany. More exactly, it
                    may be said that the Platonism of Plato’s maturity included the following
                    principal doctrines :—(i.) the supreme cause of all existence is the One, the
                    Good, Mind, which evolves itself as the universe under certain eternal immutable
                    forms called “ideas”; (ii.) the ideas are apprehended by finite minds as
                    particulars in space and time, and are then called “things”; (iii.) consequently
                    the particulars which have in a given idea at once their origin, their being,
                    and their perfection may be regarded, for the purposes of scientific study, as
                    members of a natural kind; (iv.) the finite mind, though it cannot directly
                    apprehend the idea, may, by the study of the particulars in which the idea is
                    revealed, attain to an approximate notion of it.</p>
                <p>Now when Speusippus (1) discriminated the One, the Good, and Mind, (2) denied the
                    ideas, and (3) abandoned the attempt to unify the plurality of things, he
                    explicitly rejected the theory of being expressed in (i.) and (ii.); and the
                    rejection of the theory of being, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the conception
                    of the One evolving itself as a plurality of ideas, entailed consequential
                    modifications in the theory of knowledge conveyed in (iii.) and (iv.). For, if
                    the members of a natural kind had no common idea to unite them, scientific
                    research, having nothing objective in view, could at best afford a <hi
                    rend="italic">λόγος</hi> or definition of the appropriate particulars; and, as
                    the discrimination of the One and the Good implied the progression of
                    particulars towards perfection, such a <hi rend="italic">λόγος</hi> or
                    definition could have only a temporary value. Hence, though, like Plato,
                    Speusippus (4) studied the differences of natural products (5) with a view to
                    classification, he did not agree with Plato in his conception of the
                    significance of the results thus obtained; that is to say, while to Plato the
                    definition derived from the study of the particulars included in a natural kind
                    was an approximate definition of the idea in which the natural kind originated,
                    to Speusippus the definition was a definition of the particulars studied, and,
                    strictly speaking, of nothing else. Thus, while Plato hoped to ascend through
                    classificatory science to the knowledge of eternal and immutable laws of thought
                    and being, Speusippus, abandoning ontological speculation, was content to regard
                    classificatory science not as a means but as an end, and (6) to rest in the
                    results of scientific observation. In a word, Speusippus turned from philosophy
                    to science.</p>
                <p>It may seem strange that, differing thus widely from his master, Speusippus
                    should have regarded himself and should have been regarded by others as a
                    Platonist, and still more strange that Plato should have chosen him to be his
                    successor. It is to be observed, however, firstly, that the scientific element
                    occupied a larger place in Plato’s later system than is generally supposed,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">That Plato
                    did not neglect, but rather encouraged, classificatory science is shown, not
                    only by a well-known fragment of the comic poet Epicrates, which describes a
                    party of Academics engaged in investigating, under the eye of Plato, the
                    affinities of the common pumpkin, but also by the</hi> Timaeus, <hi
                    rend="italic">which, while it carefully discriminates science from ontology,
                    plainly recognizes the importance of the study of natural kinds.</hi></p></note>
                    and, secondly, that the only Academics who came into competition with Speusippus
                    agreed with him in his rejection of the theory of ideas. Hence Plato, finding in
                    the school no capable representative of his ontological theory, might well
                    choose to succeed him a favourite pupil whose scientific enthusiasm and
                    attainment were beyond question; and Speusippus’s rivals, having themselves
                    abandoned the theory of ideas, would not be in a position to tax him with his
                    philosophical apostasy.</p>
                <p>In abandoning the theory of ideas—that is to say, the theory of figures and
                    numbers, the possessions of universal mind, eternally existent out of space and
                    time, which figures and numbers when they pass into space and time as the
                    heritage of finite minds are regarded as things— Speusippus had the approval, as
                    of the Platonists generally, so also of Aristotle. But, whereas the new
                    scholarch, confining himself to the detailed examination of natural kinds,
                    attempted no comprehensive explanation of the universe, Aristotle held that a
                    theory of its origin, its motions,<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n420/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0420-0397"/> and its order was a necessary adjunct to the
                    classificatory sciences; and in nearly all his references to Speusippus he
                    insists upon this fundamental difference of procedure. Conceiving that the
                    motions of the universe and its parts are due to the desire which it and they
                    feel towards the supreme external mind, so that the cosmical order is initial in
                    the divine mind, final in the phenomenal universe, Aristotle supposes himself
                    thus to secure the requisite unification of the variety of things. Contrariwise,
                    when Speusippus distinguishes One, Good, and Mind, so that Mind, not as yet
                    endowed with an orderly scheme, adapts the initial One to a variety of
                    particular Goods, his theory of nature appears to his rival “episodical,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, to consist of a series of tableaux wanting in dramatic
                    unity, so that it reminds him of Homer’s line— <hi rend="italic">oὐκ ἀγαθὸv
                    πoλυκoιραvίη · εἱς κoίραvoς ἔστω.</hi> The theory propounded by Aristotle
                    himself is not perhaps impeccable in this respect, but at any rate he does not,
                    like Speusippus, despair of a solution of the traditional problem of the One and
                    the Many.</p>
                <p>Speusippus and his contemporaries in the school exercised an important and
                    far-reaching influence upon Academic doctrine. When they, the immediate
                    successors of Plato, rejected their master’s ontology and proposed to themselves
                    as ends mere classificatory sciences which with him had been means, they
                    bartered their hope of philosophic certainty for the tentative and provisional
                    results of scientific experience. Xenocrates indeed, identifying ideal and
                    mathematical numbers, sought to shelter himself under the authority of Plato;
                    but, as the Xenocratean numbers, though professedly ideal as well as
                    mathematical, were in fact mathematical only, this return to the Platonic
                    terminology was no more than an empty form. It would seem, then, that Academic
                    scepticism began with those who had been reared by Plato himself, having its
                    origin in their acceptance of the scientific element of his teaching apart from
                    the ontology which had been its basis. In this way, and, so far as the present
                    writer can see, in this way only, it is possible to understand the extraordinary
                    revolution which converted Platonism, philosophical and dogmatic, into
                    Academicism, scientific and sceptical. It is as the official representative of
                    this scientific and sceptical departure that Speusippus is entitled to a place
                    in the history of philosophy.</p>
