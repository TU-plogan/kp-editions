                    situated at the head of the Gulf of Suez in 29* 58' 37" N. lat. and 32° 31' 18"
                    E. long. (see vol. iv. pl. XXXVI.).</p>
                <p>The new harbours and quays are about 2 miles south of the town, with which they
                    are connected by an embankment and railway, crossing a shallow which is dry at
                    low water; the terminal lock of the freshwater canal is on the north of the town
                    near the English hospital and the storehouses of the Peninsular and Oriental
                    Company. The site is naturally an absolute desert, and till the water of the
                    Nile was introduced by the freshwater canal in 1863 the water-supply of Suez was
                    brought across the head of the gulf from the “wells of Moses” on the Arabian
                    coast, or else carried on camels, an hour’s journey, from the fortified brackish
                    well of Bir Suweis. Thus, in spite of its favourable position for commerce, Suez
                    before the canal was but a small place. While the canal was in progress the
                    population rose from 5000 to 15,000, but has since declined. The canal, in fact,
                    carries traffic past Suez rather than to it; and with its mean bazaar and
                    mosques and mongrel population the town makes an unfavourable impression on the
                    visitor, save for the imposing view over the gulf, with the Sinai Mountains on
                    its eastern and Mount 'Ataḳa on its western shore.</p>
                <p>A canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, the indispensable condition for the
                    existence of a prosperous trading station at Suez, appears to have existed in
                    very early times. Classical writers say that it was first planned by Sesostris
                    (Rameses II.), and again undertaken by Darius I., but first completed by the
                    Ptolemies (Arist., <hi rend="italic">Meteor.,</hi> i. 14; Strabo, xiv. 25). The
                    town at its terminus was Arsinoe or Cleopatris. The work was renewed by Trajan
                    under the name <hi rend="italic">Augustus amnis,</hi> but the trade from the
                    East with Egypt still went mainly overland from Myus Hormus or from Berenice on
                    the Red Sea, below the Gulf of Suez, to Coptus in Upper Egypt. Instead of
                    Arsinoe later writers name the port of Clysma, which the Arabs corrupted into
                    Ḳolzum, calling the Red Sea the Sea of Kolzum. On the Moslem conquest of Egypt
                    the canal was restored, and is said to have remained open more than a century,
                    till the time of Manṣúr. According to Mas'údí <hi rend="italic">(Morúj,</hi> iv.
                    98), Hárún al-Rashíd projected a canal across the isthmus of Suez, but was
                    persuaded that it would be dangerous to lay open the coasts of Arabia to the
                    Greek navy. Kolzum retained some trade long after the closing of the canal, but
                    in the 13th century it lay in ruins, and the neighbouring Suez, which had taken
                    its place, was, as Yáḳút tells us, little better than a ruin. From Mokaddasi, p.
                    196, it may be inferred that the name of Suez originally denoted Bir Suweis.
                    Throughout the Middle Ages, as in Roman times, the main route from Cairo to the
                    Red Sea was up the Nile to Kris, and then through the desert to Aidháb. With the
                    Ottoman conquest Suez became more important as a naval and trading station.
                    Ships were built there from the 16th century onwards, and in the 18th century an
                    annual fleet of nearly twenty vessels (Niebuhr) sailed from it to Jiddah, the
                    port of correspondence with India. When the French occupied the town in 1798,
                    and Bonaparte was full of his canal project, Suez was much decayed, and the
                    conflicts which followed on its occupation in 1800 by an English fleet laid a
                    great part of the town in ruins. The overland mail route from England to India
                    by way of Suez was opened in 1837. The regular Peninsular and Oriental steamer
                    service began a few years later, and in 1857 a railway was opened from Cairo
                    through the desert. This line is now abandoned in favour of the railway which
                    follows the canal from Suez to Ismailia, and then ascends the Wady Tumefiát to
                    Zaḳázíḳ, whence branches diverge to Cairo and Alexandria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Suez Canal.</hi> The great engineering features have been
                    already treated of under <hi rend="smallcaps">Canal</hi> (vol. iv. pp. 789-792).
                    The opening of the canal to a great extent revolutionized the main lines of
                    international traffic. More especially it has restored to the Mediterranean
                    countries a share in the commerce of the world such as they have not possessed
                    since the beginning of the modern period. In doing so it has naturally caused
                    the decay of certain stations (such as St Helena) on the ocean highways
                    previously in vogue. In the case of sailing vessels, however, the winds at the
                    Red Sea entrance of the canal are so frequently contrary that much of the
                    advantage of the shortness of route is lost, and these vessels consequently
                    still take the old-fashioned detours. Traffic, too, in the canal has so greatly
                    increased that in 1886 a vessel was considered fortunate that got through in
                    forty-eight hours. In 1882 shipowners having expressed dissatisfaction with the
                    condition of the service, schemes for rival canals were started,—one for a
                    fresh-water canal from Alexandria to Cairo and thence to Suez by way of
                    Tel-el-Kebir, another for a canal from Alexandria to Mansurah and Ismailia, and
                    then parallel to the original canal to Suez, and a third for the construction of
                    a second Suez canal, to be finished in 1888. These proposals all fell to the
                    ground; but at length, in<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0646-0621"/> 1886, it was determined to widen the existing
                    canal so as to accommodate the increased traffic, and the works are now in
                    progress. Originally constructed by French capital, the Suez Canal has passed
                    more and more into the financial ownership as well as under the political
                    protection of England. In 1875 the British Government purchased 176,602 shares
                    from the khedive of Egypt at the price of £3,976,582, or, including commission
                    and expenses, £4,076,622, and exchequer bonds were issued to the value of
                    £4,000,000. By opening up a passage by which the faunal forms of the Red Sea
                    anil of the Mediterranean may respectively advance north and south into regions
                    from which they have hitherto been excluded, the canal has produced some curious
                    results, which have been lately investigated by Dr Conrad Keller of Zurich
                    (“Fauna im Suez-Kanal u. Diffusion de Mediter. u. Eryth. Thierwelt,” in <hi
                    rend="italic">Neue Denkschriften cl. allg. schweizer Ges. f. Naturwiss.,</hi>
                    Zurich 1883). Deep-sea forms are, of course, prevented passing by the
                    shallowness of the canal; and the sandy nature of the soil, the large lakes, the
                    currents, the disturbing influence exerted by the continual movement of vessels,
                    and the excessive saltness of the water all tend to limit and retard the
                    progress of even those forms most adapted to make their way through such a
                    channel. The salinity of the water is much greater than that of the
                    Mediterranean or the Red Sea. This is due mainly to two causes,—the rapid
                    evaporation to which the water in the canal is subjected and the gradual melting
                    of the deposits of salt (the result of previous evaporation in distant ages) in
                    some of the depressions through which the canal is carried. In the Bitter Lakes,
                    for example, it was found in 1872 that on an average each cubic mètre of water
                    contained 156·42 lb of salt, or about three times as much as ordinary sea water.
                    A certain number of forms common to the Bed Sea and the Mediterranean appeal’ to
                    have migrated from their original homes when in Quaternary times the isthmus was
                    still a lagoon. These being discounted, the following remain as the result of
                    the recent connexion established between the seas: (1) from the Mediterranean
                    <hi rend="italic">Pholas candida</hi> (as far as Ismailia), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Solen vagina, Sphaeroma serrata</hi> (to the south of Timsah Lake), <hi
                    rend="italic">Cardium edule, Gammarns</hi> sp. (to the nearer end of the Great
                    Bitter Lake), <hi rend="italic">Solea vulgaris, Umbrina cirrhosa, Ascidia
                    intestinalis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Labrax lupus</hi> (to the Red Sea); (2)
                    from the Bed Sea seventeen forms were found journeying, but one only, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mytilus variabilis,</hi> had got out into the Mediterranean
                    proper; <hi rend="italic">Ostracion cubicus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caranx
                    macrophthalmus</hi> had just got <hi rend="italic">en route,</hi> and <hi

                    scabridurn</hi> were found in Lake Menzaleh. This lake seems to prove in the
                    meantime an obstacle to the passage of eight other species.</p>
