                    solicitor-general, and joined the Middle Temple. He appears, in addition to his
                    legal studies, to have written several poems and pamphlets. He soon became
                    intimate with the leaders of the country party, especially with Essex, Russell,
                    and Algernon Sidney, but never entered into their plans so far as to commit
                    himself beyond recall. He was the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Succession of the Crown of England, collected out of Records, &amp;c.,</hi> and
                    was reputed to have written the <hi rend="italic">Just and Modest Vindication of
                    the Two Last Parliaments,</hi> which was put forward as the answer to Charles
                    II.’s famous declaration of his reasons for dissolving them. This, however, was
                    by Sidney,· though probably Somers was responsible for the final draft. When the
                    grand jury of Middlesex threw out the bill against Shaftesbury, and were
                    vehemently attacked for so doing, Somers wrote in defence of the rights of grand
                    juries. In 1683 he was counsel for the sheriffs Pilkington and Shute before the
                    Court of King’s Bench, and secured a reputation which continually increased
                    until the trial of the seven bishops, in which he was junior counsel. “Somers
                    rose last. He spoke little more than five minutes, but every word was full of
                    weighty matter; and when he sat down his reputation as an orator and a
                    constitutional lawyer was established.” In the secret councils of those who were
                    planning the revolution Somers took a leading part, and in the Convention
                    Parliament was elected a member for his native town. He was immediately
                    appointed one of the managers for the Commons in the conferences between the
                    Houses, and in arguing the questions whether James II. had left the throne
                    vacant by abdication and whether the Acts of the Convention Parliament were
                    legal—that parliament having been summoned without the usual writs—he displayed
                    great learning and legal subtlety. He was further distinguished by being made
                    chairman of the committee which drew up the celebrated Declaration of Right. On
                    May 9, 1689, Somers was made solicitor-general. He now became William III.’s
                    most confidential adviser. In the controversy which arose between the Houses on
                    the question of the legality of the decision of the Court of King’s Bench
                    regarding Titus Oates, and of the action of the Lords in sustaining this
                    decision, Somers was again the leading manager for the Commons, and has left a
                    clear and interesting account of the debates. He was next employed in January
                    1690 as chairman of the select committee of the House of Commons on the
                    Corporation Bill, by which those corporations which had surrendered their
                    charters to the crown during the last two reigns were restored to their rights;
                    but he refused to associate himself with the violent measures of retaliation
                    which the Whigs on that occasion endeavoured to include in the bill. In April a
                    speech by him carried through the Lower House, without opposition, the bill
                    which declared all the laws passed by the Convention Parliament to be valid. As
                    solicitor-general he had to conduct the prosecution of Preston and Ashton in
                    1691, and did so with a moderation and humanity which were in marked contrast to
                    the customs of the former reigns. He was shortly appointed attorney-general, and
                    in that capacity strongly<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0274-0257"/> opposed the bill for the regulation of trials in
                    cases of high treason. On March 23, 1693, the great seal having meanwhile been
                    in commission, Somers was appointed lord-keeper, with a pension of £2000 a year
                    from the day on which he should quit his office, and at the same time was made a
                    privy councillor. He had previously been knighted. Somers now became the most
                    prominent member of the Junto, the small council which comprised the chief
                    members of the Whig party. When William left in May 1695 to take command of the
                    army in the Netherlands, Somers was made one of the seven lords-justices to whom
                    the administration of the kingdom during his absence was entrusted; and he was
                    instrumental in bringing about a reconciliation between William and the princess
                    Anne.</p>
                <p>The question of improving the currency now became pressing, and Somers was the
                    author of the bold suggestion that a proclamation should be issued
                    simultaneously all over the kingdom, announcing that henceforth all clipped and
                    hammered coins were to be reckoned only by weight. But all possessors of such
                    coins might, by delivering them up on a certain day, receive a note entitling
                    them to draw from the treasury at a future time the difference between the
                    actual and nominal values. The difficulties of the plan, however, rendered its
                    adoption impossible. In April 1697 Somers was made lord chancellor, and was
                    created a peer by the title of Baron Somers of Evesham. When the discussion
                    arose on the question of disbanding the army, he summed up the case against
                    disbanding, in answer to Trenchard, in a remarkable pamphlet called “The
                    Balancing Letter.” In August 1698 he went to Tunbridge Wells for his health.
                    While there he received the king’s letter announcing the first Partition Treaty,
                    and at once replied with a memorandum representing the necessity in the state of
                    feeling in England of avoiding further war. When the king, on the occasion of
                    the Disbanding Bill, expressed his determination to leave the country, Somers
                    boldly remonstrated, while he clearly expressed in a speech in the Lords the
                    danger of the course that was being taken. Hitherto Somers’s character had kept
                    him free from attack at the hands of political opponents; but his connexion in
                    1699 with the notorious Kidd, who, being sent out to put down the pirates in the
                    Indian Ocean, turned pirate himself, and to the defraying of whose expedition
                    Somers had given £1000, afforded an opportunity; the vote of censure, however,
                    proposed upon him in the House of Commons for giving Kidd a commission under the
                    great seal was rejected by 199 to 131. The attack was renewed shortly on the
                    ground of his having accepted grants of crown property to the amount of £1600 a
                    year, but was again defeated. On the subject of the Irish forfeitures a third
                    attack was made in 1700, a motion being brought forward to request the king to
                    remove Somers from his counsels and presence for ever; but this again was
                    rejected by a large majority. In consequence, however, of the incessant
                    agitation, William now requested Somers to resign; this he refused to do, but
                    gave up the seals to William’s messenger. In 1701 he was impeached by the
                    Commons on account of the part he had taken in the negotiations relating to the
                    Partition Treaty in 1698, and defended himself most ably before the House,
                    answering the charges <hi rend="italic">seriatim.</hi> The impeachment was voted
                    and sent up to the Lords, but was there dismissed. On the death of the king
                    Somers retired almost entirely into private life. He was, however, active in
                    1702 in opposing the Occasional Conformity Bill, and in 1706 was one of the
                    managers of the union with Scotland. In the same year he carried a bill
                    regulating and improving the proceedings of the law courts. He was made
                    president of the council in 1708 upon the return of the Whigs to power, and
                    retained the office until their downfall in 1710. From this time his powers of
                    mind rapidly declined, and after being almost imbecile for six years he died of
                    apoplexy on April 26, 1716. Somers was never married, but left two sisters, of
                    whom the eldest, Mary, married Charles Cocks, whose grandson, Sir Charles Cocks,
                    Bart., became the second Lord Somers in 1784.</p>
