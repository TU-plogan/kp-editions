                <p>S <hi rend="subscript"> weden</hi> comprises the eastern and southern divisions
                    of the Scandinavian peninsula. Its northern extremity, Kuokimodka, is situated
                    in 69° 3' 21” and the southern in 55° 20' 18” N. lat. The western extremity (on
                    the Cattegat) lies in 11° 6' 29" and the eastern (on the frontier of Finland) in
                    24° 10' E. long. The greatest length of the country from north to south is 986
                    miles and its greatest breadth 286 miles, and the area is 170,713 square miles.
                    The length of the coast-line is 1603 miles, the length of the boundary line
                    towards Norway 1019 miles, and that of the boundary line towards Finland 305
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Sweden is divided into three chief parts,—the southern being called Götaland, the
                    middle part Svealand or Sweden proper, and the northern Norrland. The north and
                    north-west parts of Norrland are called Lapland.</p>
                <p>The frontier towards Norway, from 69° to 63° N. lat., is formed by a continuous
                    mountain range called Kölen (the keel). The snow peaks of Sulitelma (6178 feet),
                    east of Saltenfjord, on the frontier between Sweden and Norway, were long
                    supposed to mark the highest elevation of this mountain chain, but the
                    geodetical survey now in progress in western Lapland has already shown that
                    there are at least two peaks whose height exceeds that of Sulitelma, viz.,
                    Kefnekaise (7008 feet) and Sarjektjåkko (6988 feet).</p>
                <p>In this mountain range (Kölen), rise a great number of rivers and streams, which
                    flow in a south-easterly direction to the Gulf of Bothnia. The immense quantity
                    of fresh water that is thus carried into the gulf makes its water scarcely more
                    salt than that of a lake (0·25 to 0·40 per cent. of salt). Between the upper
                    courses of the rivers the watersheds consist of mountain ridges, which gradually
                    diminish in height. The intermediate valleys are for the most part filled with
                    the water of the rivers, and thus form a number of lakes at a considerable
                    elevation above the sea-level. Issuing from these lakes, the rivers form great
                    cataracts, and afterwards flow through the level plain that forms the
                    coast-region of the Gulf of Bothnia for a distance of many miles from the
                    shore.</p>
                <p>The boundary between Sweden and Finland is formed by (1) Muonio Elf, and
                    afterwards by (2) Torneå Elf, into which it flows; Torneå Elf rises in Torneå
                    Träsk, at an elevation of 1132 feet above the sea. Then come, in order along the
                    coast, the following rivers:—(3) Kalix Elf, which in its upper course forms the
                    lakes of Paitas Jaur and Kalas Järvi;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    which forms Stora Luleå Jaur (1214 feet) and receives on the right (5) Lilla
                    Luleå Elf, which forms the lakes of Saggat Träsk and Skalka Jaur (984 feet); (6)
                    Piteå Elf, with the lake of Tjäggelvas; (7 ) Skellefteå Elf, forming a number of
                    great lakes, such as Hornafvan (1391 feet), Uddjaur (1375 feet), Storafvan (1371
                    feet); (8) Umeå Elf (261 miles), with a great number of lakes, of which the
                    largest is Stor-Uman, receives on the left a tributary of almost equal size,
                    viz., (9) Vindel Elf; (10) Ångerman Elf (211 miles), which receives the water of
                    a whole system of streams and lakes, the largest of the latter being Stroms
                    Vattudal, in the south of Lapland; (11) Indals Elf, which receives the Ammerå,
                    with its tributaries and the numerous emissary lakes, as Hotagen (1017 feet),
                    Kallsjön and Storsjön (“Storsa Lake” on the map) (958 feet, area 173 sq. miles).
                    Close to the railway from Trondhjem to Östersund, between</p>
                <p>Kallsjön and Storsjön, rises the peak of Åreskutan (4652 feet), which is ascended
                    every year by a great number of tourists, and in the vicinity many sanatoria are
                    situated. Farther south flow three large rivers: — (12) Ljungan (193 miles),
                    with Holmsjön (656 feet); (13) Ljusnan (249 miles); and (14) Dal Elf (286
                    miles), which passes through Särnasjön (1450 feet) and Siljan (541 feet, 110 sq.
                    miles), and receives on the right (15) West Dal Elf. The last-named four rivers
                    rise in a mountainous region with many high summits, which are the eastern
                    outposts of the high range of Dovrefjeld, which traverses Norway from west to
                    east, between the parallels of 67° and 63° N. lat. Among these summits, situated
                    on the frontier or in Sweden, are to be observed the Syltoppar (5865 feet), Son
                    Fjell (4190 feet), Helags Fjell (5900 feet), and Städjan (3860 feet) on the
                    north shore of Särnasjön.</p>
                <p>In Norway, not far from the sources of Dal Elf, lies the lake of Fämundsjö, which
                    gives rise to (16) Klar Elf, which flows southwards to Lake Vener, the largest
                    lake in Sweden (144 feet, area 2150 square miles). The outlet of Vener is (17)
                    Göta Elf, which falls into the Cattegat, near Gothenburg. The watershed between
                    Dal Elf and Klar Elf is a wooded range of hills without high peaks, sloping to
                    the south-east. The south-eastern part of Svealand comprises the water systems
                    of the large lakes of Hjelmar (75 feet, area 185 square miles) and Mälar (area
                    449 square miles). Lake Mälar discharges into the Baltic at Stockholm by two
                    outlets—(18) Norrström and Söderström. They are, however, almost to be regarded
                    as channels or sounds, rather than as streams, the difference of level between
                    Lake Mälar and the Baltic being so small that occasionally, when the water is
                    low in Mälar and high in the Baltic, the current sets from the latter into the
                    former. Lake Mälar may thus be considered a fjord of the Baltic. Still its
                    waters are kept fresh by the great number of small streams that discharge into
                    it, the most important of these being (19) Fyris Elf, which passes Upsala.</p>
                <p>The boundary between Svealand and Götaland consists of wooded heights. Between
                    Lake Vetter and the northern shore of Bråviken Bay stretches the forest of
                    Kolmorden, and between the northern extremity of Lake Vetter and Lake Vener lies
                    that of Tiveden. Lake Vetter (290 feet, area 733 square miles) discharges itself
                    into Bråviken by (20) Motala Ström, the falls of which are utilized for the
                    mills in the town of Norrköping, near the mouth of the river.</p>
                <p>The central part of Götaland consists of an extensive tableland or plateau, of
                    which the highest part, at an elevation of 1237 feet, lies somewhat to the south
                    of Vetter. On the north this plateau descends rather abruptly towards the
                    fertile plains of Ostergötland (drained by Motala Ström) and Skaraborg län,
                    between Vetter and Vener. Near the south-eastern shore of Vetter, a little to
                    the north of Jönköping, lies Mount Omberg (863 feet), and near the southern
                    shore of Vener, close by Lidköping, lies Kinnekulle (915 feet), both hills
                    remarkable for their beauty. The great plateau descends less abruptly towards
                    east, south, and west. A great number of lesser streams flow down its slopes.
                    The principal are—(21) Emmån, which falls into Calmar Sound; (22) Lyckebyån,
                    (23) Mörrumsån, and (24) Helgaån, which flow in a southerly direction; and (25)
                    Lagan, (26) Nissan, (27) Ätran, and (28) Viskan, which fall into the Cattegat.
                    On this great plateau and its slopes lie also many lakes. In the northern part,
                    east of Vetter, lies Sommen (479 feet), and farther north Boren, Roxen, and
                    Glan. Between<pb break="no"

                    summit of the plateau lies Ekelsjö (1132 feet), and on its southern slope
                    Helgasjö (535 feet), Bolmen (466 feet), Mückeln (446 feet), and Åsnen.</p>
                <p>The southmost part of Sweden, Skåne, consists for the most part of a low fertile
                    country. Only in the northern part, Christianstad län, occur two low stretches
                    of hills, called Linderödsåsen and Söderåsen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Waterfalls.—</hi> The largest waterfalls are—(1) Njuom-melsaska
                    (Harsprånget), in Stora Luleå Elf, with a breadth of 60-70 feet, consisting of
                    two cataracte of 103 feet at the upper end and a fall of 150 feet more in the
                    course of 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    miles,—the largest waterfall in Europe; (2) Adna-Muorki-Kortje (“the great fall
                    of the lake”), on the same river as the former, higher up, between the two lakes
                    Jäntajaur and Kaskajaur, has a fall of 130 feet, of which 100 feet are one
                    perpendicular cataract; (3) Tännforsen, 12 miles west of Åreskutan in Jemtland,
                    between Tännsjön and Noren, has a breadth of 160 and a perpendicular fall of 84
                    feet; (4) Trollhättan, in Göta Elf, consists of three successive falls having a
                    total height of 100 feet.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that, with the exception of the northwest part along the
                    Norwegian frontier, Sweden is not a mountainous country. On the other hand,
                    fertile plains are not frequent. The most extensive are the north-west shore of
                    the Gulf of Bothnia, where, however, the severe climate precludes any successful
                    agriculture, the water districts of Lake Mälar and Lake Hjelmar, the rich
                    agricultural district of Ostergötland between Vetter and the Baltic,
                    Vestergötland, or the whole country between the two great lakes as far as
                    Gothenburg, and, as has been just mentioned, the southmost part, or Skåne, which
                    comprises Christianstad and Malmöhus län. The greatest part of the country
                    consists of low hills of granite or gneiss, clothed with forests of pine and
                    fir. The valleys are generally in great part filled with water, and the shores
                    of their lakes or wide rivers are covered with forests of deciduous trees,
                    chiefly birch, or consist of arable soil. With the exception of Finland there is
                    no country so full of lakes as Sweden. Nearly one-twelfth of the whole surface
                    of the country, or about 13,900 square miles, is covered with water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast.—</hi> The coast of Sweden is not broken by so many or so
                    deep fjords as that of Norway. The most considerable indentation is the
                    above-mentioned Bråviken Bay. On the other hand, the Swedish coast is, perhaps
                    in a still greater degree than the Norwegian, fringed by innumerable little
                    islets. Except on the coast round Skåne, in the south, the mainland does not
                    come into direct contact with the sea, girdled as it is by a belt of islands,
                    holms, and skerries, more or less thickly set, which forms the so-called
                    “skärgård” fence of skerries or outer coast. Between this wall of islets and the
                    mainland, therefore, extends a connected series of sounds of the greatest
                    importance for coastal navigation, since they admit of the employment of vessels
                    of less size and strength. This skärgård forms, besides, a most valuable natural
                    defence; for, while some sounds are deep, navigation in the vicinity of the
                    coasts is, as a rule, practically impossible without the help of pilots.</p>
                <p>The broadest part of this skärgård is that off Stockholm, which stretches many
                    miles out into the Baltic. It consists of a few large and well-peopled islands,
                    surrounded by many hundreds of islets, for the most part uninhabited. The outer
                    islands are bare grey rocks of gneiss, but the inner ones are mostly covered
                    with fir and birch trees. The entrance to Stockholm through this archipelago is
                    of its kind one of the most curious and picturesque in the world. The largest of
                    these islands are Ljusterö, Vermdö, Ingarö, Vindö, Runmarö, Ornö, and Utö (with
                    rich iron mines). As mentioned above, Lake Mälar is to be con sidered as a fjord
                    of the Baltic. The skärgård also extends into Mälar, which is filled with
                    islands. The most remarkable is Björkö, where the old town of Birka was
                    situated. The archaeological researches on this spot have been of the greatest
                    importance for our knowledge of life in Sweden in the times of the vikings. The
                    part of the skärgård next in breadth is that off Carlskrona, where the islands
                    of Sturkö, Tjurkö, Aspö, and Hasslö are situated.</p>
                <p>The Cattegat skärgård, which extends from the fjord of Svinesund at the southern
                    extremity of the Norwegian frontier as far as Halmstad, has a different aspect
                    from that of the Baltic. In the Cattegat all the islands, as well as the rocks
                    of the mainland, are almost bare of vegetation. Trees are quite absent in most
                    places, and generally the grey rocks are not even covered with grass or moss.
                    They look as if they were polished by the sea. Between these bare rocks there
                    is, however, in many places even on the larger islands arable soil of great
                    fertility. In the northern part of the skärgård near Strömstad lie the larger
                    islands of Sandö, Ödö, Tjernö, Rösö, &amp;c. Farther seawards lie the Koster
                    Islands and the Väder Islands with their lighthouses. A little more to the
                    south, in the vicinity of Lysekil, are three narrow fjords—Âbyfjord,
                    Gullmarfjord, and Koljefjord. Off the first-named lies Malmö,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Not to be confounded with the
                    town of Malmö in Skåne.</p></note> remarkable for its quarry, where the fine
                    granite of which the island consists is wrought. Next come, in succession,
                    Kornö, Skaftö, Flatö, Hermanö, and Lyrö, the last two situated off the two
                    largest islands on this coast, Oroust and Tjörn. All the islands now enumerated
                    are surrounded by innumerable islets and rocks. South of Tjörn there are no
                    considerable islands except Marstrand (with a small town and much-frequented
                    sea-bathing quarters), Koö, and Klöfverö, all situated immediately to the south
                    of Tjörn. On the coast of Halland we find only Särö, off the fjord of
                    Kungsbacka, and the Väderö of Halland, off Torekow, between Laholm Bay and
                    Skelder Bay, the only islands on the whole coast that are covered with a rich
                    vegetation of trees. On the extreme point of the cape, between the latter fjord
                    and the Sound, lies the isolated Mount Kullen with its lighthouse. In the Sound
                    off Landskrona lies the islet of liven, where Tycho Brahe had his observatory,
                    Uranienborg, in the end of the 16th century (1576-1597).</p>
                <p>In the Baltic lie the two great islands of Gotland and Öland, of which the former
                    is itself a county and a bishopric. These islands are quite different from the
                    Swedish mainland. They are formed of Silurian limestone. On the western coast of
                    Gotland the limestone rocks descend precipitously into the sea, and the island
                    forms a comparatively smooth plateau, which slopes gradually to the east. The
                    limestone soil is very fertile, and trees and plants thrive on it that do not
                    otherwise grow in the climate of Sweden, such as walnuts, ivy, &amp;c. The case
                    is the same in Öland. This island somewhat resembles a house-top. A sterile
                    limestone plain (Alvaren) stretches the whole length of the island from north to
                    south, and from this the country slopes both towards Calmar Sound on the west
                    and towards the Baltic on the east. The slopes, especially the western, are very
                    fertile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea-Bed.—</hi> The seas that surround Sweden are remarkably
                    shallow. Round the south part of Norway runs a depression in the sea-bed, called
                    the Norwegian Channel (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Norwegian Sea).</hi> It
                    stretches along the west and south coasts of Norway southward and eastward
                    almost to Christiania Fjord and the Cattegat. The deepest part of this channel,
                    upwards of 400 fathoms, extends through the Skagerack between Arendal in Norway
                    and the Scaw. In the Cattegat the depth diminishes abruptly, and<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0769-0738"/> between Gothenburg and the Scaw the greatest
                    depth is between 33 and 55 fathoms. The greatest part of the southern half of
                    the Cattegat has a depth of less than 30 fathoms. The depth of the Sound
                    generally is even less than 12 fathoms. The whole southern part of the Baltic
                    between Sweden and Germany is very shallow. West of Bornholm the depth nowhere
                    reaches 30 fathoms. East of Bornholm the sea is somewhat deeper, and a small
                    area of a depth of 50 to 60 fathoms is found a little east of that island. The
                    whole of that part of the Baltic which lies between Sweden and Russia is divided
                    into two separate basins by a submarine bank. From the southern extremity of
                    Gotland (Hoburg) there extends a nearly uninterrupted bank to the south-west as
                    far as the Prussian coast. The depth on this bank nowhere reaches 30 fathoms.
                    The shallowest parts are Hoburg Bank south of Gotland, Mittel Bank south-east of
                    Gland, and Stolpe Bank off the Prussian coast. Between Fårö off the north coast
                    of Gotland and the Gottska Sandö there extends a similar bank, which continues
                    with a somewhat greater depth of about 30 fathoms as far north as Stockholm. The
                    deepest part of the Baltic between these banks is situated in the north part
                    between Landsort and the Gottska Sandö, the maximum depth being about 160
                    fathoms. Ålands Haf, the channel between the Swedish coast and the Aland
                    Islands, is tolerably deep (100 to 160 fathoms).</p>
                <p>The Gulf of Bothnia is divided into two basins by the channel of Qvarken; the
                    southern is the deeper (about 50 fathoms), and the depth increases towards the
                    northwest, where, over a small area off the island of Ulfö near the Swedish
                    coast, it reaches 160 fathoms. The channel of Qvarken is very shallow (8 to 16
                    fathoms). The basin on the north side is also shallow. Only over a small area
                    off Bjurö Cape does the depth exceed 160 fathoms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Sweden is situated between two countries of very
                    different climatological conditions. On the west there is the maritime climate
                    of the Norwegian coast, and on the east the continental climate of Russia. It
                    may be said that Sweden alternates between the two. Cold winters alternate with
                    mild ones, and warm and dry summers with cool and rainy ones. But different
                    parts of Sweden have also in this respect a greatly differing climate, of which
                    we readily see the reason if we only recollect the character and the general
                    features of the configuration of the country. Lapland and the western part of
                    the country along the Norwegian frontier have a pronounced continental climate,
                    and so has the high plateau to the south of Lake Vetter. On the other hand, the
                    climate is more maritime the more we approach the coasts of the Baltic, and on
                    the coast of the Cattegat and in Skåne the maritime climate distinctly
                    predominates.</p>

                <p>From these figures it appears that, as mentioned above, the climate is most
                    continental in the northern aud interior parts of the country, especially at the
                    two stations of Lapland, Stensele and Jockmock, while it is more maritime on the
                    coasts. For this reason the isotherms for January on the Scandinavian peninsula
                    are linguiform. The warm sea off Norway causes the peculiarity that the western
                    parts of Lapland, although situated at the greatest elevation above the sea,
                    have not so cold winters as the interior parts round the great lakes. Still
                    farther to the east the temperature increases again towards the coast of the
                    Gulf of Bothnia.</p>
                <p>Thus, for example, the isotherm of 10° F. enters Lapland from the north-east at
                    about 68° N. lat., runs towards the soutli-west over the great lakes as far as
                    about 64½°, south of Lake Stor-Uman, makes there an abrupt bend towards the
                    east, and runs in a north-easterly direction to Haparanda at the northern
                    extremity of the Gulf of Bothnia. The isotherm of 23° F. runs from the great
                    lake of Mjösen in Norway, north of Christiania, to the southern shore of Lake
                    Siljan, or almost straight east, curves there to the north-east, and reaches the
                    shore of the Gulf of Bothnia a little north of the mouth of Ljusnan. Finally,
                    the isotherm of 30° runs from Gothenburg towards the south-east to the lake of
                    Åsnen, curves towards the north-east, aud passes Calmar and the northern parts
                    of the islands Öland and Gotland. On the summit of the plateau south of Vetter
                    the mean temperature is of course lower than both north and south of the
                    plateau. In July the temperature is almost constant all over the country. With
                    the exception of the interior of Lapland the mean temperature varies generally
                    between 59° and 62°. The warmest point is Linköping on the plain of
                    Ostergötland, between Lake Vetter and the Baltic. The most temperate and most
                    agreeable climate of the whole country is that of the Cattegat coast round
                    Halmstad.</p>
                <p>A good indication of the climate, especially that of the winter, is the time
                    during which the freshwater lakes remain frozen. We have seen that nearly
                    one-twelfth of the whole surface of</p>
                <p>Sweden is covered with water, and in</p>
                <p>Finland the number of the lakes is still greater. In both countries the times of
                    freezing and breaking up of a great many lakes have been observed for many
                    years.</p>
                <p>From these data we can calculate the length of the ice periods. I f these periods
                    are entered on a diagram, we can draw out the lines of equal ice periods, or the
                    equi-</p>
                <p>glacial lines. The accompanying map shows these lines for Sweden and Fin land.
                    From it we see that the glacial period in the south ern part of the country is
                    90 days, while in the north ern part of Lapland it has a duration of no less
                    than 230 of the 365 days of the year. The western lakes of Lapland, though the
                    higher in situation, have a somewhat shorter ice period than the eastern. The
                    ice period is considerably lengthened on the great plateau south of Lake
                    Vetter.</p>
                <p>We have said above that in certain years the climate of Sweden is more maritime,
                    in others more continental. Thus, for instauce, the annual mean temperature of
                    Upsala has varied during the last 30 years between 43°·2 (1859) and 35°·0
                    (1867). The mean temperature of particular months varies of course in a still
                    higher degree, especially during the winter; thus the mean temperature of
                    January 1873 was 34°·3, but of January 1875 only 12°·2.</p>
                <p>The difference between the means of the warmest month and the coldest is the
                    so-called yearly range of temperature. In Sweden July is generally the warmest
                    and February the coldest month. The difference between the January and July
                    temperatures, however, as given in the foregoing table, will show the yearly
                    range approximately. It will be seen that this increases towards the north. For
                    the same latitude, it is greater in the interior of the country than on the
                    coasts.</p>
                <p>As is easily understood, the periodic daily range of temperature is least during
                    the darkest part of the year, during December and January, especially in the
                    north part of the country round the polar line, and still farther north, where
                    it is almost nil. The mean range for the whole country is in December only 2°.

                    except those of western Sweden, where it occurs as early as May. The mean of
                    June is 13°. A curious fact is that in Norrland, especially in the interior, a
                    secondary maximum occurs in March, which sometimes even exceeds the summer
                    maximum.</p>
                <p>The non-periodic daily range of temperature, or the difference between the
                    monthly means of daily maximum and minimum of temperature, is as usual
                    considerably greater than the periodic. The difference is almost constant for
                    all stations, especially during the warmer part of the year. We have, for the

                <p>The mean direction of the winds shows little variation during different seasons.
                    During the summer it is west or west-southwest in the south of Sweden, changes
                    to soutli-west in the middle part of the country, and due south along the coast
                    of the Gulf of Bothnia. In winter north-north-east winds become comparatively
                    frequent in the north part of the country. This is explained by the difference
                    in barometric pressure in summer and in winter. In July the mean height of the
                    barometer indicates a gradual fall along the coast of the Baltic, from 29·828
                    inches in Calmar to 29·675 in Haparanda. In January, on the other hand, there is
                    a gradual fall from 29·853 in Calmar to 29·718 in Hemosand, but thereafter a
                    gradual rise to 29·834 in Haparanda. Unfortunately the isobarometric lines for
                    Sweden have not yet been calculated with due precision.</p>
                <p>The rainfall is greatest on the coast of the Cattegat. The annual amount is
                    greatest at Gothenburg, where it is 32·56 inches. At Halmstad it is 28·26, and
                    at Venersborg, where Göta Elf issues from Lake Vener, it is 30·33. These are the
                    rainiest stations of Sweden. Generally speaking, the amount of rain diminishes
                    afterwards as well towards north and north-west as towards southeast. The least
                    rain falls on the one hand in northern Lapland, where the annual amount is only
                    15·52 inches, and on the other hand in the south-eastern corner of Sweden, where
                    (at Calmar) we have the lowest known rainfall for the whole country (1275
                    inches). Between these two tracts there runs a belt of greater precipitation
                    from Gothenburg towards the north-east to Upsala, where the annual amount is
                    23·28. Even along this belt the amount of rainfall diminishes towards the
                    north-east, but at every point the amount is greater than to the north-west and
                    south-east of it. The greatest amount of rain falls in July and August and the
                    least in February and March. Thus, for instance, there fall in Upsala during
                    August 2·86 inches and during March 0·99 inches. As the temperature varies, so
                    does the rainfall for different years.</p>
                <p>The number of thunderstorms is small in Sweden compared with the countries of the
                    south. Their number diminishes as does the precipitation from soutli-west
                    towards north and east. From 1871 to 1880 the mean annual number of
                    thunderstorms at each station was 9·5 in Götaland, 8·4 in Svealand, and only 6·3
                    in Norrland. In the south their number diminishes rapidly from west to east,
                    from 11 on the coast of the Cattegat to 8·3 on the coast of the Baltic, and only
                    6·6 on the isle of Gotland. The thunderstorms have a distinctly marked annual
                    and daily period. They occur almost always during the warmest time of the year
                    and of the day. During the above-mentioned ten years the least number occurred
                    during the month of February, only 3, whereas there occurred in May 1194, in
                    June 3724, in July 4419, in August 3306, and in September 1461. As regards the
                    daily period, the least number, 147, occurred between 1 and 2 A.M., and the
                    greatest, 1704, between 3 and 4 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> In Götalandaud
                    Svealand most of the thunderstorms come with a south-westerly wind, in Norrland
                    with a southerly; for the whole country, the least number come with a northerly
                    wind.</p>
                <p>If the number of thunderstorms is small in Sweden, the same is in a still higher
                    degree to be said of their intensity. Hail, which on the Continent causes such
                    immense damage to the growing crops, is rare in Sweden, and often quite
                    harmless. In the south of Germany about 2 per cent. of the crops are annually
                    destroyed by hail. At Magdeburg the damage is 0·9 per cent., at Berlin 0·6 to
                    0·7 per cent., but in Sweden only 0·06 per cent. (H. H. H.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The fundamental rocks of Sweden belong to the
                    Azoic or Pre-Cambrian formation, and consist of crystalline rocks. Three great
                    divisions of this formation may be distinguished,—the grey gneiss, the red iron
                    gneiss, and the granulite.</p>
                <p>The grey gneiss rules in the northern and western parts of the country, from West
                    Norrland down to the province of Calmar. The rock has a prevalent grey colour,
                    and contains as characteristic minerals garnet and in some parts graphite.</p>
                <p>The red iron gneiss prevails in western Sweden in the provinces of Vermland,
                    Skaraborg, Elfsborg, and down to the province of</p>
                <p>Christianstad. The formation is very uniform in its character, the gneiss having
                    a red colour and containing small granules of magnetite, but, nevertheless, not
                    a single iron-mine belongs to this region. The red gneiss contains in many
                    places beds or masses of hyperite.</p>
                <p>The granulite, also called eurite and hälleflinta, is the most important of the
                    Pre-Cambrian formation, as it contains all the metalliferous deposits of Sweden.
                    It prevails in the middle part of the country, in the provinces of Vermland,
                    Kopparberg, Vestmanland, and Upsala. It occurs also in some parts of the
                    provinces of Ostergötland, Calmar, aud Kronoherg. The main rock in this region
                    consists of hälleflinta, a kind of very compact and finegrained mixture of
                    feldspar, quartz, and mica, often graduating to mica schists, quartzite, and
                    gneiss. With these rocks are often associated limestones, dolomites, and marbles
                    containing serpentine (Kolmården). The metalliferous deposits have generally the
                    form of beds or layers between the strata of granulite and limestones. They are
                    often highly contorted aud dislocated.</p>
                <p>The iron-mines occur imbedded in more or less fine-gr <hi rend="underline"
                    >ain</hi> ed gneiss or granulite (Gellivaara, Grängesberg, Norberg, Striberg),
                    or separated from the granulite by masses of augitic and amphibolous minerals
                    (<hi rend="italic">grönskarn),</hi> as in Persberg and Nordmark. Sometimes they
                    are surrounded by hälleflinta and limestone, as at Dannemora, Läugban, Pajsberg,
                    and then carry manganiferous minerals. Argentiferous galena occurs at Sala in
                    limestone, surrounded by granulite, and at Guldsmedshytta (province of Örebro)
                    in dark hälleflinta. Copper pyrites occurs at Falun in mica-schists, surrounded
                    by hälleflinta. Zinc blende occurs in large masses at Ammeberg, near the
                    northern end of Lake Vetter. The cobalt ore consists of cobalt-glance (Tuuaberg
                    in the province of Södermanland) and of linneite (at Gladhammar, near
                    Vestervik). The nickel ore of Sweden is magnetic pyrites, containing only a very
                    small percentage of nickel. The magnetic pyrites occurs generally imbedded in
                    diorite and greenstones. In the evidently most recent division of the granulite
                    occurs clay-slate (at Grythytta in the province of Örebro).</p>
                <p>Large masses of granite are found in many parts of Sweden, and form extensive
                    massiffs as in the provinces of Kronoberg, Örebro, Göteborg, Stockholm, &amp;c.
                    Sometimes the granite graduates into gneiss; sometimes (as north of Stockholm)
                    it encloses large angular pieces of gneiss. In many parts of Sweden occur
                    greenstones, as hyperite, gabbro (anorthite-gabbro at Rådmanso in the province
                    of Stockholm), and diorite, the last often forming beds between the strata of
                    the gneiss.</p>
                <p>The Cambrian formation occurs generally associated with the Lower Silurian, and
                    consists of many divisions. The oldest is a sandstone, in which are found traces
                    of worms, impressions of <hi rend="italic">Medusae,</hi> and shells of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingula.</hi> The upper divisions consist of bituminous
                    limestones, clay-slates, alum-slate, and contain numerous species of trilobites
                    of the genera <hi rend="italic">Paradoxides, Conocoryphe, Agnostics,
                    Sphaerophthalmus, Peltura,</hi> &amp;c. In Öland and north of Siljan are found
                    beds with <hi rend="italic">Obolus.</hi></p>
                <p>The Lower Silurian consists of the following divisions :—(1) beds with <hi
                    rend="italic">Ceratopyge</hi>; (2) schists with Graptolites; (3) large beds of
                    red and grey limestone (200 feet in thickness) containing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megalaspis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orthoceratites.</hi> This limestone is
                    largely used as building material; (4) slates with <hi rend="italic">Trinucleus;
                    (5)</hi> slates with Brachiopods; (6) slates with Graptolites. The Cambrian and
                    Lower Silurian strata occur scattered in several places from Vesterbotten down
                    to Jemtland (around Storsjön), and in the provinces of Skaraborg, Elfsborg,
                    Örebro, Ostergötland, and Christianstad. The whole of the island of Öland
                    cousists of these strata. The strata are in most places very little disturbed,
                    and form horizontal or slightly inclined layers. They are, south of Lake Vener,
                    capped by thick beds of eruptive diabase (called <hi rend="italic">trapp).</hi>
                    North of Lake Siljan (province of Kopparberg) occur Lower Silurian but not
                    Cambrian strata, which have been very much dislocated. The Upper Silurian has in
                    Sweden almost the same character as the Wenlock and Ludlow formation of England.
                    The island of Gotland consists entirely of this formation, which occurs also in
                    some parts of the province of Christianstad. In the western part of the province
                    of Kopparberg are extensive deposits of sandstone, separated by beds of diabase,
                    and seemingly of the same age,—the Middle Silurian,—but no fossils have been
                    found in them. In the vicinity of this sandstone region are large beds and
                    massiffs of porphyries. There are still two sets of stratified, not
                    fossiliferous, deposits, viz., in the province of Elfsborg (formation of
                    Daisland) and around Lake Vetter (formation of Visingsö). The Daisland
                    formation, which attains the thickness of 6000 to 7000 feet, consists of
                    conglomerates, chlorite schists, quartzites, and mica schists. The Visingsö
                    formation, 800 to 1000 feet in thickness, consists of sandstones, clay-slate,
                    &amp;c. In the western and northern alpine part of Sweden, near the boundaries
                    of Norway, the Silurian strata are covered by crystalline rocks, mica schists,
                    quartzites, &amp;c., of an enormous thickness. These rocks form the mass oi the
                    high mountain of Åreskutan, &amp;c.</p>

                    consists partly of sandstones with impressions of plants (cycads, ferns,
                    &amp;c.), and partly of clay-beds with coal.</p>
                <p>The Cretaceous formation occurs in the provinces of Malmohus and Christianstad.
                    Also some spots of this formation are found in the province of Blekinge. The
                    Cretaceous beds of Sweden belong to the most recent division of the Cretaceous
                    formation (chalk and danien). In many parts it has all the characteristics of a
                    coast-deposit.</p>
                <p>The most recent deposits of Sweden date from the Glacial and Post-Glacial
                    periods. At the beginning of the Glacial period the height of Scandinavia above
                    the level of the sea was greater than at present, Sweden being then connected
                    with Denmark and Germany and also across the middle of the Baltic with Russia.
                    On the west the North Sea and Cattegat were also dry land. On the elevated parts
                    of this large continent glaciers were formed, which, proceeding downwards to the
                    lower levels, gave origin to large streams and rivers, the abundant deposits of
                    which formed the diluvial sand and the diluvial clay. In most parts of Sweden
                    these deposits were swept away when the ice advanced, but in Skåne they often
                    form still, as in northern Germany, very thick beds. At its maximum the inland
                    ice not only covered Scandinavia but also passed over the present boundaries of
                    Russia and Germany. When the climate became less severe the ice slowly receded,
                    leaving its moraines, called in Sweden <hi rend="italic">krosstenslera</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">krosstensgrus.</hi> Swedish geologists distinguish between <hi
                    rend="italic">bottengrus</hi> (bottom-gravel, bottom moraine) and ordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">krossgrus</hi> (terminal and side moraine). The former generally
                    consists of a hard and compact mass of rounded, scratched, and sometimes
                    polished stones firmly imbedded in a powder of crushed rock. The latter is less
                    compact and contains angular boulders, often of a considerable size, but no
                    powder. Of later origin than the krosstensgrus is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rullstensgrus</hi> (gravel of rolled stones), which often forms narrow ranges
                    of hills, many miles in length, called <hi rend="italic">åsar,</hi> running
                    generally, independent of the relief of the country, in a north-and-south
                    direction or towards the south-east. They are of the same nature as the kames
                    and eskers in Ireland and Scotland, and consist of rolled pebbles and sand. It
                    is very probable that these åsar were formed on the bottoms of rivers which cut
                    their way in the inland ice. During the disappearance of the great inland ice
                    large masses of mud and sand were carried by the rivers and deposited in the
                    sea. These deposits, known as glacial sand and glacial clay, cover most parts of
                    Sweden south of the provinces of Kopparberg and Vermland, the more elevated
                    portions of the provinces of Elfsborg and Kronoberg excepted. In the glacial
                    clay shells of <hi rend="italic">Yoldia arctica</hi> have been met with in many
                    places <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> near Stockholm). At this epoch the North
                    Sea and the Baltic were connected along the line of Vener, Vetter, Hjelmar, and
                    Mälar. On the other side the White Sea was connected by Lakes Onega and Ladoga
                    with the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic. In the depths of the Baltic aud of
                    Lakes Vener and Vetter there actually exist animals which belong to the arctic
                    fauna and are remnants of the ancient ice-sea. The glacial clay consists
                    generally of their darker and lighter coloured layers, which give it a striped
                    appearance, for which reason it has often been called <hi rend="italic">hvarfvig
                    lera</hi> (striped clay). The glacial clay of the Silurian regions is generally
                    rich in lime and is thus a marl of great fertility. The deposits of glacial sand
                    and clay are found in the southern part of Sweden at a height ranging from 70 to
                    150 feet above the level of the sea, but in the interior of the country at a
                    height of 400 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>On the coasts of the ancient ice-sea, in which the glacial clay was deposited,
                    there were heaped up masses of shells which belong to species still extant
                    around Spitzbergen and Greenland. Most renowned among these shell-deposits are
                    the Kapellbackarne near Uddevalla. With the melting of the great ice-sheet the
                    climate became milder, and the southern part of Sweden was covered with shrubs
                    and plants now found only in the northern and alpine parts of the country <hi
                    rend="italic">(Salix polaris, Dryas octopetala, Betula nana,</hi> &amp;c. ). The
                    sea fauna also gradually changed, the arctic species migrating northward aud
                    being succeeded by the species existing on the coasts of Sweden. The
                    Post-Glacial period now began. Sands <hi rend="italic">(mosand)</hi> and clays
                    <hi rend="italic">(åkerlera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fucuslera)</hi> continued
                    to be deposited on the lower parts of the country. They are generally of
                    insignificant thickness. In the shallow lakes and enclosed bays of the sea there
                    began to be formed and still is in course of formation a deposit known by the
                    name <hi rend="italic">gyttja,</hi> characterized by the diatomaceous shells it
                    contains. Sometimes the gyttja consists mainly of diatoms, and is then called
                    <hi rend="italic">bergmj'öl.</hi> The gyttja of the lakes is generally covered
                    over by peat of a later date. In many of the lakes of Sweden there is still in
                    progress the formation of an iron-ore, called <hi rend="italic">sjömalm,</hi>
                    ferric hydroxide, deposited in forms resembling peas, coins, &amp;c., and used
                    for the manufacture of iron.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    miles are covered with wild vegetation. This may be broadly divided into five
                    different sorts, viz., the forest, bush, marsh, heath, and prairie vegetations,
                    of which the first-mentioned covers by far the largest area, or upwards of 40
                    per cent. of the whole surface of Sweden. In the northern part of the country
                    the fir <hi rend="italic">(Pinus sylvestris)</hi> and the pine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pinus Abies)</hi> are the predominating trees; south of Dal Elf the oak <hi
                    rend="italic">(Quercus pedunculata),</hi> and in the southern and south-western
                    provinces the beech <hi rend="italic">(Fagus sylvatica),</hi> are, together with
                    the fir and pine, the forest-forming trees. Besides these, there are two species
                    of birch <hi rend="italic">(Betula verrucosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B.
                    odorata),</hi> which form considerable forests. The bush vegetation derives its
                    character from various species of <hi rend="italic">Salix, Rubus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosa,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Prunus spinosa</hi> and several
                    other species. The marsh vegetation is composed of some low bushes, of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyperaceae, Gramineae,</hi> and a small number of dicotyledonous
                    and large-flowered monocotyledonous plants. The heath vegetation consists
                    principally of social <hi rend="italic">Ericaceae,</hi> especially heather <hi
                    rend="italic">(Calluna vulgaris),</hi> and the prairie vegetation of a
                    considerable variety of plants.</p>
                <p>The Swedish phanerogamic flora is angiospermous, with about thrice as many
                    dicotyledonous as monocotyledonous plants. The gymnosperms are only about 0·25
                    per cent. of the species of the flora. Its largest families are (in the order of
                    number of species) <hi rend="italic">—Compositae, Gramineae, Cyperaceae,
                    Cruciferae, Papilionaceae, Rosaceae, Personatae, Ramrnculaceae, Umbclliferae,

                    being represented by 160, the last-named by 38 species. The number of families

                    >Carex,</hi> with 88 species. More than 250 genera are represented by only one
                    species each. The whole number of phanerogamic species now known in Sweden is
                    1475. Of these only a very small number can be supposed to have originated in
                    the country; the greatest number have immigrated from the south or east after
                    the Glacial period, or have been introduced in one way or another by man. Among
                    the immigrated species about 400 are more or less generally spread over the
                    polar countries of the present period, or are to be found in southern countries
                    as alpine plants. The great mass of these Glacial plants, the earliest
                    inhabitants of the country, are confined to the northern part of Sweden; a
                    smaller number are also to be found, or are only to be found, in the south and
                    in particular localities; a larger number—about 70 species—are abundantly
                    distributed over the whole country.</p>
                <p>The Glacial plants were followed and superseded partly by subarctic or subglacial
                    species. Of these the Swedish flora has about 300, of which 50 are abundantly
                    spread over the country, and 80 are pretty generally and abundantly distributed.
                    The principal mass of the remaining species of the flora have immigrated in the
                    same period as the oak, and have spread over the country south of Dal Elf, or
                    also to the provinces immediately to the north of this river; some are outlying
                    steppe-plants; some have entered with the beech, the last immigrated forest-tree
                    of Sweden; and a small number of species, now limited to the west of the
                    country, have possibly entered during a period before that of the beech, when
                    the climate was warmer and moister than at present. (F. K.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> After the close of the Glacial period a twofold
                    immigration of animals occurred,—from the south-west through Denmark, and from
                    the north-east through Finland. Of the existing fauna, many species are widely
                    spread. Especially in the north we find boreal circumpolar forms (wild reindeer,
                    glutton, arctic fox, ptarmigan, several birds of prey, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grallae,</hi> and aquatic birds). Others, such as the bear, the wolf, the fox,
                    the magpie, &amp;c., are to be found only in the Old World, but are represented
                    in America by forms resembling them so much as to be regarded by many as only
                    local varieties. Many of the commonest species, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    squirrel, the woodpeckers, the crow, most of the singing-birds, &amp;c., though
                    wanting in the New World, are distributed over Europe and parts of northern
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>Besides these we find also specially eastern, southern, and western forms, which
                    have immigrated from widely separated regions. Thus, the northern hare, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepus timidus,</hi> properly an inhabitant of Russia and Siberia,
                    but also to be found in the mountainous tracts of central Europe, is common in
                    most parts of Sweden, while the European hare, <hi rend="italic">Lepus
                    europaeus,</hi> which is spread over central and western Europe, and is also to
                    be found in Denmark, is wanting. Most of the field-mice, and many birds which
                    have an exclusively eastern range, have immigrated from Siberia. Among mammals,
                    which nearly all belong to Europe, may be mentioned the roe-deer and the
                    red-deer, the dormouse and the hedgehog; the last-named is common in central and
                    southern Sweden. The elk is considered to have immigrated from the south.</p>
                <p>Not very long ago the bear, lynx, and wolf were common in all the forests of
                    northern and central Sweden, but their number has rapidly decreased during the
                    last fifty years. The bear is now confined to the wildest mountain and forest
                    regions of Norrland and Kopparberg län. The wolf was formerly common throughout
                    the country, aud between 500 and 600 were killed annually fifty<pb break="no"

                    it is to be found almost exclusively in the mountain regions of Norrland. The
                    lynx is also being exterminated; it is still found in the greater part of
                    northern and central Sweden, at least as far south as Lake Vener. On the other
                    hand, foxes have of late increased, at least in certain parts of the country,
                    and are common everywhere. The glutton also is by no means rare in the mountain
                    regions of Lapland. The destruction of cattle caused by beasts of prey,
                    especially in the north, is not inconsiderable, the loss being estimated at
                    about 2500 reindeer and from 9000 to 10,000 sheep and goats annually.</p>
                <p>Not without influence on the number of the smaller beasts of prey are the
                    singular migrations of the mountain <hi rend="smallcaps">Lemming</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which has its home on the higher mountains above the
                    tree-limit, whence in certain years it migrates in countless numbers to the
                    lower forest regions and lowlands, doing great damage to the vegetation wherever
                    it goes. After the last migration in 1883 the number of the foxes was found to
                    have increased in the regions through which the lemmings had passed.</p>
                <p>Of eatable game the elk lιolds the first place. It has increased in numbers and
                    range of late years, and is pretty common in the forest tracts of central
                    Sweden. The roe-deer, which has its proper home in the southmost parts of
                    Sweden, has also increased of late, and has been seen as far north as Örebro län
                    and Vestmanland. Hares occur in great abundance. Seals are found round the
                    coast; they are hunted chiefly in the Baltic and the Gulf of Bothnia. Besides
                    the larger beasts of prey, martens, weasels, otters, and squirrels are hunted
                    for the sake of their skins, but not to any great extent. The beaver is now
                    probably extinct. Some of the mammals (the bat, hedgehog, dormouse, badger,
                    bear) hibernate; most of the other animals are in winter covered with a thicker
                    coat of hair, and some change their colour to white or grey.</p>
                <p>The wood-grouse is the most valued winged game. Its favourite haunt is the great
                    lone forests. Although it has been obliged to retreat before advancing
                    cultivation, it is still pretty common in suitable places. More numerous and
                    almost as much liked is the black grouse, which has somewhat the same
                    distribution as the wood-grouse, but is less particular in the choice of its
                    abode. In the forests of central and especially of northern Sweden the
                    hazel-grouse is numerous in many places, and on the mountains above the
                    tree-limit the ptarmigan is common everywhere. In the birch and willow regions
                    we find the willow-ptarmigan, which above the snow-line is superseded by the
                    common ptarmigan. In winter a great deal of game is exported from Norrland to
                    the southern provinces. The partridge, probably introduced about 1500, with
                    difficulty endures the rude climate of Sweden, and great numbers often perish in
                    winter for want of food. Still it is distributed all over southern and central
                    Sweden as far north as Jemtland, and of late its numbers have increased. The
                    number of woodcock and snipe is, like that of <hi rend="italic">Gratiae</hi> in
                    general, decreasing. Numerous sea-fowl are found on all the coasts. Some are
                    killed and eaten, but as a rule they are not much relished. Their eggs are
                    collected for food by the inhabitants of the seaboard. The eider-duck is common
                    on both coasts. Among the birds of prey the hawk is the most destructive and the
                    most hunted. The gyrfalcon and the golden eagle are found in Norrland and
                    Lapland, and the sea-eagle throughout the country, especially on the coasts.
                    Some kinds of falcons and owls are very common, the latter especially in
                    northern Sweden. In the interior the most characteristic birds are swallows,
                    sparrows, the birds of the crow family, and the singing-birds, among which the
                    lark, the chaffinch, the thrushes, and the many species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sylvia</hi> are most noticeable. The northern nightingale is rare in southern
                    Sweden. The cuckoo is heard everywhere, especially in the forest regions. The
                    mute swan is found in great numbers in a few places in southern and central
                    Sweden. The whooper swan frequents the marshes and lakes of Lapland. The white
                    stork is found in Skåne and Halland, and herons are found in great numbers here
                    and there in Skâne and Blekinge. Cranes are distributed all over the country.
                    Characteristic of the wild forest tracts of Lapland is the Siberian jay. Upwards
                    of 250 species of birds may be considered as belonging to the Swedish fauna,
                    most of them birds of passage, scarcely 40 remaining over winter in their summer
                    resorts. In spring and autumn Sweden is visited by great flocks of the birds of
                    passage of the extreme north, especially geese and snipe.</p>
                <p>The reptiles and amphibians are few (3 snakes, 3 lizards, 11 batrachians).</p>
                <p>The Swedish rivers and lakes are generally well stocked with fish. The objects of
                    capture are chiefly salmon, eel, pike, different species of perch, burbot, and
                    several species of the <hi rend="italic">Salmonidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyprinidae.</hi> The annual income from the fisheries in the lakes and rivers
                    amounts to upwards of £135,800, of which the salmon fisheries alone yield
                    £42,000. Of still greater importance, of course, are the sea-fisheries. In the
                    end of last century the herring fishery in the “skärgård” of the west coast was
                    the most important in Europe, and it is estimated that in one year 1500 millions
                    of herrings were taken. Somewhat later, however, the great shoaΓs disappeared
                    for a long time. In 1877 a new era began in the his tory of the west-coast
                    fisheries, the take that year being 1,230,000 cubic feet. Since then the herring
                    has returned every year in greater or smaller numbers. There are also captured
                    on the same coast flat-fishes and cod-fish, mackerel, and sprats. The annual
                    produce of the sea-fishery of the south and west coasts is valued at about
                    £111,000. A smaller variety of the herring is found in great abundance on the
                    east coast. In the Sound it is still 11 inches in length, in the Baltic only 6
                    or 8 inches. This variety is called “stromming,” and is the object of an
                    important fishery, annually bringing in more than £175,000. About 140 kinds of
                    fishes are constantly found in Sweden or along its coasts. Of these nearly 100
                    belong exclusively to the sea, and upwards of 10 are to be found both in salt
                    and fresh water. The remainder are properly freshwater fishes, but many are
                    found in the brackish water of the Baltic coasts. Here we find perch, pike,
                    &amp;c., by the side of purely saltwater fishes, as the “stromming,” the
                    flat-fish, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The species of Scandinavian insects number at least 15,000. Notorious among these
                    are the Lapland gnats. The “skargârd” of the west coast has a rich fauna of
                    lower marine animals, partly forms of boreal and arctic descent, partly
                    immigrants from the south. The Royal Academy of Science has here a zoological
                    station, Kristineberg, for the purpose of scientifically examining the marine
                    fauna.</p>
                <p>Compared with the fauna of the west coast, that of the Baltic is extremely poor.
                    It consists partly of European boreal forms, which have immigrated from the
                    west, partly of freshwater forms, which have been able to live in the brackish
                    water. But other types also occur, which, though sparingly represented, are of
                    the greatest interest to the naturalist,—namely, certain dwarfed forms,—two or
                    three species of fishes, some crustaceans and other lower marine animals,
                    belonging to a purely arctic fauna, which have immigrated when the Baltic during
                    a part of the Glacial period communicated with the White Sea. They are wanting
                    on the south and west coasts of Sweden, but are found in the Arctic Ocean. Some
                    of them, the four-horned cottus and some crustaceans, are found in Lake Vetter
                    and some other lakes of central Sweden, whither they had come when these lakes
                    formed part of the arctic sea; they have since been shut in and have survived
                    both the climate and the altered composition of the water. The arctic “vikare”
                    seal <hi rend="italic">(Phoea fοetida),</hi> which is common in the north part
                    of the Baltic but is not found on the west coast, and which is also found in
                    Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, and some lakes of Finland, is also considered as a
                    survival of the fauna of the Glacial period. On the west coast lobster and
                    oyster fisheries are carried on, the former being very productive. The common
                    mussel is abundant, but in Sweden is only used as bait for fish. The crayfish is
                    common in many places in central and southern Sweden. Pearls are sometimes found
                    in the freshwater mussel <hi rend="italic">Margaritana margaritifera,</hi> which
                    is met with all over the country. (A. WI. )</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extent and Population.—</hi> Sweden takes rank among the larger
                    countries of Europe. It contains 170,712·60 English square miles, of which area
                    3,517·29 square miles are occupied by the large lakes Vener, Vetter, Mälar, and
                    Hjelmar, leaving 167,195·31 square miles, distributed among the counties as

                <p>The population has long been steadily increasing. In 1750 it amounted to
                    1,763,368, in 1800 to 2,347,303, and in 1850 to 3,482,541. The census of
                    December 31, 1880, returned the number as 4,565,668 (2,215,243 males, 2,350,425
                    females), and at the end of 1885 the population was estimated at 4,682,769
                    (2,273,861 males, 2,408,908 females).</p>
                <p>It will be seen that Sweden is sparsely peopled (the average for the whole
                    country being only 28 inhabitants to the square mile), and that the population
                    is very unevenly distributed,—Malmohus län, which lies farthest south, counting
                    193 persons to the square mile, whereas Norrbotten, farthest to the north, and
                    by far the largest county, has only 2·4.</p>
                <p>The urban population as late as 1884 amounted to only 777,857 (the rural
                    amounting to 3,866,591). The towns are in general small. Except Stockholm
                    (215,688 inhabitants in 1885), only five towns—Gothenburg (91,033), Malmö
                    (44,532), Norrköping (28,503), Gefle (20,753), and Upsala (20,202)—had in 1885
                    more than 20,000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The average number of marriages per 1000 inhabitants was for each of the years
                    1751-60 9·09; this proportion has gradually diminished since, having been 7·60
                    in 1851·60 and 6·81 in 1871— 80. The yearly average of living children born from
                    1871-80 was 133,730, and the yearly average of deaths 80,140. The yearly average
                    of deaths to 100 inhabitants for 1751-1815 was 2·71; this number has since been
                    almost constantly decreasing, the average for 1851-60 being 2·17, and for
                    1871-80 1·82. Immigration and emigration till comparatively recent times had
                    little influence on the numbers of population, but the latter years of the
                    decennial period 1860-70 caused a change in this respect. The number of
                    emigrants, which as late as 1867 amounted to little more than 9000, increased
                    during 1868 to 27,000 and during 1869 to 39,000. During the years that followed
                    there was a considerable decrease, but towards 1880 the number of emigrants
                    again rapidly increased, and in 1882 this amounted to upwards of 50,000. The
                    figure for 1884 was 23,560. Immigration, on the contrary, continues to be
                    insignificant. The annual average of immigrants for 1875-84 was 3333.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Sweden belong almost exclusively to the Scandinavian race. The
                    principal exceptions are the Finns (in 1880 about 17,000), who chiefly inhabit
                    the north-eastern part of the county of Norrbotten, the Lapps (in 1880 about
                    6400), spread over an area of about 44,000 square miles in Lapland and Jemtland,
                    and the Jews (in 1880 about 3000).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi> —Agriculture is the principal industry in
                    Sweden. The number of persons gaining their livelihood by this occupation and
                    those immediately depending on it was 2,342,000 in 1880, and the value of the
                    harvest in 1884 was estimated at about £25,500,000 sterling, of which the
                    grain-harvest made £14,800,000. From 1840 to 1880 the export of grain (including
                    meal, &amp;c. ) exceeded the import; but this has not been the case since 1881,
                    while, on the other hand, the export of dairy produce has meanwhile
                    increased.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mines.—</hi> Sweden is rich in minerals, especially iron-ores,
                    and the Swedish iron is celebrated for its good quality. In 1884 526 iron-mines
                    were worked, the joint produce of which amounted to 922,310 tons. The
                    manufacture of cast-iron amounted to 416,958 tons, that of bar-iron to 267,534
                    tons, of steel to 66,329 tons, and of hardware to 43,226 tons. The copper during
                    the same year amounted to 650 tons, and the silver to rather more than 4000 lb.
                    Pit-coal has been found only in Malmohus län, and even there in small quantity
                    compared to the consumption of the country. The produce of the coal-mines was in
                    1884 not more than 7,277,000 cubic feet, whereas the import of coal amounted to
                    52,650,000 cubic feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forests.—</hi> A great part of Sweden is, as was above
                    mentioned, covered with forests. Most of these are the property of private
                    persons or joint-stock companies, but the Government also possesses large
                    forests, the value of which was in 1884 estimated at about £2,400,000. The
                    forest produce ranks among the principal articles of export from Sweden.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> It was not till 1854 that Sweden completely
                    broke with the pre-existing protectionist system and adopted the principles of
                    free trade. Since 1860 there has been no prohibition, and import duty is in
                    general low. The value of the manufactures, which as late as 1850 was estimated
                    at only £2,000,000, was for 1883 computed at more than £10,600,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The united value of the exports and imports of
                    Sweden was estimated for 1850 at little more than £4,000,000, whereas in 1884 it
                    was something over £31,000,000 (imports about £18,000,000, exports about
                    £13,000,000). The principal articles of export were—timber and wooden wares,
                    £5,747,000; metals and hardware goods, £2,667,000; grain (including meal,
                    &amp;c.), £1,307,000; animal food, £1,081,000; live animals, £652,000; paper and
                    stationery, £584,000. The principal articles of import during the same year
                    were—cotton and woollen manufactured goods, £3,012,000; colonial products
                    (coffee, sugar, &amp;c.), £2,309,000; grain and meal, £2,258,000; minerals
                    (principally coal), £1,479,000; metals and hardware goods, £1,308,000; cotton,
                    wool, &amp;c. £1,125,000; animal food, £1,036,000; ships, carriages, machines,
                    instruments, &amp;c., £807,000; hair, hides, bones, horns, and other animal
                    substances, £784,000; tallow, oils, tar, gums, and similar substances, £782,000.
                    The aggregate burden of vessels entering from and clearing to foreign ports was
                    858,827 tons in 1850, 5,388,085 tons in 1884. The estimated value of the exports
                    to the United Kingdom during 1884 was £6,229,000, to Denmark £1,848,000, to
                    France £1,073,000, to Germany £1,008,000, and to Norway £604,000; while the
                    imports from Great Britain and Ireland reached £4,952,000, from Germany
                    £4,947,000, from Denmark £2,932,000, from Russia and Finland £1,881,000, and
                    from Norway £1,225,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways, Posts, and Telegraphs.—</hi> The length of the
                    railways in Sweden is very great in proportion to the population. In 1884 the
                    total length was 4194 miles, of which 1437 miles belonged to the Government and
                    2657 to 76 private companies. The postal system is remarkably well organized. In
                    1884 the number of post offices was 1965, through which 46,533,627 inland
                    letters, postcards, post-office orders, newspaper and book packets, &amp;c.,
                    were forwarded, and 5,507,770 to and 6,511,248 from foreign countries. The
                    telegraph system is also in a very flourishing condition. The total length of
                    the telegraph wires in 1884 was 12,969 miles, aud the number of messages
                    forwarded was 1,178,959.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> With regard to education Sweden occupies a
                    very prominent place. Primary education is compulsory for all the children of
                    the country, and this principle is so strictly applied that in 1884 out of
                    733,329 children of school-age only 15,143 were not under tuition. To supply
                    this primary instruction there are 9925 national schools of different kinds,
                    with 5216 male teachers and 6832 female teachers (1884). For higher educational
                    purposes there are 96 public schools (1885), of three grades, with 14,617
                    pupils, and two universities (Upsala with 1821 and Lund with 827 students). In
                    Stockholm there is, besides, a medical faculty, the Royal Caroline
                    Medico-Chirurgical Institution. A free university is in course of formation, for
                    which large sums have been given by private persons. There are a large number of
                    Government schools for the military and naval services, for the technical
                    sciences, for metallurgy, agriculture, nautical science, and for the blind and
                    the deaf and dumb. All instruction at the national schools, the public schools,
                    and the universities is free.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> Christianity was introduced into Sweden about
                    the ninth century, and was generally professed by the twelfth. The country
                    adopted the doctrines of the Reformation during the reign of Gustavus Vasa. The
                    national church, established by the resolution passed at Upsala in 1593 (<hi
                    rend="italic">Upsala mote),</hi> is Lutheran. The country is divided into 12
                    bishoprics (<hi rend="italic">stift).</hi> The bishop of Upsala is archbishop of
                    Sweden. In 1880 the number of dissenters was 21,234, of whom 14,627 were
                    Baptists, 2993 Jews, 1591 Methodists, and 810 Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Army and Navy.—</hi> The land defences consist partly of a
                    standing army, partly of a militia. The former is for the most part founded on
                    the so-called “indelningsverk,” an institution dating from the time of Sweden’s
                    greatness, which makes the soldier a settled farmer. This force comprises about
                    40,000 men. The militia comprises (since 1885) all males between twenty-one and
                    thirty-two years of age. The time of drill for the militia is only forty-two
                    days, extending over two years.</p>
                <p>The navy, with a permanent personnel (also for the most part founded on the
                    “indelningsverk ”) of rather more than 7000 men, consists principally of
                    coasting vessels, both ironclad aud unarmoured.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> Sweden is a limited monarchy. Its
                    constitution, like that of England, rests on an historical development of
                    several centuries. From the earliest times the people governed themselves
                    through elected trustees, made laws and levied taxes, while the king was little
                    more than their leader in war. By and by the power of the king was extended, and
                    alongside of it there arose a class of great men, who certainly lessened the
                    legal rights of the lower orders, but who never succeeded in completely subduing
                    them. Through Engelbrecht the burghers and yeomen regained their influence on
                    the development of the state, and their deputies were summoned to the riksdag
                    (1435). Gustavus Vasa and his son Charles IX. stripped the nobility of the high
                    authority they had exercised during the latter part of the mediaeval period, and
                    which had been dangerous both to the power of the king and to the people, and so
                    saved the work of Engelbrecht. The right of the lower classes to be members of
                    the riksdag was confirmed by the first “Riksdagsordning” (“law for regulating
                    the riksdag or parliament”) of Sweden (1617),<pb break="no"

                    system of four houses formerly adopted. In the 16th century the nobility, having
                    been endowed with extensive domains by the crown, again won an ascendency that
                    was very dangerous to the lower classes, but it was crushed when Charles XI., by
                    the diminution of their property (1680), for ever put an end to the supremacy of
                    the nobility and the council in the state. By this act the power of the king was
                    greatly strengthened, so much so as to endanger even the most essential rights
                    of the riksdag,—those of giving laws and levying taxes. But after the death of
                    Charles XII. the despotic system was abolished, and all power was lodged in the
                    hands of the riksdag by the constitutions of 1719 and 1720. During the following
                    period, which is called “the time of liberty,” it was the riksdag that had the
                    function of appointing and dismissing the councillors of state, and by this
                    means was able to dominate the administration so completely as to make the power
                    of the king of little more significance than an empty word. Different political
                    parties defeated each other, and sold their services to foreign states without
                    any regard to the interests of their own country. This state of affairs, which
                    might eventually have proved exceedingly disastrous, was altered by a revolution
                    effected by Gustavus III. (1772), which restored to the king his former power.
                    In the new constitution, however, neither the authority of the king nor that of
                    the people was clearly limited, and this soon led to collisions by which the
                    king succeeded in considerably increasing his ascendency (1789), though he
                    cannot be said to have gained despotic power. Gustavus IV., however, abused his
                    great authority, so that he was dethroned by a revolution. New constitutional
                    laws were now made, in which, guided by the experience of former times, an
                    effort was made clearly to define the respective powers of the king and the
                    representatives of the people, to prevent encroachment from either side. The
                    effort was crowned with success, and the new constitution of June 6, 1809, is
                    still in great measure in force. The old division, however, into four houses has
                    been abolished, and the influence of the representatives of the people has been
                    increased by the new Riksdagsordning of 1866. The other constitutional laws are
                    the “Successionsordning” (“law of succession”) of 1810 and the
                    “Tryckfrihetsordning” (“law regulating the liberty of the press”) of 1812.</p>
                <p>The executive power is vested in the king alone. The legislative power he shares
                    with the riksdag, both parties having the rights of initiative and veto. The
                    king has, besides, a legislative power, not precisely defined, in certain
                    economic matters. The right of levying taxes belongs to the riksdag alone; but
                    the king may in certain cases (as, for example, through his right of lowering
                    the custom duties) exercise a certain influence. He can declare war and make
                    peace, and has the supreme command of the army.</p>
                <p>The king is irresponsible, but all his resolutions must be taken in the presence
                    of responsible councillors (“statsrâd”). These, who form the council of state,
                    are ten in number, of whom seven are also the heads of departments of the
                    administration (justice, foreign affairs, army, navy, internal affairs, finance,
                    and ecclesiastical affairs, including both church and schools). For the advice
                    they give the councillors of state are responsible to the riksdag, which revises
                    the record of their proceedings through an annually appointed board, which has
                    power also to indict the councillors before a special tribunal, the “riksrätt,”
                    formed for the occasion, of which certain high functionaries have to be members.
                    One of the councillors of state is, as prime minister, the head of the
                    administration.</p>
                <p>The riksdag meets every year on January 15, and consists of two houses. The
                    members of the first house, one for every 30,000 inhabitants (143 in 1887), are
                    elected by the “landsting” in the counties, or by the municipal councils of the
                    larger towns, for a period of nine years. They receive no payment. Any Swede is
                    eligible who is at least thirty-five years of age, who possesses, and for three
                    years before the election has possessed, real property to the value of 80,000
                    crowns, or who, during the same period, has paid taxes on an annual income of
                    4000 crowns. The members of the second house (one or two for every district of
                    judicature in the country, according as the population exceeds or falls short of
                    40,000, and one for every 10,000 inhabitants in the towns) receive a salary of
                    1200 crowns, and are elected for a period of three years by electors, or
                    directly, according to the resolution of the electoral district. If a member
                    retires during that period, his successor is elected for the remainder of the
                    three years, and thus the house is wholly renewed at regular intervals, which is
                    not the case with the first house. The franchise is possessed by every one who
                    owns landed property to the value of 1000 crowns, or who has farmed for at least
                    five years lands worth 6000 crowns, or pays taxes on an annual income of 800
                    crowns. All electors are eligible. The number of electors is about 6·5 per cent.
                    of the population. The towns elect their representatives separately. Both houses
                    have in theory equal power. Before bills are discussed they are prepared by
                    boards, whose members are elected by half of each house. When the houses differ
                    on budget questions, the matter is settled by a common vote of both houses,
                    which arrangement gives the second house a certain advantage from the greater
                    number of its members. By revisers elected annually the riksdag controls the
                    finances of the kingdom, and by an official (“justitieombudsman”) elected in the
                    same way the administration of justice is controlled; he can indict any
                    functionary of the state who has abused his power. The bank of the kingdom is
                    superintended by trustees elected by the riksdag, and in the same way the public
                    debt is administered through an office (“Riksgäldskontoret”), the leader of
                    which is appointed by the riksdag.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration, Law, and Justice.—</hi> The administration
                    consists partly of a centralized civil service, arranged under different
                    departments, partly of local authorities. Each of the twenty-four counties has a
                    governor (“landshöfding”) who presides over the local offices (the
                    “landskansli,” the “landskontor ”), and is assisted by subordinate local
                    officers (“kronofogdar,” “häradsskrifvare,” “länsmän ”). There is, moreover, in
                    each county a representation (the “landsting ”), elected by the people, that
                    deliberates on the affairs of the county and has a right to levy taxes. Each
                    county is divided into parishes, which, like the towns, have a very strong
                    communal self-government. The law of Sweden dates from 1736, but it has of
                    course undergone a great many alterations and additions, the most important
                    being the new penal law of 1864. Justice is administered by tribunals of three
                    instances :—(1) the “häradsrätter” in the country, consisting of a judge and
                    seven to twelve assessors elected by the people, who, if they are unanimously of
                    an opinion different from that of the judge, can outvote him, and the
                    “rådhusrätter” (boards of magistrates) in the towns; (2) three “hofrätter”
                    (higher courts) in Stockholm, Jönköping, and Christianstad; and (3) the royal
                    supreme court, which passes sentence in the name of the king, and two members of
                    which are present in the council of state when law questions are to be settled;
                    this tribunal has, moreover, to give its opinion upon all proposed changes of
                    the law. A jury is never summoned in Sweden except in cases affecting the
                    liberty of the press.</p>

                    and independent, though both are governed by the same king. The connexions of
                    both countries with foreign states are regulated by the Swedish minister for
                    foreign affairs, but when the king has to settle matters concerning foreign
                    states which also are of importance to Norway a Norwegian councillor of state
                    has to be present. Both countries have the same ambassadors and consuls abroad,
                    and share the expenses of their support, Sweden bearing the larger part of this
                    outlay. In war the two countries are bound to assist each other. Thus the union
                    is what is called a “unio realis.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> F. N.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi> II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi></p>
                <p>From the earliest times of which we have any authentic information there were in
                    Sweden two more or less distinct peoples,—the Göta or Goths in the south, and
                    the Svea or Swedes in the north. They spoke similar languages, were of the same
                    Teutonic stock, and had like customs, institutions, and religious beliefs; but
                    these facts did not prevent them from regarding one another with jealousy and
                    dislike. The most powerful king among these peoples was the king at Upsala.
                    There were other chiefs or kings, called in later times smaa-kongar, but they
                    recognized the superiority of the Upsala king, whose peculiar position was due
                    to the fact that there was at Upsala a great temple of Wodan, which was held in
                    equal reverence by the Swedes and the Goths. Upsala was in the territory of the
                    Swedes, and we can account for the feeling of the Goths with regard to it only
                    by supposing that they were an offshoot from the Swedes, and that the worship of
                    Wodan was in some special way associated with Upsala before the separation took
                    place. Of the two peoples, the Goths seem to have been most active and open to
                    new ideas. They spread along the southern coasts of Sweden and among the islands
                    of the Baltic, and there can be little doubt that the Goths in Germany and
                    Russia, who played so great a part in the disruption of the Roman empire, sprang
                    from the Swedish Goths.</p>
                <p>Slavery was not unknown in ancient Sweden, but it did not form an important
                    element in social life. The vast majority of the people were free. They were
                    divided into two classes, jarls and bondar, corresponding to the Anglo-Saxon
                    eorls and ceorls. The bondar were the landed freemen, while the jarls were of
                    noble blood. In some remote age the land may have been held in common by village
                    communities, but in historic times there has always been in Sweden private
                    property in land as well as in movables,—the jarls having wider lands than the
                    bondar, and some bondar being better off than other members of their class. The
                    kings were treated with much respect, for they belonged to families which were
                    believed to be descended from the gods; but their power was far from being
                    absolute. When a king died, his authority did not necessarily pass to one of his
                    sons; the freemen chose as his successor the member of the royal family who
                    seemed to them best fitted for the duties of the office. The king’s power was
                    limited not only by the fact that he was elected but by the rights of the
                    freemen in all matters concerning life and land. At regular times moots were
                    held for legal, legislative, and political purposes; and without the sanction of
                    the Great Thing, as the tribal assembly was called, no law was valid and no
                    judgment good.</p>
                <p>Besides the Great Thing, of which all freemen were members, there were local
                    things, each attended by the freemen of the district to which it belonged. The
                    chief function of these local assemblies was to settle disputes between freemen,
                    their decisions being given in accord ance with rules based on ancient customs.
                    Very often their judgments could not be enforced; and here, as in other Teutonic
                    lands, the impotence of the local popular courts was one of the causes which led
                    to the growth of the king’s authority. He was bound to go round his land in
                    regular progress, doing and enforcing justice among his subjects; and in course
                    of time men felt more and more strongly that the best way of obtaining redress
                    for serious grievances was to appeal directly to him.</p>
                <p>As far back as we can go in Swedish history we find that the principal him of the
                    Upsala kings was to get rid of the smaa-kongar, and to put royal officers in
                    their place. These officers ruled in the king’s name in association with the
                    local things, but their tendency, especially in times of great civil commotion,
                    was to make themselves as independent as possible. The king himself was always
                    attended by some of the leading magnates, who formed a sort of council of state,
                    and with their aid he prepared the plans which were afterwards submitted to the
                    Great Thing. Although the Great Thing never ceased to be in theory an assembly
                    of the nation, it gradually lost its primitive character, the political rights
                    of the common freemen being usurped by the nobles, who sought also to hamper the
                    exercise of the royal authority.</p>
                <p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Ynglinga Saga,</hi> in which bits of old
                    Swedish legends are preserved, the first Upsala kings were Ynglingar, sprung
                    from Yngve Frey, the grandson of Wodan. We are told that the last representative
                    of this dynasty was Ingjald Illrede, that he slew six of the smaa-kongar, and
                    that he afterwards killed himself when he heard that the son of one of the
                    murdered chiefs was advancing against him. It is said that the Ynglingar were
                    succeeded by the Skioldungar, who claimed to be descended from Skiold, Wodan’s
                    son; and the traditional account is that this line began with Ivar Widfadme, and
                    that he not only became king at Upsala but conquered Denmark, a part of Saxony,
                    and the fifth part of England. Another of the Skioldungar, Eric Edmundsson, is
                    said to have been an even greater king than the founder of the dynasty. During
                    this legendary period, kings in Sweden were often at war with kings in Norway
                    and Denmark, and Swedish adventurers undertook many warlike enterprises against
                    the Finns and the Wends. While Danes and Norwegians were founding states in the
                    British Islands and France, the Swedes were accomplishing like results on the
                    eastern shores of the Baltic.</p>
                <p>At this early period Sweden did not take in all the territory which now belongs
                    to it. Scania, one of the most fruitful and prosperous districts of modern
                    Sweden, had been from time immemorial an independent and comparatively powerful
                    Gothic state. In the 9th century it was annexed to Denmark by King Guthrun; and,
                    although in later times it was often a subject of bitter dispute between Denmark
                    and Sweden, its connexion with the former country was not finally severed until
                    the 17th century. Lund, the principal town in Scania, was for many generations
                    the see of the primate of the Danish church.</p>
                <p>The scattered notices of Adam of Bremen, Saxo, and certain saints’ lives, with a
                    few allusions elsewhere, are our direct written sources for this early period.
                    They may be eked out by study of the laws and of local nomenclature. Later the
                    rich runic remains of Sweden give us some fuller help. After the end of the 10th
                    century the evidence gradually becomes clearer and more trustworthy. There was
                    then at Upsala a powerful king called Eric the Victory-Blest. He defeated a band
                    of vikings in a great battle at Fyrisval, and, according to Adam of Bremen, had
                    for some time complete control over Denmark. He was succeeded in 993 by his son
                    Olaf<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n776/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0776-0745"/> (993-1024), who was called the Lap-King because
                    he was a child when his reign began. Olaf was baptized about the year 1000, and
                    was the first Christian king of the Swedes. In the 9th century St Ansgar had
                    laboured for some time as a missionary in Sweden, but without much success. Even
                    Olaf, who was supported in his efforts by Siegfred, the devoted English
                    missionary from whom he had received instruction in Christian doctrine, found
                    that it was impossible to convert the majority of his subjects. He was allowed
                    to build churches in West Gothland, but in the rest of his dominions the people
                    clung obstinately to paganism. During his reign there was war between Sweden and
                    Norway, and Olaf seems to have been in favour of carrying on the struggle with
                    vigour. His people, however, desired peace, and it is related that at the Great
                    Thing at Upsala they threatened to take his life if he did not give Olaf, the
                    Norwegian king, his daughter in marriage. He consented to do as they wished, but
                    broke his promise; and he would probably have been set aside had it not been for
                    the mutual jealousy of the Swedes and the Goths.</p>
                <p>The Lap-King was succeeded, one after the other, by his sons Anund aud Edmund the
                    Elder; and under their rule the church lost much of the ground which it had
                    gained through the efforts of Olaf. After Edmund the Elder’s death the Goths
                    resolved that Stenkil, the Christian jarl of West Gothland, should be made king.
                    This decision was resisted by the Swedes, but the result of the civil war which
                    broke out was that Stenkil was able to maintain his claim. He reigned from 1056
                    to 1066, and effectually protected the church without attempting to do violence
                    to the convictions of the pagan population. His reign was followed by a period
                    of much confusion, during which the Goths and the Swedes treated each other as
                    enemies,— the latter upholding paganism, the former contending for Christianity.
                    Under Inge the Elder, who reigned from 1080 to 1112, the temple at Upsala was
                    burned, and from this time there could be no doubt as to the ultimate triumph of
                    the church, which was served with heroic courage by many zealous foreign
                    missionaries. So much progress was made that Swerker Karlsson, who reigned from
                    about 1135 to 1155, begged the pope to give the Swedish people bishops and a
                    primate. Nicholas Breakspear, the English cardinal who was afterwards raised to
                    the papacy as Adrian IV., was sent to make the necessary arrangements. He found
                    that the Swedes and the Goths could not agree as to a place for the see of a
                    primate; but at a synod which met at Linköping in 1152 it was decided that the
                    Swedish clergy should accept the law of celibacy, and that Sweden should pay a
                    yearly tax to the pope. For a long time many pagan ideas and customs survived,
                    but Sweden was now, at least nominally, a Christian country.</p>
                <p>When Swerker was murdered in 1155 the Goths wished to make his son king, but the
                    Swedes chose Eric Edwards-son, and he reigned until 1160. Eric was so good a
                    king that after his death he was canonized by the popular voice, as was then the
                    way in the North. Upsala was made by him a primate’s see, and he began the
                    series of efforts which led to the annexation of Finland to Sweden. Finnish
                    pirates had often desolated the Swedish coasts, and it had become absolutely
                    necessary that their country should be subdued. Eric not only overcame the
                    Finns, but did what he could to compel them to accept Christianity.</p>
                <p>For about a century after Eric’s death the Goths and the Swedes were almost
                    constantly at war with one another, each people choosing its own king. The Goths
                    preferred the descendants of Swerker, while the Swedes were loyal to the
                    descendants of Eric, who were known as the yeomen-kings, because Eric had
                    originally belonged to the class of bondar or yeomen. The Danish kings often
                    aided one or other of the contending parties, and as a rule they seem to have
                    done far more harm than good by their interference. To some extent the church
                    maintained among the people a sense of national unity, but it was not powerful
                    enough to give much protection to the poorer members of the community against
                    the despotism of local magnates. In the end, when the church itself became rich,
                    the higher clergy were quite as tyrannical as the secular nobles.</p>
                <p>John Swerkerson, the last king of the Swerker dynasty, died in 1222; Eric the
                    Halt, the last of the yeomen-kings, in 1250. In the latter year the crown was
                    given to Waldemar, whose mother was a sister of King Eric the Halt. Waldemar
                    belonged to the Folkungar family, which had acquired great estates and risen to
                    a position of high importance in the state. Under this dynasty the Goths and the
                    Swedes gradually ceased to be jealous of one another, and became a thoroughly
                    united people. From this time civil troubles in Sweden sprang, not from the
                    antagonism of rival peoples, but chiefly from the increasing power of the great
                    landowners, who strove incessantly to limit the rights of the free peasantry,
                    and were often strong enough to defy the crown.</p>
                <p>At the time of the death of Eric the Halt, Birger Brosa, Waldemar’s father, was
                    in Finland, where he conquered Tavastland and strengthened the hold of the
                    Swedish crown over those tribes which had been already subdued. On his return to
                    Sweden he was indignant to find that he had not himself been elected to the
                    throne. He accepted what had been done, however, and devoted his energies to the
                    promotion of his son’s interests. Until his death Birger was the real ruler of
                    Sweden, and the nation had never been governed by a man of stronger will or more
                    upright character. If he did not actually found Stockholm, it was he who made it
                    the strongest fortress in the country,—a service for which the Swedish people
                    had good reason to be grateful to him, for it enabled them to put an end to the
                    depredations of Finnish pirates. After the death of Birger great evils were
                    brought upon the country by the folly and incompetence of Waldemar, who was at
                    last driven from the throne and imprisoned by his brother Magnus, who succeeded
                    him. Magnus (1279-1290) was a lover of pomp and splendour, and formed a more
                    brilliant court than the Swedes had ever seen. He granted immunity from taxation
                    to those landowners who should give the crown <hi rend="italic">ross-djenst</hi>
                    or horse-service, that is, serve the king in war at the head of a body of
                    horsemen. His intention in adopting this plan was to secure for the crown a
                    powerful body of loyal and attached supporters, but, as the measure added to the
                    wealth, dignity, and influence of the nobles, its ultimate effect was to weaken
                    the royal authority. Although he increased the importance of the aristocracy,
                    Magnus was not unmindful of the interests of the common freemen. He is known as
                    Ladu-laas or Barn-Lock, because he issued a law requiring persons of noble birth
                    to pay for the straw and corn with which, when travelling, they might be
                    supplied by peasants. Magnus was also a munificent benefactor of the clergy. He
                    endowed a large number of churches and built five monasteries.</p>
                <p>Magnus was succeeded by his son Birger (1290-1319). Birger was only nine years
                    old when his father died, and for a long time the power of the crown was wielded
                    by his guardian, Torkel Knutsson, a wise and vigorous statesman. Knutsson drew
                    up a code of laws which was accepted by the Great Thing in 1295; and in Finland
                    he not only put down rebellion but annexed Savolax and Carelia. In 1306, misled
                    by his brothers Eric and Waldemar, Birger<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0777-0746"/> caused this faithful and able counsellor to be
                    beheaded, and the result was civil war, in which the weak king found it hard to
                    make way against his restless and ambitious brothers. At last he got them into
                    his power by treachery, and threw them into a dungeon of the castle of Nyköping,
                    where they died of starvation. Soon afterwards Birger himself died, despised and
                    hated by his subjects. He was succeeded by his nephew Magnus, his brother Eric’s
                    son, a child of about three years of age. Magnus’s guardian, Mats Ketilmundsson,
                    was a man of strong and noble character, and as long as his supremacy lasted the
                    Swedish people were more prosperous than they had ever been before. Taking
                    advantage of the troubled condition of Denmark, he joined Scania and the
                    neighbouring districts of Halland and Blekinge to the Swedish kingdom; and had
                    his prudent system of government been maintained these provinces might have been
                    kept, for the inhabitants seem to have preferred Swedish to Danish rule. But,
                    when he died in 1336, the king fell under the influence of unworthy favourites.
                    Scania, Halland, and Blekinge were restored to Denmark, and Sweden was soon in a
                    state of the greatest confusion. In 1363 a number of nobles who had given Magnus
                    much trouble, and whom he had expelled from the country, went to his sister’s
                    son Albert, count of Mecklenburg, and offered him the crown. The offer was
                    accepted, and afterwards Albert was formally elected by the Great Thing. Magnus
                    resisted, but was defeated and made prisoner in a battle at Enköping in 1365. In
                    1371 he was released, and the rest of his days he spent in Norway, where he was
                    not unpopular. From his mother he had inherited the Norwegian crown, but before
                    the misfortunes of his later years it had been transferred to his son Haco.</p>
                <p>The nobles and the hierarchy of Sweden were now so powerful that only a king of
                    the highest political genius could have hoped to control them. Albert of
                    Mecklenburg proved to be utterly unfit for the task he had undertaken. He tried
                    to protect himself by giving many of the great offices of state to Germans, but
                    he was warned that he would be dethroned if he continued to show so much favour
                    to foreigners. In 1371 he accepted as his chief counsellor a great Swedish noble
                    called Bo Jonsson, to whom about a third of the kingdom is said to have
                    belonged. Bo Jonsson gave much more heed to his own interests than to those of
                    his country, and did hardly anything to mitigate the hardships inflicted on the
                    common people at this time by the turbulence of the well-off classes. After Bo
                    Jonsson’s death Albert attempted to regain some of the authority which he had
                    been forced to delegate to his powerful minister; but the nobles refused to obey
                    him, and invited Margaret of Denmark and Norway to take his place.</p>
                <p>Margaret, one of the most remarkable figures in Scandinavian history, was the
                    daughter of Waldemar IV. of Denmark, and at an early age she had become the wife
                    of Haco of Norway, son of the Swedish king whom Albert had supplanted. The
                    offspring of this marriage was an only son, Olaf, who succeeded his grandfather
                    in Denmark in 1375 and his father in Norway in 1380. Both countries were ruled
                    firmly and wisely by Margaret in her son’s name; and after his death in 1387 the
                    Danes and the Norwegians begged her to retain supreme power. To this request she
                    assented; and, when the Swedish nobles asked her to undertake the government of
                    Sweden also, she at once expressed her willingness to attack Albert, who had
                    irritated her by claiming the Danish crown. An army was soon despatched to
                    Sweden, and in 1389 Albert was defeated and taken prisoner at Falköping.
                    Stockholm, which was held by German mercenaries, refused to admit the conqueror,
                    and for several years it was besieged without success by Danish troops. At last
                    the difficulty had to be settled by negotiation. In 1395 it was arranged that
                    Albert should be set at liberty on condition that within three years he should
                    pay a ransom of 60,000 marks. If at the end of that period the money was not
                    paid, he was either to give up Stockholm or to return to captivity. The result
                    was that in 1398 Stockholm was surrendered by the Hanseatic League, which had
                    become security for the fulfilment of Albert’s engagement.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Margaret had persuaded the Danes, the Norwegians, and the Swedes to
                    accept her grandnephew Eric of Pomerania as her successor, and in 1397 he was
                    crowned at Calmar. Margaret was eager that the union of the Scandinavian
                    countries under a single sovereign should be made permanent, and delegates from
                    the councils of state of the three kingdoms met at Calmar to discuss her
                    proposals. On the 20th of July 1397 these delegates concluded what was called
                    the union of Calmar. Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, while retaining their local
                    laws and customs, were in all future time to be ruled by one king. When a king
                    died he was to be succeeded by his eldest son; but if he were childless his
                    successor was to be freely elected. In foreign affairs Scandinavia was always to
                    act as a united country. Margaret had excellent intentions in devising this bold
                    scheme, but the time was not ripe for so vast a change. It was inevitable that
                    when popular movements were no longer held in check by her strong will,
                    formidable difficulties should spring from the jealousies of the three
                    nationalities.</p>
                <p>Even after Eric’s coronation Margaret remained the real sovereign, and she was
                    powerful enough to make the union something more than a mere name. But even
                    during her lifetime the Swedish people showed that they resented the idea of
                    being taxed for objects in which they were only indirectly interested, and when
                    she died (in 1412) it soon became evident that Eric would be unable to retain
                    their allegiance. In 1386 Margaret had formally recognized the claim of Gerhard
                    VI., count of Holstein, to be feudal lord of the duchy of Schleswig. Gerhard
                    died in 1404, leaving three young sons. Margaret and Eric then tried to recover
                    the rights of the Danish crown in the duchy; and in 1413, soon after Margaret’s
                    death, Eric caused Schleswig to be declared a forfeited fief. The result was a
                    war which lasted about twenty years. The Swedes had to bear heavy burdens to
                    enable Eric to carry on the conflict, and he made no attempt to allay their
                    discontent. He seldom visited their country, and his officers often treated them
                    with reckless cruelty. In the province of Dalecarlia the royal bailiff acted so
                    tyrannically that in 1434 the people rebelled. They were led by a brave and
                    patriotic miner, Engelbrecht Engelbrechtsson, and under his influence the
                    movement spread rapidly among the peasantry of other districts. The Swedish
                    council of state, alarmed by the enthusiasm he had excited, agreed in 1436 to
                    declare the king deposed. The nobles were more afraid of the peasants than of
                    Eric, and soon placed him on the throne again; but he never fully recovered his
                    authority. He was obliged to make Charles Knutsson his viceroy in Sweden; and
                    Knutsson was as anxious as Engelbrechtsson that Swedish independence should be
                    restored. The two patriotic leaders became jealous of one another, and
                    Engelbrechtsson was murdered by a member of Knutsson’s party. But the popular
                    agitation lost none of its original force, and in 1439 Eric was dethroned by all
                    his kingdoms. He fled to the island of Gotland, where he lived for some years by
                    piracy; and afterwards he was compelled to seek for refuge in Pomerania.</p>
                <p>Christopher of Bavaria, Eric’s nephew, was elected to the Danish throne, and he
                    was soon acknowledged also in<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0778-0747"/> Norway and Sweden. He was a man of good
                    intentions, but was not strong enough to overcome the prejudice created against
                    him by the fact of his being a foreigner. When he died in 1448 the Danes chose
                    Christian, count of Oldenburg, as his successor, and the Norwegians by and by
                    followed their example. Had the decision in Sweden rested only with the nobles
                    and the clergy, Christian would at once have received the Swedish crown, for
                    under the nominal rule of a foreign king these classes were able to tyrannize as
                    they pleased over their poorer neighbours. But the Swedish people generally so
                    strongly disliked the union, aud stood so urgently in need of the protection of
                    a native sovereign, that Charles Knutsson was made king. He mounted the throne
                    as Charles VIII. The aristocracy, both spiritual and temporal, detested him; and
                    in 1457 he found in Archbishop Jöns Bengtsson so formidable an enemy that he had
                    to make his escape to Dantzic. Christian I. of Denmark and Norway then became
                    king of Sweden, but he was unable to assert supremacy over the country as a
                    whole, and in 1464 Charles VIII. again secured the throne. In the following year
                    Charles was displaced a second time, but soon afterwards he was recalled, and he
                    retained the crown until his death in 1470.</p>
                <p>Charles was succeeded, not as king but as regent, by his nephew Sten Sture, under
                    whose firm rule Sweden became prosperous and contented. Sten Sture was a
                    far-seeing statesman, and sided resolutely with the peasants against the nobles.
                    He took great pains also to promote the intellectual culture of the people. The
                    university of Upsala was founded by him, and he introduced into Sweden the art
                    of printing, and invited to the country many foreign scholars. He was not able
                    wholly to destroy the union, for in 1496 he was defeated by King Hans of Denmark
                    and Norway, who afterwards received the Swedish crown. Nevertheless Sten Sture
                    remained the real master of Sweden, and after the defeat of the Danes by the
                    Ditmarshers in 1500 his power was almost absolute. He died in 1503, when his
                    authority passed to his nephew Svante Nilsson Sture, whom King Hans and the
                    Swedish clergy and nobles in vain attempted to put down. Svante Nilsson Sture
                    was succeeded by his son, Sten Sture the younger, in 1512, and for some time
                    this brave and patriotic regent vigorously held his own both against his enemies
                    at home and against Christian II., king of Denmark and Norway. In 1520, however,
                    he was mortally wounded in a battle with the Danes at Bogesund, after which
                    Christian II. became king of Sweden. This sovereign had some enlightened ideas,
                    but he was a man of ferocious passions, and he had no sooner restored the union
                    than he made the maintenance of it impossible by an act of almost unparalleled
                    cruelty. Under the pretence of upholding the honour of the church he ordered at
                    Stockholm the execution of ninety persons accused of having taken part in the
                    deposition of his friend and supporter Archbishop Gustavus Trolle, who had been
                    the late regent’s bitterest enemy. Most of the condemned men were nobles, and
                    Christian hoped that by killing them he would secure the allegiance of the
                    peasantry. The whole Swedish nation, however, was shocked by so horrible a
                    massacre, and resolved to shake off for ever the hated Danish yoke.</p>
                <p>The movement for national independence was headed by Gustavus Ericsson, known
                    afterwards as Gustavus Vasa. This young noble had been one of a group of Swedish
                    hostages whom Christian II. had sent to Denmark, treating them as if they had
                    been prisoners of war. In 1519 he escaped from prison, and after a short stay in
                    Lübeck found his way to Dalecarlia, where he went about in disguise among the
                    peasantry, urging them to combine against the common enemy. At first they were
                    afraid to act with him, but their hesitation vanished when they heard of the
                    blood-bath in Stockholm,—a crime by which Gustavus himself was more than ever
                    embittered against the Danes, for his father was one of Christian II.’s victims.
                    A force raised by Archbishop Trolle having been defeated, Gustavus led his
                    troops beyond the limits of Dalecarlia and took Vesterås and Upsala, and laid
                    siege to Stockholm and Calmar. These fortresses were bravely defended, but in
                    1523, with the help of a fleet sent to him by Lübeck, he succeeded in capturing
                    them. In 1521 he had been declared regent, and in 1523, before the conquest of
                    Stockholm and Calmar, he summoned at Strengnäs a diet which elected him to the
                    throne. Soon afterwards he made himself master of Finland, and he annexed
                    Scania, Halland, and Blekinge. The union had now been brought to an end, and
                    from this time Sweden was always ruled by her own kings. Denmark and Norway,
                    however, remained subject to one crown until the beginning of the 19th
                    century</p>
                <p>Gustavus Vasa was by far the greatest sovereign who had up to this time ruled the
                    Swedish people. Before he was made king the doctrines of Luther had been
                    proclaimed in Sweden by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri; and Gustavus,
                    who listened attentively to their teaching, became one of the most enthusiastic
                    adherents of the Reformation. He acted cautiously, however, and resolutely
                    opposed violent agitators. The majority of the Swedes cordially accepted the new
                    doctrines, and at a diel held at Westerns in 1527 Gustavus received authority to
                    reorganize the church. This he did thoroughly, making it clear from the
                    beginning that Protestant pastors would never be permitted to wield the power
                    which the Roman priesthood had so often abused. The greater part of the vast
                    estates which had belonged to the Roman clergy he confiscated and applied to the
                    uses of the state. In his secular policy he was as bold and successful as in his
                    dealings with the church. For centuries the independence and arrogance of the
                    great nobles had been the curse of the Swedish people. Gustavus missed no
                    opportunity or limiting their influence. He compelled them to bear their fair
                    share of the public burdens, and secured for himself faithful allies by
                    obtaining for burghers and the peasantry, who had lost almost all their
                    political influence a recognized place in the diet, which was now summoned more
                    frequently and regularly than it had been for several generations. Gustavus did
                    everything he could to encourage industry. For six years he fought with Lübeck
                    ir order to break the supremacy of the Hanseatic League and he concluded
                    treaties of commerce with England and the Netherlands. So many changes were
                    effected ir Sweden in his time that several conspiracies were formed against
                    him, but he had little difficulty in overcoming his enemies, for he had the
                    confidence and affection of the great mass of his subjects. In 1544 it was
                    decided by the diet that the Swedish throne should cease to be elective, and
                    that it should be hereditary in the family of Gustavus.</p>
                <p>When Gustavus died in 1560, his eldest son Eric became king. Eric was foolish
                    enough to go to war with Frederick II. of Denmark for no better reason than that
                    the latter, like Eric himself, claimed the right to put three crowns in his
                    coat-of-arms. This war, which lasted seven years, caused much suffering to both
                    nations. The Danes were generally beaten at sea, but under the leadership of the
                    stout soldier Daniel Rantzau they gained important victories on land.
                    Intellectually Eric was one of the most cultivated of Swedish kings, but in
                    action he was so headstrong and wayward that most people believed him to be
                    insane. He wasted the treasure amassed by<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0779-0748"/> his father, and under the influence of passion
                    and suspicion caused the death of many powerful and loyal subjects. In 1568 his
                    brothers John and Charles rebelled against him. His favourite, Göran Persson,
                    who was accused of having constantly misled him, was seized and executed, and
                    Eric himself was obliged to surrender. He was deprived of the crown and kept in
                    close confinement until 1577, when he was murdered.</p>
                <p>John mounted the throne as John III. (1568-1592). In 1570 the war between Sweden
                    and Denmark was brought to an end by the peace of Stettin. Sweden obtained some
                    advantages by this treaty, but she had to resign to Denmark her claims to the
                    island of Gotland, and to Scania, Halland, and Blekinge. Through the influence
                    of his first wife Catherine, sister of King Sigismund II. of Poland, John had
                    become a Catholic; and as king he laboured to restore as far as possible the old
                    religious forms. His efforts were bitterly resented by the Protestants, while at
                    Rome he was condemned for not acting with sufficient decision in the interest of
                    his church. He was succeeded by his son Sigismund, who had been elected king of
                    Poland in 1587. In the interval between John’s death and Sigismund’s arrival in
                    Sweden supreme power was exercised by Duke Charles, Sigismund’s uncle. Charles,
                    the ablest of all the sons of Gustavus Vasa, resolved to take advantage of the
                    opportunity to place the ecclesiastical system of the country on a satisfactory
                    basis. Accordingly a great assembly was summoned at Upsala in 1593, and by this
                    assembly it was decreed that the Augsburg confession of faith should be accepted
                    as the authoritative statement of the theological doctrines of the Swedish
                    church. The decision was of vast importance, and the Swedes have ever since
                    looked back upon it as one that marked an era in their national history.</p>
                <p>Before his coronation in 1594 Sigismund undertook to protect the rights of his
                    Protestant subjects; but, being an ardent Catholic, he soon began to work for
                    the triumph of his own creed. On his return to Poland the discontent he had
                    excited in Sweden found free expression, and he was obliged to place the
                    administration of affairs in the hands of his uncle, Duke Charles. In the time
                    of King John a dispute about frontiers had led to war between Sweden and Russia,
                    and this war was still going on when Charles undertook his new duties. In 1595
                    he concluded peace, securing for Sweden the provinces of Esthonia and Narva, but
                    yielding to Russia some districts on the borders of Finland. These districts
                    were held by Klas Fleming, an enthusiastic adherent of King Sigismund, and he
                    declined to give them up, nor were they surrendered until the death of this
                    general in 1597. Meanwhile Charles had found that some members of the council of
                    state were bent on thwarting all his schemes, and from them he appealed to the
                    diet. The diet heartily supported him, and appointed him governor-general of
                    Sweden; whereupon he set to work in earnest to put down Catholic intriguers, and
                    to promote the interests of the peasantry in opposition to those of the great
                    nobles. In 1598 Sigismund advanced against him with a Polish army, and was
                    defeated at Stängebro, near Linköping. The war went on for some time, but
                    Sigismund himself returned to Poland. In 1600 the diet demanded that he should
                    reside in Sweden or send his son to be educated as a Protestant. No answer being
                    returned to these demands, Sigismund was dethroned, and his heirs were deprived
                    of the right of succession. Duke Charles was then made king, and reigned as
                    Charles IX. Sigismund continued to regard himself as the lawful sovereign, and
                    as the same pretension was made by his descendants, a very bitter feeling sprang
                    up between Sweden and Poland,—a feeling which led to many wars during the next
                    sixty years.</p>
                <p>Charles IX. (1600-1611) carried on with splendid vigour the work which had been
                    begun by his father Gustavus Vasa. Under his rule Sweden became a thoroughly
                    Protestant country, and for the first time associated herself to some extent
                    with the general Protestant movement in other lands. Charles watched with
                    especial interest the action of religious parties in Germany, and carefully
                    maintained good relations with the leading German Protestant princes. At home
                    one of his principal aims was to force the aristocracy to be subservient to the
                    crown, and he succeeded as no Swedish king had done before him. For burghers and
                    the peasantry he secured in the diet a more important and more clearly defined
                    place than had formerly belonged to them, and he devised many sagacious measures
                    for the material welfare of his people. He devoted much attention to the
                    development of mining industries, and by the founding of convenient seaports he
                    gave a great impetus to trade. In foreign relations he was not less masterful
                    than in his management of domestic affairs. In 1609 he sent an army into Russia
                    to oppose the false Demetrius, whose pretensions to the Russian throne were
                    supported by Poland. The Swedish generals, after having achieved some success,
                    were obliged to retreat in consequence of a mutiny among their troops; but
                    Charles despatched a fresh force, which did its work so well that the Russians
                    came to terms, and even promised to accept his younger son, Charles Philip, as
                    czar. In the last year of his life Charles was engaged in a war with Christian
                    IV. of Denmark, who invaded Sweden because Charles claimed to be king of the
                    Norwegian Laplanders and sought to exclude the Danes from the extensive trade
                    with Riga. Calmar, notwithstanding the strenuous exertions of Charles, was
                    captured by the Danes, and from this circumstance the struggle came to be known
                    as the Calmar War.</p>
                <p>Charles IX. was succeeded by his son Gustavus Adolphus (1611-1632), the most
                    illustrious of the kings of Sweden. He was only seventeen years of age when he
                    became king, but he had already given evidence of high intellectual and moral
                    qualities. One of his first public acts was to appoint as chancellor the
                    youngest of his counsellors, Axel Oxenstjerna, a great statesman whose name is
                    intimately associated with all the most prominent events of his reign. By
                    mingled gentleness and firmness Gustavus won almost immediately the goodwill of
                    his subjects, and before he was many years on the throne he became the object of
                    their most enthusiastic devotion. He showed unfailing respect for the rights of
                    the diet, improved its organization, and summoned it regularly once a year.
                    Industry and trade flourished under his wise rule, and he did much to develop
                    the educational system of Sweden by giving splendid endowments to the university
                    of Upsala and by founding the university of Dorpat and many schools and
                    colleges. He introduced into the army a rigid system of discipline, yet he was
                    adored by his soldiers, who had perfect faith in his military genius and were
                    touched by his care for their welfare and by the cheerfulness with which, when
                    necessary, he shared their hardships.</p>
                <p>The war with Denmark which had been begun in his father’s time he was obliged to
                    continue, but he did so very unwillingly, and as soon as possible (in 1613) he
                    signed a treaty of peace, by which, in return for the payment of a million
                    thalers, Sweden received back all the territory that had been conquered by the
                    Danes. Having no further cause of anxiety in this direction, he prosecuted with
                    renewed vigour the war with the Russians, who had not kept their promise to
                    recognize Prince Charles Philip as czar. The Swedish general, Count de la
                    Gardie, had gained many advantages in the struggle, and when<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n780/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0780-0749"/> Gustavus himself took part in it the Swedes were
                    so successful that in 1617 the czar Michael was glad to conclude the peace of
                    Stolbova, giving up Kexholm, Carelia, and Ingermanland, and confirming Sweden in
                    the possession of Esthonia and Livonia. The next task of Gustavus was to subdue
                    Sigismund of Boland, who had formally renewed his claim to the crown of Sweden
                    after Charles IX.’s death, and had proved himself one of the most troublesome of
                    the young Swedish king’s enemies. In 1621 Gustavus took the field against him,
                    and achieved a series of brilliant successes, which were interrupted only when,
                    in 1629, Austria sent to the aid of Poland a force of 10,000 men under
                    Arnheim.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Thirty Years’ War, begun in 1618, had been raging in Germany.
                    Christian IV. of Denmark, who had intervened on behalf of the Protestants, had
                    been forced to lay down his arms; and it seemed in the highest degree probable
                    that the Catholic reaction, headed by the fanatical emperor Ferdinand II., was
                    about to be completely triumphant. Gustavus, like his father and grandfather,
                    was an enthusiastic Protestant, and he had watched with grief and dismay the
                    misfortunes of those who were struggling for the right of free judgment in
                    religion. At last he resolved to give them the support they so urgently needed,
                    and, in order that he might without unnecessary delay act upon his decision, he
                    arranged with Poland in 1629 that there should be an armistice for six years. He
                    then began to make preparations for his great enterprise, and in 1630 he
                    embarked for Germany with an army of 15,000 men. In undertaking this splendid
                    task he was not influenced only by religious motives. He wished to punish the
                    Austrians for having helped the Poles; he hoped to find an opportunity of adding
                    to Swedish territory; and there are reasons for supposing that he dreamed of
                    snatching the imperial crown from the Hapsburg dynasty and placing it on his own
                    head. But all the evidence we possess goes to show that these objects were
                    subordinate. His principal aim was to save Protestantism in Germany from
                    extinction.</p>
                <p>He had many unexpected difficulties to contend with, for he was distrusted by
                    most of the German Protestant princes. Very soon, however, his tact and courage
                    enabled him to overcome every obstacle, and at Breitenfeld he gained a decisive
                    victory over the imperial general Tilly. After this great success the confidence
                    of the German Protestants revived, and Gustavus was everywhere received as their
                    deliverer. Tilly tried to prevent him from crossing the Lech, but was again
                    defeated; and the Swedish king took possession of Munich, having already held
                    court at Frankfort. For some time the destinies of the empire appeared to be at
                    his disposal, but all the hopes excited by his heroic career were suddenly cut
                    short by his death in the battle of Lützen in 1632.</p>
                <p>Gustavus was succeeded by his daughter Christina, whom, before his departure for
                    Germany, he had presented to the diet as heiress to the crown. During her
                    minority Sweden was governed by five nobles whom the diet appointed to be her
                    guardians, the foremost place being given to Axel Oxenstjerna. They continued
                    the foreign policy of Gustavus, maintaining in Germany a powerful army, which,
                    although no longer uniformly successful, gained many victories over the imperial
                    forces. Christina. carefully educated in accordance with instructions left by
                    her father, became one of the most cultivated women of the 17th century; and at
                    an early age she astonished her guardians by the vigour of her understanding. In
                    1644, on her eighteenth birthday, she assumed supreme power, and for some time
                    she fulfilled all the expectations which had been formed as to her reign. In
                    1645 she brought to an end a war with Denmark which had been begun two years
                    before. The Danes had been repeatedly defeated, and by the treaty of Brömsebro
                    they resigned to Sweden Jemtland and Harjeaadalen along with the islands of
                    Gotland and Oesel, and gave up Halland for a period of twenty-five years.
                    Contrary to the advice of Oxenstjerna, Christina pressed for the conclusion of
                    peace in Germany, and, when her object was attained, the Swedes had no reason to
                    be dissatisfied with the result. By the peace of Westphalia, concluded in 1648,
                    Sweden obtained the duchies of Bremen, Verden, and Western Pomerania, a part of
                    Eastern Pomerania, and Wismar. Moreover, Sweden was recognized as a state of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>The Swedish people were anxious that Christina should marry, but she declined to
                    sacrifice her independence. In 1649, however, she persuaded the diet to accept
                    as her successor the best of her suitors, her cousin Charles Gustavus of
                    Pfalz-Zweibrücken, the son of the only sister of Gustavus Adolphus. In the
                    following year she was crowned with great pomp. About this time her character
                    seemed to undergo a remarkable change. She became wayward and restless,
                    neglected her tried counsellors, and followed the advice of self-seeking
                    favourites. So much discontent was aroused by her extravagance and fickleness
                    that she at last announced her determination to abdicate, and she abandoned her
                    purpose only in deference to Oxenstjerna’s entreaties. She now devoted herself
                    to her duties with renewed ardour, and made her court famous by inviting to it
                    Descartes, Grotius, Salmasius, and other scholars and philosophers. But she had
                    soon to encounter fresh difficulties. During the Thirty Years’ War the influence
                    of the nobles had been greatly increased, partly in consequence of their
                    position in the army, partly through the wealth they acquired in Germany. They
                    made as usual so bad a use of their power that an agitation which seemed likely
                    to have most serious consequences sprang up against them among the peasants, the
                    burghers, and the clergy. Unable to bring order out of the prevailing confusion,
                    and longing for repose, Christina finally resolved to resign the crown; and in
                    1654 she formally laid the royal insignia before the diet in order that they
                    might be transferred to Charles Gustavus, who forthwith became king as Charles
                    X. Christina immediately left the country, and did not return to it for many
                    years. She ultimately made some attempts to recover the crown, as well as to be
                    elected queen of Poland, but her efforts were not successful. She joined the
                    Roman Church, and there was much talk at all the courts in Europe about the
                    eccentricities of her character and about her passionate love of art and
                    learning.</p>
                <p>Charles X. (1654-1660) devoted his energies chiefly to war, in which he was
                    brilliantly successful. He began his military career by attacking Poland, whose
                    king claimed to be the true heir to the Swedish crown. In a great battle at
                    Warsaw Charles destroyed the Polish army, and Poland would probably soon have
                    been absolutely at his mercy but for the intervention of Russia, which sought to
                    weaken him by invading Esthonia and Livonia. While the war with Poland and
                    Russia was in progress, Charles became involved in a struggle with Denmark, and
                    he conducted it so vigorously and skilfully that the Danes, by the peace of
                    Roeskilde, signed in 1658, gave up Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and various other
                    territories. War with Denmark was several times renewed, and at the time of his
                    death Charles was engaged in making extensive preparations for a fresh
                    onslaught.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by his son Charles XL, a child of four years of age. During the
                    minority of Charles XI. the government was carried on by his mother Hedwig
                    Eleonore and by the chancellor De la Gardie and four other ministers. In 1660
                    they concluded with Poland the<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0781-0750"/> peace of Oliva, whereby Sweden received the whole
                    of Livonia as far as the Düna. Soon afterwards peace was also concluded with
                    Denmark and Russia, the former receiving back Drontheim and Bornholm, which had
                    been taken by Charles X. Sweden, however, kept Scania, Halland, and Blekinge,
                    which were now finally severed from the Danish monarchy. In 1672 Charles XI.
                    himself assumed the direction of affairs. For some time he seemed to take little
                    interest in public business, and in 1674 he was rash enough to send an army into
                    Germany to aid Louis XIV. in his war with the United Provinces and their allies.
                    The Swedes were defeated at Fehrbellin by the elector of Brandenburg, who at
                    once followed up his victory by taking possession of Pomerania. Christian V. of
                    Denmark, thinking he had now a good opportunity of recovering Scania, joined the
                    enemies of France and Sweden, and at sea the Danes gained several great
                    victories over the Swedes. Charles XI., aroused by these disasters, began to
                    show the real vigour of his character. He placed himself at the head of his
                    army, and in several battles so decisively defeated the Danes that they were
                    driven from Scania, the greater part of which they had occupied. When peace was
                    made in 1679, Sweden had to give up to Brandenburg a part of Pomerania, but she
                    sustained no other losses.</p>
                <p>At this time the finances of Sweden were in utter confusion, and the revenue was
                    not nearly large enough to cover the necessary expenditure. So many of the crown
                    lands had from time to time been given away to nobles that the administration
                    could not be carried on without a system of crushing taxation. The common
                    people, unable to bear the burdens imposed upon them, had often insisted that
                    these lands should be taken back. Charles XI. became convinced that there was no
                    other way out of his difficulties, and in 1680, with the sanction of the diet,
                    he ordered that the fourth part of all the crown lands which had been given away
                    during the previous thirty years should be restored. This, however, was only the
                    beginning of the so-called process of reduction, which was soon extended and
                    carried out with ruthless severity. By this measure some of the foremost
                    families in Sweden were ruined, and the crown was made almost independent of the
                    diet, for it recovered no fewer than ten counties, seventy baronies, and many
                    smaller estates. Charles became virtually an absolute sovereign, and on the
                    whole he made an excellent use of his power. For more than a century Sweden had
                    been almost constantly engaged in war. She now enjoyed a period of repose, and
                    profited greatly by the king’s vigorous administration. He built fortresses,
                    reorganized the army and navy, and carried on many important public works in the
                    interests of commerce. He also founded the university of Lund, and made larger
                    provision for popular education, frequently impressing upon the clergy the duty
                    of attending to the intellectual needs of their parishioners. His comparatively
                    early death was lamented by the great majority of the people, who were grateful
                    for the steady determination with which he applied himself to the duties of his
                    office.</p>
                <p>Charles XI. was succeeded by his son Charles XII. (1697-1718), the most brilliant
                    although not the greatest figure in Swedish history. He was a youth of fifteen
                    when his father died, and he was so enthusiastically devoted to sport and all
                    kinds of physical exercise that he seemed to be utterly destitute of political
                    ambition. Accordingly Augustus II. of Poland and Saxony, Peter I. of Russia, and
                    Frederick IV. of Denmark, thinking the time had come for the recovery of the
                    possessions taken from their predecessors by Sweden, formed an alliance against
                    him, and they appear to have had no doubt that he would be easily overcome.
                    Charles XII., however, was in reality a man of extraordinary vigour and daring,
                    and he soon convinced his enemies that they would find in him a formidable
                    opponent. In 1700 he began what is known as the Northern War by suddenly
                    advancing against Copenhagen, which he was about to besiege when Frederick,
                    alarmed by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, accepted Charles’s terms, and
                    signed the peace of Travendahl. Charles at once crossed the Baltic to attack
                    Augustus II. and Peter I., the former of whom was besieging Riga, while the
                    latter threatened Narva. At Narva the Swedish king gained a splendid victory,
                    and afterwards he defeated the Saxons, driving them away from Riga. If he had
                    now concluded peace, he might have been for many years by far the greatest
                    potentate in northern Europe. But he was resolved to humiliate Augustus II., and
                    this he did most effectually. Defeated at Klissoff, Augustus was held to have
                    forfeited the throne of Poland, and at Charles’s suggestion Stanislaus Leczinski
                    was elected king. Charles followed Augustus into Saxony, and in 1706 forced him
                    to conclude the treaty of Altranstädt. Meanwhile Peter I. had been taking
                    possession of Swedish territory on the Baltic, and on a portion of it had begun
                    to build St Petersburg. Instead of attacking him directly, Charles resolved to
                    thwart him by seizing Moscow, and this decision proved fatal to his great
                    designs. Worn out by a long and dreary march, during which many soldiers died of
                    hunger and disease, his dispirited army was defeated at Poltava (1709); and
                    Charles, ignorant of the real condition of the enemy’s forces, fled across the
                    Russian frontier into Turkey. He remained five years in the Turkish dominions,
                    trying to induce the sultan to become his ally. But, although war did break out
                    between Russia and Turkey, the Turks had little confidence in Charles, for it
                    was supposed that he wished to become king of Poland, and the sultan suspected
                    that if this scheme were effected he might become a dangerous enemy of the
                    Ottoman empire. Convinced at last that nothing was to be gained from Turkey,
                    Charles made his escape, and in fourteen days rode from Adrianople to Stralsund.
                    In his absence the war had been continued by Peter I., who had soon been joined
                    again by Augustus II. and Frederick IV.; and ultimately the alliance was
                    strengthened by the accession of the king of Prussia and the elector of Hanover,
                    each of whom was eager to possess those Swedish territories which were in the
                    neighbourhood of his own dominions. In Stralsund, which was besieged by an army
                    of Danes, Saxons, Prussians, and Russians, Charles displayed astonishing valour
                    and military skill, but about a year after his arrival the town was obliged to
                    surrender. He then went to Lund, adopted vigorous measures for the defence of
                    the Swedish coasts, and attacked Norway. By the advice of his friend Baron Gertz
                    he entered into negotiations with Peter I., who was not unwilling to come to
                    terms. Had Charles lived, it is possible that the tide of misfortune might have
                    turned, but he was shot dead while engaged in besieging Frederikshall. His
                    intention was to conquer Norway after having made peace with Russia, and from
                    Norway to cross to Great Britain, where he hoped to punish the elector of
                    Hanover by placing the Pretender on the English throne.</p>
                <p>All the conditions of political life in Sweden were now changed. The Swedish
                    people were surrounded by a crowd of enemies whom they could not hope to
                    overcome, and in the confusion caused by the Northern War the nobles had
                    recovered their ancient power. As Charles XII. had no children, it was doubtful
                    whether the crown should pass to his younger sister Ulrica Eleonore or to
                    Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, the son of his elder sister Hedvig
                    Sophia. The nobles decided in favour of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0782-0751"/> Ulrica Eleonore, who secured their support by
                    undertaking to place all real power in their hands. In 1720 her authority was
                    transferred to her husband, Prince Frederick of Hesse, who reigned as Frederick
                    I. until his death in 1751. He reigned, however, only in name, for the diet,
                    which now practically meant the nobles, usurped every important prerogative of
                    the crown. There were two parties, known as the Hats and the Caps, who assailed
                    one another with much vehemence; but on one point they were agreed, and that was
                    that the Swedish people should in future be ruled, not by a king, or by a king
                    acting in conjunction with the diet, but by the aristocracy.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Sweden had been shorn of most of the foreign territory for which in
                    past times she had made so many sacrifices. In 1719 she had given up Bremen and
                    Verden to Hanover; in 1720 Stettin and Western Pomerania as far as the Peene
                    were resigned to Prussia; and in 1721 Russia obtained Livonia, Esthonia,
                    Ingermanland, and a part of Viborg län. In 1741, against the wish of King
                    Frederick, the Hats plunged into a war with Russia; and the consequence was that
                    in 1743 Sweden had to conclude the degrading peace of Åbo, by which she lost
                    Eastern Finland. She had even to beg Russia to aid her against Denmark, and she
                    was obliged to recognize Adolphus Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, a relative of
                    the czarina Elizabeth, as heir to the throne.</p>
                <p>From the reign of Charles IX. until that of Charles XII. Sweden had been one of
                    the greatest powers in Europe. She had conducted many wars successfully; she had
                    secured a vast territory beyond her proper limits; in the crisis of the struggle
                    between Catholicism and Protestantism she had lent powerful support to those who
                    were fighting for spiritual freedom. In the management of international
                    relations during this period no great decision was arrived at by any European
                    state without reference to her wishes, and there seemed to be solid reasons for
                    the belief that her power would be enduring. Yet she suddenly sank from her high
                    position to that of a third-rate state, which exercised little or no influence
                    on the affairs of the rest of the world. This striking change was immediately
                    due to the calamities brought upon his country by Charles XII,, but sooner or
                    later it would have come even if he had never lived. The circumstances of Europe
                    were in his time very different from those with which Gustavus Adolphus had to
                    deal. Russia had emerged as a united and growing state; Prussia had begun to
                    display some of the qualities which were ultimately to make her supreme in
                    Germany; and Hanover had been made important by the accession of the house of
                    Brunswick to the throne of Great Britain. Sweden could not have permanently
                    maintained her conquests against these new political forces. Charles XII., by
                    his bold but headstrong policy, only hastened a process which was in any case
                    inevitable.</p>
                <p>Under Adolphus Frederick (1751-1771) Sweden took part in the Seven Years’ War,
                    siding with the enemies of Frederick the Great. But she was now so feeble, and
                    her statesmen were so incompetent, that her intervention led to no serious
                    results. The Hats, who were responsible for the humiliation brought upon Sweden
                    by this exhibition of her weakness, had to make way for the Caps; but neither
                    party had the power or the will to arouse the nation from the lethargy into
                    which it had fallen. Gustavus III., Adolphus Frederick’s son (1771-1792), was a
                    man of a very different temper from his indolent father. He had great energy of
                    character, a thorough comprehension of some of the conditions of political
                    progress, and a frank and persuasive manner. In early youth he seems to have
                    convinced himself that it would be impossible for Sweden to become a prosperous
                    country unless the royal authority were restored, and when at the age of
                    twenty-five he succeeded his father he secretly resolved to make the crown
                    supreme.</p>
                <p>He carried out his plans with remarkable ability and caution. Under the pretence
                    that he wished to introduce a new system of military manoeuvres, he collected
                    around him about two hundred officers, most of whom were young men, and they
                    were gradually induced to pledge themselves to support him. Agents were
                    despatched to win over the regiments in the provinces, and Gustavus was careful
                    to make a good impression on the burgher class and on the peasantry. When all
                    was ready, the commandant of Christianstad, on the 12th of August 1772, as
                    previously arranged, formally renounced his allegiance to the diet, and one of
                    the king’s brothers went to the town with the regiments in the neighbourhood and
                    pretended to besiege it. Suspicions were aroused at Stockholm, and at a meeting
                    of the council of state Gustavus was bitterly reproached by some of the members.
                    He then boldly proclaimed his purpose. The members of the council of state were
                    arrested, and the king received the homage of the leading authorities in the
                    military, naval, and civil services. The diet was forthwith summoned, and at its
                    first sitting Gustavus spoke of the lamentable condition of the kingdom, and of
                    the need for more efficient methods of government. He had no wish, he said, to
                    establish an absolute monarchy, but it was necessary that the supremacy of the
                    aristocracy should be destroyed, and that the country should re-establish the
                    system which existed in the time of Gustavus Adolphus, when the crown and the
                    diet had each its separate functions and worked cordially together. A new
                    constitution, which had been drawn up, placing executive power wholly in the
                    king’s hands, was afterwards read, and at once accepted.</p>
                <p>Delivered from the trammels which had hampered his immediate predecessors,
                    Gustavus worked hard for the welfare of his subjects. Agriculture, industry, and
                    trade revived; the army and navy were improved; and the educated classes began
                    to show greater interest in art, literature, and science. Unfortunately the king
                    took the court of France as the model for his own court, and the country
                    resented the incessant demands for money which were rendered necessary by his
                    personal extravagance. In 1788 he declared war with Russia, hoping to recover
                    Livonia and the part of Finland which Russia had conquered; and the discontent
                    he had aroused found expression in the army, the leaders of which declined to
                    fight, protesting that the war ought not to have been begun without the sanction
                    of the diet. At the same time Denmark was persuaded by the czarina Catherine to
                    attack Sweden. Gustavus seemed to be on the verge of ruin, but he was saved by
                    his own courage and sagacity. Hastening back from Finland, he was able to rescue
                    Gothenburg from the Danes with a force raised in Dalecarlia, and soon
                    afterwards, through the intervention oi England and Prussia, Denmark was induced
                    to withdraw from the struggle. The majority of the diet, seeing the dangers to
                    which the nation was exposed, rallied around the king, and, notwithstanding the
                    opposition of the nobles, recognized the right of the crown to declare war.
                    Impressed by the firm and rapid action of Gustavus, the army returned to its
                    allegiance, and the conflict with Russia was begun in earnest. In 1789 the
                    Swedes were very unsuccessful, but in the following year they gained several
                    victories both at sea and on land. Gustavus saw, however, that it would be
                    impossible for him to wrest from Russia any of her territories, and in 1790
                    peace was concluded on the understanding that both states should occupy the
                    position they held before the war.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0783-0752"/> Gustavus was greatly excited by the French
                    Revolution, and sought to form an alliance with Russia, Prussia, and Austria for
                    the restoration of Louis XVI. But the diet refused to support his wild schemes.
                    Several nobles, desiring to avenge the supposed wrongs of their order, entered
                    into a conspiracy against him, and in 1792 he was mortally wounded by an
                    assassin who acted as their agent.</p>
                <p>Gustavus IV. (1792-1809) was not quite fourteen years old when his father was
                    murdered, and during his minority the government was carried on by his uncle the
                    duke of Södermanland. Gustavus began to exercise royal authority in 1796. His
                    reign was remarkable chiefly for the obstinacy with which he clung to his own
                    ideas, no matter how far they might conflict with the obvious interests of his
                    country. He had a bitter detestation of Bonaparte, and in 1803 went to Carlsruhe
                    in the hope that he might induce the emperor and some of the German princes to
                    act with him in support of the Bourbons. His enmity led to an open rupture with
                    France, and even after the peace of Tilsit, when Russia and Prussia offered to
                    mediate between him and the French emperor, he refused to come to terms. The
                    consequence was that he lost Stralsund and the island of Rügen. He displayed so
                    much friendship for England that Russia and Denmark, acting under the influence
                    of France, declared war against him; and the whole of Finland was soon held by
                    Russian troops. Gustavus attacked Norway, but his army was driven back by the
                    Danes and Norwegians. He still declined to make peace, and he even alienated
                    England when she attempted to influence him by moderate counsels. The Swedish
                    people were so enraged by the consequences of his policy that in 1809 he was
                    dethroned, and the claims of his descendants to the crown were also repudiated.
                    He was succeeded by the duke of Södermanland, who reigned as Charles XIII.</p>
                <p>Charles XIII. (1809-1818) concluded peace with Russia, Denmark, and France,
                    ceding to Russia by the treaty of Frederikshamm (1809) the whole of Finland. The
                    loss of this territory, which had been so long associated with the Swedish
                    monarchy, was bitterly deplored by the Swedes, but it was universally admitted
                    that under the circumstances the sacrifice was unavoidable. Charles assented to
                    important changes in the constitution, which were intended to bring to an end
                    the struggle between the crown and the aristocracy and to provide some security
                    for the maintenance of popular rights. The king was still to be at the head of
                    the executive, but it was arranged that legislative functions and control over
                    taxation should belong to the diet, which was to consist of four orders— nobles,
                    clergymen, burghers, and peasants.</p>
                <p>As Charles XIII. was childless, the diet elected as his successor Prince
                    Christian Augustus of Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. In 1810, soon after his
                    arrival in Stockholm, this prince suddenly died; and Sweden astonished Europe by
                    asking Marshal Bernadotte to become heir to the throne. Bernadotte, who took the
                    name of Charles John, was a man of great vigour and resource, and soon made
                    himself the real ruler of Sweden. Napoleon treated Sweden as almost a conquered
                    country, and compelled her to declare war with England. Bernadotte, associating
                    himself heartily with his adopted land, resolved to secure its independence, and
                    entered into an alliance with Russia. In 1813 he started with an army of 20,000
                    Swedes to co-operate with the powers which were striving finally to crush the
                    French emperor. The proceedings of the Swedish crown prince were watched with
                    some suspicion by the allies, as he was evidently unwilling to strike a decisive
                    blow at France; but after the battle of Leipsic he displayed much activity. He
                    blockaded Hamburg, and by the peace of Kiel, concluded in January 1814, he
                    forced Denmark to give up Norway. He then entered France, but soon returned, and
                    devoted his energies to the conquest of Norway, which was very unwilling to be
                    united with Sweden. Between the months of July and November 1814 the country was
                    completely subdued, and Charles XIII. was proclaimed king. The union of Sweden
                    and Norway, which has ever since been maintained, was recognized by the congress
                    of Vienna; and it was placed on a sound basis by the frank adoption of the
                    principle that, while the two countries should be subject to the same crown and
                    act together in matters of common interest, each should have complete control
                    over its internal affairs. The new relation of their country to Norway gave much
                    satisfaction to the Swedes, whom it consoled in some measure for the loss of
                    Finland. It also made it easy for them to transfer to Prussia in 1815 what
                    remained of their Pomeranian territories.</p>
                <p>In 1818 Bernadotte mounted the throne as Charles XIV., and he reigned until he
                    died in 1844. Great material improvements were effected during his reign. He
                    caused new roads and canals to be constructed; he encouraged the cultivation of
                    districts which had formerly been barren; and he founded good industrial and
                    naval schools. He was not, however, much liked by his subjects. He never
                    mastered the Swedish language, and he was so jealous of any interference with
                    his authority that he sternly punished the expression of opinions which he
                    disliked. To the majority of educated Swedes the constitution seemed to be
                    ill-adapted to the wants of the nation, and there was a general demand for a
                    political system which should make the Government more directly responsible to
                    the people. In 1840 a scheme of reform was submitted to the diet by a committee
                    which had been appointed for the purpose, but the negotiations and discussions
                    to which it gave rise led to no definite result.</p>
                <p>Charles XIV. was succeeded by his son Oscar I. (1844- 1859). Oscar had always
                    expressed sympathy with liberal opinions, and it was anticipated that the
                    constitutional question would be settled during his reign without much
                    difficulty. These expectations were disappointed. The diet met soon after his
                    accession, and was asked to accept the scheme which had been drawn up in 18i0.
                    The measure received the cordial approval of the burghers and peasants, but was
                    rejected by the nobles and the clergy. In 1846 a committee was appointed to
                    prepare a new set of proposals, and late in the following year the discussion of
                    its plans began. While the debates on the subject were proceeding some
                    excitement was produced by the revolutionary movement of 1848, and a new
                    ministry, pledged to the cause of reform, came into office. The scheme devised
                    by this ministry was accepted by the committee to which it was referred, but the
                    provisions of the existing constitution rendered it necessary that the final
                    settlement should depend upon the vote of the next diet. When the diet met in
                    1850 it was found that the difficulties in the way were for the time
                    insuperable. The proposals of the Government were approved by a majority of the
                    burghers, but they were opposed by the nobles, the clergy, and the peasantry.
                    The solution of the problem had, therefore, to be indefinitely postponed.</p>
                <p>Although the constitution was not reformed, much was done in other ways during
                    the reign of Oscar I. to promote the national welfare. The criminal law was
                    brought into accordance with modern ideas, and the law of inheritance was made
                    the same for both sexes and for all classes of the community. Increased freedom
                    was secured for industry and trade; the methods of administration were improved;
                    and the state took great pains to provide the country with an efficient railway
                    system. The result of the wise legislation of this period was that a new spirit
                    of<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0784-0753"/> enterprise was displayed by the commercial
                    classes, and that in material prosperity the people made sure and rapid
                    progress.</p>
                <p>In 1848, when the difficulty about Schleswig-Holstein led to war between Denmark
                    and Germany, the Swedes sympathized cordially with the Danes, of whom they had
                    for a long time ceased to be in the slightest degree jealous. Swedish troops
                    were landed in Fünen, and through the influence of the Swedish Government an
                    armistice was concluded at Malmö. The excitement in favour of Denmark soon died
                    out, and when the war was resumed in 1849 Sweden resolutely declined to take
                    part in it. The outbreak of the Crimean War greatly alarmed the Swedes, who
                    feared that they might in some way be dragged into the conflict. In 1855, having
                    some reason to complain of Russian acts of aggression on his northern frontiers,
                    the king of Sweden and Norway concluded a treaty with England and France,
                    pledging himself not to cede territory to Russia, and receiving from the Western
                    powers a promise of help in the event of his being attacked. The demands based
                    on this treaty were readily granted by Russia in the peace of Paris in 1856.</p>
                <p>Charles XV. (1859-1872) mounted the throne after his father’s death. Nearly two
                    years before his accession he had been made regent in consequence of Oscar I.’s
                    ill-health. Charles was a man of considerable intellectual ability and of
                    decidedly popular sympathies, and during his reign the Swedish people became
                    enthusiastically loyal to his dynasty. In 1860 two estates of the realm—the
                    peasants and the burghers—presented petitions, begging him to submit to the diet
                    a scheme for the reform of the constitution. This request he willingly granted.
                    The main provisions of the plan offered in his name were that the diet should
                    consist of two chambers,—the first chamber to be elected for a term of nine
                    years by the provincial assemblies and by the municipal corporations of towns
                    not represented in those assemblies, the second chamber to be elected for a term
                    of three years by all natives of Sweden possessing a specified property
                    qualification. The executive power was to belong to the king, who was to act
                    under the advice of a council of state responsible to the national
                    representatives. This plan, which was received with general satisfaction, was
                    finally adopted by the diet in 1866, and is still in force.</p>
                <p>Early in the reign of Charles XV. there were serious disputes between Sweden and
                    Norway, and the union of the two countries could scarcely have been maintained
                    but for the tact and good sense of the king. He also exercised a steadying
                    influence in 1863, when his people expressed passionate sympathy with the Poles
                    in their insurrection against Russia, and with the Danes in their war with
                    Prussia and Austria.</p>
                <p>Charles XV, died in 1872, and was succeeded by his brother Oscar II., who still
                    reigns (1887). Under him Sweden has maintained good relations with all foreign
                    powers, and political disputes in the diet have never been serious enough to
                    interrupt the material progress of the nation.</p>

                    an historical figure of extraordinary interest, has left her name attached to
                    several important religious works, in particular to a collection of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cppen-barelser</hi> (“Revelations”), in which her visions and
                    ecstatic meditations are recorded, and a version, the first into Swedish, of the
                    five books of Moses. This latter was undertaken, at her desire, by her
                    father-confessor Mattias (d. 1350), a priest at Linköping. The. translation of
                    the Bible was continued a century later by a monk named Johannes Budde (d.
                    1484),</p>
                <p>In verse the earliest Swedish productions were probably the folk-songs. The age
                    of these, however, has been commonly exaggerated. It is doubtful whether any
                    still exist which are as old, in their present form, as the 13th century. The
                    bulk are now attributed to the 15th, and many are doubtless much later still.
                    The last, such as “Axel och Valborg,” “Liten Karin,” “Kampen Grim-borg,” and
                    “Habor och Signild,” deal with the adventures of romantic mediaeval romance.
                    Almost the only positive clue we hold to the date of these poems is the fact
                    that one of the most characteristic of them, “Engelbrekt,” was written by Tomas,
                    bishop of Strengnäs, who died in 1443. Tomas, who left other poetical pieces, is
                    usually called the first Swedish poet. There are three rhyming chronicles in
                    mediaeval Swedish, all anonymous. The earliest, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erikskröwikan,</hi> is attributed to 1320; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Karls-krönikan</hi> is at least 120 years later; and the third, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sturekrönikorna,</hi> was probably written about 1500. All three
                    have been edited by G. E. Klemming. The collection of rhymed romances which
                    bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Queen Euphemia's Songs</hi> must have been
                    written before the death of that lady in 1312. They are believed to date from
                    1303. They are versions of three mediaeval stories taken from French and German
                    sources, and they deal respectively with King Arthur and the Table Round, with
                    Duke Frederick of Normandy, and with Flores and Blancheflor. They possess very
                    slight poetic merit in their Swedish form. A little later the romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">King Alexander</hi> was translated by, or at the command of, Bo
                    Jonsson Grip; this is more meritorious. A brilliant and pathetic relic of the
                    close of the mediaeval period exists in the <hi rend="italic">Love Letters</hi>
                    addressed in 1498 by Ingrid Persdotter, a nun of Vadstena, to the young knight
                    Axel Nilsson. The first book printed in the Swedish language appeared in
                    1495.</p>
                <p>The 16th century added but little to Swedish literature, and that little is
                    mostly connected with the newly founded university of Upsala. The Renaissance
                    scarcely made itself felt in Scandinavia, and even the Reformation failed to
                    waken the genius of the country. Psalms and didactic<pb break="no"

                    letters in the 16th century. Two writers, the brothers Petri, take an easy
                    prominence in so barren a period. Olaus Petri (1497-1552) and Laurentius Petri
                    (1499-1573) were Carmelite monks who proceeded in 1516 to Wittenberg to study
                    theology under Luther, and who came back to Sweden as the apostles of the new
                    faith. Olaus, who is one of the noblest figures in Swedish annals, was of the
                    executive rather than the meditative class. He found time, however, to write a
                    <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> which is the earliest prose history of Sweden,
                    a mystery-play, <hi rend="italic">Tobie Comedia,</hi> which is the first Swedish
                    drama, and three psalm-books, the best known being published in 1530 under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Någre Gudhelige Vijsor</hi> (“Certain Divine Songs”).
                    Laurentius Petri, who was archbishop of all Sweden, edited or superintended the
                    translation of the Bible published at Upsala in 1540. He also wrote many psalms.
                    Laurentius Andreae, who died in 1552, had previously prepared a translation of
                    the New Testament, which appeared in 1526. He was a polemical writer of
                    prominence on the side of the Reformers. Finally, Petrus Niger (Peder Svart),
                    bishop of Vesterås (d. 1562), wrote a chronicle of the life of Gustavus I. up to
                    1533, in excellent prose. The same writer left unpublished a history of the
                    bishops of Westerås his predecessors. The latter half of the 16th century is a
                    blank in Swedish literature.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Charles IX. and the consequent development of Swedish
                    greatness, literature began to assert itself in more vigorous forms. The long
                    life of the royal librarian, Johannes Buraeus (1568-1652), formed a link between
                    the age of the Petri and that of Stjernhjelm. Buraeus studied all the sciences
                    then known to mankind, and confounded them all in a sort of Rabbinical cultus of
                    his own invention, a universal philosophy in a multitude of unreadable volumes.
                    But he was a patient antiquarian, and advanced the knowledge of ancient
                    Scandinavian mythology and language very considerably. He awakened curiosity and
                    roused a public sympathy with letters; nor was it without significance that two
                    of the greatest Swedes of the century, Gustavus Adolphus and the poet
                    Stjernhjelm, were his pupils. The reign of Charles IX. saw the rise of secular
                    drama in Sweden. The first comedy was the <hi rend="italic">Tisbe</hi> of Magnus
                    Olai Astero-pherus (d. 1647), a coarse but witty piece on the story of Pyramus
                    and Thisbe, acted by the schoolboys of the college of Arboga in 1610. This play
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Ralph Roister Doister</hi> of Swedish literature. A
                    greater dramatist was Johannes Messenius (1579-1636), who, having been
                    discovered plotting against the Government during the absence of Gustavus in
                    Russia, was condemned to imprisonment for life—that is, for twenty years. Before
                    this disaster he had been professor in Upsala, where his first historical comedy
                    <hi rend="italic">Disa</hi> was performed in 1611 and the tragedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Signill</hi> in 1612. The design of Messenius was to write the
                    history of his country in fifty plays; he completed and produced six. These
                    dramas are not particularly well arranged, but they form a little body of
                    theatrical literature of singular interest and value. Messenius was a genuine
                    poet; the lyrics he introduces have something of the charm of the old ballads.
                    He wrote abundantly in prison; his <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi> was a
                    history of Sweden in Latin, but he has also left, in Swedish, two important
                    rhyme-chronicles. Messenius was imitated by a little crowd of playwrights.
                    Nikolaus Catonius (d. 1655) wrote a fine tragedy on the Trojan War, <hi
                    rend="italic">Troijen-borgh,</hi> in which he excelled Messenius as a dramatist.
                    Andreas Prytz, who died in 1655 as bishop of Linköping, produced several
                    religious chronicle plays from Swedish history. Jacobus Rondeletius (d. 1662)
                    wrote a curious “Christian tragi-comedy” of <hi rend="italic">Judas
                    Redivivus.</hi> These plays were all acted by schoolboys and university youths,
                    and when they went out of fashion among these classes the drama in Sweden almost
                    entirely ceased to exist. Two historians of the reign of Charles IX., Erik
                    Göransson Tegel (d. 1636) and Aegidius Girs (d. 1639), deserve mention.</p>
                <p>The reign of Gustavus Adolphus was adorned by one great writer, the most
                    considerable in all the early history of Sweden. The title of “the Father of
                    Swedish Poetry” has been universally awarded to Göran Lilja, better known by his
                    adopted name of Georg Stjernhjelm (1598-1672). This extraordinary man was born
                    at Wika in Dalecarlia on the 7th of August 1598. He took his degree at
                    Greifswald, and spent some years in travelling over every quarter of Europe. On
                    his return he attracted the notice of Gustavus Adolphus, who gave him a
                    responsible post at Dorpat in 1630, and raised him next year to the nobility.
                    After the king’s death Christina attached him, as a kind of poet-laureate, to
                    her court in Stockholm. His property lay in Livonia, and when the Russians
                    plundered that province in 1656 the poet was reduced to extreme poverty for two
                    or three years. He died at Brunkeborg in Stockholm on the 22d of April 1672.
                    Stjernhjelm was a man of almost universal attainment, but it is mainly in verse
                    that he has left his stamp upon the literature of his country. He found the
                    language rough and halting, and he moulded it into perfect smoothness and
                    elasticity. His master Buraeus had written a few Swedish hexameters by way of
                    experiment. Stjernhjelm took the form and made it national. His greatest poem,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> is a didactic allegory in hexameters, written
                    in very musical verse, and with an almost Oriental splendour of phrase and
                    imagery. In its faults as well as its beauties the style of Stjernhjelm reminds
                    us of that of his great Dutch contemporary Vondel. He was certainly influenced
                    by a writer a few months older than himself, the German poet Martin Opitz. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Hercules,</hi> which deals with the familiar story of the
                    dispute for the hero between Duty and Pleasure, was first printed, at Upsala, in
                    1653, but was finished some years earlier. <hi rend="italic">Bröllops-Besvars
                    Ihughommelse,</hi> a sort of serio-comic epithalamium in the same measure, is
                    another very brilliant work of Stjernhjelm. His masques, <hi rend="italic">Then
                    fågne Cupido</hi> (“Cupid Caught”) (1649), <hi rend="italic">Freds-afi</hi>
                    (“The Birth of Peace”) (1649), and <hi rend="italic">Parnassus Triumphans</hi>
                    (1651), were written for the entertainment of the queen, and have a charming
                    lyrical lightness. He can scarcely, however, be said to have been successful in
                    his attempt, in the first two of these, to introduce unrhymed song-measures.
                    Stjernhjelm was an active philologist, and left a great number of works on
                    language, of which only a few have ever been printed. He wrote letter A of the
                    earliest Swedish dictionary, published in 1643, and a work on mathematics
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Archimedes Reformatus.</hi> No brighter intellectual
                    figure arose in Sweden till the beginning of the 19th century.</p>
                <p>The claim of Stjernhjelm to be the first Swedish poet may be contested by a
                    younger man, but a slightly earlier writer, Gustaf Rosenhane (1619-1684), who
                    was a reformer on quite other lines. If Stjernhjelm studied Opitz, Rosenhane
                    took the French poets of the Renaissance for his models, and in 1650 wrote a
                    cycle of one hundred sonnets, the earliest in the language; these were published
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Venerid</hi> in 1680. Rosenhane printed in
                    1658 a “Complaint of the Swedish Language” in thirteen hundred rattling rhyming
                    lines, and in 1682 a collection of eighty songs. He was a metrist of the
                    artistic order, skilful, learned, and unimpassioned. His zeal for the
                    improvement of the literature of his country was beyond question. Most of the
                    young poets followed Stjernhjelm rather than Rosen-<pb break="no"

                    former, the brothers Columbus deserve special attention. Each wrote copiously in
                    verse, but Johan (1640-1684) almost entirely in Latin, while Samuel (1642-1678),
                    especially in his <hi rend="italic">Odae Suetkicae,</hi> showed himself an apt
                    and fervid imitator of the Swedish hexameters of Stjernhjelm. Of a rhyming
                    family of Hjärne, it is enough to mention one member, Urban Hjärne (1641-1724),
                    who introduced the new form of classical tragedy from France, in a species of
                    transition from the masques of Stjernhjelm to the later regular rhymed dramas.
                    His best play was a <hi rend="italic">Rosimunda.</hi> Lars Johansson
                    (1642-1674), who called himself “Lucidor the Unfortunate,” has been the subject
                    of a whole tissue of romance, most of which is fabulous. It is true, however,
                    that he was stabbed, like Marlowe, in a midnight brawl at a tavern. His poems
                    were posthumously collected as <hi rend="italic">Flowers of Helicon, Plucked and
                    Distributed on various occasions by Lucidor the Unfortunate.</hi> Stripped of
                    the myth which had attracted so much attention to his name, Lucidor proves to be
                    an occasional rhymster of a very low order. Haquin Spegel (1645-1714), the
                    famous archbishop of Upsala, wrote a long didactic epic in alexandrines, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gods Labour and Rest,</hi> with an introductory ode to the Deity
                    in rhymed hexameters. He was also a good writer of hymns. Another ecclesiastic,
                    the bishop of Skara, Jesper Svedberg (1653-1735), wrote sacred verses, but is
                    better remembered as the father of Swedenborg. Peter Lagerlöf (d. 1699)
                    cultivated a pastoral vein in his <hi rend="italic">Elisandra</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucillis</hi>; he was professor of poetry, that is to say, of the
                    art of writing Latin verses, at Upsala. Olof Wexionius (1656-1690?) published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Sinne-Afvel,</hi> a collection of graceful miscellaneous
                    pieces, in 1684, in an edition of only 100 copies. Its existence was presently
                    forgotten, and the name of Wexionius had dropped out of the history of
                    literature, when Hanselli recovered a copy and reprinted its contents in 1863.
                    We have hitherto considered only the followers of Stjernhjelm; we have now to
                    speak of an important writer who followed in the footsteps of Rosenhane. Gunno
                    Eurelius, afterwards ennobled with the name of Dahlstjerna (1661-1709), early
                    showed an interest in the poetry of Italy. In 1690 he translated Guarini’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Pastor Fido,</hi> and in or just after 1697 published, in a folio
                    volume without a date, his <hi rend="italic">KungaSkald,</hi> the first original
                    poem in <hi rend="italic">ottava rima</hi> produced in Swedish. This is a
                    bombastic and vainglorious epic in honour of Charles XL, whom Eurelius adored;
                    it is not, however, without great merits, richness of language, flowing metre,
                    and the breadth of a genuine poetic enthusiasm. He published a little collection
                    of lamentable sonnets when his great master died. Eurelius struck the lyre
                    several times in honour of Charles XII., but these poems have all perished. He
                    was a true patriot, and grief at the defeat of Poltava is said to have cost him
                    his life. Johan Runius (1679-1713), called the “Prince of Poets,” published a
                    collection entitled <hi rend="italic">Dudaim,</hi> in which there is nothing to
                    praise, and with him the generation of the 17th century closes. Talent had been
                    shown by certain individuals, but no healthy school of Swedish poetry had been
                    founded, and the latest imitators of Stjernhjelm had lost every vestige of taste
                    and independence.</p>
                <p>In prose the 17th century produced but little of importance in Sweden. Gustavus
                    Adolphus (1594-1632) was the most polished writer of its earlier half, and his
                    speeches take an important place in the development of the language. The most
                    original mind of the next age was Olof Rudbeck (1630-1702), the famous author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Atland er Manhem.</hi> He spent nearly all his life in Upsala,
                    building anatomical laboratories, conducting musical concerts, laying out
                    botanical gardens, arranging medical lecture rooms—in a word, expending
                    ceaseless energy on the practical improvement of the university. He was a genius
                    in all the known branches of learning; at twenty-three his physiological
                    discoveries had made him famous throughout Europe. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atland</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Atlan-tika)</hi> appeared in four folio
                    volumes, in Latin and Swedish, in 1679-98; it was an attempt to summon all the
                    authority of the past, all the sages of Greece and the bards of Iceland, to
                    prove the inherent and indisputable greatness of the Swedish nation, in which
                    the fabulous Atlantis had been at last discovered. It was the literary
                    expression of the majesty of Charles XI., and of his autocratical dreams for the
                    destiny of Sweden. From another point of view it is a monstrous hoard or cairn
                    of rough-hewn antiquarian learning, now often praised, sometimes quoted from,
                    and never read. Olof Verelius (1618— 1682) had led the way for Rudbeck, by his
                    translations of Icelandic sagas, a work which was carried on with greater
                    intelligence by Johan Peringskjöld (1654-1720), the editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heimskringla.</hi> The French philosopher Descartes, who died at
                    Christina’s court at Stockholm in 1650, found his chief, though posthumous,
                    disciple in Anders Rydelius (1671-1738), bishop of Lund, who was the master of
                    Dalin, and thus connects us with the next epoch. Charles XII., under whose
                    special patronage Rydelius wrote, was himself a metaphysician and physiologist
                    of merit.</p>
                <p>A much more brilliant period followed the death of Charles XII. The influence of
                    France and England took the place of that of Germany and Italy. The taste of
                    Louis XIV., tempered by the study of Addison and Pope, gave its tone to the
                    academical court of Queen Ulrica Eleonore, and Sweden became completely a slave
                    to the periwigs of literature, to the unities and graces of classical France.
                    Nevertheless this was a period of great intellectual stimulus and activity, and
                    Swedish literature took a solid shape for the first time. This Augustan period
                    in Sweden closed somewhat abruptly about 1765. Two writers in verse connect it
                    with the school of the preceding century. Jacob Frese (1691-1729), whose poems
                    were published in 1726, was an elegiacal writer of much grace, who foreshadowed
                    the idyllic manner of Creutz. Samuel von Triewald (1688-1743) played a very
                    imperfect Dryden to Dalin’s Pope. He was the first Swedish satirist, and
                    introduced Boileau to his countrymen. His <hi rend="italic">Satire upon our
                    Stupid Poets</hi> may still be read with entertainment. Both in verse and prose
                    Olof von Dalin (1708-1763) takes a higher place than any writer since
                    Stjernhjelm. He was inspired by the study of his great English contemporaries.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Swedish Argus</hi> (1733-34) was modelled on Addison’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Thoughts about Critics</hi>
                    (1736) on Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Criticism,</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tale of a Horse</hi> on Swift’s <hi rend="italic">Tale of a
                    Tub.</hi> Dalin’s style, whether in prose or verse, was of a finished elegance.
                    His great epic, <hi rend="italic">Swedish Freedom</hi> (1742), was written in
                    alexandrines of far greater smoothness and vigour than had previously been
                    attempted. When in 1737 the new Royal Swedish theatre was opened, Dalin led the
                    way to a new school of dramatists with his <hi rend="italic">Brynhilda,</hi> a
                    regular tragedy in the style of Crébillon <hi rend="italic">père.</hi> In his
                    comedy of <hi rend="italic">The Envious Man,</hi> he introduced the manner of
                    Molière, or more properly that of Holberg. His songs, his satires, his
                    occasional pieces, without displaying any real originality, show Dalin’s tact
                    and skill as a workman with the pen. He stole from England and France, but with
                    the plagiarism of a man of genius; and his multifarious labours raised Sweden to
                    a level with the other literary countries of Europe. They formed a basis upon
                    which more national and more scrupulous writers could build their various
                    structures. A foreign critic, especially an English one, will never be able to
                    give Dalin so much credit as the<pb break="no"

                    master of <hi rend="italic">pastiche.</hi></p>
                <p>The only poet of importance who contested the laurels of Dalin was a woman.
                    Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht (1718-1763) was the centre of a society which
                    ventured to rival that which Queen Ulrica Eleonore created and Dalin adorned.
                    Both groups were classical in taste, both worshipped the new lights in England
                    and France. Fru Nordenflycht wrote with facility and grace; her collection of
                    lyrics, <hi rend="italic">The Sorrowing Turtledove</hi> (1743), in spite of its
                    affectation, enjoyed and merited a great success; it was the expression of a
                    deep and genuine sorrow—the death of her husband after a very brief and happy
                    married life. It was in 1744 that she settled in Stockholm and opened her famous
                    literary salon. She was called “The Swedish Sappho,” and scandal has been
                    needlessly busy in giving point to the allusion. It was to Fru Nordenflycht’s
                    credit that she discovered and encouraged the talent of two very distinguished
                    poets younger than herself, Creutz and Gyllenborg. Gustaf Filip Creutz
                    (1729-1785) was a Finlander who achieved an extraordinary success with his
                    idyllic poems, and in particular with the beautiful pastoral of <hi
                    rend="italic">Atis och Camilla,</hi> long the most popular of all Swedish poems.
                    In 1763, the year of the death of Dalin and of Fru Nordenflycht, Creutz ceased
                    to write, having been appointed minister to Spain; he gave up poetry for
                    politics. Gustaf Frederik Gyllenborg (1731-1808) was a less accomplished poet,
                    less delicate and touching, more rhetorical and artificial. His epic <hi
                    rend="italic">Taget öfver Balt</hi> (“The Expedition across the Belt”) (1785) is
                    an imitation, in twelve books, of Voltaire’s <hi rend="italic">Hcnriade,</hi>
                    and deals with the prowess of Charles X. It is impossible to read it. He wrote
                    fables, allegories, and satires. He outlived his chief contemporaries so long
                    that the new generation addressed him as “Father Gyllenborg.” Anders Odel
                    (1718-1773) wrote in 1739 the famous “Song of Malcolm Sinclair,” the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sinclairsvisa.</hi> The writers of verse in this period were
                    exceedingly numerous, but it cannot be needful, in a sketch of this kind, to
                    preserve the minor names.</p>
                <p>In prose, as was to be expected, the first half of the 18th century was rich in
                    Sweden as elsewhere. The first Swedish novelist was Jakob Henrik Mörk
                    (1714-1763). His romances have some likeness to those of Richardson; they are
                    moral, long-winded, and slow in evolution, but written in an exquisite style,
                    and with much knowledge of human nature. <hi rend="italic">Adalrik och
                    Göthilda,</hi> which went on appearing from 1742 to 1745, is the best known; it
                    was followed, between 1749 and 1758, by <hi rend="italic">Thecla.</hi> Jakob
                    Wallenberg (1746-1778) described a voyage he took to the East Indies and China
                    under the very odd title of <hi rend="italic">Min Son på Galejan</hi> (“My Son
                    at the Galleys ”), a work full of humour and originality. We have already
                    indicated that Dalin’s activity in prose was scarcely less abundant or less
                    meritorious than that in verse. He wrote an important history of Sweden down to
                    Charles IX. His contemporary Johan Ihre (1707-1780), a professor at Upsala,
                    edited the <hi rend="italic">Codex Argenteus</hi> of Ulfilas, and produced the
                    first complete Swedish dictionary. In doing this he was assisted by the labours
                    of two other grammarians, Sven Hof (d. 1786) and Abraham Sahlstedt (d. 1776).
                    Karl Gustaf Tessin (1695-1770) wrote on politics and on aesthetics. Anders Johan
                    von Höpken (1712-1789), the friend of Ulrica Eleonore, was a master of
                    rhetorical compliment in addresses and funeral orations. In spite of all the
                    encouragement of the court, drama did not flourish in Sweden. Among the
                    tragedians of the age we may mention Dalin, Gyllenborg, and Erik Wrangel (d.
                    1765). In comedy Reinbold Gustaf Modée (d. 1752) wrote three good plays in
                    rivalry of Holberg. In science Linnaeus, or Karl von Linné (1707-1778), was the
                    name of greatest genius in the whole century; but he wrote almost entirely in
                    Latin. The two great Swedish chemists, Torbern Olof Bergman (1735-1784) and Karl
                    Vilhelm Scheele (1742- 1786), flourished at this time. In pathology a great name
                    was left by Nils Rosén von Rosenstein (1706-1773), in navigation by Admiral
                    Fredrik Henrik af Chapman (d. 1808), in philology by Karl Aurivillius (d. 1786).
                    But these and other distinguished savants whose names might be enumerated
                    scarcely belong to the history of Swedish literature. The same may be said about
                    that marvellous and many-sided genius, Emanuel Swedenborg (1688— 1772), who,
                    though the son of a Swedish poet, preferred to prophesy to the world in Latin
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Swedenborg).</hi></p>
                <p>What is called the Gustavian period is supposed to commence with the reign of
                    Gustavus III. in 1771 and to close with the abdication of Gustavus IV. in 1809.
                    This period of less than forty years was particularly rich in literary talent,
                    and the taste of the people in literary matters widened to a remarkable extent.
                    Journalism began to develop; the Swedish Academy was founded; the drama first
                    learned to flourish in Stockholm; and literature began to take a
                    characteristically national shape. This fruitful period naturally divides itself
                    into two divisions, equivalent to the reigns of the two kings. The royal
                    personages of Sweden have commonly been protectors of literature; they have
                    strangely often been able men of letters themselves. Gustavus III. (1746-1792),
                    the founder of the Swedish Academy and of the Swedish theatre, was himself a
                    playwright of no mean ability. One of his prose dramas, <hi rend="italic">Siri
                    Brahe och Johan Gyllen-stjerna,</hi> held the stage for many years. In 1773 the
                    king opened the national theatre in Stockholm, and on that occasion an opera of
                    <hi rend="italic">Thetis och Pelee</hi> was performed, written by himself. In
                    1786 Gustavus created the Swedish Academy, on the lines of the French Academy,
                    but with eighteen members instead of forty. The first list of immortals, which
                    included the survivors of a previous age and such young celebrities as Kellgren
                    and Leopold, embraced all that was most brilliant in the best society of
                    Stockholm; the king himself presided, and won the first prize for an oration.
                    The principal writers of the reign of Gustavus III. bear the name of the
                    Academical school. But we must first consider a writer of genius who had nothing
                    academical in his composition.</p>
                <p>Karl Mikael Bellman (1740-1795), the most original and one of the most able of
                    all Swedish writers, was an improvisatore of the first order (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bellman).</hi> The riot of his dithyrambic hymns sounded a
                    strange note of nature amid the conventional music of the Gustavians. Of the
                    academical poets Johan Gabriel Oxenstjerna (1750-1818), the nephew of
                    Gyllenborg, was a descriptive idyllist of grace. He translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradise Lost.</hi> A writer of far more power and versatility was Johan Henrik
                    Kellgren (1751-1795), the leader of taste in his time (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kellgren).</hi> He was the first writer of the end of the century in Sweden,
                    and the second undoubtedly was Karl Gustaf af Leopold (1756-1829), “the blind
                    seer Tiresias-Leopold,” who lived on to represent the old school in the midst of
                    romantic times. Leopold was not equal to Kellgren in general poetical ability,
                    but he is great in didactic and satiric writing. He wrote a satire, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Enebomiad,</hi> against a certain luckless Per Enebom, and a
                    classic tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Virginia.</hi> He is little read now.
                    Gudmund Göran Adlerbeth (1751-1818) was a translator, and the author of a
                    successful tragic opera, <hi rend="italic">Cora och Alonzo</hi> (1782). Anna
                    Maria Lenngren (1754-1817) was a very popular sentimental writer of graceful
                    verse, chiefly between 1792 and 1798. She was less French and more national than
                    most of her contemporaries; she is a Swedish Mrs Hemans.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0788-0757"/> Two writers of the academic period, besides
                    Bellman, and a generation later than he, kept apart, and served to lead up to
                    the romantic revival. Bengt Lidner (1759- 1793), a melancholy and professedly
                    elegiacal writer, had analogies with such German sentimentalists as Novalis. He
                    led a strange wandering life, and died, still young, in extreme poverty. His
                    poems appeared in 1788. Tomas Thorild (1759-1808) was a much stronger nature,
                    and led the revolt against prevailing taste with far more vigour. But he is an
                    irregular and inartistic versifier, and it is mainly as a prose writer, and
                    especially as a very original and courageous critic, that he is now mainly
                    remembered. He settled in Germany, and died as a professor in Greifswald. Karl
                    August Ehrensvärd (1745- 1800) may be mentioned here as a critic whose aims
                    somewhat resembled those of Thorild. The creation of the Academy led to a great
                    production of aesthetic and philosophical writing. Among critics of taste may be
                    mentioned Nils von Rosenstein (1752-1824); the rhetorical bishop of Linköping,
                    Magnus Lehnberg (1758-1808); and Count Georg Adlersparre (1760-1809). Kellgren
                    and Leopold were both of them important prose writers.</p>
                <p>The excellent lyrical poet Frans Mikael Franzén (1772— 1847) (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Franzén),</hi> and a belated academician Johan David Valerius
                    (1776-1852), fill up the space between the Gustavian period and the domination
                    of romantic ideas from Germany. It was Lorenzo Hammarsköld (1785-1827) who in
                    1803 introduced the views of Tieck and Schelling by founding the society in
                    Upsala called “Vitterhetens Vänner” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hammarsköld).</hi>
                    This passed away, but was succeeded in 1807 by the famous “Aurora förbundet,”
                    founded by two youths of genius, Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom (1790-1855) and
                    Vilhelm Frederik Palmblad (1788-1852). These young men had at first to endure
                    bitter opposition and ridicule from the academic writers then in power, but they
                    supported this with cheerfulness, and answered back in their magazines, <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyfem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Posforos</hi> (1810-1813). They
                    were named “Fosforisterna” (Phosphorists) from the latter. The principal members
                    of the school were the three writers last named (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Atterbom)</hi> and Karl Frederik Dahlgren (1791-1844), a humorist who owed much
                    to the example of Bellman. Fru Julia Nyberg (1785-1854), under the title of
                    Euphrosyne, was their tenth Muse, and wrote agreeable lyrics. Among the
                    Phosphorists Atterbom was the man of most genius. On the side of the Academy
                    they were vigorously attacked by Per Adam Wallmark (1777-1858). One of them,
                    Atterbom, eventually forced the doors of the Academy itself.</p>
                <p>In 1811 certain young men in Stockholm founded a society for the elevation of
                    society by means of the study of Scandinavian antiquity. This was the Gothic
                    Society, which began to issue the magazine called <hi rend="italic">Iduna</hi>
                    as its organ. Of its patriotic editors the most prominent was Erik Gustaf Geijer
                    (1783-1847), but he was presently joined by a young man slightly older than
                    himself, Esaias Tegnér (1782-1846), afterwards bishop of Vexiö, the greatest of
                    Swedish writers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Geijer</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tegnér).</hi> Even more enthusiastic than either in pushing to its last extreme
                    the worship of ancient myths and manners was Per Henrik Ling (1776-1839), now
                    better remembered as the father of gymnastic science than as a poet. The Gothic
                    Society eventually included certain younger men than these—Arvid August Afzelius
                    (1785-1871), the first editor of the Swedish folk-songs; Gustaf Vilhelm
                    Gumaelius (1789-1877), who has been somewhat pretentiously styled “The Swedish
                    Walter Scott,” author of the historical novel of <hi rend="italic">Tord
                    Ponde</hi>; Baron Bernhard von Beskow (1796-1868), lyrist and dramatist; and
                    Karl August Nicander (1799-1839), a poet who approached the Phosphorists in
                    manner. The two great lights of the Gothic school are Geijer, mainly in prose,
                    and Tegnér, in his splendid and copious verse. Johan Olof Wallin (1779-1839) may
                    be mentioned in the same category, although he is really distinct from all the
                    schools. He was archbishop of Upsala, and in 1819 he published the national
                    hymn-book of Sweden, now officially used in all churches; of the hymns in this
                    collection, one hundred and twenty-six are written by Wallin himself.</p>
                <p>From 1810 to 1840 was the blossoming-time in Swedish poetry, and there were
                    several writers of distinguished merit who could not be included in either of
                    the groups enumerated above. Second only to Tegnér in genius, the brief life and
                    mysterious death of Erik Johan Stagnelius (1793-1823) have given a romantic
                    interest to all that is connected with his name. His first publication was the
                    epic of <hi rend="italic">Vladimir the Great</hi> (1817); to this succeeded the
                    romantic poem <hi rend="italic">Planda.</hi> His singular dramas, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Bacchantes</hi> (1822), <hi rend="italic">Sigurd Ring,</hi>
                    which was posthumous, and <hi rend="italic">The Martyrs</hi> (1821), are
                    esteemed by many critics to be his most original productions. His mystical
                    lyrics, entitled <hi rend="italic">Liljor i Saron</hi> (“Lilies in Sharon”), and
                    his sonnets, which are the best in Swedish, may be recommended as among the most
                    delicate products of the Scandinavian mind. Stagnelius has been compared, and
                    not improperly, to Shelley. Erik Sjöberg, who called himself “Vitalis”
                    (1794-1828), was another gifted writer whose career was short and wretched. A
                    volume of his poems appeared in 1820; they are few in number and all brief. His
                    work divides itself into two classes—the one profoundly melancholy, the other
                    witty or boisterous. Two humorous poets of the same period who deserve mention
                    are Johan Anders Wadman (1777-1837), an improvisatore of the same class as
                    Bellman, and Kristian Erik Fahlcrantz (1790—1866), bishop of Vesterås, whose
                    humorous polemical poem of <hi rend="italic">Noah's Ark</hi> (1825) is a
                    masterpiece.</p>
                <p>Among the poets who have been mentioned above, the majority distinguished
                    themselves also in prose. But the period was not one in which Swedish prose
                    shone with any special lustre. The first prosaist of the time was, without
                    question, the novelist Karl Jonas Ludvig Almqvist (1793-1866), around whose
                    extraordinary personal character and career a mythical romance has already
                    collected (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Almqvist).</hi> He was encyclopaedic in his
                    range, although his stories preserve most charm; on whatever subject he wrote
                    his style was always exquisite. Frederik Cederborgh (1784-1835) revived the
                    comic novel in his <hi rend="italic">Uno von Trasenberg</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ottar Trailing.</hi> The historical novels of Gumaelius have
                    already been alluded to. Swedish history supplied themes for the romances of
                    Count Per Georg Sparre (1790-1871) and of Gustaf Henrik Mellin (1803-1876). But
                    all these writers sink before the sustained popularity of the Finnish poetess
                    Fredrika Bremer (1801-1865), whose stories have reached farther into the distant
                    provinces of the world of letters than the writings of any other Swede except
                    Tegnér (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bremer).</hi> She was preceded by Sofia Zelow,
                    afterwards Baroness von Knorring (1797-1848), who wrote a long series of
                    aristocratic novels.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the romantic period a high position was taken as an
                    independent thinker by Benjamin Höijer (1767-1812), who owed much at the outset
                    to Kant and Fichte. Geijer also distinguished himself in philosophical writing,
                    but the most original of Swedish philosophers has been Kristofer Jakob Boström
                    (1797-1866), a peripatetic talker, who wrote little, but whose system has been
                    reduced to literature by K. Claëson (1827-1859), Professor Axel Nyblaeus (b.
                    1821), and other disciples. A polemical writer of great talent was Magnus
                    Jakob<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0789-0758"/> Crusenstolpe (1795-1865), of whose work it has
                    been said that “it is not history and it is not fiction, but something brilliant
                    between the one and the other.” As an historian of Swedish literature Per
                    Wieselgren (1800-1877) has composed a valuable work, and he has made other
                    valuable contributions to history and bibliography. In history we meet again
                    with the great name of Geijer, with that of Jonas Hallenberg (1748-1834), and
                    with that of Anders Magnus Strinnholm (1786-1862), whose labours in the field of
                    Swedish history were extremely valuable. Geijer and Strinnholm prepared the way
                    for the most popular and perhaps the greatest of all Swedish historians, Anders
                    Fryxell (1795-1881), whose famous <hi rend="italic">Berättelser ur Svenska
                    Historien</hi> appeared in parts during a space of nearly sixty years, an
                    extraordinary example of persistent and uninterrupted work. As a legal historian
                    the first place is easily maintained by Karl Johan Schlyter (b. 1795). Hans
                    Järta (1774-1847) was a statesman who wrote with vigour on economical subjects.
                    In science it is only possible to mention the celebrated names of Jöns Jakob
                    Berzelius (1779-1848) the chemist, Elias Fries (1794- 1878) the botanist, Karl
                    Adolf Agardh (1785-1859) the physiologist, and Sven Nilsson (1787-1883) the
                    palaeontologist.</p>
                <p>In the generation which has just passed away, the first poet of Sweden, without a
                    rival, was Johan Ludvig Runeberg (1804-1877), who divides with Tegnér the
                    highest honour in Swedish literature (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Runeberg).</hi>
                    The other leading verse-writers were Karl Vilhelm Böttiger (1807-1878), the
                    son-in-law and biographer of Tegnér; Johan Börjesson (1790-1866), the last of
                    the Phosphorists, author of various romantic dramas; Vilhelm August von Braun
                    (1813-1860), a humorous lyrist; “Talis Qualis,” whose real name was Karl Vilhelm
                    August Strandberg (1818-1877); and August Teodor Blanche (1811-1868), the
                    popular dramatist. But Runeberg is the only great poetic name of this period. In
                    prose there was not even a Runeberg. Novel-writing was sustained at no very high
                    level by Karl Anton Wetterbergh (b. 1804), who called himself “Onkel Adam,” by
                    Emilie Carlén (b. 1807), whose autobiography has lately appeared, by Oskar
                    Patrick Sturzen-Becker, “Orvar Odd,” (1811-1869), by August Blanche, and by
                    Marie Sofia Schwartz (b. 1819). Lars Johan Hierta (1801-1872) was the leading
                    journalist, Johan Henrik Thomander, bishop of Lund (1798-1865), the greatest
                    orator, Matthias Alexander Castrén (1813— 1852) a prominent man of science, and
                    Karl Gustaf af Forsell (1783-1848) the principal statistician of this not very
                    brilliant period. Elias Lönnrot (1802-1884) is distinguished as the Finnish
                    professor who discovered and edited the <hi rend="italic">Kalevala.</hi> It is
                    impossible to give an exhaustive list of names in so short a sketch as this.</p>
                <p>Swedish literature is not in a very lively condition at the present time. The
                    most popular living poet is the Finn, Zakris Topelius (b. 1818). Of a higher
                    artistic merit are the finished lyrics of Count Karl Snoilsky (b. 1841). King
                    Oscar II. (b. 1829) is a genuine poet of the second order, as his father Charles
                    XV. was of the third. Karl David af Wirsén (b. 1842) is an active writer on the
                    conservative side. The best living author of Sweden is undoubtedly Viktor
                    Rydberg (b. 1829), who has written masterly novels and historical works. The
                    latest influences from Denmark and France are beginning to be represented by
                    Strindberg the novelist, and by Fru A. Ch. Edgren, the most successful Swedish
                    dramatist of the moment. The revival of literature which has been so marked in
                    the other two Scandinavian countries has not yet spread into Sweden.</p>
