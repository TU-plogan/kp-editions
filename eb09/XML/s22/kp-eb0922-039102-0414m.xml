                    (1635-1705), “the father of Pietism,” was born 13th January 1635, at
                    Rappoltsweiler in Upper Alsace. He received his earliest education from his
                    subsequent brother-in-law, Joachim Stoll, chaplain to the count of Rappoltstein,
                    whose wife was Spener’s godmother. After a brief stay in the grammar-school of
                    Colmar he entered the university of Strasburg in 1651 as a student of
                    theology,—living there with an uncle, and holding quite aloof from the
                    student-life of the place. He devoted himself to philology, history, and
                    philosophy, and won his degree of master (1653) by a disputation against the
                    philosophy of Hobbes. He then became private tutor to the princes Christian and
                    Charles of the Palatinate, and lectured in the university on philology and
                    history. From 1659 to<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0415-0392"/> 1662 he visited the universities of Basel,
                    Tübingen, and Geneva, and commenced the study of heraldry, which he pursued
                    throughout his life. In Geneva especially his religious views and tendencies
                    were turned in the direction of his subsequent Pietism. He returned to Strasburg
                    in 1663, where he was appointed preacher without pastoral duties, with the right
                    of holding lectures in the university. Three years afterwards he was invited to
                    become the chief pastor in the Lutheran church at Frankfort-on-the-Main. He had
                    previously married a lady of his mother’s choice, who made him an excellent wife
                    and bore him eleven children. Immediately after his removal to Frankfort he
                    commenced that line of pastoral work which issued in the movement called <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pietism</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). In 1686 he accepted
                    the invitation to the first court chaplaincy at Dresden. But the elector John
                    George III., at whose personal desire the post had been offered to him, was soon
                    offended at the fearless conscientiousness with which his chaplain sought to
                    discharge his pastoral duties; and the opposition of the Saxon university of
                    Leipsic to the Pietistic movement and to Spener personally served to render the
                    chaplain more decidedly a <hi rend="italic">persona ingrata</hi> to the elector.
                    Spener refused to resign his post, and the Saxon Government hesitated to dismiss
                    him. But in 1691 the Saxon representative at Berlin induced the court of
                    Brandenburg to offer him the rectorship of St Nicolas in Berlin with the title
                    of “consistorialrath.” In Berlin Spener was held in high honour, though the
                    tendencies of the court and the Government officials were rather rationalistic
                    than pietistic. One of the most important works of this period of his life was
                    the foundation of the university of Halle (1691), which he directed. All his
                    life long Spener had been exposed to the incessant attacks and abuse of the
                    orthodox Lutheran theologians, who generally charged him with the errors in
                    doctrine and extravagances in practice of followers who had borrowed from him
                    everything rather than his wisdom and caution. With his years his opponents
                    multiplied, and the movement which he had inaugurated presented increasingly
                    matter for hostile criticism. In 1695 the theological faculty of Wittenberg
                    formally laid to his charge 264 errors, and only his death (5th February 1705)
                    released him from these fierce conflicts.</p>
                <p>Though Spener has been justly called “the father of Pietism,” hardly any of the
                    errors and none of the extravagances of the movement can be ascribed to him
                    personally. So far was he from sharing them that Ritschl maintains (ii. p. 163)
                    that “he was himself not a Pietist,” as he did not advocate the quietistic,
                    legalistic, and semi-separatist practices of Pietism, though they were more or
                    less involved in the positions he assumed or the practices which he encouraged
                    or connived at. The only two points on which he departed from the orthodox
                    Lutheran faith of his day were the requirement of regeneration as the <hi
                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of the true theologian, and the expectation of
                    the conversion of the Jews and the fall of Papacy as the prelude of the triumph
                    of the church. He did not, like the later Pietists, insist on the necessity of a
                    conscious crisis of conversion, nor did he encourage a complete breach between
                    the Christian and the secular life.</p>
                <p>Spener was a voluminous writer. The list of his published works comprises 7 vols.
                    folio, 63 quarto, 7 octavo, 46 duodecimo; and in one year he had answered 622
                    and had still to answer 300 letters. The most important of his works for their
                    bearing on his history are <hi rend="italic">Theologische Bedenken,</hi> in 4
