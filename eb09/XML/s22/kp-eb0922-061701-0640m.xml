                    Lyons, he manifested military abilities which secured his rapid promotion. As
                    <hi rend="italic">chef de bataillon</hi> he was present at the siege of Toulon
                    in 1793, where he took General O’Hara prisoner. During the Italian campaign of
                    1796 he distinguished himself in most of the important contests and was severely
                    wounded at Cerea on 11th October. In October 1797 he was appointed to the
                    command of a demi-brigade, and in the following year his services in Switzerland
                    were recognized by his promotion to the rank of general of brigade. He then went
                    to Egypt, but soon afterwards was recalled, and in August made chief of the
                    staff to Brune, to whom he rendered invaluable assistance in restoring the
                    efficiency and discipline of the army in Italy. In July 1799 he was made general
                    of division to Joubert in Italy, and, after being continued in the same office
                    by his successors, was in 1800 named by Masséna his second in command. Soon
                    afterwards he had an opportunity of manifesting those qualities which entitle
                    him to rank among the most daring and clever tacticians of his time; his
                    dexterous resistance to the superior forces of the Austrians with the left of
                    Masséna, when the right and centre were shut up in Genoa, not only prevented the
                    invasion of France from this direction but powerfully contributed to the success
                    of Napoleon’s strategy of crossing the Alps, which culminated in the battle of
                    Marengo on 14th June. He took a prominent part in all the subsequent events of
                    the Italian campaign till the peace of Lunéville, 9th February 1801. In the
                    campaigns of 1805 and 1806 he greatly increased his reputation, more especially
                    at Austerlitz, Saalfeld, Jena, Pultusk, and Ostrolenka. He obtained the title of
                    count on 19th March 1808, and, after taking part in the siege of Saragossa, was
                    named generalissimo of the army of Aragon and governor of the province, which,
                    by wise administration no less than by his brilliant valour, he in two years
                    brought into complete submission. He annihilated the army of Blake at Maria on
                    14th June 1809, and on 22d April 1810 inflicted a severe defeat on O’Donnell.
                    After being made marshal of France, 8th July 1811, he in 1812 achieved the
                    conquest of Valencia, for which he was rewarded with the title of Duc
                    d’Albufera. By Louis XVIII. he was on 4th June made a peer of France, but,
                    having assisted Napoleon during the “hundred days,” he was deprived of his
                    peerage on 24th July 1815. He died near Marseilles on 3d January 1826. Suchet
