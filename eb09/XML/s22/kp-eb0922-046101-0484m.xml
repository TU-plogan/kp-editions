                    Latin <hi rend="italic">status,</hi> which, in the so-called Middle Ages, had
                    come to mean a “state” in the political sense. “Statistic,” therefore,
                    originally denoted inquiries into the condition of a state. Since the beginning
                    of the 18th century the denotation of the word has been extended so as to
                    include subjects only indirectly connected with political organizations, while
                    at the same time the scope of the investigations it implies has become more
                    definite, and at the present day may be said, for practical purposes, to be
                    fixed, though there are still controversies as to the position of statistical
                    studies in relation to other departments of scientific procedure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The origin of what is now known as “statistic”
                    (Ger. <hi rend="italic">Die Statistik</hi>; Fr, <hi rend="italic">La
                    Statistique;</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">Statistica</hi>) can only be referred
                    to briefly here. As M. Maurice Block has observed in commencing his admirable
                    treatise, “it is no exaggeration to say that statistic has existed ever since
                    there were states.” For the first administrative act of the first regular
                    Government was probably to number its fighting men, and its next to ascertain
                    with some degree of accuracy what amount of taxation could be levied on the
                    remainder of the community. As human societies became more aud more highly
                    organized, there can be no doubt that a very considerable body of official
                    statistics must have come into existence, and been constantly used by statesmen,
                    solely with a view to administration. The Romans, who may be described as the
                    most business-like people of antiquity, were careful to obtain accurate
                    information regarding the resources of the state, and they appear to have
                    carried on the practice of taking the census, a very comprehensive statistical
                    operation, with a regularity which has hardly been surpassed in modern times. As
                    to the efficiency of the work done we have unfortunately very little
                    information, but those who are curious on the subject may be referred to an
                    article by Dr Hildebrand, entitled “Die amtliche Bevölkerungsstatistik im alten
                    Rom,” printed in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch für Nationalökonomie und
                    Statistik,</hi> 1866, p. 82.</p>
                <p>Statistics, or rather the material for statistics, therefore existed at a very
                    early period, but it was not until within the last three centuries that
                    systematic use of the information available began to be made for purposes of
                    investigation and not of mere administration. According to M. Block, the
                    earliest work in which facts previously known only to Government officials were
                    published to the world was a volume compiled by Francesco Sansovino, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Del Governo et Amministrazione di Diversi Regni et
                    Repub-liche,</hi> which was printed in Venice and bears the date 1583. Other
                    works of a similar kind were published towards the end of the 16th century in
                    Italy and France. Regarding these and other early books on the subject reference
                    may be made to Fallati’s <hi rend="italic">Einleitung in die Wissenschaft der
                    Statistik,</hi> Dr G. B. Salvioni’s preface and notes to his translation into
                    Italian of Dr Mayr’s work on statistics, and other authors mentioned at the
                    close of this article.</p>
                <p>Works on state administration and finance continued to be published during the
                    first half of the 17th century, and the tendency to employ figures, which were
                    hardly used at all by Sansovino, became more marked, especially in England,
                    where the facts connected with “bills of mortality” had begun to attract
                    attention.</p>
                <p>In the year 1660 Hermann Conring, “professor of medicine and politics,” a rather
                    odd combination, in the university of Helmstädt, was in the habit of giving
                    lectures in which he analysed and discussed the circumstances existing in
                    various countries, in so far as they affected the happiness of the inhabitants.
                    Conring’s example was followed by other writers, in Germany and elsewhere, to
                    whom reference is made by Block <hi rend="italic">(Traité,</hi> pp. 5, 6) and
                    Haushofer <hi rend="italic">(Lehr-und Handbuch,</hi> p. 10, note).</p>
                <p>The best-known member of the “descriptive” school was Achenwall (1719-1772), who
                    is sometimes spoken of as “the father of modern statistics,” but, as his
                    procedure was essentially the same as that of Conring, though it was carried out
                    more fully, the title has not been unanimously granted. It is generally
                    admitted, however, that Achenwall’s work gave a great impulse to the pursuit of
                    the studies which are now included under the title of statistics. He called his
                    book <hi rend="italic">Staatsverfassung der europäischen Reiche</hi> in the
                    first two editions (1749, 1752), meaning “Constitution of the States of Europe.”
                    Subsequently he added “vornehmsten” and then “heutigen before “europäischen,”
                    evidently with the desire of bringing his work, which may be regarded as the
                    germ of such volumes as the <hi rend="italic">Statesman's Year-Book,</hi> “up to
                    date.’ Achenwall is usually credited with being the first writer who made use of
                    the word “statistics,” which he applied to his collection of “noteworthy matters
                    regarding the state”<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n485/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0485-0462"/><hi rend="italic">(Staatsmerkwürdigkeiten),</hi>
                    but the claim has been disputed by M. Block, who points out that the term <hi
                    rend="italic">collegium statisticum</hi> had been previously employed by
                    Schmeitzel, a follower of Conring, whose lectures at Jena were no doubt attended
                    by Achenwall.</p>
                <p>In any case statistics, in the modern sense of the word, did not really come into
                    existence until the publication by J. P. Süssmilch, a Prussian clergyman, of a
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">Hie göttliche Ordnung in den Veränderungen des
                    Menschlichen Geschlechts aus dem Geburt, dem Tode, und der Fortpflanzung
                    desselben erwiesen.</hi> In this book a systematic attempt was made to make use
                    of a class of facts which up to that time had been regarded as belonging to
                    “political arithmetic,” under which description some of the most important
                    problems of what modern writers term “vital statistics” had been studied,
                    especially in England. Süssmilch had arrived at a perception of the advantage of
                    studying what Quetelet subsequently termed the “laws of large numbers.” He
                    combined the method employed by the Conring-Achenwall school of “descriptive
                    statistics,” whose works were not unlike modern school-books of geography, with
                    that of the “political arithmeticians,” who had confined themselves to
                    investigations into the facts regarding mortality and a few other similar
                    subjects, without much attempt at generalizing from them.</p>
                <p>Political arithmetic had come into existence in England in the middle of the 17th
                    century, or about the time when Conring was instructing the students of
                    Helmstädt. The earliest example of this class of investigation is the work of
                    Captain John Graunt of London, entitled <hi rend="italic">Natural and Political
                    Annotations made upon the Bills of Mortality,</hi> which was first published in
                    1666. This remarkable work, which dealt with mortality in London only, ran
                    through many editions, and the line of inquiry it suggested was followed up by
                    other writers, of whom the most distinguished was Sir William Petty, whose
                    active mind was naturally attracted by the prospect of making use of a new
                    scientific method in the class of speculations which occupied him. Sir William
                    was the first writer to make use of the phrase which for nearly a century
                    afterwards was employed to describe the use of figures in the investigation of
                    the phenomena of human society. He called his book on the subject, which was
                    published in 1683, <hi rend="italic">Five Essays in Political Arithmetics</hi>
                    Other writers, of whom Halley, the celebrated mathematician and astronomer, was
                    one, entered on similar investigations, and during the greater part of the 18th
                    century the number of persons who devoted themselves· to “arithmetical”
                    inquiries into problems of the class now known as statistical was steadily
                    increasing. Much attention was given to the construction of tables of mortality,
                    a subject which had a great attraction for mathematicians, who were eager to
                    employ the newly-discovered calculus of probabilities on concrete problems.
                    Besides Halley, De Moivre, Laplace, and Euler busied themselves with this branch
                    of study. Attempts were also made to deal with figures as the basis of political
                    and fiscal discussion by Arthur Young, Hume, and other historical writers, as
                    well as by the two Mirabeaus.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to return to Süssmilch, who, as already mentioned,
                    endeavoured to form a general theory of society, based on what were then termed
                    “arithmetical” premisses, treated nearly on the lines laid down by Achenwall. In
                    modern language, he made use of quantitative aggregate-observation as an
                    instrument of social inquiry. It is true he did not enter on his investigation
                    with an “open mind.” He desired to support a foregone conclusion, as the title
                    of his work already mentioned shows. But nevertheless his work was a most
                    valuable one, since it pointed out a road which others who had no desire to
                    procure evidence in favour of a particular system of thought were not slow to
                    follow. M. Block makes the following remarks on the influence exercised on his
                    contemporaries by the work of Süssmilch :—“If the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Göttliche Ordnung</hi> had been a professor his influence would
                    have been much greater than it was. In maintaining that the movement of
                    population is subject to law, that there is a regularity in the recurrence of
                    such phenomena which allows of their being foreseen, he cast into the public
                    mind a leaven which has evidently contributed to the progress of science.”
                    Although for many years after the appearance of Süssmilch’s book there was a
                    good deal of resistance to the introduction of “arithmetic” as the coadjutor of
                    moral and political investigations, yet, practically there was a tacit admission
                    of the usefulness of figures, even by the chiefs of the so-called “descriptive”
                    school. On the other hand Süssmilch’s success was the origin of a “mathematical”
                    school of statisticians, some of whom carried their enthusiasm for figures so
                    far that they refused to allow any place for mere “descriptions” at all. These
                    two schools have now coalesced, each admitting the importance of the point of
                    view urged by the other. They were, however, still perceptibly distinct even as
                    late as 1850, and the ignorant hostility with which many people even among the
                    cultivated classes still regard statistical inquiries into the nature of human
                    society may be regarded as a survival of the much stronger feeling which showed
                    itself among “orthodox” professors of law and economics on the publication of
                    Süssmilch’s treatise.</p>
                <p>M. Block is of opinion that the descriptive school, by whom figures are regarded
                    merely as accessories to and illustrations of the text, would have maintained
                    its position even now but for the establishment of official statistical offices
                    and the influence of the great Belgian Quetelet. Quetelet’s work was certainly
                    “epoch-making” in a far higher degree than that of any of his predecessors. To
                    the impulse created by him must be attributed the foundation in 1835 of the
                    Statistical Society of London, a body which, though it has contributed little to
                    the discussion of the theory of statistics, has had a considerable and very
                    useful influence on the practical work of carrying out statistical
                    investigations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Quetelet’s works were
                    numerous and multifarious, but his most important contribution to the growth of
                    statistical inquiry was his investigation of the theory of probabilities as
                    applied to the “physical and social” sciences, contained in a series of letters
                    to the duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and published in 1846. Quetelet was above
                    all things an exponent of the “laws of large numbers.” He was especially
                    fascinated with the tendency to relative constancy of magnitude displayed by the
                    figures of moral statistics, especially those of crime, which inspired him with
                    a certain degree of pessimism. His conception of an average man (<hi
                    rend="italic">l'homme moyen)</hi> and his disquisition on the “curve of
                    possibility” were most important contributions to the technical development of
                    the statistical method, though, as M. Block observes, their value may have been
                    somewhat exaggerated by subsequent writers (Block, ch. i. p. 16, and ch. v. p.
                    112 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.). It is not possible to enter at length into
                    Quetelet’s work in connexion with statistical science. At the close of this
                    article will be found a list including those of his works which are likely to be
                    of use to students of statistics.</p>
                <p>The influence exercised by Quetelet on the development of statistics is clearly
                    seen from the fact that, though there is still considerable controversy among
                    statisticians, the old controversy between the “descriptive” and arithmetical
                    schools has disappeared, or perhaps we should say has been transformed into a
                    discussion of another kind, the question now at issue being whether there is a
                    science<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n486/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0486-0463"/> of statistics as well as a statistical method. It
                    is true that a few books were published between 1830 and 1850 in which the
                    politico-geographical description of a country is spoken of as “statistics,”
                    which is thus distinguished from “political arithmetic.” The title of Knies’s
                    great work, <hi rend="italic">Die Statistik als selbständige Wissenschaft</hi>
                    (Cassel, 1850), is especially noteworthy as showing that the nature of the
                    controversy was changing. The opponents of Süssmilch maintained that “political
                    arithmetic” ought not to be spoken of as statistics at all. They clung to the
                    conceptions of Conring and Achenwall, to whom “statistics” represented
                    “Staatenkunde” or “Staatszustandskunde,” or, as Herzberg, one of Achenwall's
                    followers, called it, “die Kenntniss von der politischen Verfassung der
                    Staaten.” Knies claimed that the really “scientific” portion of statistics
                    consisted of the figures employed. As Haushofer says, “his starting point is
                    political arithmetic.”</p>
                <p>Some eminent statisticians of the latter half of the present century agree with
                    Knies, but the majority of the modern writers on the theory of statistics have
                    adopted a slightly different view, according to which statistics is at once a
                    <hi rend="italic">science</hi> relating to the social life of man and a <hi
                    rend="italic">method of investigation</hi> applicable to all sciences. This view
                    is ably maintained by Mayr, Haushofer, Gabaglio, and Block, who may be taken to
                    represent the opinions held by the majority of statisticians on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>Having dealt as far as was possible, within the limits of this article, with the
                    history of statistics, we may here enter a little more minutely into the views
                    of the existing Continental school. This is all the more necessary because,
                    singular to say, there has been no systematic exposition of the subject in
                    England. Isolated dicta have been furnished by high authorities, such as the
                    late Dr W. A. Guy, Prof. Ingram, Sir Rawson W. Rawson, Mr Robert Giffen, and to
                    some extent also by John Stuart Mill, Buckle, Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and
                    other historical and economic writers. There are also monographs on particular
                    points connected with the <hi rend="italic">technique</hi> of statistical
                    investigation, such as the contribution made by Mr F. Y. Edgeworth to the
                    discussions at the jubilee of the Statistical Society in 1885, and some of the
                    observations contained in a paper by Mr Patrick Geddes, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">An Analysis of the Principles of Economics,</hi> read before the
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1884. Prof. Foxwell has also lectured on the
                    subject of statistics in his capacity of Newmarch lecturer at University
                    College, London. But there has been no attempt to deal with the subject in a
                    systematic way. The practice of statistical inquiry, on the other hand, has been
                    carried on in England with a high degree of success.</p>
                <p>With regard to the few invasions of the domain of theory attempted by English
                    writers, it may be observed that the authorities above mentioned are not
                    unanimous. Dr Guy as well as Sir Rawson Rawson, who handled the subject with
                    great ability at the jubilee meeting of the London Statistical Society in June
                    1885, both claim that statistics is to be regarded as an independent science,
                    apart from sociology, while Prof. Ingram, who presided over Section F at the
                    Dublin meeting of the British Association in 1878, maintained that statistics
                    cannot occupy a position co-ordinate with that of sociology, and went on to say
                    that they “constitute only one of the aids or adminicula of science.” Mr Giffen
                    has also expressed himself adversely to the Continental doctrine that there is
                    an independent science of statistics, and this opinion appears to be the correct
                    one, but, as Dr Guy and Sir Rawson Rawson have the support of the great body of
                    systematic teaching emanating from distinguished Continental statisticians in
                    support of their view, while their opponents have so far only the <hi
                    rend="italic">obiter dicta</hi> of a few eminent men to rely upon, it appears
                    needful to examine closely the views held by the Continental authorities, and
                    the grounds on which they are based.</p>
                <p>The clearest and shortest definition of the science of statistics as thus
                    conceived is that of M. Block, who describes it as “la science de l’homme vivant
                    en société en tant qu’elle peut être exprimée par les chiffres.” He proposes to
                    give a new name to the branch of study thus defined, namely, “Demography.”
                    Mayr’s definition is longer. He defines the statistical science as “die
                    systematische Darlegung und Erörterung der thatsächlichen Vorgänge und der aus
                    diesen sich ergebenden Gesetze des gesellschaftlichen menschlichen Lebens auf
                    Grundlage quantitativer Massenbeobachtungen” (the systematic statement and
                    explanation of actual events, and of the laws of man’s social life that may be
                    deduced from these, on the basis of the quantitative observation of aggregates).
                    Gabaglio’s view is practically identical with those adopted by Mayr and Block,
                    though it is differently expressed. He says “statistics may be interpreted in an
                    extended and in a restricted sense. In the former sense it is a method, in the
                    latter a science. As a science it studies the actual social-political order by
                    means of mathematical induction.”</p>
                <p>This discussion regarding the nature of statistics is to a large extent a
                    discussion about names. There is really no difference of opinion among
                    statistical experts as to the subject-matter of statistics, the only question
                    being— Shall statistics be termed a science as well as a method? That there are
                    some investigations in which statistical procedure is employed which certainly
                    do not belong to the domain of the supposed statistical science is generally
                    admitted. But, as already shown, an attempt has been made to claim that the
                    phenomena of human society, or some part of those phenomena, constitute the
                    subjectmatter of an independent statistical science. It is not easy to see why
                    this claim should be admitted. There is no reason either of convenience or logic
                    why the use of a certain scientific method should be held to have created a
                    science in one department of inquiry, while in others the said method is
                    regarded merely as an aid in investigation carried on under the superintendence
                    of a science already in existence. It is impossible to get over the fact that in
                    meteorology, medicine, and other physical sciences statistical inquiries are
                    plainly and obviously examples of the employment of a method, like microscopy,
                    spectrum analysis, or the use of the telescope. Why should the fact of their
                    employment in sociology be considered as authorizing the classification of the
                    phenomena thus dealt with to form a new science?</p>
                <p>The most effective argument put forward by the advocates of this view is the
                    assertion that statistics are merely a convenient aid to investigation in the
                    majority of sciences, but are the sole method of inquiry in the case of
                    sociology. Dr Mayr especially <hi rend="italic">(Gesetzmässigkeit,</hi> Ac., p.
                    14 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> makes use of this argument, and illustrates it
                    with his usual ability; but his reasoning is very far from being conclusive.
                    When, indeed, it is tested by reference to the important class of social facts
                    which are named economic, it becomes obvious that the argument breaks down.
                    Economics is a branch—the only scientifically organized branch—of sociology, and
                    statistics are largely used in it, but no one, so far as we are aware, has
                    proposed to call economics a department of statistical science. Sir Rawson W.
                    Rawson, it is true, has boldly proposed to throw over the term “sociology”
                    altogether, and to describe the study of man in the social state as
                    “statistics,” but common usage is too firmly fixed to make this alteration of
                    nomenclature practicable even if it were desirable. The existence of the works
                    of Mr Herbert Spencer and Dr Schäffle alone would render the attempted
                    alteration abortive.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n487/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0487-0464"/> Although, however, the above considerations
                    forbid the acceptance of the Continental opinion that the study of man in the
                    social state is identical with statistics, it must be admitted that without
                    statistics the nature of human society could never become known. For society is
                    an aggregate, or rather a congeries of aggregates. Not only that, but the
                    individuals composing these aggregates are not in juxtaposition, and what is,
                    from the sociological point of view, the same aggregate or organ of the “body
                    politic” is not always composed of the same individuals. Constancy of social
                    form is maintained concurrently with the most extensive changes in the
                    collocation and identity of the particles composing the form. A “nation” is
                    really changed, so far as the individuals composing it are concerned, every
                    moment of time by the operation of the laws of population. But the nation,
                    considered sociologically, remains the same in spite of this slow change in the
                    particles composing it, just as a human being is considered to be the same
                    person year by year, although year by year the particles forming his or her body
                    are constantly being destroyed and fresh particles substituted. Of course the
                    analogy between the life of a human being and the life of a human community must
                    not be pressed too far. Indeed, in several respects human communities more
                    nearly resemble some of the lower forms of animal life than the more highly
                    organized forms of animal existence. There are organisms which are fissiparous,
                    and when cut in two form two fresh independent organisms, so diffused is the
                    vitality of the original organism; and the same phenomenon may be observed in
                    regard to human communities.</p>
                <p>Now the only means whereby the grouping of the individuals forming a social
                    organism can be ascertained, and the changes in the groups year by year
                    observed, is the statistical method. Accordingly the correct view seems to be
                    that it is the function of this method to make perceptible facts regarding the
                    constitution of society on which sociology is to base its conclusions. It is not
                    claimed, or ought not to be claimed, that statistical investigation can supply
                    <hi rend="italic">the whole</hi> of the facts a knowledge of which will enable
                    sociologists to form a correct theory of the social life of man. The statistical
                    method is essentially a mathematical procedure, attempting to give a
                    quantitative expression to certain facts; and the resolution of differences of
                    quality into differences of quantity has not yet been effected even in chemical
                    science. In sociological science the importance of differences of quality is
                    enormous, and the effect of these differences on the conclusions to be drawn
                    from figures is sometimes neglected, or insufficiently recognized, even by men
                    of unquestionable ability and good faith. The majority of politicians, social
                    “reformers,” and amateur handlers of statistics generally are in the habit of
                    drawing the conclusions that seem good to them from such figures as they may
                    obtain, merely by treating as homogeneous quantities which are heterogeneous,
                    and as comparable quantities which are not comparable. Even to the conscientious
                    and intelligent inquirer the difficulty of avoiding mistakes in using statistics
                    prepared by other persons is very great. There are usually “pitfalls” even in
                    the simplest statistical statement, the position and nature of which are known
                    only to the persons who have actually handled what may be called the “raw
                    material” of the statistics in question; and in regard to complex statistical
                    statements the “outsider” cannot be too careful to ascertain from those who
                    compiled them as far as possible what are the points requiring elucidation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Statistical Method.—</hi> This method is a scientific
                    procedure (1) whereby certain phenomena of aggregation not perceptible to the
                    senses are rendered perceptible to the intellect, and (2) furnishing rules for
                    the correct perform ance of the quantitative observation of these phenomena. The
                    class of phenomena of aggregation referred to includes only such phenomena as
                    are too large to be perceptible to the senses. It does not, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> include such phenomena as are the subject-matter of microscopy.
                    Things which are very large are often quite as difficult to perceive as those
                    which are very small. A familiar example of this is the difficulty which is
                    sometimes experienced in finding the large names, as of countries or provinces,
                    on a map. Of course the terms “large,” “too large,” “small,” and “too small”
                    must be used with great caution, and with a clear comprehension on the part of
                    the person using them of the standard of measurement implied by the terms in
                    each particular case. A careful study of the first few pages of De Morgan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Differential and Integral Calculus</hi> will materially assist the
                    student of statistics in attaining a grasp of the principles on which standards
                    of measurement should be formed. It is not necessary that he should become
                    acquainted with the calculus itself, or even possess anything more than an
                    elementary knowledge of mathematical science, but it is essential that he should
                    be fully conscious of the fact that “large” and “small” quantities can only be
                    so designated with propriety by reference to a common standard.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sources whence Statistics are Derived.—</hi> The term
                    “statistics” in the concrete sense means systematic arrangements of figures
                    representing “primary statistical quantities.” A primary statistical quantity is
                    a number obtained from numbers representing phenomena, with a view to enable an
                    observer to perceive a certain other phenomenon related to the former as whole
                    to parts. They represent either a phenomenon of existence at a given point of
                    time or a phenomenon of accretion during a given period. As examples may be
                    mentioned the number of deaths in a given district during <hi rend="italic">a
                    given time,</hi> the number of pounds sterling received by the London and North
                    Western Railway during a given time, and the number of “inches of rain” that
                    fell at Greenwich during a given time. Other examples are the number of tons of
                    pig-iron lying in a particular store at <hi rend="italic">a given date,</hi> the
                    number of persons residing (the term "residing” to be specially defined) in a
                    given territory at a given date, and the number of pounds sterling representing
                    the "private deposits” of the Bank of England at a given date.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Primary Statistical Quantities</hi> are the result of labours
                    carried on either (A) by Governments or (B) by individuals or public or private
                    corporations.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Government Statistics.—</hi> (1) A vast mass of statistical
                    material of more or less value comes into existence automatically in modern
                    states in consequence of the ordinary administrative routine of departments. To
                    this class belong the highly important statistical information published in
                    England by the registrar-general, the returns of pauperism issued by the Local
                    Government Board, the reports of inspectors of prisons, factories, schools, and
                    those of sanitary inspectors, as well as the reports of the commissioners of the
                    customs, and the annual statements of trade and navigation prepared by the same
                    officials. There are also the various returns compiled and issued by the Board
                    of Trade, which is the body most nearly resembling the statistical bureaus with
                    which most foreign Governments are furnished. Most of the Government departments
                    publish some statistics for which they are solely responsible as regards both
                    matter and form, and they are very jealous of their right to do so, a fact which
                    is to some extent detrimental to that uniformity as to dates and periods which
                    should bo the ideal of a well-organized system of statistics. Finally may be
                    mentioned the very important set of statistical quantities known as the budget,
                    and the statistics prepared and published by the commissioners of inland
                    revenue, by the post office, and by the national debt commissioners. All these
                    sets of primary statistical quantities arise out of the ordinary work of
                    departments of the public service. Many of them have been in existence, in some
                    form or other, ever since a settled Government existed in the country. There are
                    records of customs receipts at London and other ports of the time of Edward
                    III., covering a period of many years, which leave nothing to be desired in
                    point of precision and uniformity. It may be added that many of these sets of
                    figures are obtained in much the same form by all civilized Governments, and
                    that it is often possible to compare the figures relating to different
                    countries, and thus obtain evidence as to the sociological phenomena of each,
                    but in regard to others there are differences which make comparison
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>(2) Besides being responsible for the issue of what may be called administration
                    statistics, all Governments are in the habit of ordering from time to time
                    special inquiries into special subjects<pb break="no"

                    information needful for administrative purposes, or, in countries possessed of
                    representative institutions, to supply statistics asked for by parliaments or
                    congresses. It is not necessary to refer particularly to this class of
                    statistical information, except in the case of the census. This is an inquiry of
                    such great importance that it may be regarded as one of the regular
                    administrative duties of Governments, though as the census is only taken once in
                    a series of years it must be mentioned under the head of occasional or special
                    inquiries undertaken by Governments. In the United Kingdom the work is done by
                    the registrars-general who are in office when the period for taking the census
                    comes round. On the Continent the work is carried out by the statistical bureaus
                    of each country,—except France, where it is under the supervision of the
                    minister of the interior. For further information on this subject reference may
                    be made to the excellent chapter in M. Maurice Block’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité</hi> entitled “Recensement.” See also “Instructions to the
                    Superintendent Registrar of Births and Deaths as to his duties in taking the

                <p>B. The primary statistical quantities for which individuals or corporations are
                    responsible may be divided into three categories.</p>
                <p>(1) Among those which are compiled in obedience to the law of the land are the
                    accounts furnished by municipal corporations, by railway, gas, water, banking,
                    insurance, and other public companies making returns to the Board of Trade, by
                    trades unions, and by other bodies which are obliged to make returns to the
                    registrar of friendly societies. The information thus obtained is published in
                    full by the departments receiving it, and is also furnished by the companies
                    themselves to their proprietors or members.</p>
                <p>(2) An enormous mass of statistical information is furnished voluntarily by
                    public companies in the reports and accounts which, in accordance with their
                    articles of association, are presented to their proprietors at stated intervals.
                    With these statistics may be classed the figures furnished by the various trade
                    associations, some of them of great importance, such as Lloyd’s, the London
                    Stock Exchange, the British Iron Trade Association, the London Corn Exchange,
                    the Institute of Bankers, the Institute of Actuaries, and other such bodies too
                    numerous to mention.</p>
                <p>(3) There are cases in which individuals have devoted themselves with more or
                    less success to obtaining original statistics on special points. The great work
                    done by Messrs Behm and Wagner in arriving at an approximate estimate of the
                    population of the earth does not belong to this category, though its results are
                    really primary statistical quantities. Many of these results have not been
                    arrived at by a direct process of enumeration at all, but by ingenious processes
                    of inference. It need hardly be said that it is not easy for individuals to
                    obtain the materials for any primary statistical quantity of importance, but it
                    has been done in some cases with success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Operations Performed on Primary Statistical Quantities.—</hi>
                    Only a brief description of matters connected with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >technique</hi> of the statistical method can be given in this article. In order
                    to form statistics properly so called the primary statistical quantities must be
                    formed into tables, and in the formation of these tables lies the art of the
                    statistician. It is not a very difficult art when the principles relating to it
                    have been properly grasped, but those who are unfamiliar with the subject are
                    apt to underrate the difficulty of correctly practising it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Simple Tables.—</hi> The first thing to be done in the
                    construction a table is to form a clear idea of what the table is to show, and
                    to express that idea in accurate language. This is a matter which is often
                    neglected, and it is a source of much waste of time and occasionally of
                    misapprehension to those who have to study the figures thus presented. No table
                    ought to be considered complete without a "heading” accurately describing its
                    contents, and it is frequently necessary that such headings should be rather
                    long. It has been said that “you can prove anything by statistics.” This
                    statement is of course absurd, taken absolutely, but, like most assertions which
                    are widely believed, it has a grain of truth in it. If this popular saying ran
                    “you can prove anything by tables with slovenly and ambiguous headings,” it
                    might be assented to without hesitation. The false “statistical” facts which
                    obtain a hold of the public mind may often be traced to some widely circulated
                    table, to which either from stupidity or carelessness an erroneous or inaccurate
                    “heading” has been affixed.</p>
                <p>A statistical table in its simplest form consists of “primaries” representing
                    phenomena of the same class, but existing at different points of time, or coming
                    into existence during different portions of time. This is all that is essential
                    to a table, though other things are usually added to it as an aid to its
                    comprehension. A table stating the number of persons residing in each county of
                    England on a given day of a given year, and also, in another column, the
                    corresponding numbers for the same counties on the corresponding day of the
                    tenth year subsequently, would be a simple tabular statement of the general
                    facts regarding the total population of those counties supplied by two
                    successive censuses. Various figures might, however, be added to it which would
                    greatly add to its clearness. There might be columns showing the increase or
                    decrease for each county and for the whole kingdom during the ten years, and
                    another column showing what <hi rend="italic">proportion,</hi> expressed in
                    percentages, these increases or decreases bore to the figures for the earlier of
                    the two years. Then there might be two columns showing what proportions, also
                    expressed as percentages, the figures for each county bore in each year to the
                    figures for the whole kingdom. The nine-column table thus resulting would still
                    be simple, all the figures being merely explicit assertions of facts which are
                    contained implicitly in the original “primaries.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Complex Tables.—</hi> Suppose now we have another table
                    precisely similar in form to the first, and also relating to the counties of
                    England, but giving the number of houses existing in each of them at the same
                    two dates. A combination of the two would form a complex table, and an
                    application of the processes of arithmetic would make evident a number of fresh
                    facts, all of which would be implied in the table, but would not be obvious to
                    most people until explicitly stated.</p>
                <p>The technical work of the statistician consists largely in operations of which
                    the processes just referred to are types.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Proportions.—</hi> The most usual and the best mode of
                    expressing the proportion borne by one statistical quantity to another is to
                    state it as a percentage. In some cases another method is adopted —namely, that
                    of stating the proportion in the form “one in so many.” This method is generally
                    a bad one, and its use should be discouraged as much as possible, the chief
                    reason being that the changing portion of this kind of proportional figure
                    becomes greater or less inversely, and not directly, as the phenomenon it
                    represents increases or diminishes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Averages.—</hi> Averages or means are for statistical purposes
                    divided into two classes, the <hi rend="italic">geometrical</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">arithmetical.</hi> An arithmetical mean is the sum of all the
                    members forming the series of figures under consideration divided by their
                    number, without reference to their <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> or relative
                    importance among themselves. A geometrical mean is the sum of such figures
                    divided by their number, with due allowance made for their weight. An example
                    will make this clear, and the simplest example is taken from a class of
                    statistical quantities of a peculiar kind —namely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >prices.</hi> The price of a given article is the approximate mathematical
                    expression of the rates, in terms of money, at which exchanges of the article
                    for money were actually made at or about a given hour on a given day. A <hi
                    rend="italic">quotation of price</hi> such as appears in a daily price list is,
                    if there has been much fluctuation, only a very rough guide to the actual rates
                    of exchange that have been the basis of the successive bargains making up the
                    day’s business. But let us suppose that the closing price each day may be
                    accepted as a fair representative of the day’s transactions, and let us further
                    suppose that we desire to obtain the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> price for
                    thirty days. Now the sum of the prices in question divided by thirty would be
                    the arithmetical mean, and its weak point would be that it made no allowance for
                    the fact that the business done on some days is much larger than that done on
                    others; in other words, it treats them as being all of equal weight. Now if, as
                    is actually the case in some markets, we have a daily account of the <hi
                    rend="italic">total quantities sold</hi> we can weight the members accurately,
                    and can then obtain their geometrical mean. There are cases in which the
                    careless use of arithmetical means misleads the student of the social organism
                    seriously. It is often comparatively easy to obtain arithmetical means, but
                    difficult to obtain geometrical means. Inferences based on the former class of
                    average should be subjected to the most rigid investigation.</p>
                <p>Before closing this short survey of the very important subject of averages or
                    means, it is needful to discuss briefly the nature of the phenomena which they
                    may safely be regarded as indicating, when they have been properly obtained.
                    Given a geometric mean of a series of numbers referring to no matter what
                    phenomenon, it is obvious that the value of the mean as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >type</hi> of the whole series will depend entirely on the extent of divergence
                    from it of the members of the series as a body. If we are told that there are in
                    a certain district 1000 men, and that their average height is 5 feet 8 inches,
                    and are told nothing further about them, we can make various hypotheses as to
                    the structure of this body from the point of view of height. It is possible that
                    they may consist of a rather large number of men about 6 feet high, and a great
                    many about 5 feet 5 inches. Or the proportions of relatively tall and short men
                    may be reversed, that is, there may be a rather large number of men about 5 feet
                    4 inches, and a moderate number of men about 5 feet 11 inches. It is also
                    possible that there may be very few men whose height is exactly 5 feet 8 inches,
                    and that the bulk of the whole body consists of two large groups—one of giants
                    and the other of dwarfs. Lastly, it is possible that 5 feet 8 inches may really
                    give a fair idea of the height of the majority of the men, which it would do if
                    (say ) 660 of them were within an inch of that height, either by excess or
                    deficiency, while of the remainder one half were all above 5 feet 9 inches and
                    the other half all below 5 feet 7 inches. This latter supposition would most
                    likely be found to be approximately correct if the men belonged to a race whose
                    average height was 5 feet 8<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0489-0466"/> inches, and if they had been collected by chance.
                    The extent of the divergence of the items composing an average from the average
                    itself may be accurately measured and expressed in percentages of the average,
                    the algebraic signs + and - being employed to indicate the direction of the
                    variation from the mean. An average may, therefore, advantageously be
                    supplemented—(1) by a figure showing what proportion of the members from which
                    it is derived differ from the average by a relatively small quantity, and (2) by
                    figures showing the maximum and minimum deviations from the average. The meaning
                    of the term “relatively small” must be considered independently in each
                    investigation. Further remarks on averages will be found in the works mentioned
                    at the conclusion of this article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prices.—</hi> Reference has already been made to the peculiar
                    class of statistical quantities known as <hi rend="italic">prices.</hi> Prices
                    in their widest sense include all figures expressing <hi rend="italic">ratios of
                    exchange.</hi> In modern society the terms of exchange are always expressed in
                    money, and the things for which money is exchanged are—(1) concrete entities
                    with physical attributes, such as iron or wheat; (2) immediate rights, such as
                    those given by interest-bearing securities of all kinds, by bills of exchange,
                    by railway or steamship contracts to carry either passengers or goods, and by
                    bargains relative to the foreign exchanges; (3) contingent rights, such as those
                    implied in policies of insurance. All these rates of exchange belong to the same
                    category, whether they are fixed within certain limits by law, as in the case of
                    railway charges, or are left to be determined by the “higgling of the market.”
                    All these cases of price may conceivably come within the operation of the
                    statistical method, but the only matter connected with price which it is
                    necessary to refer to here is the theory of the <hi rend="italic">index
                    number.</hi><hi rend="italic">Index Numbers.—</hi> The need for these became
                    conspicuous during the investigations of Tooke, Newmarch, and others into the
                    general cyclical movements of the prices of commodities; and to construct a good
                    system of these may be said to be one of the highest technical aims of the
                    statistical method. In comparing the prices of different years it was soon
                    observed that, though whole groups of articles moved upwards or downwards
                    simultaneously, they did not all move in the same proportion, and that there
                    were nearly always cases in which isolated articles or groups of articles moved
                    in the opposite direction to the majority of articles. The problem presented to
                    statisticians therefore was and is to devise a statistical expression of the
                    general movement of prices, in which all prices should be adequately
                    represented. The first rough approximation to the desired result was attained by
                    setting down the percentages representing the movements, with their proper
                    algebraic signs before them, and adding them together algebraically. The total
                    with its proper sign was then divided by the number of articles, and the
                    quotient represented the movement in the prices of the whole body of articles
                    during the period under consideration. It was soon seen, however, that this
                    procedure was fatally defective, inasmuch as it treated all prices as of equal
                    weight. Cotton weighed no more than pimento, and iron no more than umbrellas.
                    Accordingly an improvement was made in the procedure, first by giving the prices
                    of several different articles into which cotton, iron, and other important
                    commodities entered, and only one price each in the case of the minor articles,
                    and secondly by fixing on the price of some one article representing iron or
                    cotton, and multiplying it by some number selected with the view of assigning to
                    these articles their proper weights relatively to each other and to the rest.
                    The objection to both these plans is the same,—that the numbers attached to the
                    various articles or groups of articles are purely arbitrary; and of late years
                    attempts have been made to obtain what may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >natural</hi> index numbers, the most successful so far being that of Mr Robert
                    Giffen, whose index numbers are obtained from the declared values of the imports
                    or exports into or from the United Kingdom of the articles whose prices are
                    dealt with. In the case of both imports and exports Mr Giffen worked out the
                    proportion borne by the value of each article to the total value for a series of
                    years. Deducting the “unenumerated” articles, a series of numbers was thus
                    obtained which could be used as the means of weighting the prices of the
                    articles in an investigation of a movement of prices. This procedure is no doubt
                    susceptible of further improvement, like its predecessors, but it is a great
                    advance on the arbitrary systems of index numbers employed in them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Desirability of Increased Uniformity in Statistics. —</hi>
                    One of the most serious difficulties in connexion with statistical
                    investigations is the variety of the modes in which primaries of the same order
                    are obtained, as regards dates and periods. This is a matter of which all
                    persons who have occasion to use statistics are made painfully aware from time
                    to time. Some attempts have lately been made to introduce more harmony into the
                    official statistics of the United Kingdom, and some years ago a committee of the
                    Treasury sat to inquire into the matter. The committee received a good deal of
                    evidence, and presented a report, from which, however, certain members of the
                    committee dissented, preferring to express their views separately. The evidence
                    will be found very interesting by all who wish to obtain an insight into the
                    genesis of the official statistics of the country. The report and evidence were
                    published in the June number of the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Statistical
                    Society</hi> for 1881, as well as in the usual official form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The International Institute of Statistics.—</hi> The absence of
                    uniformity in statistics which is felt in England is not so marked in foreign
                    countries, where the principle of centralization in arrangements of a political
                    character is more powerful than it is here. In several Continental countries and
                    in the United States there are statistical bureaus with definite duties to
                    perform. In the United Kingdom, as already remarked, the nearest approach to a
                    central statistical office is the Commercial and Statistical Department of the
                    Board of Trade, on which the work of furnishing such statistics as are not
                    definitely recognized as within the province of some other state department
                    usually falls. Various attempts have been made to introduce more uniformity into
                    the statistics of all countries. It was with this object that statistical
                    congresses have met from time to time since 1853. An endeavour was made at the
                    congress held in 1876 at Budapest to arrange for the publication of a system of
                    international statistics, each statistical bureau undertaking a special branch
                    of the subject. The experiment was, however, foredoomed to be only a very
                    partial success, first because all countries were not then and are not yet
                    furnished with central statistical offices, and secondly because the work which
                    fell on the offices in existence could only be performed slowly, as the ordinary
                    business of the offices necessarily left them little leisure for extra work. In
                    1885, at the jubilee of the London Statistical Society, a number of eminent
                    statistical officials from all parts of the world except Germany were present,
                    and the opportunity was taken to organize an International Institute of
                    Statistics with a view to remedying the defects already ascertained to exist in
                    the arrangements made by the congresses. The only obstacle to securing a proper
                    representation of all countries was the absence of any German delegates, none of
                    the official heads of the German statistical office being allowed to
                    attend,—apparently on political grounds. Since then assurances of a satisfactory
                    kind have been given to the German Government that their servants would be in no
                    way committed to any course disapproved by that Government if they gave their
                    assistance to the institute, from the formation of which it is hoped that much
                    advantage may result. For information as to the constitution and objects of the
                    institute reference may be made to a paper by Dr F. X. von Neumann-Spallart in
