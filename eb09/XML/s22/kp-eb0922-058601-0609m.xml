                    XV. p. 320, and Plate VI.), derived from the straits which separate the
                    peninsula from Sumatra and which form so important a sea-gate between India and
                    China. The Straits Settlements are defined, by letters patent 17th June 1885, as
                    consisting of the island of Singapore (which contains the seat of government),
                    the town and province of Malacca, the territory and islands of the Dindings (off
                    Perak), the island of Penang, and Province Wellesley, with their dependencies
                    actual or prospective. The Cocos or <hi rend="smallcaps">Keeling Islands</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), formerly attached to Ceylon, were transferred to
                    the Straits Settlements in 1886. These possessions have formed a crown colony
                    since 1867, previous to which they were administered as a presidency of the
                    Indian empire. The governor, appointed for six years, is assisted by an
                    executive and a legislative council. Resident councillors are stationed at
                    Penang and Malacca, and since 1874 British residents have exercised supervision
                    at the native courts of Perak, Selangor, and Sungei Ujong, and are assisted by a
                    staff of European officials.</p>

                <p>The population, which thus was 306,775 in 1871 and 423,384 in 1881, was estimated
                    at 473,000 in 1884. The increase is solely produced by immigration of Chinese
                    and natives of India; for, while the total number of births registered in
                    Singapore, Penang, Province Wellesley, and Malacca was in the three years
                    1881-83 only 21,134, the deaths were 37,151.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The number of hospital cases, and consequently the
                    death-rate, is affected, however, by the fact that natives from the rest of the
                    peninsula, whose diseases prove beyond native skill, are often brought to the
                    colonial hospitals.</p></note> In 1883 61,206 Chinese landed at Singapore and
                    48,419 in Penang; and, though the influx of Indian coolies has been retarded by
                    the stringent protective laws of the Indian Government, the stream of
                    immigration has been steadily increasing in volume. The number of Chinese is
                    probably below the truth, as they were very reluctant to fill up the returns. In
                    1867, the date of the transfer to the crown, the colony had, it was estimated,

                    in 1868 and 2,152,700 in 1884). The expenditure in the same period increased
                    from 1,197,177 to 3,652,771 dollars. In 1868 12,400 dollars were devoted to
                    education (95,600 in 1884). Public works were credited with 146,800 dollars in
                    1868 but with 1,170,000 in 1884. The ports of the Straits Settlements are all
                    free. In 1867 the total burden was 1,237,700 tons, in 1873 2,507,000 tons, and
                    in 1883 4,290,600. The value of the united imports and exports was in 1867 about
                    £14,040,000, and in 1883 it was estimated by Sir Frederick Weld at £38,624,200.
                    The imports usually somewhat exceed the exports.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Malacca.</hi> —The territory of Malacca lies between the
                    river Linggi and the Kesang, which separate it respectively from Sungei Ujong to
                    the north-west and the Moar district of Johor to the east. To the north it
                    marches with Negri Sembilan. Forest conservancy is beginning to be carefully
                    attended to, and pepper-growing has recently been started with success at Arra
                    Kudah by A chinese settlers. Tapioca and tin are among the exports, the latter,
                    brought from the Selangor mines, being smelted in Malacca. The average
                    birth-rate in 1881-83 was 2046 and the death-rate 2642. The city of Malacca has
                    already been described, vol. xv. p. 312.</p>

                    one time part of the. Kedah territory, from which it is now separated by the
                    Kwala Muda river. Southwards it extends (since 1874) a little to the south of
                    the Krian river and marches with Perak. The boundary was rectified by treaty
                    with Siam in 1867. Butterworth is the seat of the Government headquarters. The
                    country consists for the most part of fertile plain, and the remainder, about
                    one-eleventh of the whole, is low wooded hills (highest 1843 feet). Some of the
                    low land is rich dark alluvial soil, and much of it is sandy; in the hills a
                    ferruginous sandy loam of rather poor quality prevails. Sugar-growing has long
                    been a staple industry, and tea plantations began to be formed in 1869-70.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Dindings</hi> belonged originally to the state of Perak.
                    The British territory extends some 26 miles from north to south. Though it has a
                    magnificent natural harbour, “it has not hitherto,” says Sir Frederick Weld,
                    “been a progressive district. But I think its time is at hand. It produces tin,
                    timber, and ebony, and turtles frequent the neighbouring islands.” Dinding
                    Island lies off the mouth of the river of the same name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Perak</hi> is an extensive tract of country, comprising the
                    great part of the basin of the Perak river (which runs north and south, almost
                    parallel with the coast of the peninsula, for upwards of 130 miles, excluding
                    the windings, before it turns abruptly west to the Strait) and all the basin of
                    the Beraam river. The boundary towards Patani cuts the Perak river at the rapids
                    of Jeram Panjang. The population of the states is about 110,000, among the more
                    noteworthy tribes being the Sakeis. Perak was brought iuto closer relation to
                    Britain by the treaty signed at Pankor (Pangkore) in the Dindings, 20th January
                    1874, which authorized the appointment of a British resident and assistant
                    resident. The first resident, J. W. Birch, was murdered in November 1875; but
                    British troops from India and China, under General (Sir Francis) Colborne, soon
                    suppressed the insurrectionary movement. One column crossed from Larut to Kwala
                    Kungsa and defeated the rebels at Kotah Lamah, Enggar, and Prek, and another
                    advanced from Banda Baru (where Mr Birch was buried) to Blanja, the residence of
                    the ex-sultan Ismail, and thence to Kinta on the Kinta river, the capital of
                    Perak. As it was discovered that Abdullah, the ruling sultan, had been accessory
                    to the murder of Mr Birch, he was deposed in 1877 and banished to Mahe
                    (Seychelles). The residency of Lower Perak was removed from Banda Baru to Durian
                    Sabatang, the place where the Bidor and Batang Padang join the main stream of
                    the Kungsa or Perak, and it has again been removed to Teluk Anson (Teluk Mah
                    Intan), lower down, the centre of the inland trade. The residency of Upper Perak
                    is at Kwala Kungsa. Perak has made wonderful advance since the war. Its revenue
                    was 312,875 dollars in 1877, and in 1884, at a moderate estimate, 1,435,697. In
                    1877 there was only one line of good road in the country,—from Larut through the
                    pass of Bukit Berapit to Kwala Kungsa; now large tracts have been opened up with
                    roads and bridle-paths. “Rivers have been cleared of obstructions, telegraph
                    lines laid down, court-houses, hospitals, police-stations, &amp;c., built, and a
                    line of railway (8 miles) constructed from Port Weld, the port of Larut, at
                    Teluk Kartang, where vessels drawing 13 to 15 feet can enter to Taipeng
                    (Thai-peng).” The revenue is mainly derived from a duty on tin, which is largely
                    mined in Larut, &amp;c. The mines of the Capitan China in 1883 produced to the
                    value of £105,000. Coffee and tea planting seem to promise well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Selangor</hi> lies to the south of Perak, and consists
                    mainly of the basins of the Selangor, the Klang, and the Langat, of which the
                    last two meet in a common delta to the south of 3° N. lat. Previous to 1880 the
                    seat of the British resident and staff was at Klang, at the head of 13-feet
                    navigation on the Klang river; at that date it was transferred to Kwala Lumpur,
                    at the junction of the Gombah with the Klang, the highest point reached by the
                    cargo boats which bring up provisions for the tin-miners and return with tin,
                    guttapercha, and other produce. There are tin mining settlements at Ranching,
                    Ulu Selangor, Ulu Bernam, Ulu Gombah, Ulu Klang, Ulu Langat, Sungie Patch Recko,
                    Kajang, Ampagnan, &amp;c. The mine at Ampagnan was bought for 170,000 dollars by
                    Singapore merchants. The population of Selangor (50,000,—29,000 of them Chinese)
                    is rapidly increasing by immigration from China, India, and Sumatra. Since the
                    close of the civil war (1867-74) and the acceptance of the British resident the
                    country has rapidly developed. At the mouth of the Selangor lies the town of
                    that name, with ruins of an old Dutch fort and the stone on which the sultans of
                    Selangor receive investiture. At Klang, up the Klang river, lies the principal
