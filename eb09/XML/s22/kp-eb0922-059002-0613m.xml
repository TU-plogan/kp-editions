                    Canning, Viscount</hi></label> (1786-1880), diplomatist, was the first cousin of
                    George Canning the statesman, and the youngest son of Stratford Canning, who,
                    having been disinherited for marrying beneath his rank, settled in London as a
                    merchant in Clement’s Lane, where young Canning was born 4th November 1786.
                    Shortly afterwards the father died, and the family removed to Wanstead, the boy
                    attending the village school and afterwards a school at Hackney until 1794, when
                    he went to Eton. Ultimately he became captain of the school, and he also
                    manifested his literary predilections by publishing, in conjunction with
                    Wellesley and others, a collection of essays entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Miniature.</hi> In 1805 he was elected scholar of King’s College, Cambridge,
                    and, while still attending the university, became in 1807 précis writer to his
                    cousin, who had been appointed foreign minister. At the close of the year he
                    went to Copenhagen as one of the secretaries of a special diplomatic mission,
                    and after his return he was appointed in June 1808 first secretary at
                    Constantinople. On the removal of his chief Mr Adair to Vienna in July 1810,
                    Canning remained minister plenipotentiary, making use of the opportunity to give
                    indications of that overmastering purpose and bold yet subtle diplomacy which
                    were to have such an important influence on the history of the Eastern question.
                    In 1812 he succeeded in effecting the treaty of Bucharest between Russia and
                    Turkey, which was signed on the 12th May, shortly before the arrival of his
                    successor. This was properly the inauguration of that English influence in
                    Turkey which did not cease until within recent years. The treaty was also of
                    immense immediate advantage by freeing the Russian army to act against Napoleon,
                    and on his return to England Canning was rewarded by a pension of £1200 a year.
                    He remained in London, occupying himself with literature, and contributing some
                    articles to the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> then newly founded,
                    until in May 1814 he was appointed by Lord Castlereagh minister plenipotentiary
                    to Switzerland, where he succeeded in effecting the federation of the cantons as
                    a neutral state. He returned to England in 1817, and in August 1820 was sent as
                    plenipotentiary to the United States, to arrange certain outstanding differences
                    between the States and England; but, although a convention was signed 13th March
                    1824, this was rejected by the American senate, and matters for several years
                    remained, so far as any actual arrangement was concerned, <hi rend="italic">in
                    statu quo.</hi> In October 1825 Canning was sent on a second commission to
                    Constantinople, chiefly to promote the independence of Greece, but after long
                    and complicated negotiations the attack, without the knowledge of the
                    ambassadors, on the Turkish fleet by the allies under Sir E. Codrington at
                    Navarino, 20th October 1827, caused a conference then being held to be suddenly
                    broken up, and rendered necessary the withdrawal of the ambassadors from
                    Constantinople. They, however, again met at Poros towards the close of the
                    following year, and ultimately Turkey was compelled, by the treaty of
                    Adrianople, 14th August 1829, following a short war with Russia, to loose her
                    grasp on Greece, and consent to the arrangement of a frontier limit. On his
                    return to England Canning was made G.C.B. In 1828 he had been elected to the
                    House of Commons for Old Sarum, and he sat for different boroughs until 1841,
                    when he again accepted the office of ambassador to Turkey. During the next
                    twelve years he gradually succeeded in winning the confidence of the sultan, as
                    well as awakening his wholesome awe, by convincing him, not<pb break="no"

                    Turkey, but of his sole ability to thwart the wiles of the Russian emperor.
                    There is no doubt a certain degree of exaggeration in Kinglake’s description of
                    Canning as the “Great Elchi,” at whose slightest frown the Turks were ready to
                    quail, and by whose matchless skill and coolness the emperor Nicholas was placed
                    at his wits’ end; but the consummate ability with which he managed the
                    negotiations connected with the question of the Holy Places, so as to place the
                    emperor as much as possible in the wrong, and to render his act of hostility on
                    3d July 1853—which led to the Crimean war—unjustifiable, cannot be denied.
                    During the war he retained his position at Constantinople, but at its conclusion
                    he returned in 1858 to London. In 1852 he had been raised to the peerage with
                    the title Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. His later years were spent chiefly in
                    retirement, and, except when the Eastern question came prominently into notice,
                    he took little part in political discussion. On Eastern politics he contributed
                    several papers to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nineteenth Century.</hi> He died without surviving male issue 14th August
                    1880.</p>
                <p>His essays were collected and published in 1881 under the title of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eastern Question,</hi> with a memorial preface by Dean Stanley. A
                    memoir by Stanley Lane Poole is in preparation.</p>
