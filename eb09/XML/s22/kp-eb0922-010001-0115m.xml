                    of the Sacae”) and the <hi rend="italic">Nimrúz</hi> or “meridies” of the <hi

                    lat. and 61° 0' and (including Rudbár) 62° 40' E. long. Its extreme length is
                    about 100 and its breadth varies from 70 to over 100 miles,—but the exact limits
                    are vague, and the modern signification of the name practically comprehends the
                    peninsula formed by the lower</p>
                <p>Helmand and its embouchure on the one side and the “Hámún” or “lake” on the
                    other. When British arbitration was brought to bear upon the disputed claims of
                    Persia over this country in 1872, it was found necessary to suppose two
                    territories—one compact and concentrated, which was called “Sistân Proper,” the
                    other detached and irregular, called “Outer Sistân.” Of each of these a brief
                    description will be given.</p>
                <p>1. Sistán Proper is bounded on the north by the “Nâïzâr,” or reed-bed which
                    fringes the “Hámún” or expanse; west by the Hámún itself, of which the hill
                    called “Kuh-i-Khwájah” marks the central point; south by a line shutting in
                    Sikuha and all villages and lands watered by the main Sistán Canal; and east by
                    the old bed of the Helmand, from a mile above the dam at Kohak to the mouth.
                    Kal'ah-i-nau and Rindan are among the more northerly inhabited villages. The
                    Kuh-i-Khwájah is a sufficient indication of the western side. Búrj-i-'Alam Khan
                    should be included within the southern boundary as well as Sikuha. Khwájah Ahmad
                    and Jahánabád, villages on the left bank, or west of the true bed of the
                    Helmand, denote the eastern line. The whole area is estimated at 947 square
                    miles. The fixed population may be roughly stated at 35,000,—some 20,000
                    Sistánis and 15,000 settlers,—the greater part of whom are Parsiwans, or rather,
                    perhaps, a Persian-speaking people. To the above numbers may be added 10,000
                    Baluch nomads. Taking the aggregate at 45,000, and looking at the extent of
                    country comprehended, we find nearly 48 persons to the square mile. These
                    figures are eight times in excess of the proportional result found for the whole
                    of Persia. It should be explained that the designation Sistán Proper is not
                    arbitrarily given. The territory comprehended in it is spoken of as Sistán by
                    the dwellers on the right bank of the</p>
                <p>Helmand, in contradistinction to their own lands. At the same time it could only
                    be but a fractional part—as indeed the whole country under consideration could
                    only be—of the Sistán of Persian history.</p>
                <p>Sistán Proper is an extensive tract of sand and clay alluvium, generally flat,
                    but irregular in detail. It has heaps, but no hills; bushes, but no trees,
                    unless indeed three or four tamarisks of aspiring height deserve the name; many
                    old ruins and vestiges of comparative civilization, but few monuments or relics
                    of antiquity. It is well watered by rivers and canals, and its soil is of proved
                    fertility. wheat or barley is perhaps the staple cultivation; but pease, beans,
                    oil-seeds, and cotton are also grown. Among fruits, grapes and mulberries are
                    rare, but melons and water-melons, especially the latter, are abundant. Grazing
                    and fodder are not wanting, and besides the reeds peculiar to Sistán there are
                    two grasses which merit notice,—that called <hi rend="italic">bannu,</hi> with
                    which the bed of the Hámún abounds on the south, and the taller and less salt
                    <hi rend="italic">kirta</hi> on the higher ground.</p>
                <p>2. Outer Sistán, the country on the right bank of the Helmand, and east of its
                    embouchure in the Hámún, extends more than 100 miles in length, or from a point
                    between the Charboli and Khuspas rivers north to Rudbár south. In breadth the
                    district of Chakhansúr, measuring from the old bed of the Helmand, inclusive of
                    Nad Ali, to Kadah, may be estimated at some 30 miles. It<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n116/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0116-0101"/> produces wheat and barley, melons, and perhaps a
                    few vegetables and oil seeds. Beyond the Chakhansúr limits, southward or up to
                    the Helmand, there is probably no cultivation save that obtained on the river
                    bank, and ordinarily illustrated by patches of wheat and barley with melon beds.
                    On the opposite side of the river, in addition to the cultivated portions of the
                    bank, there is a large tract extending from above <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    south of) Kohak, or the Sistán dam <hi rend="italic">(band),</hi> to the
                    gravelly soil below the mountain ranges which separate Sistán from Baluchistan
                    and Narmashir. The distance from north to south of this plain may be computed at
                    40 miles, and from east to west at 80 or 90 miles. Lands north of the Náïzár not
                    belonging to the Afghan district of Lash Juwain may also be included in Outer
                    Sistán; but it is unnecessary to make any distinction of the kind for the tract
                    marked “Hámún” on the west, where it merges into the Persian frontier. Bellew
                    states there are 1200 houses in Chakhansúr. This can hardly apply to the fort in
                    which the sardar lives, and the comparatively few houses outside, bearing that
                    name, and noticed by Major Lovett on his visit in 1872. Nor did there then
                    appear to be any other centres of population in the district, excepting perhaps
                    Kadah on the eastern limit. The inhabitants are Sistánis or Parsiwans, Baluch
                    nomads, and Afghans. Between the Kohak <hi rend="italic">band</hi> and Rudbár
                    they are mainly Baluch. Most of the less nomad tribesmen are Sanjuráni and Toki,
                    the sardars jealously claiming the former appellation.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable geographical feature of Sistán generally, in the modern
                    acceptation of the term, is the Hámún, or expanse, which stretches far and wide
                    on the north, west, and south, but is for a great part of the year dry or a mere
                    swamp. In the early spring, at which period the present writer was in the
                    locality, the existence of a lake could only be certified by pools or hollows of
                    water formed at the mouths of the principal feeders, such as the Khash Rúd on
                    the north-east, the Farah Rud on the north-west, and the Helmand, where its old
                    bed terminates at no great distance from the Khash Rúd. Bellew describes the
                    aspect of that portion of Sistán limited to the actual basin of the Helmand as
                    indicating the former existence of a lake which covered with its waters a
                    considerable area. On the north this tract has been raised to a higher level
                    than the remainder by the deposit at the mouths of rivers of the solid matter
                    brought down. It is still, however, from 200 to 500 feet below the level of the
                    desert cliffs that bound it, and which at some former period formed the shores
                    of the lake; and it is from 50 or 60 to 200 feet above the level of the beds of
                    the rivers now flowing into the existing Hámún. The tract thus raised by
                    depositions in the bed of the former lake, writes the same authority, is now the
                    inhabited district of Sistán, and contains the Hámún, a great sedge-grown swamp,
                    the last relic of the lake itself. To the south of the Hámún and inhabited tract
                    of Sistán is the Zarah hollow. It extends for about 100 miles to the Sarhad
                    Mountains. Called by the natives God-i-Zarah, or the hollow of Zarah, it is
                    described as a wide and circular depression sloping gently up to the bounding
                    hills and desert cliffs. It receives the drainage of these in its central and
                    deepest hollow, which, except in seasons of drought, is more or less marshy. It
                    is connected along the western border of the area with the existing Hámún by the
                    Sar-shila, a great drainage gully through which runs the superfluous flood of
                    the Hámún.</p>
                <p>The water-supply of Sistan is about as uncertain as that of Sind, though the
                    general inclination to one bank, the left, is more marked in the Helmand than in
                    the Indus. Therefore the boundary lines given must be received with slight
                    reservation. It is easy to see that a good year of inundation extends the
                    borders of the so-called lake to within the Náïzár; and there are well-defined
                    beds of dry canals intersecting the country, which prove the existence formerly
                    of an extensive water-system no longer prevailing. The main canal of Sistán,
                    confounded by some writers with the parent river, bears the waters of the
                    Helmand westward into the heart of the country. They are diverted by means of a
                    large <hi rend="italic">band</hi> or dam, known indifferently as the “Amir’s,”
                    the “Sistân,” or the “Kohak” <hi rend="italic">band.</hi> It is constructed of
                    horizontally laid tamarisk branches, earth, and perpendicular stakes, and
                    protected from damage by a fort on the left and a tower on the right bank of the
                    river. Although this diversion of the stream may be an artificial development of
                    a natural channel, and undoubtedly dates from a period long prior to recent
                    Persian occupation, it appears that the later arrangements have been more
                    maturely and better organized than those carried on by the pre decessors of the
                    amir of Káian. The towns of Deshtak, Chelling, Burj-i-'Alam Khan, Bahramabad,
                    Kimmak, and others of less note are actually on the banks of this main canal.
                    Moreover, it is the indirect means of supplying water to almost every town and
                    village in Sistán Proper, feeding as it does a network of minor canals, by which
                    a system of profuse irrigation is put in force, which, with an industrious and a
                    contented population, should be productive of most extensive grain cultivation.
                    To consider the main canal as the river itself is a theory which a brief
                    inspection of the locality seems quite to disprove. On the one hand we have a
                    comparatively narrow passage abruptly turning to the westward, on the other a
                    broad and well-defined river-bed prolonged in the old direction, into which the
                    waters would at all times flow unrestrained but for an artificial embankment.
                    Whatever arguments, however, may be used on this head, the larger bed is assumed
                    to be the original Helmand for purposes of territorial limitation.</p>
                <p>Provisions in Sistán are, as a rule, sufficient, though sheep and oxen are
                    somewhat poor. Bread is cheap and good, being procurable to natives at less than
                    a halfpenny the pound. Vegetables are scarce, and rice is chiefly obtained from
                    Herat. The inundated lands abound with water-fowl. Partridges and sand-grouse
                    are occasionally seen. River fish are plentiful enough, but confined to one
                    species, the barbel.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Sistán are mainly composed of Kaiyánis, descendants of the
                    ancient rulers of the land; Sarbandis and Shahrakis, tribes supposed to have
                    consisted originally of immigrants from western Persia; and Baluchis of the
                    Nharui and Sanjurani (Toki) clans. Bellew separates the “Sistânis”; but it is a
                    question whether this term is not in a large measure applied to fixed
                    inhabitants of the country, whatever their descent and nationality. For
                    instance, an old Shahraki guide to the Sistán Mission of 1872 persisted in being
                    a “Sistâni”; and, if his definition be accepted, the outside element must be
                    confined to Baluchis and modern settlers only.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The ancient Drangiana (Zaraya, Darañka, “lake
                    land”) received the name of “land of the Sacae” after this country was
                    permanently occupied by the “Scythians” or Sacae, who overran Iran in 128 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii.
                    pp. 594 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.). It was included in the Sásánian empire, and
                    then in the empire of the caliphs. About 860 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    when it had undergone many changes of government under lieutenants of the
                    Baghdad caliphs, or bold adventurers acting on their own account, Ya'kúb b.
                    Láith made it the seat of his power. In 901 it fell under the power of the
                    Sámánids, and a century later into that of the Ghaznavids. An invasion of
                    Jaghatais and the irruption into its richer lands by Timúr are salient points in
                    the history of Sistán prior to the Safawid conquest (1508). Under this dynasty
                    for more than two centuries, or up to 1722, Sistan remained more or less a
                    Persian dependency. At the time of the Afghan invasion of Mir Mahmud (1722),
                    Malik Muhammad Kaiyáni was the resident ruler in Sistán, and by league with the
                    invader or other intrigue he secured for himself that particular principality
                    and a great part of Khurasan also. He was slain by Nadir Kuli Khan, the general
                    of Shah Tahmasp, who afterwards, as Nadir Shah, became possessor of Sistán as
                    part of his Persian dominions. Shortly after the death of Nadir (1751) Sistán
                    passed, together with other provinces, into the hands of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the
                    first sovereign in a united Afghanistan. On the death of Ahmad Shah in 1773 the
                    country became a recognized bone of contention, not so much between Persians and
                    Afghans as between Herat and Kandahar; but eventually the internal dissensions
                    of Afghanistan gave Persia the desired opportunity; and by a steady course of
                    intrigue and encroachment she managed to get within her grasp the better lands
                    on the left bank of the lower Helmand and something on the right bank besides.
                    When the British arbitrator appeared on the scene in the beginning of 1872,
                    though compelled to admit the shah’s possession of what has been called “Sistán
                    Proper,” he could in fairness insist on the evacuation of Nad Ali, Kala Fath,
                    and all places occupied on the right bank by Persian troops; and furthermore he
                    left to the Afghans both sides of the river Helmand from the dam of Kohak to its
                    elbow west of Rudbár. For the precise boundary see <hi rend="smallcaps"
