                    It is the polymorphism of the individual: that is, the life-history is usually
                    complex, the individual assuming different forms in various stages of its
                    life-history. Thus, in the great majority of plants there is a well-marked
                    alternation of generations,—an alternation, that is, of a sexual form, the <hi
                    rend="italic">gametophyte,</hi> with an asexual form, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sporophyte</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reproduction,</hi> vol. χχ. p. 423).
                    And not only so, but in many cases one or other of these generations presents a
                    number of different forms. Hence the true affinities of any individual cannot be
                    regarded as satisfactorily ascertained unless its life-history is fully known;
                    and, since in most cases the various forms are perfectly separate, and often
                    quite dissimilar, there is difficulty in obtaining all the information necessary
                    for determining the true systematic position of a plant,—a difficulty which has
                    not yet been overcome in very many cases.</p>
                <p>Comparatively little light is thrown on the affinities of existing plants by the
                    information which has been accumulated with regard to the extinct fossil forms.
                    In no case can the genealogy of an existing plant be traced as in the case of
                    the horse among animals (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom).</hi></p>
                <p>The vegetable kingdom is usually divided into the four following sub-kingdoms
                    :—I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Thallophyta;</hi> II. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bryophyta</hi>; III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pteridophyta</hi>; IV. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phanerogamia (Sper-maphyta).</hi></p>
                <p>All of these, except some <hi rend="italic">Thallophyta,</hi> present a more or
                    less clearly marked alternation of generations. In all cases the more
                    conspicuous form is considered to be “the plant.” Thus, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thallophyta</hi> generally the plant is the gametophyte, the sporophyte being
                    comparatively inconspicuous and in many cases merely an appendage on the
                    gametophyte; in the <hi rend="italic">Bryophyta</hi> likewise the gametophyte is
                    the plant, the sporophyte being an appendage on the gametophyte. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Phanerogamia</hi>
                    the plant is the sporophyte, the gametophyte being comparatively inconspicuous.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> the gametophyte is still an
                    independent organism; but in ascending from the lower to the higher forms it
                    becomes more and more reduced. In the <hi rend="italic">Phanerogamia</hi> the
                    gametophyte is still further reduced and becomes a mere appendage on the
                    sporophyte.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sub-Kingdom</hi> I. THALLOPHYTA.</p>
                <p>This sub-kingdom includes the most lowly organized of plants. They are
                    characterized by the total absence, or the imperfection, of that differentiation
                    of the body into root, stem, and leaf which is so marked a feature in the higher
                    plants, and by the simplicity of their internal structure, especially by the
                    absence of woody vascular tissue. In those <hi rend="italic">Thallophyta</hi>
                    which present an alternation of generations the gametophyte is generally the
                    more conspicuous, constituting the plant. The gametophyte is commonly capable of
                    producing spores, not only sexually, but also asexually.</p>
                <p>The sub-kingdom is naturally divided into two main classes, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Algae</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sea-Weeds</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fungi,</hi> to which may be added, as a subsidiary group, the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Lichens.</hi> It is becoming usual to regard the <hi
                    rend="italic">Algae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> as distinct
                    sub-kingdoms; but it is preferable, as they have so much in common, to continue
                    to regard them as classes of the sub-kingdom <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thallophyta.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Class</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Algae.</hi> —There is so much variety in the form and structure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Algae</hi> (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Algae)</hi> that no
                    more precise definition of them can be given than that they are Thallophytes
                    which contain chlorophyll (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> vol. xix.
                    p. 52). Though they characteristically live in water, this is by no means
                    universally the case, for the natural habitat of many of them is damp soil. All
                    <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi> contain chlorophyll, but many of them contain other
                    colouring-matters in addition,—a feature which forms a convenient basis for
                    classification. On this basis the <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi> are classified
                    into the four following sub-classes :—</p>
                <p>I. Cyanophyceae, containing a bluish colouring-matter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >phycocyanin,</hi> and having a blue-green colour.</p>
                <p>II. Chlorophyceae, green <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> containing no
                    colouring-matter, except chlorophyll and its derivatives.</p>
                <p>III. Phaeophyceae, containing a yellow or brown colouring-matter, <hi
                    rend="italic">phycophaein,</hi> and having a brown colour.</p>
                <p>IV. Rhodophyceae, containing a red colouring-matter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >phyco</hi><hi rend="italic">erythrin,</hi> and having a red or purple
                    colour.</p>
                <p>These four sub-classes are by no means co-extensive. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanophyceae</hi> include only very simple forms; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chlorophyceae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phaeophyceae</hi> include a series
                    of forms from the simplest to the most complex; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhodophyceae</hi> include only forms which, though their vegetative structure
                    is frequently very simple, are comparatively highly developed as regards their
                    reproductive organs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-Class I.</hi> Cyanophyceae, or Blue-Green <hi rend="italic"
                    >Algae.—</hi> The body may consist of a single, more or less nearly spherical
                    cell, as in most of the <hi rend="italic">Chroococcaceae (e.g.,
                    Gloeocapsa),</hi> or it may be a multicellular layer one cell thick <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Merismopedia),</hi> or it may be filamentous, consisting of
                    a single row of cells, as in <hi rend="italic">Riυularia, Nostoc,
                    Oscillaria.</hi> When the body is filamentous, it sometimes presents a
                    distinction of base and apex, as in <hi rend="italic">Rivularia</hi>; and it is
                    frequently branched, the branching being either spurious <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., Scytonema)</hi> or true (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Sirosiphon).</hi> In
                    most cases growth and cell-division go on in all the cells of the body, but in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scyto-nemeae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sirosiphoneae</hi>
                    only at the apices. A characteristic feature of the sub-class is the more or
                    less bulky mucilaginous cell-wall which invests the cells and filaments.</p>
                <p>Reproduction is mainly effected in a purely vegetative manner. In the unicellular
                    forms each cell-division necessarily leads to the formation of new individuals.
                    In the flattened forms <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Merismopedia),</hi> when the
                    body reaches a certain limit of size, it simply breaks up into a number of
                    separate portions. In the filamentous forms the body is marked out into segments
                    by inert cells, termed <hi rend="italic">heterocysts,</hi> which are quite
                    different in appearance from the living cells of the filament. Eventually these
                    segments, termed <hi rend="italic">hormogonia,</hi> separate, and, escaping from
                    the mucilaginous matrix, develop by growth and cell-division into new
                    individuals. In many cases special reproductive cells, <hi rend="italic"
                    >spores,</hi> are developed. Each spore is formed from a single cell of the
                    body, which surrounds itself with a thick firm wall of its own. It is probable
                    that ciliated spores, <hi rend="italic">zoospores,</hi> are produced, but the
                    existing observations on this point are inconclusive. There is no evidence of
                    the existence of any form of sexual reproduction in this group.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> are divided into a number of orders
                    :—</p>
                <p>Order 1. <hi rend="italic">Chroococcaceae.</hi> Order 4. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rivulariaceae.</hi><hi rend="italic">,, 2. Nostocaceae.</hi>,, 5. <hi
                    rend="italic">Scytonemeae.</hi></p>
                <p>„ 3. <hi rend="italic">Oscillariaceae.</hi>,, 6. <hi rend="italic">Sirosiphoneae
                    (Stigonemeae).</hi></p>
                <p>It is doubtful to what extent these orders really represent distinct forms; for
                    there is some evidence that certain <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> assume
                    the different forms characteristic of several of these orders at various stages
                    of their development and under various external conditions: in other words,
                    some, at least, of the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> are polymorphic, and
                    this necessarily renders their classification difficult.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizomycetes (Fungi)</hi> in many respects, as, for instance, in their general
                    structure, in their simple vegetative reproduction and in their spore formation,
                    in the production of a bulky mucilaginous matrix, and in their polymorphism. On
                    these grounds they are frequently placed along with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizomycetes</hi> in a distinct class under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizophyta.</hi> But this arrangement does not seem to secure any special
                    advantage. It is simpler to regard the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Schizomycetes</hi> as parallel groups, the one belonging
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> the other to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fungi.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sub-Class IL</hi> Chlorophyceae.—The body may
                    consist of a single cell <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Protococcoideae),</hi> or it
                    may be multinucleate and unseptate <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Siphoneae),</hi> or
                    septate and therefore multicellular <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Characeae).</hi> It
                    presents all degrees of morphological differentiation: thus, it may be spherical
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">Haematococcus</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volvox),</hi> or flattened (as in <hi rend="italic">Ulva),</hi> or filamentous
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">Spirogyra, Ulothrix,</hi> &amp;c. ), with a
                    differentiation of root and shoot (as in <hi rend="italic">Oedogonium);</hi> or
                    it may even present rudimentary differentiation into stem, leaf, and root, as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Siphoneae (e.g., Caulerpa)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Characeae.</hi> The structure of the body is peculiar in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrodictyeae,</hi> being composed of a number of originally separate cells;
                    such a body is termed a <hi rend="italic">coenobium.</hi></p>
                <p>Vegetative multiplication, though not universal, is not uncommon in this
                    sub-class. Reproduction by means of asexually-produced spores is very general,
                    and the spores are commonly ciliated zoospores. A sexual process has been
                    observed in members of every order of this sub-class. It consists either in the
                    fusion of similar sexual cells, when it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >isogamous</hi>; or a large non-motile <pb break="no"

                    motile male cell (antherozoid), when it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >oogamous.</hi> The isogamous process usually takes place between free-swimming
                    ciliated cells (<hi rend="italic">planogametes)</hi>; but in the group of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Conjugates</hi> it takes place between gametes which are not
                    set free into the water and are not ciliated (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reproduction).</hi> In those <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> in which both
                    sexual and asexual spore-formation occurs, there is generally a distinction of
                    sexual and asexual forms, so that the life-history presents an alternation of
                    generations. Thus, in <hi rend="italic">Acetabularia</hi> the plant is the
                    sporophyte, producing asexually non-motile spores, which on germination give
                    rise to sexual reproductive cells or gametes. Each of these spores represents a
                    sexual form or gametophyte. Again, in <hi rend="italic">Coleochaete</hi> the
                    plant is the gametophyte, producing the sexual organs, the sporophyte being
                    represented by a small flattened plate of cells, developed from the fertilized
                    female cell or oospore, which never produces any sexual organs, but only
                    spores.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> may be classified as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 1. Protococcoideae.—</hi> Unicellular plants; the body
                    frequently spherical and unattached, but presenting in some forms a distinction
                    of base and apex, and then it is attached by the base. Reproduction by
                    vegetative division, or by zoospores, or by a sexual process, the sexual cells
                    being similar planogametes. This order may be divided into two families,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protococcaceae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Palmellaceae,</hi>
                    the distinction being that in the latter the cellwalls are swollen and
                    mucilaginous, so that the cells are held together, whereas in the former the
                    cells are free. Vegetative multiplication by division is universal in the <hi

                <p>The distinction of the genera, and to some extent also that of the orders, is
                    rendered difficult in many cases by polymorphism. For instance, it has been
                    ascertained that many plants which have been referred to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protococcoideae</hi> are simply forms of some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confervoideae, Siphoneae,</hi> &amp;c.; and similarly some of the <hi

                    that each of the above orders includes some autonomous forms.</p>
                <p>With regard to the affinities and phylogeny of the orders of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chlorophyceae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Protoccoideae</hi> must be taken as
                    the starting-point from which the other orders have sprung, their evolution
                    having taken place in various directions. Beginning with the simple spherical
                    <hi rend="italic">Protococcaceae,</hi> the origin of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volvocineae</hi> from these by cell-division can be readily traced through <hi

                    members of this order—the <hi rend="italic">Cladophoreae</hi> —and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphoneae</hi> is indicated by the multinucleate cells of the

                    really belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Confervoideae,</hi> closely resembles
                    some of the <hi rend="italic">Siphoneae</hi> in its general habit. The phylogeny
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Characeae</hi> is obscure, but it is probable that they

                    rend="italic">Cladophoreae.</hi> It is of interest to note that the large cells

                <p><hi rend="italic">Sub-Class III.</hi> Phaeophyceae.—The form of the body is very
                    various; it may consist of a single cell; when multicellular it may be
                    filamentous and. branched, or a flattened expansion, or cylindrical or
                    vesicular, hollow or solid. It presents also various degrees of morphological
                    differentiation: in some forms it is quite undifferentiated; in others it
                    presents a differentiation of base and apex, and is then attached by the base;
                    in others it presents indications of differentiation into root, stem, and leaf.
                    Vegetative multiplication is common only in the lowest forms; in the higher it
                    occurs in some cases, and is effected by the abstriction of modified members of
                    the parent, termed <hi rend="italic">gemmae.</hi> The existence of a sexual
                    process has been ascertained in several forms; but in many others further
                    investigation is required to determine its presence or absence. In those forms
                    in which it occurs it may be either isogamous or oogamous; the isogamous process
                    may take place between free-swimming gametes, or between gametes which are not
                    free-swimming or ciliated. The life-history of the plants of this group is
                    imperfectly known; but it has been ascertained that in some there is, and in
                    others there is not, an alternation of generations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Phaeophyceae</hi> may be classified as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 1. Diatomaceae.—</hi> Unicellular plants, either free, or
                    connected into filaments or masses by mucilage. Reproduction, vegetative by

                    >auxospores)</hi>; or sexual isogamous by the fusion of non-ciliated gametes.
                    The cell-wall is impregnated with silica.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 2. Syngeneticae.—</hi> Body unicellular, the cells being
                    held together by mucilage. Reproduction by division and by asexually-produced
                    spores. The order includes the two forms, <hi rend="italic">Chromophyton</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Hydrurus.</hi> The former is distinguished by being
                    unattached and by the motility of its spores, which have a single long cilium.
                    <hi rend="italic">Hydrurus</hi> grows attached, and the spores are not
                    motile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 3. Phaeosporeae. —</hi> Multicellular plants; the body is
                    filamentous and branched or flattened, always presenting differentiation of base
                    and apex, and in some cases more or less well-marked differentiation into root,
                    stem, and leaf, usually attached by the base. Reproduction, vegetative by gemmae
                    or by means of asexually-produced zoospores, or by a sexual process which is
                    essentially isogamous, the gametes being ciliated, but in the higher forms
                    tending to become oogamous. The principal families of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaeosporeae</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Ectocarpeae, Sphacelarieae,
                    Mesogloeaceae, Desmarestieae, Scyto-siphoneae, Cutleriaceae,</hi> and <hi

                    >{polysiphonous),</hi> as in the <hi rend="italic">Mesogloeaceae</hi>; or they
                    may be polysiphon-ous with a more or less well-developed cortical layer, as in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sphacelarieae,</hi> in which case there is also a large
                    apical cell. The structure of the <hi rend="italic">Desmarestieae (e.g.,
                    Desmarestia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arthrocladia)</hi> is similar to that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sphacelarieae,</hi> but the growing point is not apical,
                    as in the <hi rend="italic">Sphacelarieae,</hi> but intercalary, as in the <hi

                    Cladostephus</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Sphacelarieae)</hi> there is an
                    indication of the differentiation of the shoot into stem and leaf. The type of
                    structure obtaining in the <hi rend="italic">Scytosiphoneae, Cutleriaceae,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Laminarieae</hi> is that of a flattened expansion of
                    parenchymatous tissue, though in the <hi rend="italic">Laminarieae</hi> there is
                    a certain degree of histological differentiation, as is indicated by the
                    presence of elongated cells forming structures resembling the sieve-tubes of the
                    vascular plants. In some of the <hi rend="italic">Scytosiphoneae</hi> there is a
                    large internal cavity, so that the body presents a cylindrical or vesicular
                    form. Vegetative reproduction by gemmae is only known in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sphacelarieae.</hi> Reproduction by means of asexually-produced spores
                    (zoospores) is known to occur in the majority of the <hi rend="italic"

                    is no indication of any other kind of polymorphism. In those forms in which the

                    >Bangiaceae,</hi> consisting only of eight spore mother-cells. The principal
                    orders of the <hi rend="italic">Florideae</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Bangiaceae,
                    Lemaneaceae, Nemalieae, Ceramiaceae, Corallineae, Rhodomelaceae,
                    Cryptonemiaceae, Rhodymeniaceae, Wran-geliaccae, Squamariaceae,
                    Sphaerococcaccae.</hi></p>
                <p>With regard to the life-history of the <hi rend="italic">Florideae,</hi> it is
                    generally considered to present a well-marked alternation of generations, the
                    plant being the gametophyte, the fructification (cystocarp) formed in
                    consequence of fertilization being the sporophyte. Further polymorphism has been
                    detected in the genera <hi rend="italic">Lemanea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Batracho-spermum.</hi> Here the carpospore does not at once give rise to the
                    plant, but to a filamentous or flattened body, which in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Batracho-spermum</hi> reproduces itself by spores, and from which the parent
                    form springs as lateral branches. This filamentous form appears to be identical
                    with species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Chantransia</hi>; it is therefore
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">Chantransia-</hi> form <hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mutual Affinities and Phylogeny of Sub-Classes of
                    Algae.</hi></p>
                <p>Comparison of the four sub-classes shows that, whereas the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chlorophyceae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Phaeophyceae</hi> present two
                    fairly complete series of parallel forms, ranging from unicellular
                    undifferentiated to multicellular more or less highly differentiated organisms,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> consist only of comparatively simple
                    forms in which sexual reproduction is unknown, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhodophyceae</hi> of comparatively complex forms in all of which a sexual
                    process obtains. It has been suggested by Cohn, Berthold, and others that there
                    is a close relation between the lowest <hi rend="italic">Rhodophyceae
                    (Bangia)</hi> and the higher filamentous <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae
                    (Scytonemeae, Sirosiphoneae),</hi> and that possibly the latter may have been
                    derived from the former. On this view the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Rhodophyceae,</hi> taken together, constitute a series
                    which is on a level with those of the <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> and
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Phaeophyceae.</hi> On comparing these three series
                    together, it will be observed that they present a general correspondence, in
                    that the main types of form are to be found in all. Thus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chroococcaceae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palmellaceae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Syngeneticae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaeophyceae</hi> are corresponding groups; similarly, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confervoideae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> correspond to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ectocarpeae</hi> and other filamentous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaeophyceae,</hi> and to various forms of <hi rend="italic">Rhodophyceae,</hi>
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Bangia, Porphyra, Griffithsia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Callithamnion;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chara
                    {Chlorophyceae)</hi> resembles, at least in its vegetative structure, such forms
                    as <hi rend="italic">Cladostephus (Phaeophyceae)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polysiphonia {Rhodophyceae).</hi> There are, however, forms belonging to some
                    of the subclasses which have no representatives in others. Thus the orders <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphoneae, Volvocineae, Hydrodictyeae,</hi> belonging to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chlorophyceae,</hi> are unrepresented in the other sub-classes,
                    and this is true also of the <hi rend="italic">Fucaceae</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laminarieae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Phaeophyceae.</hi>
                    The Conjugate <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> also form a peculiar group,
                    the only corresponding forms being the <hi rend="italic">Diatomaceae
                    {Phaeophyceae),</hi> which present many points of resemblance to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Desmidieae.</hi></p>
                <p>With regard to the phylogeny of the <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> the possible
                    derivation of the <hi rend="italic">Rhodophyceae</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanophyceae</hi> has already been pointed out. Assuming this, there are three
                    series of <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi> closely allied in their origin, in each
                    of which evolution has proceeded on more or less divergent lines, thus leading
                    to the development of a number of corresponding forms in the three series. It is
                    not impossible that the <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaeophyceae</hi> may also have sprung from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanophyceae,</hi> not, like the <hi rend="italic">Rhodophyceae,</hi> from the
                    higher forms, but from the lower. But, if the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyanophyceae</hi> be regarded, not as primitive, but as degenerate, forms—and
                    for this view there are good grounds—then the simpler <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chlorophyceae</hi> are probably to be regarded as the forms from which the
                    others have been derived.</p>

                    >Chytridiaceae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Entomophthoreae,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancylisteae,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gymnoasceae,</hi> may
                    be given. The <hi rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> are extremely simple <hi
                    rend="italic">Fungi,</hi> consisting in some forms of a single spherical cell
                    and in others of a small mycelium. The <hi rend="italic">Entomophthoreae</hi>
                    have a well-developed mycelium, which, unlike that of most <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phycomycetes,</hi> is septate. The <hi rend="italic">Ancylisteae</hi> are
                    merely the simplest forms of the <hi rend="italic">Oomycetes.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Gymnoasceae</hi> are characterized by the simple structure of
                    their fructification, the asci (or, in some cases, the single ascus) not being
                    surrounded by an investment of sterile tissue. This group includes typical
                    forms, such as <hi rend="italic">Gymnoascus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erem-ascus,</hi> as well as aberrant forms, such as <hi rend="italic">Exoascus,
                    Saccharomyces,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Affinities and Phylogeny of Sub-Classes of
                    Fungi.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Myxomycetes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schizomycetes</hi> are so peculiar that they cannot be connected in any way
                    with the other sub-classes of <hi rend="italic">Fungi.</hi> Beginning, then,
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Zygomycetes,</hi> there can be no doubt that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> are closely connected with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mucorini</hi> by such forms as <hi rend="italic">Polyphagus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Zygochytrium,</hi> and with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancylisteae</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Oomycetes.</hi> On the other hand,
                    they are connected with the <hi rend="italic">Ustilagineae</hi> (especially <hi
                    rend="italic">Protomyces)</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Clado-chytrium.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Entomophthoreae</hi> seem to be most nearly related to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mucorini.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Ancylisteae</hi> are closely
                    related to the <hi rend="italic">Peronosporeae</hi> (especially <hi
                    rend="italic">Pythium),</hi> and these again to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saprolegnieae.</hi> Coming now to the <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes,</hi> there
                    is an obvious similarity between the simpler <hi rend="italic">Gymnoasceae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Mucorini.</hi> Thus in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eremascus</hi> the sexual organs are quite similar, and the sexual process is
                    one of conjugation, as in the <hi rend="italic">Mucorini</hi>; but there is this
                    difference, that the product of the sexual process in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eremascus</hi> is an ascus, whereas in the <hi rend="italic">Mucorini</hi> it
                    is a zygospore (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reproduction).</hi> Those <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascomycetes</hi> which, like <hi rend="italic">Pyronema,</hi> have
                    differentiated sexual organs, show some resemblance to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oomycetes.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Uredineae</hi> appear to be closely
                    connected with the <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes</hi> on the one hand, the
                    aecidium being homologous with the apothecium, and on the other hand with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tremellini</hi> among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Basidiomycetes,</hi> through the Tremelloid <hi rend="italic">Uredineae
                    (Leptopuccinieae),</hi> which have lost their aecidia, possessing only asexually
                    - produced spores (teleutospores). The <hi rend="italic">Hymenomycetes</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gasteromycetes</hi> appear to form two parallel series
                    starting from the <hi rend="italic">Tremellini.</hi></p>
                <p>In attempting to express these relations in terms of phylogeny, the first
                    question which arises is as to whether or not the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chytridiaceae</hi> are to be taken as the primitive forms. It is possible to
                    regard them, not as primitive forms, but as degraded <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mucorini,</hi> their degradation being due to their aquatic habit; but there
                    are no conclusive grounds for this assumption. Then there is the question as to
                    the origin of the <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes.</hi> De Bary inclines to the
                    opinion that they are derived from the <hi rend="italic">Oomycetes</hi>
                    (especially <hi rend="italic">Peronospora),</hi> on account of the similarity of
                    the sexual organs of such <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">Podosphaera</hi> to those of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peronosporeae.</hi> But how, on this view, is the development of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascomycetes</hi> with similar sexual organs to be accounted for?
                    It seems more reasonable to trace the <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes</hi> back
                    through <hi rend="italic">Eremascus</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Mucorini,</hi>
                    and to assume that the differentiation of the sexual organs arose in the
                    Ascomycetous series. The following scheme expresses the phylogeny of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fungi</hi> as suggested in the foregoing remarks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Affinities of Fungi with Algae.</hi></p>
                <p>With the exception of the <hi rend="italic">Basidiomycetes,</hi> the sub-classes
                    of <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> present resemblances to various forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">Algae,</hi> as might be expected, for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fungi</hi> must have sprung from the <hi rend="italic">Algae.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Myxomycetes</hi> resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrodictyeae,</hi> in that the body (plasmodium) is a coenobium, formed by the
                    aggregation of originally separate cells. The similarity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schizomycetes</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi> has
                    been already mentioned (p. 125). The <hi rend="italic">Phycomycetes</hi>
                    resemble the <hi rend="italic">Siphoneae</hi> in their typically unseptate
                    multinucleate structure; but the <hi rend="italic">Mucorini</hi> approach the
                    Conjugate <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Oomycetes</hi>
                    the oogamous <hi rend="italic">Siphoneae,</hi> in the sexual process. The
                    simpler <hi rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> closely resemble the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protococcaceae</hi> in their general form, as also in the
                    production of ciliated zoospores. The <hi rend="italic">Ascomycetes,</hi>
                    especially those in which male cells (spermatia) are formed, and probably also
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aecidiomycetes,</hi> resemble the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhodo-phyceae</hi> in many important features. In both groups the female organ
                    contains no distinctly differentiated female cell (oosphere); and the effect of
                    fertilization is to cause the female organ to grow into a sporogenous
                    fructification (apothecium, cystocarp), which constitutes the asexual generation
                    or sporophyte in the life-history.</p>
                <p>With regard to the derivation of the <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Algae,</hi> it appears that there are at least two distinct
                    origins. The <hi rend="italic">Schizomycetes</hi> doubtless arose from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyanophyceae</hi>; but, as pointed out above, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Schizomycetes</hi> cannot be regarded as having given rise to
                    higher forms of <hi rend="italic">Fungi.</hi> These sprang independently from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi>; and probably the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chytridiaceae</hi> were derived from the <hi rend="italic">Protococcaceae</hi>;
                    and from the <hi rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> the higher forms were
                    developed as indicated in the above sketch of the phylogeny of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fungi,</hi> the evolution of the <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi>
                    proceeding along much the same lines as that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Algae,</hi> and thus giving rise to forms which have their representatives in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Algae,</hi> and terminating in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Basidiomycetes,</hi> which are altogether and peculiarly Fungal. The origin of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protococcaceae</hi> is suggested by the fact that many of the latter are
                    “endophytic”: that is, they inhabit the tissues of higher plants; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chytridiaceae</hi> may be regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protococcaceae</hi> which have become truly parasitic, and have consequently
                    lost their chlorophyll.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bryophyta</hi> may be characterized as plants which present
                    a definite alternation of generations, the plant being the gametophyte and the
                    fructification or sporogonium the sporophyte. The sporophyte is not independent,
                    but remains permanently attached to the gametophyte. The shoot of the
                    gametophyte is sometimes thalloid; but more frequently it is differentiated into
                    stem and leaf. The shoot of the sporophyte is not differentiated into stem and
                    leaf, though there is in some cases an indication of such differentiation. The
                    gametophyte commonly reproduces its like by means of gemmae; the female organ is
                    an archegonium. The <hi rend="italic">Bryophyta</hi> are divided into two
                    classes— the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hepaticae</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Liverworts</hi> and the MUSCI or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mosses.</hi> (For details
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Muscineae.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Mutual Affinities and
                    Phylogeny of Mosses and Liverworts.</hi></p>
                <p>In consequence of the well-marked alternation of generations in these classes, it
                    is essential to trace their resemblances in both generations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a. Gametophyte</hi> (plant).—The higher Liverworts (foliose <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermannieae)</hi> resemble the Mosses in that the shoot is
                    differentiated into stem and leaf; but there is this general difference, that
                    the shoot of these Liverworts has dorsi-ventral symmetry, whereas that of the
                    Mosses has radial symmetry. The connecting form is afforded by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haplomitrium,</hi> which alone among the foliose Liverworts has radial
                    symmetry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">b. Sporophyte</hi> (sporogonium).—The main differences between
                    the sporogonium of the Liverworts and that of the Mosses are these: the
                    structure of the sporogonium is simpler in the Liverworts than it is in the
                    Mosses; in the former it usually has no columella and produces elaters, whereas
                    in the latter a columella is always present, and there are no elaters. In the
                    Liverworts the sporogonium remains enclosed in the enlarged venter of the
                    archegonium (calyptra) until the spores are ripe, but in most Mosses the
                    developing sporogonium bursts the calyptra at an early stage. A connecting form
                    is afforded by the sporogonium of <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi> (Liverwort),
                    which has a columella and bears stomata like the sporogonia of the Mosses, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n144/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0144-0129"/> and in which the elaters are rudimentary. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphagnum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Archidium</hi> among Mosses
                    resemble the Liverworts in that the sporogonium is enclosed in the calyptra
                    until near maturity.</p>
                <p>Although there are so many points of resemblance between them, there is no
                    evidence to show that the Mosses and Liverworts form one continuous series. This
                    might perhaps be assumed if the gametophyte alone were considered; but it cannot
                    when the sporophyte is taken into account as well. The more important features
                    in the comparative morphology of the sporophyte are as follows. Taking first the
                    Liverworts, in the <hi rend="italic">Riccieae</hi> proper (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Riccia, Oxymitra)</hi> both the epibasal and hypobasal halves of the oospore
                    (fertilized female cell) form sporogenous tissue. In the allied <hi
                    rend="italic">Corsinieae,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Marchantieae,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anthoceroteae</hi> the epibasal half alone gives rise to
                    sporogenous tissue, the hypobasal half forming an organ of absorption and
                    attachment which is the <hi rend="italic">true foot.</hi> In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermannieae,</hi> likewise, the sporogenous tissue is developed
                    entirely from the epibasal half of the oospore, which also gives rise to the
                    seta or stalk of the sporogonium; but the hypobasal half is aborted and gives
                    rise to only a rudimentary foot; in some foliose forms a <hi rend="italic">false
                    foot</hi> is formed by a dilatation of the base of the seta. In the Mosses there
                    is not in any family such a simple sporophyte as that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Riccieae</hi> among the Liverworts; but there are forms which present the same
                    morphological difference as that which in the Liverworts distinguishes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Marchantieae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Anthoceroteae,</hi> on
                    the one hand, from these <hi rend="italic">Jungermannieae,</hi> on the other.
                    Thus, among Mosses the <hi rend="italic">Sphagnaceae, Andreaeaceae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Phascaceae</hi> have a true foot, whereas in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bryineae</hi> there is a spurious foot at the base of the seta, as in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermannieae.</hi> Taking all the foregoing facts into account,
                    it is clear that the <hi rend="italic">Riccieae</hi> are the most primitive of
                    existing <hi rend="italic">Muscineae,</hi> and it is probably from them that the
                    true Mosses, as well as the other Liverworts, have been derived.</p>
                <p>The following phylogeny may be suggested. As regards the Liverworts, there can be
                    no doubt that the <hi rend="italic">Marchantieae</hi> are to be traced back
                    through the <hi rend="italic">Corsinieae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Riccieae,</hi> and it is probable that, as Leitgeb points out, the frondose <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi> were derived from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corsinieae</hi> through the <hi rend="italic">Rielleae.</hi> With regard to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Anthoceroteae,</hi> Leitgeb seems to suggest that they may
                    have been derived through <hi rend="italic">Notothylas</hi> from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jungermannieae</hi>; but in opposition to this must be set the
                    difference between the two groups as regards the morphology of the foot.
                    Probably the <hi rend="italic">Anthoceroteae</hi> arose independently from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Corsinieae.</hi> The Mosses are to be traced back to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthoceroteae,</hi> on account of the general similarity in the
                    structure of the sporogonium. The genus <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi> shows
                    its special relation to the <hi rend="italic">Sphagnaceae</hi> in the
                    development of the sporogenous cells from the amphithecium, whereas the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Notothylas</hi> resembles the other Mosses in that the
                    sporogenous cells are developed from the endothecium. The following scheme will
                    serve to illustrate these remarks.</p>
                <p>The phylogeny of the <hi rend="italic">Muscineae</hi> can be traced with
                    exceptional clearness in both generations. With regard to the gametophyte, it
                    must be remembered (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Muscineae)</hi> that at its first
                    development from the spore it is a <hi rend="italic">protonema,</hi> which is
                    either filamentous, as usually in Mosses, or a flattened expansion, as generally
                    in Liverworts, the shoot which bears the sexual organs being a secondary
                    development on the protonema. Both these forms of protonema bear a striking
                    resemblance to various Confervoid <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae,</hi> and
                    there can be little doubt that it is from this group that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscineae</hi> have arisen. This view is supported by the close resemblance of
                    the simple sporophyte of <hi rend="italic">Riccia</hi> among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Muscineae</hi> to that of <hi rend="italic">Coleochaete</hi> among
                    the Confervoid <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae.</hi> There is, however, this
                    difference, that in <hi rend="italic">Riccia</hi> the cells resulting from the
                    division of the oospore are differentiated into an external sterile layer,
                    forming the wall of the capsule, and an internal mass of sporogenous cells,
                    whereas in <hi rend="italic">Coleochaete</hi> all the cells are sporogenous.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sub-Kingdom</hi> III. PTERIDOPHYTA <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Vascular Cryptogams).</hi></p>
                <p>In these plants the gametophyte is a filamentous or tuberous, or more commonly a
                    membranous, flattened <hi rend="italic">prothallium,,</hi> exhibiting no
                    differentiation into stem and leaf. The sexual organs are antheridia and
                    archegonia, as in the <hi rend="italic">Muscineae.</hi> The sporophyte becomes
                    quite independent of the gametophyte, constituting the plant. The shoot is
                    always differentiated into stem and leaf, and the tissues are highly
                    differentiated.</p>
                <p>The sub-kingdom is divided into three classes,— <hi rend="smallcaps">Filicinae,
                    Equisetinae, Lycopodinae.</hi></p>
                <p>Each of these classes includes two series of forms,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >homospor-ous,</hi> in which all the spores are alike, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >heterosporous,</hi> in which the spores are of two kinds, namely, large spores
                    <hi rend="italic">{macrospores)</hi> and small spores (<hi rend="italic"
                    >microspores).</hi> On germination the spore of the homo-sporous forms gives
                    rise to a well-developed prothallium, which becomes quite free from the spore,
                    and usually bears both antheridia (male) and archegonia (female). The spores of
                    the heterosporous forms give rise on germination to comparatively inconspicuous
                    prothallia, which remain connected with the spores, and bear either exclusively
                    male or exclusively female organs. Thus, in the heterosporous forms the
                    gametophyte is represented by a male and a female organism, the former being
                    much the smaller. The male prothallium is always developed from a microspore,
                    the female prothallium from a macrospore (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    and are not aggregated on special shoots, so as to form flowers. The embryo

                    sprung from the simpler homosporous forms, that is, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salviniaceae</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllaceae</hi>; and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lycopodinae</hi> that <hi rend="italic">Selaginella</hi> has
                    sprung from <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium.</hi> Assuming that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isoetes</hi> belongs to the <hi rend="italic">Lycopodinae,</hi> its nearest
                    ally would appear to be <hi rend="italic">Phylloglossum</hi>; but this point
                    must remain undecided until the whole life-history, especially the embryogeny,
                    of <hi rend="italic">Phylloglossum</hi> is known, and its true systematic
                    position thereby fixed.</p>
                <p>Various attempts have been made to trace back the sporophyte of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> to that of the <hi rend="italic">Muscineae,</hi>
                    the points of contact being the <hi rend="italic">Hymenophyllaceae</hi> on the
                    one hand and <hi rend="italic">Anthoceros</hi> on the other; but these attempts
                    cannot be considered to have been successful. The differences between the known
                    forms of sporophyte in the two classes are too great to be explained away on any
                    hypothesis. The case is different with regard to the gametophyte; there are, in
                    fact, many points of resemblance between the prothallium of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> and the gametophyte of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscineae.</hi> As Goebel and Bower have pointed out, the prothallium of some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Trichomanes</hi> is a branched filamentous
                    structure, closely resembling Moss protonema; and in most ferns, as also in <hi
                    rend="italic">Equisetum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium,</hi> the
                    prothallium is at first filamentous. The filamentous prothallium gives rise to
                    one or more flattened expansions, on which the sexual organs, or at least the
                    archegonia, are developed <hi rend="italic">(archegoniophores).</hi> Thus there
                    are indications in the gametophyte of many <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi>
                    of that distinction of protonema and sexual shoot which is so characteristic of
                    the gametophyte of the <hi rend="italic">Muscineae.</hi> But this remarkable
                    correspondence in the gametophyte does not warrant the conclusion that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> have sprung from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muscineae.</hi> It rather indicates that they are groups having a common origin
                    in the Confervoid <hi rend="italic">Chlorophyceae,</hi> but diverging from the
                    first in the relation of the sporophyte to the gametophyte, so that, whereas in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Muscineae</hi> the sporophyte remains attached to the
                    gametophyte throughout its whole existence, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteridophyta</hi> the sporophyte develops as an independent organism. There can
                    be little doubt that in the primitive <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> the
                    two generations resembled each other, and that, as evolution proceeded, they
                    became more and more widely dissimilar, the gametophyte losing, the sporophyte
                    gaining, in both morphological and histological differentiation. An indication
                    of this is still afforded by the general resemblance of the sporophyte of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phylloglossum</hi> to the gametophyte of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycopodium cemuum</hi> as described by Treub, and of the sporophyte of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycopodium Phlegmaria</hi> to its gametophyte (Treub). It will
                    probably be found, when material is obtained for investigating it, that the
                    sporophyte and the gametophyte of <hi rend="italic">Phylloglossum</hi> are very
                    similar.</p>

                <p>These plants are commonly known as “flowering plants”; but they are more
                    correctly designated “seed-bearing plants,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spermaphyta,</hi> for the production of a seed is the one feature which
                    distinguishes the members of this sub-kingdom from those of the other
                    sub-kingdoms.</p>
                <p>There is a definite alternation of generations in the lifehistory of these
                    plants, but it is obscured by the extreme reduction which the gametophyte has
                    undergone (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reproduction).</hi> The sporophyte is the
                    plant; a suspensor is formed in its embryogeny; and it is heterosporous. The
                    sporophylls are aggregated on special shoots, frequently with other floral
                    leaves (bracteoles, perianth leaves), to form flowers. The two kinds of
                    sporangia are in all cases borne on distinct sporophylls. In the microsporangium
                    there are numerous fertile sporogenous cells, each of which produces four
                    microspores; in the macrosporangium there are generally but few sporogenous
                    cells, of which only one is usually fertile, and this one produces a single
                    macrospore without division. The microspores are set free from the sporangium
                    producing them, whereas the macrospore is not. It is this last peculiarity which
                    determines the formation of the seed.</p>
                <p>In the above account of the asexual reproductive organs of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phanerogamia,</hi> the terms employed are those which are applied in the case
                    of the heterosporous <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi>; the advantage gained
                    by the use of these terms is that the true homologies of the reproductive organs
                    in the two sub-kingdoms are kept in view. The relation between these terms and
                    those more commonly in use is as follows :—stamen = leaf bearing microsporangia
                    (microsporophyll); carpel = leaf bearing macrosporangia (macrosporophyll);
                    pollen-sac = microsporangium; anther = sorus of microsporangia; ovule
                    (nu-cellus) = macrosporangium; pollen-grain =microspore; embryo sac =
                    macrospore. Stamens and carpels are commonly borne by the same individual and in
                    the same flower; but in many cases they are confined to distinct individuals <hi
                    rend="italic">(dioecious)</hi> or to distinct flowers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(diclinous)</hi> on the same individual.</p>
                <p>Inasmuch as these plants are heterosporous, the sexual generation is represented
                    by male and female gametophytes. The male gametophyte, formed by the germination
                    of the microspore (pollen-grain), consists of two or sometimes three or four
                    cells, one of which becomes the male organ (pollen tube=antheridium of other
                    subkingdoms), while the rest have nothing to do with reproduction, but
                    constitute the rudimentary vegetative portion of the prothallium. The female
                    gametophyte, commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">endosperm</hi> ( = female
                    prothallium), is formed in the interior of the macrospore or embryo sac, and
                    usually does not come at all into relation with the exterior. From certain cells
                    of this endosperm one or more female organs are formed, which are equivalent to,
                    and in some Phanerogams closely resemble, the archegonia of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta;</hi> each of these female organs possesses, as its
                    essential constituent, the female cell (oosphere, ovum).</p>
                <p>The process of fertilization (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Reproduction)</hi> depends
                    upon the pollen-grains being brought near to the ovules, so that, when the
                    pollen-grains germinate, the pollen tubes may be able, in the course of their
                    growth, to come into close relation with the female cells which the ovules
                    contain. In many cases the transference of the pollen-grains is effected by the
                    wind; the plants in which this is the case are characterized by their
                    inconspicuous flowers, and are termed <hi rend="italic">anemophilous.</hi> In
                    other cases the transference is effected by means of insects; the plants in
                    which this is the case are termed <hi rend="italic">entomophilous,</hi> and are
                    characterized by their conspicuous flowers, in which the perianth leaves are
                    highly developed and brightly coloured, to attract the visits of insects,—an end
                    which is further attained by the secretion of scented volatile oils and of
                    sugary liquid (nectar). It is the conspicuous flowers of these entomophilous <hi
                    rend="italic">Phanerogamia</hi> which have earned for the whole group the
                    designation of “flowering plants,” which, however, is by no means generally
                    applicable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Phanerogamia</hi> are divided into two classes,—the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gymnospermae</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Angiospermae.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Class</hi> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gymnospermae.</hi> —The
                    carpels are sometimes absent, and, when present, they do not form an ovary;
                    hence the ovules are naked. There is no stigma, consequently the pollen-grain
                    comes into direct contact with the ovule. The whole of the female prothallium is
                    formed in the embryo sac before fertilization. The female organ is in most cases
                    a fully developed archegonium. The embryo is developed from a portion only of
                    the fertilized female cell or oospore <hi rend="italic">{meroblastic
                    embryogeny)</hi>; frequently several embryos are developed from one oospore (<hi
                    rend="italic">polyembryony).</hi> The flowers are dioecious or diclinous.</p>
                <p>This class consists of the following orders :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 1. Cycadaceae</hi>: characterized generally by the
                    unbranched stem and by the large branched leaves. The order includes nine
                    genera:— <hi rend="italic">Cycas, Dioon, Ceratozamia, Zamia, Macrozamia,
                    Encephal-artos, Stangeria, Bowenia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Microcycas.</hi>
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Cycas</hi> is peculiar, in that the carpels are not
                    borne on special shoots, so as to form flowers, but on the main shoot, in the
                    same way as the foliage leaves. The stamens of <hi rend="italic">Cycas,</hi> as
                    also both the stamens and carpels in the other genera, are highly modified
                    sporophylls which are borne on special shoots forming cone-like flowers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 2. Coniferae</hi>: characterized by the much-branched
                    stem and by the very numerous, small, unbranched leaves. The staminal flowers
                    are generally cone-like. This order includes the Pines, Firs, Larches, Yews,
                    Cypresses, &amp;c., arranged in the following families :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order 3. Gnetaceae</hi>: habit various; the flowers are not
                    cones, and have a perianth. This order includes the three genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephedra, Gnetum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Welwitschia.</hi> In
                    <hi rend="italic">Gnetum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Welwitschia</hi> the female
                    organ (archegonium) is reduced to a single cell, the oosphere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mutual Affinities and Phylogeny of Gymnospermae.</hi></p>
                <p>There is but little resemblance between the <hi rend="italic">Cycadaceae</hi> and
                    the other two orders. <hi rend="italic">Gingko</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salisburia,</hi> a remarkable genus which is usually placed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Taxineae,</hi> though it is in many respects peculiar, resembles
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cycadaceae</hi> in the structure of the archegonium, in
                    the fleshy character assumed by the outer portion of the seed-coat, and in the
                    fact that the development of the embryo does not begin until after the seed has
                    been shed. Probably the fossil plants known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cordaitaceae</hi> may be regarded as a group intermediate between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycadaceae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Coniferae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gnetaceae</hi> are more
                    closely allied, so much so in fact that the latter have been regarded by various
                    writers as a family of the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae.</hi> The structure of
                    the flowers in <hi rend="italic">Ephedra</hi> is very similar to that in <hi
                    rend="italic">Taxus.</hi></p>
                <p>The connexion of the Gymnosperms with the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> is
                    undoubted. The development of the microsporangium in the Gymnosperms is the same
                    as that of the sporangium of <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium.</hi> The development
                    of the macrosporangium presents in most cases the characteristic Phanerogamic
                    features; but in certain cases (<hi rend="italic">Ceratozamia longifolia,
                    Cupressus sempervirens, Callitris quadrivalvis)</hi> there is a mass of
                    sporogenous cells, as in the sporangia of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteridophyta,</hi> though only one of these cells is fertile, and it produces a
                    single macrospore without division. In fact, there is a marked general
                    resemblance in the development of the macrosporangium between these species and
                    <hi rend="italic">Isoetes.</hi> Another point of importance is the fact that,
                    although the female prothallium (endosperm) is under ordinary conditions
                    entirely and permanently enclosed in the macrospore (embryo sac)—a feature which
                    is characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Phanerogamia—</hi> yet in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cycadaceae,</hi> if the first-formed archegonia are not
                    fertilized, the prothallium resumes its growth and bursts the macrospore, coming
                    to the surface of the ovule and turning green in consequence of exposure to
                    light. Taking into consideration their general habit and the peculiarities in
                    the development of their sporangia, it appears that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cycadaceae</hi> find in the Eusporangiate <hi rend="italic">Filices</hi> their
                    nearest allies among the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta.</hi> This suggestion
                    presupposes the existence of hetero-sporous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eusporangiata,</hi> although all the known forms are homo-sporous. But this
                    difficulty will be met, if, as suggested above, it turns out that <hi
                    rend="italic">Isoetes</hi> really belongs to the Eusporangiate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filices.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Coniferae</hi> resemble more nearly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycopodinae,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">Lycopodium</hi> and

                    form of their flowers. However, the position of the pollen-sacs on the under
                    surface of the peltate sporophyll is a feature which connects them with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Equisetinae</hi>; but, on the other hand, the ligular outgrowth on
                    the upper surface of the macrosporophyll in <hi rend="italic">Araucaria,</hi>
                    which in the <hi rend="italic">Abietineae</hi> becomes the large ovuliferous
                    scale, is another point of resemblance to <hi rend="italic">Selaginclla</hi> and

                    hardly possible to trace back the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae</hi> to either of

                    The one point which affords any clue is the resemblance in general structure

                    more than that of any other Gymnosperm, resembles that of an Angiosperm,
                    especially in the fact that the staminal flower contains a rudimentary
                    ovule.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Class</hi> II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Angiospermae.</hi> —The
                    carpel or carpels form an ovary, in which the ovules are enclosed. A portion of
                    the carpel forms a stigma, which receives the pollen-grains. The pollen-grains
                    germinate on the stigma, and therefore do not come into direct relation with the
                    ovules. A part only of the female prothallium <hi rend="italic">{primary
                    endosperm)</hi> is formed before fertilization, the remainder <hi rend="italic"
                    >{secondary endosperm)</hi> after fertilization. The female organ is a reduced
                    archegonium, consisting merely of the female cell (oosphere). The general
                    occurrence of both macrosporophylls and microsporophylls in the same flower is a
                    characteristic feature of this group, as is also the whorled arrangement of the
                    floral leaves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Angiospermae</hi> are divided into two sub-classes,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monocotyledons</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dicotyledons,</hi>
                    according to the number of the primary leaves or cotyledons of the embryo;
                    hence, in the former sub-class the first leaves are alternate, in the latter
                    opposite. In the Monocotyledons, with few exceptions, the growing-point of the
                    embryonic stem is lateral; in the Dicotyledons it is always terminal. There are
                    other distinguishing features, such as the parallel venation of the leaves of
                    Monocotyledons and the reticulate venation in Dicotyledons; but they are not
                    sufficiently constant to be of much taxonomic value.</p>
                <p>The Monocotyledons may be conveniently arranged in the following series :—</p>
                <p>Series 1. <hi rend="italic">Nudiflorae</hi>: usually diclinous or dioecious;
                    perianth wanting or rudimentary. This series includes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spadiciflorae</hi> (Aroids, Palms, <hi rend="italic">Naiadeae)</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Glumiflorae</hi> (Grasses, Sedges).</p>
                <p>Series 2. <hi rend="italic">Petaloideae</hi>: usually monoclinous; perianth
                    present, and usually well-developed and coloured. This series includes the
                    Lilies, Orchids, Irises, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The Dicotyledons are usually classified as follows :—</p>
                <p>Series 1. <hi rend="italic">Monochlamydeae</hi>: usually diclinous or dioecious;
                    perianth absent or simple.</p>
                <p>Series 2. <hi rend="italic">Polypetalae:</hi> usually monoclinous; perianth
                    usually consists of calyx and coloured corolla, the petals being free.</p>
                <p>Series 3. <hi rend="italic">Gamopetalae</hi>: usually monoclinous; perianth
                    usually consists of calyx and coloured corolla, the petals being coherent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phylogeny of the Angiospermae.</hi></p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the <hi rend="italic">Angiospermae</hi> have been
                    derived from the <hi rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi>; but it is a question
                    whether they have had an independent origin from that group or whether they are
                    to be traced back to it through the Gymnosperms. In view of the wide gulf which
                    separates the Angiosperms from even the highest <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteridophyta,</hi> and of the affinities of the Gymnosperms to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteridophyta</hi> on the one hand and to the Angiosperms on the
                    other, the latter suggestion would appear to be the more probable.</p>
                <p>Although the Monocotyledons and the Dicotyledons have so many features in common,
                    it is probable that they have not had the same origin. The Gymnospermous forms
                    to which the Dicotyledons are most nearly allied are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coniferae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gnetum</hi> among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gnetaceae.</hi> The marked Angiospermous characters of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gnetum,</hi> and its general similarity in habit to a Dicotyledonous plant,
                    afford some ground for regarding this genus as the starting-point of the
                    Dicotyledons. But more probably the Dicotyledons are to be traced back to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Coniferae,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gnetaceae</hi> to be
                    regarded as a lateral offshoot of the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae,</hi> with an
                    Angiospermous tendency, but not leading on to higher forms. The Gymnosperms
                    which most resemble the Monocotyledons are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cycadaceae;</hi> and, if it be assumed that the Angiosperms have sprung from
                    the Gymnosperms, it is to this order of the latter class that the Monocotyledons
                    are to be traced. The Monocotyledons in which this resemblance is most
                    conspicuous are those, such as the Aroids and Palms, which belong to the series
