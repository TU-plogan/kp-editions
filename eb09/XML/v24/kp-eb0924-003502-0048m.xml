                    Procopius in the second year of his reign, and backed up by the public opinion
                    of Constantinople and the sympathy of the Gothic princes and chiefs on the
                    Danube, seemed so alarming that he thought of negotiation; but in the following
                    year the revolt collapsed at the prompt action of a loyal and able veteran
                    officer. In the year 366 Valens at one stroke reduced the taxes of the empire by
                    one-fourth, a very popular measure, though one of questionable policy in the
                    face of the threatening attitude of the Goths on the lower Danube. Before
                    venturing on a campaign against them, Valens received baptism from Eudoxus, the
                    bishop of Constantinople and the leader of the Arian party. After some small
                    successes over the Goths, won by his generals, Valens concluded a peace with
                    them, which lasted six years, on a general understanding that the Danube was to
                    be the boundary between Goths and Romans. On his return to Constantinople in
                    369-370 Valens began to persecute his orthodox and Catholic subjects. Yet he can
                    hardly have been a hearty and willing persecutor, or he would not have suffered
                    the orthodox Basil to remain bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, nor can he have
                    been a thoroughgoing religious fanatic, or he would not have restrained many of
                    his subjects from burying themselves in monasteries to escape the duties of
                    citizens. Indeed he had not the strength of will or force of character to have
                    been either the one or the other.</p>
                <p>In the years 371 to 377 Valens was in Asia Minor, most of the time at the Syrian
                    Antioch. The late war with Persia under the emperors Julian and Jovian had not
                    been satisfactorily concluded: the question as to the possession or the
                    protectorate of Armenia was still in suspense. Valens, though anxious to avoid
                    an Eastern war, because of danger nearer home from the restlessness of the
                    Goths, was compelled to take the field against Sapor, who had invaded and
                    occupied Armenia. It seems that Valens<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Amm. Marc., xxix. 1; the narrative is brief and not very
                    clear.</p></note> crossed the Euphrates in 373, and in Mesopotamia his troops
                    drove back the king of Persia to the farther bank of the Tigris. But the Roman
                    success was by no means decisive, and no definite understanding as to boundaries
                    was come to with Persia. Valens returned to Antioch, where in the winter of 373
                    a young man of high rank, Theodorus by name, was made to believe by a pack of
                    fortune-tellers and magicians that the emperor’s successor would be a man whose
                    name began with “Theod.” Theodorus was put to death, with many others whose name
                    began with the same fatal letters; and this led to a vindictive persecution
                    throughout the province of Asia of all who professed or practised magic and
                    necromancy. The age was a very superstitious and inquisitive one, and Valens
                    certainly shared its weakness. Between 374 and 377 we read of grievous
                    complaints of injustice and extortion perpetrated under legal forms, the result
                    probably of the recent panic, and pointing to an increasing weakness and
                    timidity at headquarters. Although preparations were made for following up the
                    war with Persia and securing the frontier, a truce was patched up, rather to the
                    disadvantage of the empire, Armenia and the adjacent country being half
                    conquered and annexed by Sapor. The armies of Rome, in fact, were wanted in
                    another quarter. The Huns, of whom we now hear for the first time, were
                    beginning in 376 to press the Goths from the north, and the latter asked leave
                    of the emperor to cross the Danube into Roman territory. This they were allowed
                    to do, on the condition that they came unarmed, and their children were <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0049-0036"/> transported to Asia as hostages. The conditions,
                    however, were not strictly enforced, and the whole affair was treacherously
                    mismanaged by the imperial generals, who for their own profit forced the new
                    settlers to buy food at famine prices. Accordingly the enraged Goths, under
                    their chief Frithigern, streamed across the Balkans into Thrace and the country
                    round Adrianople, plundering, burning, and slaughtering as they went. They were
                    driven back for a time, but returned in the spring of 378 in greater force, with
                    Huns and Alans to fight with them against the empire; and again, after one or
                    two repulses, they penetrated to the neighbourhood of Adrianople. Valens, who
                    had now returned to Constantinople, left the capital in May 378 with a strong
                    and well-officered army. Without awaiting the arrival of his nephew Gratian,
                    emperor of the West, who had just won a great victory over one of the barbarous
                    tribes of Germany in Alsace, Valens attacked the enemy at once, although his
                    troops had to go into action heated and fatigued by a long march on a sultry
                    August day. The battle was decided mainly by the cavalry of the Alans and
                    Sarmatians, the Roman infantry being outnumbered, outmanoeuvred, and finally so
                    hemmed in that the men could scarcely draw their swords. The slaughter went on
                    for hours, till the imperial army was destroyed. Valens either perished on the
                    field or, as some said, in a cottage fired by the enemy. From the battle of
                    Adrianople the Goths permanently established themselves south of the Danube.</p>
