                    (1599-1660), the head of the Spanish school of painting and one of the mightiest
                    painters the world has known, was born in Seville early in June 1599, the year
                    in which Van Dyck also first saw the light at Antwerp. His European fame is of
                    comparatively recent origin, dating from the first quarter of the 19th century.
                    Till then his pictures had lain immured in the palaces and museum of Madrid; and
                    from want of popular appreciation they had to a large extent escaped the
                    rapacity of the French marshals during the Peninsular War. In 1828 Sir David
                    Wilkie<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Cunningham’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Life,</hi> vol. ii.</p></note> wrote from Madrid that he felt
                    himself in the presence of a new power in art as he looked at the works of
                    Velazquez, and at the same time found a wonderful affinity between this master
                    and the English school of portrait painters, being specially reminded of the
                    firm square touch of Raeburn. He was struck by the sense of modernness of
                    impression, of direct contact with nature, and of vital force which pervaded all
                    the work of Velazquez, in landscape as well as in portraiture. Time and
                    criticism have now fully established his reputation as one of the most
                    consummate of painters, and accordingly Mr Ruskin says of him that “everything
                    Velazquez does may be taken as absolutely right by the student.” At the present
                    day his marvellous technique and strong individuality have given him a power in
                    European art such as is exercised by no other of the old masters. Acquainted
                    with all the Italian schools, the friend of the foremost painters of his day, he
                    was strong enough to withstand every external influence and to work out for
                    himself the development of his own nature and his own principles of art. A
                    realist of the realists, he painted only what he saw; consequently his
                    imagination seems limited. His religious conceptions are of the earth earthy,
                    although some of his works, such as the Crucifixion and the Scourging, are
                    characterized by an intensity of pathos in which he ranks second to no painter.
                    His men and women seem to breathe; his horses are full of action and his dogs of
                    life; so quick and close is his grasp of his subject. England was the first
                    nation to recognize his extraordinary merit, and it owns by far the largest
                    share of his works outside of Spain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of the 274 works attributed to Velazquez by Mr Curtis 121
                    are in the United Kingdom, while France has but 13, Austria-Hungary 12, Russia
                    7, and Germany about the same number.</p></note> But Velazquez can only be seen
                    in all his power in the gallery of the Prado at Madrid, where over sixty of his
                    works are preserved, including historical, mythological, and religious subjects,
                    as well as landscapes and portraits. It is hardly creditable to the patriotism
                    of Seville, his native town, that no example of his work is to be seen in the
                    gallery of that city. Seville was then in the height of its prosperity, “the
                    pearl of Spain,” carrying on a great trade with the New World, and was also a
                    vigorous centre of literature and art. For more than a hundred years it had
                    fostered a native school of painting which ranked high in the Peninsula, and it
                    reckoned among its citizens many whose names are prominent in Spanish
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Velazquez was the son of Rodriguez de Silva, a lawyer in Seville, descended from
                    a noble Portuguese family, and was baptized on 6th June 1599. Following a common
                    Spanish usage, he is known by his mother’s name Velazquez. There has been
                    considerable diversity of opinion as to his full name, but he was known to his
                    contemporaries as Diego de Silva Velazquez, and signed his name thus. He was
                    educated, says Palomino, by his parents in the fear of God, and was intended for
                    a learned profession, for which he received a good training in languages and
                    philosophy. But the bent of the boy was towards art, and he was placed under the
                    elder Herrera, a vigorous painter who disregarded the Italian influence of the
                    early Seville school. From his works in Seville we can see that Herrera was a
                    bold and effective painter; but he was at the same time a man of unruly temper
                    and his pupils could seldom stay long with him. Velazquez remained but one year,
                    long enough, however, to influence his life. It was from Herrera that he learned
                    to use long brushes, or, as Mr J. E. Hodgson, R.A., suggests, brushes with long
                    bristles, by means of which his colours seem to be floated on the canvas by a
                    light fluent touch, the envy and despair of his successors. From Herrera’s
                    studio Velazquez betook himself to a very different master, the learned and
                    pedantic Pacheco, the author of a heavy book on painting, and, as we see by his
                    works at Madrid, a dull commonplace painter. In this school he remained for five
                    years, studying proportion and perspective, and seeing all that was best in the
                    literary and artistic circles of Seville. Here also—and this may explain much—he
                    fell in love with his master’s daughter Juana, whom he married in 1618 with the
                    hearty approval of Pacheco, who praises his hand and heart, claiming at the same
                    time all the credit of having been his master. He must, however, have found
                    Velazquez a wayward pupil; for, instead of looking to Raphael, according to
                    orders, the young painter set himself to copy the commonest things about him,—
                    earthenware jars of the country people, birds, fish, fruit, and flowers of the
                    market-place. To paint well and thoroughly what he saw, to model with his brush,
                    and to colour under the influence of light and shade were for him the vital
                    purpose, the first lesson, in his art. It was with deliberate purpose that
                    Velazquez painted these <hi rend="italic">bodegones</hi> (tavern-pieces), as
                    they were called; for we are told that he said he would rather be the first
                    painter of common things than the second in higher art. Carrying out this idea
                    still further, Velazquez felt that to master the subtlety of the human face he
                    must make this a special study, and he accordingly engaged a peasant lad to be
                    his servant and model, making innumerable studies in charcoal and chalk, and
                    catching his every expression. We see this model in the laughing Peasant Boy of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0148-0133"/> Belvedere Gallery at Vienna. In such work as
                    this, and in his studies by the wayside, Velazquez laid the foundation of his
                    subsequent mastery of expression, of penetration into character, and of
                    rendering the life of his sitter to the quick. He saw the world around him
                    teeming with life and objects of interest to the painter, and he set himself to
                    render these. His manner is as national as that of Cervantes. He lived and died
                    racy of the soil. The position and reputation of Velazquez were now assured at
                    Seville. There his wife bore him two daughters,—all his family so far as is
                    known. The younger died in infancy, while the elder, Francisca, in due time
                    married Bautista del Mazo, a painter, whose large family is probably that which
                    is represented in the important picture of later years in Vienna, the so-called
                    Family of Velazquez. Mr Curtis, however, is inclined to believe that this
                    picture is by Mazo. In the gallery at Madrid there is at least one portrait of
                    this daughter, painted in these early days at Seville, as also a portrait of
                    Juana his wife, holding a drawing-tablet on her knee. There was formerly in the
                    possession of Lord Dudley another portrait of his wife by Velazquez, painted,
                    perhaps, in the first year of their happy marriage. Of this early Seville manner
                    we have an excellent example in El Aguador (the Water-Carrier) at Apsley House
                    (London). Firm almost to hardness, it displays close study of nature. One can
                    see in it the youthful struggle to portray the effects of light stealing here
                    and there over the prominent features of the face, groping after the effects
                    which the painter was to master later on. The brushwork is bold and broad, and
                    the outlines firmly marked. As is usual with Velazquez at this time, the harmony
                    of colours is red, brown, and yellow, reminding one of Ribera. For sacred
                    subjects we may turn to the Adoration of the Magi at Madrid, dated 1619, and the
                    Adoration of the Shepherds in the London National Gallery, in both of which we
                    have excellent examples of his realism. The peasants offering their gifts of
                    poultry are the hard-featured women of the market-place of Seville,
                    pre-Raphaelite in their uncompromising truthfulness. Thus also in the St John in
                    the Desert we find his peasant boy transformed into the saint.</p>
                <p>But Velazquez was now eager to see more of the world. Madrid, with its fine
                    Titians, held out strong inducements. Accordingly in 1622, fortified with
                    letters of introduction to Fonseca, who held a good position at court, he spent
                    some months there, accompanied only by his servant. Here he painted the portrait
                    of the poet Gongora, a commission from Pacheco, which now hangs in the gallery
                    at Madrid. The impression which Velazquez made in the capital must have been
                    very strong, for in the following year he was summoned to return by Olivares,
                    the all-powerful minister of Philip IV., fifty ducats being allowed to defray
                    his expenses. On this occasion he was accompanied by his father-in-law. Next
                    year (1624) he received from the king three hundred ducats to pay the cost of
                    the removal of his family to Madrid, which became his home for the remainder of
                    his life. Weak and worthless as a king, Philip had inherited the art-loving
                    propensities of his race, and was proud to be considered a poet and a painter.
                    It is one of the best features of his character that he remained for a period of
                    thirty-six years the faithful and attached friend of Velazquez, whose merit he
                    soon recognized, declaring that no other painter should ever paint his portrait.
                    By his equestrian portrait of the king, painted in 1623, Velazquez secured
                    admission to the royal service with a salary of twenty ducats per month, besides
                    medical attendance, lodgings, and payment for the pictures he might paint. The
                    portrait was exhibited on the steps of San Felipe, and was received with
                    enthusiasm, being vaunted by poets, among them Pacheco. It has unfortunately
                    disappeared, having probably perished in one of the numerous fires which
                    occurred in the royal palaces. The Prado, however, has two portraits (Nos. 1070
                    and 1071) which are most probably studies for this picture. In them the
                    harshness of the Seville period has disappeared and the tones are more delicate.
                    The modelling is firm, recalling that of Antonio Moro, the Dutch
                    portrait-painter of Philip II., who exercised a considerable influence on the
                    Spanish school. In the same year the prince of Wales (afterwards Charles I.)
                    arrived at the court of Spain. We are told that he sat to Velazquez, but the
                    picture has disappeared.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In 1847 Mr John Snare of Reading exhibited a picture which had come from the
                    sale of Lord Fife in 1809, and which he maintained to be the long lost work.
                    This led to much controversy; but the claim was rejected by experts and the
                    picture is said to be now in America.</p></note> It was during this period also
                    that he painted the hunting-scenes of which examples are to be found in the
                    collections of Sir Richard Wallace, Lord Clarendon, and others, and which served
                    him in the production of the great Boar Hunt of the London National Gallery,
                    painted, however, in the later years of his life,—a magnificent work in spite of
                    some restorations. It was then too that he painted the groups of Court Gallants
                    in their gay costumes, accompanied, as in the Boar Hunt, by their servants and
                    dogs. The splendid Meeting of Artists (as it is absurdly named) in the Louvre
                    was doubtless executed at a later time from studies taken in these early years,
                    for it displays all the qualities of his finer work, space and air being thrown
                    round the figures, which are touched with great mastery and ease.</p>
                <p>In 1628 Rubens visited Madrid on a diplomatic mission for nine months, and
                    Velazquez was appointed by the king to be his guide among the art treasures of
                    Spain. Rubens was then at the height of his fame, and had undertaken as a
                    commission from Olivares the large pictures which now adorn the great hall in
                    Grosvenor House (London). These months might have been a new turning-point in
                    the career of a weaker man than Velazquez, for Rubens added to his brilliant
                    style as a painter the manner of a fascinating courtier. Rubens had a high
                    opinion of the talent of Velazquez, as is attested by Fuensalida, but he
                    effected no change in the style of the strong Spaniard. He impressed him,
                    however, with the desire to see Italy and the works of her mighty painters. In
                    1627 the king had given for competition among the painters of Spain the subject
                    of the Expulsion of the Moors. Velazquez bore off the palm; but his picture was
                    destroyed in a fire at the palace in 1734. Palomino, however, describes it.
                    Philip III. points with his baton to a crowd of men and women driven off under
                    charge of soldiers, while Spain, a majestic female, sits looking calmly on. The
                    triumph of Velazquez was rewarded by his being appointed gentleman usher. To
                    this was shortly afterwards added a daily allowance of twelve reals, the same
                    amount as was allowed to the court barbers, and ninety ducats a year for dress,
                    which was also paid to the dwarfs, buffoons, and players about the king’s
                    person—truly a curious estimate of talent at the court of Spain. As an extra
                    payment he received (though it was not paid for five years) one hundred ducats
                    for the picture of Bacchus, painted in 1629 (No. 485 of the Madrid gallery). The
                    spirit and aim of this work are better understood from its Spanish name, Los
                    Borrachos or Los Bebedores (the Topers), who are paying mock homage to a
                    half-naked ivy-crowned young man seated on a wine barrel. It is like a story by
                    Cervantes, and is brimful of jovial humour. One can easily see in this picture
                    of national manners how Velazquez had reaped the benefit of his close study of
                    peasant life. The painting is firm and solid, and the light and shade are more
                    deftly handled than in former works. Altogether, this production <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n149/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0149-0134"/> may be taken as the most advanced example of the
                    first style of Velazquez. It is usual to divide his artistic career by his two
                    visits to Italy, his second style following the first visit and his third the
                    second. Roughly speaking, this somewhat arbitrary division may be accepted,
                    though it will not always apply, for, as is usual in the case of many great
                    painters, his styles at times overlap each other. Velazquez rarely signed his
                    pictures, and the royal archives only give the dates of his more important
                    works. Internal evidence and history, as regards his portraits, supply to a
                    certain extent the rest.</p>
                <p>In 1629 Philip gave Velazquez permission to carry out his desire of visiting
                    Italy, without loss of salary, making him besides a present of 400 ducats, to
                    which Olivares added 200. He sailed from Barcelona in August in the company of
                    the marquis De Spinola, the conqueror of Breda, then on his way to take command
                    of the Spanish troops at Milan. It was during this voyage that Velazquez must
                    have heard the details of the surrender of Breda from the lips of the victor,
                    and he must have sketched his fine head, known to us also by the portrait by Van
                    Dyck. But the great picture was not painted till many years later, for Spinola
                    had fallen into disfavour at court. In Venice Velazquez made copies of the
                    Crucifixion and the Last Supper of Tintoretto, which he sent to the king, and in
                    Rome he copied Michelangelo and Raphael, lodging in the Villa Medici till fever
                    compelled him to remove into the city. Here he painted the Forge of Vulcan (No.
                    1059 of the Madrid gallery), in which Apollo narrates to the astonished Vulcan,
                    a village blacksmith, the news of the infidelity of Venus, while four Cyclops
                    listen to the scandal. The mythological treatment is similar to that of the
                    Bacchus: it is realistic and Spanish to the last degree, giving a picture of the
                    interior of an Andalusian smithy, with Apollo thrown in to make the story tell.
                    The conception is commonplace, yet the impression it produces is undoubted from
                    the vividness of the representation and the power of expression. The modelling
                    of the half-naked figures is excellent. Altogether this picture is much superior
                    to the other work painted at the same time, Joseph’s Coat, which now hangs in
                    the Escorial. This work has been much praised—overpraised in the opinion of the
                    present writer—and this opinion is shared by Don Federico de Madrazo, the
                    director of the Madrid museum, who looks on it as one of the weakest of the
                    productions of Velazquez. Both these works are evidently painted from the same
                    models. In looking at these two pictures what strikes one especially is that
                    they betray no trace of the influence of the Italians. Velazquez remained true
                    to himself. At Rome he also painted the two beautiful landscapes of the Gardens
                    of the Medici, now in the Madrid museum, full of sparkle and charm. Landscape as
                    a form of art never had attraction for the Spaniards; but Velazquez here, and in
                    the silvery landscapes painted some years later at Aranjuez, shows how great a
                    master he was in this branch of art. After a visit to Naples in 1631, where he
                    worked with his countryman Ribera, and painted a charming portrait of the
                    infanta Maria, sister of Philip, he returned early in the year to Madrid.</p>
                <p>He then painted the first of many portraits of the young prince Don Baltasar
                    Carlos, the heir to the throne, dignified and lordly even in his childhood,
                    caracolling in the dress of a field-marshal on his prancing steed. Sir Richard
                    Wallace owns a fine example; but the finest in the United Kingdom is the
                    well-known picture at Grosvenor House, a masterly example of the second manner
                    bf Velazquez. The colour is warm and bright, the workmanship solid and fused
                    like enamel, while light and air pervade every corner. The scene is in the
                    riding-school of the palace, the king and queen looking on from a balcony, while
                    Olivares is in attendance as master of the horse to the prince. Don Baltasar
                    died in 1646 at the age of seventeen, so that judging by his age this picture
                    must have been painted about 1641, two years before the fall of Olivares. This
                    powerful minister was the early and constant patron of the painter. His
                    impassive saturnine face is familiar to us from the many portraits painted by
                    Velazquez, a face which, like his royal master’s, seems never to have known a
                    smile, and in which are written pride and disdain. Two must be named of
                    surpassing excellence,—the full length belonging to Mr. Holford (exhibited at
                    Burlington House in 1887), stately and dignified, in which he wears the green
                    cross of Alcantara and holds a wand, the badge of his office as master of the
                    horse; the other the great equestrian portrait of the Madrid gallery (No. 487),
                    in which he is flatteringly represented as a field-marshal in all his pomp
                    during an action. It is difficult to overpraise the excellence of this work,
                    either as regards its dramatic power or its masterly execution. In these
                    portraits Velazquez has well repaid the debt of gratitude which he. owed to his
                    first patron, whom he stood by in his fall, thus exposing himself to the
                    risk—and it was not a light one—of incurring the anger of the jealous Philip.
                    The king, however, showed no sign of malice towards his favoured painter.
                    Faithful in few things, Philip kept true to Velazquez, whom he visited daily in
                    his studio in the palace, and to whom he stood in many attitudes and costumes,
                    as a huntsman with his dogs, as a warrior in command of his troops, and even on
                    his knees at prayer, wearing ever the same dull uninterested look. His pale face
                    and lack-lustre eye, his fair flowing hair and moustaches curled up to his eyes,
                    and his heavy projecting Austrian lip are known in many a portrait and nowhere
                    more supremely than in the wonderful canvas of the London National Gallery (No.
                    745), where he seems to live and breathe. Few portraits in the whole range of
                    art will compare with this work, in which the consummate handling of Velazquez
                    is seen at its best, for it is in his late and most perfect manner.<note

                    their form, they were encased during the night in perfumed leather covers called
                    <hi rend="italic">bigoteras.</hi></p></note> From one of the equestrian
                    portraits of the king, painted in 1638, the sculptor Montanas modelled a statue
                    which was cast in bronze by the Florentine sculptor Tacca, and which now stands
                    in the Plaza del Oriente at Madrid, “a solid Velazquez,” as it has been well
                    named by Ford. This portrait exists no more; but there is no lack of others, for
                    Velazquez was in constant and close attendance on Philip, accompanying him in
                    his journeys to Aragon in 1642 and 1644, and was doubtless present with him when
                    he entered Lerida as a conqueror. It was then that he painted the great
                    equestrian portrait (No. 1066 of the Madrid gallery) in which the king is
                    represented as a great commander leading his troops,—a rôle which Philip never
                    played except in a theatrical pageant. All is full of animation except the
                    stolid face of the king. It hangs as a pendant to the great Olivares
                    portrait,—fit rivals of the neighbouring Charles V. by Titian, which doubtless
                    fired Velazquez to excel himself, and both remarkable for their silvery tone,
                    and their feeling of open air and harmony combined with brilliancy. The light
                    plays on the armour and scarf thrown to the wind, showing how completely
                    Velazquez had mastered the effects he strove to reach in his early days. Of
                    these two great works Sir Richard Wallace possesses small but excellent
                    replicas.</p>

                <p>But, besides the forty portraits of Philip which are known, we have portraits of
                    other members of the royal family, of Philip’s first wife, Isabella of Bourbon,
                    and her children, especially of her eldest son, Don Baltasar Carlos, of whom,
                    besides those already mentioned, there is a beautiful full length in a private
                    room at Buckingham Palace. Cavaliers, soldiers, churchmen, and poets of the
                    court, as for example the Quevedo at Apsley House (Burlington House, 1887), sat
                    to the painter and, even if forgotten by history, will live on his canvas. The
                    admirable Pareja of Lord Radnor’s collection (Burlington House, 1873) is said to
                    have been taken by Philip for the living man. It has been remarked that the
                    Spaniards have always been chary of committing to canvas the portraits of their
                    beautiful women, Queens and infantas may be painted and exhibited, but ladies
                    rarely. One wonders who the beautiful woman can be that adorns the gallery of
                    Sir Richard Wallace, the splendid brunette so unlike the usual fair-haired
                    female sitters to Velazquez. She belongs to this period of his work, to the
                    ripeness of his middle period. Instinct with life, her bosom seems to heave and
                    the blood to pulsate through her veins. The touch is firm but free, showing the
                    easy strength of the great master. Rarely has flesh been painted with such a
                    glow, yet with such reserve. This picture was one of the ornaments of the
                    Bethnal Green collection. But, if we have few ladies of the court of Philip, we
                    have in great plenty his buffoons and dwarfs. Even these deformed creatures
                    attract our sympathy as we look at their portraits by Velazquez, who, true to
                    his nature, treats them gently and kindly, as in El Primo (the Favourite), whose
                    intelligent face and huge folio with ink bottle and pen by his side show him to
                    be a wiser and better-educated man than many of the gallants of the court. El
                    Bobo de Coria, El Nino de Vallecas, and Pab-lillos, a buffoon evidently acting a
                    part, all belong to this middle period. From these commissioned portraits of the
                    menials of the court it is pleasant to turn to one of the greatest of historical
                    works, the Surrender of Breda, often known as Las Lanzas, from the serried rank
                    of lances breaking the sky, which is believed to have been painted about 1647.
                    It represents the moment when the vanquished Justin of Nassau in front of his
                    Dutch troops is submissively bending as he offers to his conqueror Spinola the
                    keys of the town, which, with courteous grace, the victor refuses to accept, as
                    he lays his hand gently on the shoulder of his defeated foe.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This gracious attitude is
                    also employed by Velazquez in a picture in Stafford House (representing the
                    reception of St Francis Borgia by Loyola).</p></note> Behind Spinola stand the
                    Spanish troops bearing their lances aloft, while beyond is a long stretch of the
                    Low Country, dotted with fortifications and giving the impression of vast space
                    and distance. The picture is full of light and air and is perhaps the finest
                    example of the silvery bluish style of Velazquez. In conception it is as fine as
                    in execution, and one looks in vain for a trace of “the malicious pencil” which
                    Sir William Stirling-Maxwell discerned in the treatment of Justin and his
                    gallant Dutchmen.</p>
                <p>The greatest of the religious paintings by Velazquez belongs also to this middle
                    period, the Christ on the Cross (Madrid gallery, No. 1055). Palomino says it was
                    painted in 1638 for the convent of San Placido. It is a work of tremendous power
                    and of great originality, the moment chosen being that immediately after death.
                    The Saviour’s head hangs on his breast and a mass of dark tangled hair conceals
                    part of the face. The beautiful form is projected against a black and hopeless
                    sky from which light has been blotted out. The figure stands absolutely alone
                    without any accessory. The skull and serpent described by Sir William
                    Stirling-Maxwell were added by some pious bungler at a much later date. The
                    picture was lengthened to suit its place in an oratory; but this addition has
                    since been removed.</p>
                <p>Velazquez’s son-in-law Mazo had succeeded him as usher in 1634, and he himself
                    had received steady promotion in the royal household, receiving a pension of 500
                    ducats in 1640, increased to 700 in 1648, for portraits painted and to be
                    painted, and being appointed inspector of works in the palace in 1647. Philip
                    now entrusted him with the carrying out of a design on which he had long set his
                    heart, the founding of an academy of art in Spain. Rich in pictures, Spain was
                    weak in statuary, and Velazquez was commissioned to proceed to Italy to make
                    purchases. Accompanied by his faithful slave Pareja, whom he taught to be a good
                    painter, he sailed from Malaga in 1649, landing at Genoa, and proceeding thence
                    by Milan to Venice, buying Titians, Tintorettos, and Veroneses as he went. A
                    curious conversation which he is said to have had with Salvator Rosa is reported
                    by Boschini,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Stirling’s <hi rend="italic">Velazquez and his Works</hi>, p. 161.</p></note> in
                    which the Spaniard with perfect frankness confesses his want of appreciation of
                    Raphael and his admiration of Titian, “first of all Italian men.” It seems a
                    possible story, for Velazquez bought according to his likings and painted in the
                    spirit of his own ideals. At Modena he was received with much favour by the
                    duke, and doubtless here he painted the two splendid portraits which now adorn
                    the Dresden gallery, for these pictures came from the Modena sale of 1746. They
                    presage the advent of the painter’s third and latest manner, a noble example of
                    which is the great portrait of Innocent X. in the Doria palace at Rome, to which
                    city Velazquez now proceeded. There he was received with marked favour by the
                    pope, who presented him with a medal and gold chain. Of this portrait, thought
                    by Sir Joshua Reynolds to be the finest picture in Rome, Palomino says that
                    Velazquez took a copy to Spain. There exist several in different galleries, some
                    of them possibly studies for the original or replicas painted for Philip. One of
                    the most remarkable is that in Apsley House, exhibited in Burlington House in
                    1887. The modelling of the stern impassive face conies near to perfection, so
                    delicate are the gradations in the full light; all sharpness of outline has
                    disappeared; and the features seem moulded by the broad and masterly brushwork.
                    When closely examined, the work seems coarse, yet at the proper distance it
                    gives the very essence of living flesh. The handling is rapid but unerring.
                    Velazquez had now reached the <hi rend="italic">manera abreviada,</hi> as the
                    Spaniards call this bolder style. This is but another way of saying that his
                    early and laborious studies and his close observation of nature had given to him
                    in due time, as to all great painters, the power of representing what he saw by
                    simpler means and with more absolute truth. At Rome he painted also a portrait
                    of his servant Pareja, probably the picture of Lord Radnor’s collection, which
                    procured his election into the Academy of St Luke. Philip was now wearying for
                    his return; accordingly, after a visit to Naples, where he saw his old friend
                    Ribera, he returned to Spain by Barcelona in 1651, taking with him many pictures
                    and 300 pieces of statuary, which he afterwards arranged and catalogued for the
                    king. Undraped sculpture was, however, abhorrent to the Spanish Church, and
                    after Philip’s death these works gradually disappeared.</p>
                <p>Isabella of Bourbon had died in 1644, and the king had married Maria Anna of
                    Austria, whom Velazquez now painted in many attitudes. He was specially chosen
                    by the king to fill the high office of “aposentador major,” which imposed on him
                    the duty of looking after the quarters occupied by the court whether at home or
                    in their journeys —a responsible function, which was no sinecure and inter <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0151-0136"/> fered with the exercise of his art. Yet far from
                    indicating any decline, his works of this period are amongst the highest
                    examples of his style. The dwarf Don Antonio el Inglés (the Englishman) with his
                    dog, Aesop, Menippus, and the Sculptor, all in the Madrid gallery, show his
                    surest and freest manner. To these may be added the charming portraits of the
                    royal children in the Louvre and Vienna, among the choicest of his works. It is
                    one of these infantas, Margarita Maria, the eldest daughter of the new queen,
                    that is the subject of the well-known picture Las Meniñas (the Maids of Honour)
                    in the Madrid gallery, painted in 1656, where the little lady holds court,
                    surrounded by her ladies-in-waiting, her dwarfs, and her mastiff, while
                    Velazquez is seen standing at his easel. This is the finest portrait we have of
                    the great painter, and, as etched by St Raymond, it forms the frontispiece of
                    the book by Mr Curtis. It is a face of much dignity, power, and sweetness,—like
                    his life, equable and serene, unruffled by care. Las Meniñas was the picture of
                    which Luca Giordano said that it was the “theology of painting,” another way of
                    expressing the opinion of Sir Thomas Lawrence, that this work is the philosophy
                    of art, so true is it in rendering the desired effect. The result is there, one
                    knows not by what means, as if by a first intention without labour, absolutely
                    right. The story is told that the king painted the red cross of Santiago on the
                    breast of the painter, as it appears to-day on the canvas. Velazquez did not,
                    however, receive the honour till 1659, three years after the execution of this
                    work. Even the powerful king of Spain could not make his favourite a belted
                    knight without a commission to inquire into the purity of his lineage on both
                    sides of the house.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    records of this commission have been found among the archives of the order of
                    Santiago by Μ. Villaamil.</p></note> Fortunately the pedigree could bear
                    scrutiny, as for generations the family was found free from all taint of heresy,
                    from all trace of Jewish or Moorish blood, and from contamination by trade or
                    commerce. The difficulty connected with the fact that he was a painter was got
                    over by his being painter to the king and by the declaration that he did not
                    sell his pictures. But for this royal appointment, which enabled him to escape
                    the censorship of the Inquisition, we should never have had his splendid Venus
                    and Cupid, belonging to Mr Morritt of Rokeby Hall (exhibited in Manchester in
                    1857), painted in his latest manner and worthy of comparison with Titian. There
                    were in truth but two patrons of art in Spain,—the church and the art-loving
                    king and court. Murillo was the artist favoured by the church, while Velazquez
                    was patronized by the crown. One difference, however, deserves to be noted.
                    Murillo, who toiled for a rich and powerful church, left scarcely sufficient
                    means to pay for his burial, while Velazquez lived and died in the enjoyment of
                    good salaries and pensions. Yet on occasions Philip gave commissions for
                    religious pictures to Velazquez, —among others, and belonging to this later
                    period, the Coronation of the Virgin (Madrid), splendid in colour—a harmony of
                    red, blue, and grey—but deficient in religious feeling and dignity. It was
                    painted for the oratory of the queen, doubtless Maria Anna, in the palace at
                    Madrid. Another royal commission for the hermitage of Buen Retiro was the St
                    Anthony the Abbot and St Paul the Hermit, painted in 1659, the landscape of
                    which excited the warm admiration of Sir David Wilkie. The last of his works
                    which we shall name is Las Hilanderas or the Spinners (Madrid), painted about
                    1656, representing the interior of the royal tapestry works. The subject is
                    nothing, the treatment everything. It is full of light, air, and movement,
                    splendid in colour, and marvellous in handling. This picture, Raphael Mengs
                    said, seemed to have been painted not by the hand but by the pure force of
                    will.</p>
                <p>We see in it the full ripeness of the power of Velazquez, a concentration of all
                    the art-knowledge he had gathered during his long artistic career of more than
                    forty years. In no picture is he greater as a colourist. The scheme is simple,—a
                    harmony of red, bluish green, grey, and black, which are varied and blended with
                    consummate skill.</p>
                <p>In 1660 a treaty of peace between France and Spain was to be consummated by the
                    marriage of the infanta Maria Theresa with Louis XIV., and the ceremony was to
                    take place in the Island of Pheasants, a small swampy island in the Bidassoa.
                    Velazquez was charged with the decoration of the Spanish pavilion and with the
                    whole scenic display. In the midst of the grandees of the first two courts in
                    Christendom Velazquez attracted much attention by the nobility of his bearing
                    and the splendour of his costume. On the 26th June he returned to Madrid, and on
                    the 31st July he was stricken with fever. Feeling his end approaching, he signed
                    his will, appointing as his sole executors his wife and his firm friend
                    Fuensalida, keeper of the royal records. He died on the 6th of August 1660,
                    passing away in the full possession of his great powers, and leaving no work
                    behind him to show a trace of decay. He was buried in the Fuensalida vault of
                    the church of San Juan, and within eight days his wife Juana was laid beside
                    him. Unfortunately this church was destroyed by the French in 1811, so that his
                    place of interment is now unknown. There was much difficulty in adjusting the
                    tangled accounts outstanding between Velazquez and the treasury, and it was not
                    till 1666, after the death of Philip, that they were finally settled.</p>
                <p>Velazquez can hardly be said to have formed a school of painting. Apart from the
                    circumstance that his occupations at court would have prevented this, his genius
                    was too personal for transmission by teaching. Yet his influence on those
                    immediately connected with him was considerable. In 1642 he befriended young
                    Murillo on his arrival in Madrid, received him into his house, and directed his
                    studies for three years. His son-in-law Mazo painted in his manner, and
                    doubtless many pictures by Mazo are attributed to the master. Carreno, though
                    never a pupil, was a favourite and had the good sense to appreciate him and
                    imitate him. His faithful slave Pareja studied his methods and produced work
                    which by the favour of Velazquez procured his manumission from Philip. But the
                    appreciation of the fine talent of Velazquez passed away quickly in Spain, as
                    that country began to fall to pieces.</p>
