                    line from Blois to Le Mans. The abbey of the Trinity (12th to 15th century) has
                    a fine portal in florid Gothic style. A graceful balustrade runs round the
                    building at the spring of the roof, and two rows of flying buttresses,
                    themselves resting on other elegant buttresses, support the nave. The high
                    gallery of the triforium, the rich traceries of the windows, and the modern
                    fonts are worthy of notice. Part of the building is in the Angevin style of the
                    beginning of the 13th century. In the choir are some fine stalls and glass of
                    the 15th and 16th centuries. The steeple, 262 feet high, which stands isolated
                    in front of the church, belongs to the middle of the 12th century, and is one of
                    the finest examples of Transition architecture. The lower part is rectangular
                    and the upper octagonal, with a stone spire. It has been recently restored. The
                    church of La Madeleine (15th century) is surmounted by a stone spire, an
                    indifferent imitation of that of the abbey. The fine tower of St Martin (16th
                    century) is all that remains of the church of that name. The town-hall occupies
                    the old gate of St George; its river front is composed of two large crenellated
                    and machicolated towers, connected by a pavilion. The ancient hospital of St
                    James afterwards became a college of the Oratorians, in which Mascaron was a
                    professor, but is now a lyceum; the charming chapel, dating from the 15th
                    century, in the most florid Gothic style, is still preserved. Parts of the
                    chateau of the counts of Vendome are as old as the 11th century. A public
                    promenade leads to the curious vaults under the castle. Vendôme is the seat of
                    an archaeological and scientific society, possesses a library of 15,000 volumes
                    and 305 MSS., and a museum, mostly archaeological, in front of which stands a
                    statue of Ronsard. There are some interesting houses of the 15th and 16th
                    centuries, and near the town are the remains of a Roman theatre. The population
                    in 1881 was 7913 (commune 9420), the corresponding figures for 1886 being 7843
                    and 9325.</p>
                <p>Vendôme <hi rend="italic">(Vindocinum)</hi> appears originally to have been a
                    Gallic oppidum, replaced later by a feudal castle, around which the modern town
                    has arisen. Christianity was introduced by St Bien-heuré in the 5th century, and
                    the abbey of the Trinity was founded in 1030. About the end of the 10th century
                    Vendôme became an independent county, and was raised to a duchy in 1515. It long
                    belonged to a branch of the Bourbon family. During the Wars of Religion the town
                    was sacked by the Protestants, by members of the League, and was finally taken
                    by Henry IV. Since then its industrial and commercial importance (tanneries and
                    manufactories of woollen stuffs and gloves) has fallen off. Marshal de
                    Rochambeau was a native of Vendôme.</p>
