                <p><label type="entry">VERMONT</label>, one of the New England States of the
                    American Union, lies between 42° 44' and 45° 0' 43'' N. lat. and 71° 38' and 73°
                    25' W. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Canadian province of Quebec, on the
                    E. by New Hampshire, from which it is separated by the Connecticut river, on the
                    S. by Massachusetts, and on the W. by New York, from which it is separated for
                    more than 100 miles by Lake Champlain. The Canadian boundary is 90 miles long;
                    but from this the width of Vermont continually grows less towards the southern
                    border, where it is 41 miles. The length is 158 miles. The boundary between
                    Vermont and New York passes through the western side of Lake Champlain, so that
                    three-fourths of the lake and most of its islands belong to the former. The area
                    of the State is 10,212 square miles.</p>
                <p>The surface is greatly diversified, so that the scenery is everywhere attractive
                    and often grand. The Green Mountains, following a south-westerly trend, divide
                    the State into nearly equal portions. Near Canada there are two ranges, the
                    western being the larger; but near the fortyfourth parallel they unite and
                    continue through western New England as a single range. The highest mountain is
                    Mansfield (4430 feet), and there are five others over 4000 feet and twelve over
                    3500 feet. Except upon the loftiest summits, the whole range is densely covered
                    with forests of spruce <hi rend="italic">(Abies nigra),</hi> mingled with which
                    are other evergreen and deciduous trees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hence the old French name <hi rend="italic">Verd
                    Mont.</hi></p></note> Many of the streams flowing west unite to form five rivers
                    which enter Lake Champlain. Eleven smaller rivers flow into the Connecticut,
                    which drains about one-third of the area of Vermont. Three streams run north and
                    enter Lake Memphremagog, about one-fifth of which is within the State, and two
                    flow south to join the Hudson river. Most of the larger streams pass through
                    wide, fertile valleys. Small lakes and ponds are abundant.</p>
                <p>The rocks of Vermont are largely metamorphic. Their age has long been disputed
                    among geologists; it appears now, however, to be clearly established that most
                    of them are Palaeozoic, although there are a few small areas which may prove to
                    be Archaean. Along Lake Champlain there are many outcrops of unaltered
                    fossiliferous strata, which, from the Lower Cambrian through the Hudson River or
                    Cincinnati formations, lie in a regular conformable series, and upon these rest
                    Quaternary deposits. The strata have a northerly strike and a dip 5°-90° E. They
                    form frequent headlands and cliffs upon the shore of Lake Champlain, where they
                    can be most easily studied. The Cambrian beds, nowhere more than a few miles
                    broad, extend from Canada southwards for about 90 miles, having a total
                    thickness of probably not less than 10,000 feet. They consist of limestone,
                    sandstone, shale, slate, quartzite, and conglomerate<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n186/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0186-0167"/>. The limestone is often arenaceous and dolomitic,
                    sometimes magnesian. There are great masses of reddish, silicious limestone, the
                    Red Sandrock of geologists, which, often destitute of fossils, contains here and
                    there species of <hi rend="italic">Ptychoparia, Olenellus, Orthisina, Obolus,
                    Salterella,</hi> &amp;c. Included in these beds are thick layers of a
                    beautifully mottled red and white dolomite, the “Winooski marble,” long used for
                    architectural purposes. Similar fossils occur in the “Georgia shales” and
                    elsewhere. Above the Cambrian are small patches of Calciferous and Quebec, then
                    larger areas of Chazy, Trenton, Utica, and Hudson River. In the Chazy and
                    Trenton there are extensive quarries upon Isle la Motte, and these formations
                    are finely exhibited in many localities near the lake. The rocks are mostly
                    limestones and shales of a black or dark grey colour, and frequently afford
                    Silurian fossils in great abundance. Within a few miles of Lake Champlain the
                    sedimentary rocks are replaced by schists, quartzites, and other metamorphic
                    rocks, which continue beyond the mountains to Connecticut river. In the southern
                    part of Vermont there are Lower Helderberg strata, and in the northern, about
                    Lake Memphremagog, Upper Helderberg. These occupy but limited areas and are
                    unconformable with the underlying rocks. Rev. A. Wing determined the age of the
                    great marble beds of Rutland county to be mostly, if not wholly, of the Chazy
                    epoch. He then extended his observations to the rocks of the Green Mountain
                    mass; and by means of the results thus gained, as well as by his own
                    long-continued independent researches, Prof. J. D. Dana seems to have
                    substantially settled the age of the rocks which compose the mountains as Lower
                    Silurian, and shown that the uplift ending in the range took place after the
                    close of the Hudson River and before the Helderberg period. In the Champlain
                    valley the rocks are traversed by dykes of trap and porphyry, which in some
                    instances have spread over the strata. In the Utica and Hudson River shales
                    there is most beautiful veining: innumerable seams of white calcite, from the
                    finest line to several inches in width, cross and recross the black strata in
                    every direction. In a narrow strip from Canada to Bennington there are Tertiary
                    beds, which are well seen at Brandon. In this formation there are great masses
                    of lignite, containing fossil fruits, also bog iron, manganese, kaolin, and
                    variously and often brightly coloured clays. The entire surface of Vermont shows
                    the effects of glaciation. Some of the Silurian ledges are striated and polished
                    most beautifully. Drift, boulders, sands, clays occur everywhere; every stream
                    is bordered by terraces; remains of mammoth, mastodon, beluga, are found in the
                    drift deposits, as well as <hi rend="italic">Mya, Saxicava, Mytilus,</hi> and
                    other marine <hi rend="italic">Mollusca.</hi> Sea-beaches over 2000 feet and
                    terraces over 1000 feet above the present sea-level testify to movements of the
                    surface. From the early Cambrian to the late Quaternary epoch Lake Champlain was
                    an arm of the sea, and for a portion of this time it was connected with the
                    ocean at each end, so that a current flowed from what is now New York Bay to St
                    Lawrence Gulf, converting New England into an island.</p>
                <p>Ores of copper, silver, lead, gold, manganese, and iron occur; but, although
                    numerous attempts at mining have been made, very few have continued or ever been
                    profitable. A large amount of copper is obtained at the Ely mines, where the ore
                    is chalco-pyrite; and gold has been found in paying quantity in river gravel,
                    and also in veins, and is still sought in one or two places. The chief mineral
                    wealth of the State is in its quarries. No other State in the Union produces so
                    great a variety or quantity of marble. The annual production is nearly 2,000,000
                    cubic feet, and is increasing. Roofing and other slate is obtained in very large
                    quantities and of fine quality. Most excellent granite is quarried in increasing
                    amount, and there are large beds of soap-stone, which are worked. Besides what
                    may be called useful minerals, the State affords a large variety of species, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> rutile, actinolite, talc, serpentine, which are of
                    interest to the mineralogist. The State has many mineral springs, some of which
                    have long been places of popular resort. Most of them are sulphurous, some
                    chalybeate, carbonate, or alkaline.</p>
                <p>The climate of Vermont, like that of New England generally, is subject to
                    extremes and to sudden changes. In summer the temperature varies from 65° to 75°
                    Fahr., sometimes rising to 90°; in winter it ranges from 18° to 50°, sometimes
                    falling to -10° or rarely - 20°. At Burlington the mean annual temperature is
                    45°. The climate is milder in the Champlain valley than east of the Green
                    Mountains. During the winter there is often much snow, which in the colder parts
                    of the State covers the ground for three months. The average annual rainfall is
                    33 inches. The air is clear and pure. Notwithstanding the changeable climate,
                    the death-rate is low and the people robust.</p>
                <p>Most of the large mammals formerly common,—the panther, wolf, lynx, beaver,
                    otter, moose,—have either disappeared or are very rare; others, as the black
                    bear, red deer, mink, and marten, are found only in certain localities. More
                    common are the red fox, raccoon, skunk, porcupine, woodchuck, rabbit, squirrel,
                    and other smaller species. Birds have changed less; but the wild turkey, golden
                    eagle, raven, &amp;c., have become very rare, and the white-headed eagle, large
                    hawks, owls, herons, bitterns, and the like are far from common. The lakes are
                    visited at certain seasons by great numbers of ducks, geese, and other
                    water-fowl. Thrushes, bluebirds, titmice, sparrows, swallows, warblers, vireos,
                    blackbirds, crows, and woodpeckers are common, as well as many other small
                    birds. In Lake Champlain and the large streams which flow into it are found
                    sturgeon, garpike, muskalonge, bass, pike, pickerel, shad, as well as many
                    smaller species. Trout abound in the mountain streams and in some of the ponds.
                    Reptiles and batrachians are not numerous either in species or individuals.</p>
                <p>The flora is of great beauty and of unusual botanical interest. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxifraga Aizoon, Poa laxa, Arenaria groenlandica,</hi> and other alpine plants
                    are found on the higher mountains. <hi rend="italic">Lathyrus maritimus,
                    Hudsonia tomentosa,</hi> and other maritime species recall the time when Lake
                    Champlain was salt. A number of western species find their eastern limit in the
                    Champlain valley, and a greater number of Canadian plants have ended their
                    southward migrations in northern Vermont. Over 1300 species of phanerogams and
                    higher cryptogams grow wild in the State. About 50 of these are found nowhere
                    else in New England, and a few nowhere else in the United States. Ferns grow
                    luxuriantly in many mountain forests and ravines, where 50 species may be
                    collected, including such very rare forms as <hi rend="italic">Asplenium viride,
                    Pellaea gracilis, Woodsia glabella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hyperborea,
                    Aspidium Braunii,</hi> &amp;c. Orchids are also abundant. Of the 108 families
                    found in the State the most numerous are the ranunculus, saxifrage, rose,
                    composite, heath, lily, grass, and sedge. The once prevalent forests are now
                    chiefly confined to the mountains. There are nearly 100 species of trees and
                    large shrubs; the forests and groves consist chiefly of 11 species of oak, 6 of
                    maple, 17 of willow, 6 of birch, 8 of poplar, 3 of elm, 17 of conifers, besides
                    beech, ash, walnut, butternut, &amp;c. No single species forms so characteristic
                    a feature of the landscape as the American elm, which with great variety of
                    form, always elegant and beautiful, grows singly or in small groups in every
                    meadow and upon many uplands. The sugar maple is a common and conspicuous tree.
                    (G. H. P.)</p>
                <p>The population was estimated in 1777 at 30,000. The first census taken, in 1791,
                    gave 85,425. The different enumerations from 1800 to 1880 inclusive have been as
                    follows:—154,465; 217,895; 235,966; 280,652; 291,948; 314,120; 315,098; 330,551;
                    332,286. The very slight gain in the decades succeeding 1850 is accounted for by
                    the large emigration from Vermont to the western portions of the country. Of the
                    total population in 1880 291,327 were natives and 40,959 foreign-born. Of the
                    latter class British America furnished the largest contingent, 24,620; Ireland
                    11,657; other parts of Great Britain 3773. The number of coloured was 1057; the
                    excess of males over females 1488. The number gathered in towns of from 4000 to
                    12,000 inhabitants was 37,800. The largest towns are Rutland, 12,149 (in 1886
                    two new towns were formed from it); Burlington, 11,365; St Albans, 7193;
                    Bennington, 6333; Brattleboro, 5880; St Johnsbury, 5800. Montpelier, the
                    capital, has 3219. The average density of population is 36∙4 per square mile.
                    The insane numbered 1015; idiotic, 803; blind, 486; paupers, 1564; inmates of
                    prisons and reformatories, 261. The births in 1885 were 6592, or 22∙1 per 1000
                    of population, and the deaths 5358 (average age as reported, 41∙95 years;
                    percentage of deaths to population, 1∙61). The number of divorces in 1860 was
                    94, one to every 23 marriages; in 1880 the number was 129 (one to 20 marriages);
                    and in 1885 it was 94 (one to 28∙7 marriages).</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the chief occupation of the State. The 35,522 farms make up a
                    total of 4,882,588 acres, of which 3,286,461 are improved land. The western
                    portion of the State contains the finest tracts of arable land; the climate as
                    well as the soil of the Champlain valley is especially adapted to fruit-raising,
                    the surface of the lake being but 90 feet above sea-level. The average size of
                    farms in Vermont is 137 acres; the total estimated value of the farms in 1880
                    was $109,346,010, and of the total products in 1879 $22,082,656. Subjoined are
                    the figures relating to the leading crops :—wheat, <pb break="no"

                    acre; oats, 3,742,282 bushels, averaging 37∙6 bushels per acre; Indian corn,
                    2,014,271; potatoes, 4,438,172 bushels; hay, 1,051,183 tons. The wool clip was
                    2,551,113 lb; and there were 217,033 cows, producing 25,245,826 lb of butter
                    (12,137,980 lb in 1850) and 6,121,130 ft of cheese (8,720,834 in 1850). The
                    value of orchard products amounted to $640,942. Of maple sugar Vermont produces
                    more than any other State,—in 1880 11,261,077 lb, or 30∙8 per cent. of the whole
                    production of the United States, besides 128,091 gallons of molasses.</p>
                <p>In 1880 the State possessed 75,215 horses, 283 mules and asses, 18,868 working
                    oxen and 167,204 other cattle (exclusive of milch cows), 439,870 sheep, and
                    76,384 pigs. Much attention is given to the raising of improved stock. The
                    rearing of fine breeds of sheep for exportation is a lucrative business.</p>
                <p>Lake Champlain abounds in fish of various kinds. Great pains have been taken of
                    late years to stock the numerous ponds and streams of the State with salmon,
                    trout, carp, and bass. Both fish and game are protected by stringent laws, and
                    to some extent by special police supervision.</p>
                <p>In 1880 there were 2874 manufacturing and mechanical establishments, the average
                    number of operatives 17,540, and the value produced in 1879 was $31,354,366.
                    Eight firms manufactured cotton, 44 woollen goods, 227 flour and grist-mill

                    agricultural tools, and 688 lumber. The State rates as nineteenth in value
                    ($3,258,816) of lumber products, while Burlington ranks third in importance
                    among the lumber markets of the United States. Eighteen marble quarries produced
                    a value of $1,340,050; there are also granite and slate quarries,—61 quarries in
                    all, with a total production in 1879 of $1,752,333.</p>
                <p>Burlington is the only port of entry. The State has 9 steam vessels aggregating
                    2380 tons, 12 sailing vessels, and 14 unrigged vessels, the total tonnage being
                    4594. The imports for the year ending 31st December 1887 were $5,959,813 and the
                    exports $1,433,564; the value of the pine, spruce, and hemlock lumber imported
                    was $1,084,599. Most of this foreign trade is carried on with Canada.</p>
                <p>Railroad construction was begun in 1846, and by December 1849 two lines were
                    completed from the Connecticut river to Burlington. In 1853 the working mileage
                    had risen to 493 miles, and in 1886 it was 946 miles, mainly of trunk lines. A
                    State board of three commissioners, appointed by the governor and senate,
                    exercises general supervision.</p>
                <p>Bills of credit were issued as early as 1781, and were all faithfully redeemed.
                    The first State bank was chartered in 1806, but closed an unsuccessful career in
                    1814. In 1818 banks were established at Windsor and Burlington. In 1841 there
                    were 17 incorporated banking institutions, with a capital of $1,735,000. In
                    October 1887 there were 49 national banks, with an aggregate capital of
                    $7,566,000, a surplus fund of $1,571,864, and $668,329 undivided profits. The
                    circulation was $3,478,100, secured by bonds to the amount of $3,891,000. The
                    loans and discounts amounted to $12,879,765, and the individual deposits to
                    $6,627,090. In 1860 there were 12 institutions for savings, with deposits to the
                    amount of $1,111,532. In June 1887 there were 28 savings banks and trust
                    companies, with $15,587,051 to the credit of 53,810 depositors, and a surplus of
                    $776,113. Deposits pay a state tax of <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> per cent The State proper has no debt.</p>
                <p>The Congregationalists have 197 churches, 186 ministers, 20,271 members, 22,035
                    pupils in Sunday schools, and 13,748 families belonging to the congregations.
                    The Baptists have 105 churches, 111 ministers, 8623 members, 8922 pupils in
                    Sunday schools. The Methodists have 192 churches, 161 ministers, 16,067 members,
                    18,830 children in Sunday schools. The Episcopalians report 36 ministers in
                    charge of 52 parishes, with 3926 communicants; number of families, 1789. The
                    Free Baptists and Christians together have 60 churches and 4000 members; the
                    Adventists 35 churches with 1750 members. The Roman Catholics have 39 priests in
                    charge of 79 churches and number about 25,000.</p>
                <p>Lands were set apart for the support of schools by the proprietors of townships
                    as early as 1761. Legislative provision for education dates from 1782. The
                    original educational system of the State contemplated primary schools in every
                    township, a grammar or high school in each county, and one university. Towns
                    were authorized to subdivide into districts of convenient size, each with power
                    to choose its own officers, levy taxes, and maintain a school. In 1870 the towns
                    were authorized to substitute the town for the district system, but in 1886 only
                    one in nine had made the exchange. In 1886 there were 2557 public schools of all
                    grades, with 71,667 pupils, besides 7247 in private schools. In 1880 the number
                    of persons above ten years unable to read was 12,993, or 4∙9 per cent., the
                    population between 5 and 20 being 99,463. The total revenue for school purposes
                    in 1886 was $621,370. This revenue is derived partly from funds held by the
                    State, but chiefly from town and district taxes. Facilities for advanced
                    instruction are offered by 39 public high schools and 25 incorporated academies.
                    The State has 3 normal schools, founded in 1866. Since 1874 State supervision is
                    exercised through a superintendent elected by the general assembly. The State
                    university at Burlington, chartered in 1791, was inaugurated in 1800; it
                    provides instruction in arts, engineering, chemistry, agriculture, and medicine,
                    with a teaching staff of 15 in the academic and 26 in the medical faculty; in
                    1887 there were 189 students in medicine, 148 in arts and sciences, and in all
                    departments 487. The library contains 35,300 volumes. Middlebury College
                    (Congregational), chartered in 1800, has a teaching staff of 9 with 63 students,
                    and a library of 16,000 vols. Norwich university (Episcopalian) at Northfield is
                    organized as a military school; there are 10 instructors and 56 students. The
                    State library contains 18,600 vols., the free public library of Burlington
                    18,000 vols., that of St Johnsbury 12,000, and that of Lunenburg (free but not
                    public) 14,000. In all 75 libraries were reported in 1880, 42 having over 1000
                    vols. each.</p>
                <p>The governor and chief executive officers are elected by direct vote of the male
                    citizens twenty-one years old and upwards who have resided within the State for
                    one whole year preceding the election. The general assembly, or legislative
                    body, is composed of a senate of 30 members apportioned among the 14 counties
                    according to population, and a house of representatives consisting of one member
                    from each organized township (244). The sessions of the legislature have been
                    biennial since 1870. The State election occurs in September in the even years.
                    The judiciary is elective throughout, the chief justice and 6 assistant justices
                    of the supreme court being chosen by the senate and house in joint assembly. The
                    term of service is usually a long one, by virtue of repeated re-elections. The
                    assistant judges of county courts are chosen by the freemen of the counties, and
                    justices of the peace by the several towns. The county courts hold two terms
                    annually, a justice of the supreme court presiding. A general session of the
                    supreme court is held at the capital in October or November. Probate courts are
                    held in each county, six of the counties being divided each into two probate
                    districts. The State is represented in the Federal Government by two senators
                    and two representatives, and has four votes in the electoral college. Since 1852
                    the policy of the State in regard to intoxicating liquors has been that of
                    prohibition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Vermont first became known to Europeans in 1609,
                    when Champlain explored the lake since known by his name. During the next
                    century the lake and its borders were a thoroughfare for various military
                    expeditions in the Indian and colonial wars, and several points along the lake
                    were occupied, mainly as military posts, by both French and English; but the
                    first permanent settlement was made in 1724 at Fort Dummer in the limits of
                    Brattleboro. In 1760 there were not more than 300 inhabitants, scattered along
                    the Connecticut river within 50 miles of the southern border. Both New Hampshire
                    and New York claimed jurisdiction over the territory under royal grants (see
                    vol. xvii. p. 393). By 1763 New Hampshire had chartered 138 townships west of
                    the Connecticut, and between 1765 and 1776 New York had issued grants of land,
                    covering in all 2,418,700 acres, often embracing the same territory as the New
                    Hampshire charters. The claims of New York were always stoutly, and sometimes
                    forcibly, resisted by the great majority of the settlers. In 1776 the Vermonters
                    sought admission to the provincial Congress, but through the influence of New
                    York were refused. In January 1777 they proclaimed their independence, framed a
                    State constitution, and again applied for a place in the confederacy. Congress
                    hesitated as before. In 1780 British generals made overtures to the little
                    republic, but with no result beyond a diplomatic intercourse continued until
                    1783, so managed by the envoys of Vermont as to gain time and save the State
                    from invasion. In 1782 they knocked at the doors of Congress again without
                    avail. By July 1789 New York was willing to waive its pretensions, and Vermont
                    was admitted as the fourteenth State in March 1791. In May 1775 the “Green
                    Mountain boys” under Ethan Allan and Seth Warner had captured Ticonderoga and
                    Crown Point. The battle of Bennington in August 1777 was won by the combined
                    forces of Vermont and New Hampshire. During the whole struggle the State, though
                    unrecognized, contributed its full share of men and means. In the war of 1812-14
                    Vermont is credited with 5236 soldiers in regular service, exclusive of 2500
                    volunteers who were under arms at Plattsburgh in September 1814. In the Civil
                    War of 1861-65 the State furnished more than its due quota of troops, 33,288 men
                    from a total population (1860) of 315,098. The present organized force consists
                    of but one regiment, with one battery, 565 men. The unorganized militia numbered
                    64,162 men in 1880.</p>
