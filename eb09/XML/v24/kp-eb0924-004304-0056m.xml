                    (1586-1652), to whom we owe one of the best books of Eastern travel, came of a
                    noble Roman family which had produced two cardinals, and was born, on 11th April
                    1586, in the family palace built by Cardinal Andrea. His early life was divided
                    between the pursuits of literature and arms. He saw active service against the
                    Moors of Barbary, but also became a member of the Roman Academy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Umoristi,</hi> and acquired some reputation as a versifier and
                    rhetorician. To the latter quality we owe some tedious passages in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels;</hi> but that book gives also sufficient evidence of
                    solid and useful learning in the classical authors, which served him well,
                    particularly in the first part of his wanderings. The idea of travelling in the
                    East was suggested by a disappointment in love, as an alternative to suicide,
                    and was ripened to a fixed purpose by a visit to the learned Mario Schipano,
                    professor of medicine in Naples, to whom the record of Pietro’s travels was
                    addressed in the form of very elaborate letters, based on a full diary. Before
                    leaving Naples he took a vow of pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and, sailing from
                    Venice on 8th June 1614, reached Constantinople, where he remained for more than
                    a year, and acquired a good knowledge of Turkish and a little Arabic. On 25th
                    September 1615 he sailed for Alexandria with a suite of nine persons, for he
                    travelled always as a nobleman of distinction, and with every advantage due to
                    his rank. From Alexandria he went on to Cairo, and, after an excursion to Mount
                    Sinai, left Cairo for the Holy Land on 8th March 1616, in time to assist at the
                    Easter celebrations at Jerusalem. Having sedulously visited the holy sites, he
                    journeyed by Damascus to Aleppo, and thence to Baghdad, where he married a
                    Syrian Christian named Maani, a native of Mardin. He now desired to visit
                    Persia; but, as that country was then at war with Turkey, he had to leave
                    Baghdad by stealth (4th January 1617). Accompanied by his wife, who was the
                    courageous and constant companion of his Persian journeys until her death in
                    consequence of a miscarriage (30th December 1621), he proceeded by Hamadan to
                    Ispahan, and joined Shah Abbas in a campaign in northern Persia, in the summer
                    of 1618.</p>

                <p>Here he was well received at court and treated as the shah’s guest. On his return
                    to Ispahan he was occupied with political schemes hostile to the Turk, the
                    alliance of Persia with the Cossacks and the king of Poland, and also with a
                    project for the foundation of a Catholic colony in Persia; at the same time he
                    diligently continued his Oriental studies and observations. He now began to
                    think of returning by India rather than adventure himself again in Turkey; but
                    the state of his health, and the war between Persia and the Portuguese at Ormuz,
                    created difficulties. In October 1621 he started from Ispahan, and, visiting
                    Persepolis and Shiraz, made his way to the coast; but, after long delay and many
                    troubles—his wife dying at Mina—he was forced to return to Shiraz, after the
                    capture of Ormuz, and it was not till January 1623 that he found passage for
                    Surat on the English ship “Whale.” In India he remained till November 1624, his
                    headquarters being Surat and Goa. He was at Muscat in January 1625, and at
                    Bussorah in March. In May he started by the desert route for Aleppo, and, after
                    a short stay there and a visit to Antioch, took ship at Alexandretta on a French
                    vessel. Touching at Cyprus and doing quarantine at Malta, he reached Rome on
                    28th March 1626, and he was received with much honour, not only by literary
                    circles, but by Pope Urban VIII., who appointed him a gentleman of his
                    bedchamber. The rest of his life was uneventful; he married as second wife a
                    Georgian orphan of noble family, Mariuccia (Tinatin de Ziba), whom his first
                    wife had adopted as a child, and who had accompanied him in all his journeys. By
                    her he had fourteen sons. He died at Rome on 21st April 1652.</p>
                <p>In Pietro della Valle’s lifetime there were printed (1) a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Funeral Oration on his Wife Maani,</hi> whose remains he brought with him to
                    Rome and buried there (1627); (2) an <hi rend="italic">Account of Shah
                    Abbas,</hi> printed at Venice in 1628, but not published; (3) the first part of
                    the letters describing his <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> (Turkey, 1650). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> in Persia (2 parts) were published by his sons in
                    1658, and the third part (India) in 1663. An English translation appeared in
                    1665 (fol.). Of the Italian text the edition of Brighton, 1843 (2 vols. 8vo), is
                    more esteemed than the other reprints. It contains a sketch of the author’s life
                    by Gio. P. Bellori (1622). Della Valle’s story is often prolix, with a tendency
                    to the rhetorical. He has no turn for incident, an absolute want of humour, and
                    little real literary faculty of any kind; but he is clear and exact, well
                    informed, and very instructive, so that his work still possesses high value.</p>
