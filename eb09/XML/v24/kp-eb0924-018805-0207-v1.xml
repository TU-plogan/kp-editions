                <p><label type="entry">VESICAL DISEASES</label>. The urinary bladder is the
                    temporary reservoir of the renal secretion, and as such contains the urine for
                    longer or shorter periods. In recent years diseases of the bladder have come
                    more than formerly within the scope of operative surgery, owing especially to
                    great advances in the methods of examining the inner wall of the bladder both by
                    sight and touch,—by sight in virtue of the endoscope, an instrument which when
                    introduced into the bladder enables a visual examination of the interior to be
                    made; and by touch, as surgeons do not now hesitate to make incisions into the
                    bladder, either from the perinaeum or suprapubically, for purely diagnostic
                    purposes. Further, more careful and improved chemical and microscopical
                    examination of the urine enables the surgeon to judge better than formerly what
                    the condition of the bladder is. Diseases of the bladder may be conveniently
                    divided into two groups,—(1) those which involve recognizable organic structural
                    change, and (2) those which do not necessarily involve obvious organic
                    structural change (Sir H. Thompson). The more important diseases of the first
                    class are inflammation or cystitis, calculi, and neoplastic growths; but there
                    are also others of less importance, such as hypertrophy, dilatation, and
                    tuberculosis. The diseases of the second group in which no organic structural
                    change can be recognized in the bladder-wall are numerous. In many cases,
                    however, they can scarcely be considered as diseases of the bladder pure and
                    simple, but rather as concomitants or results of other diseases. Moreover, in
                    many cases they give rise sooner or later to diseases which are accompanied by
                    structural changes. Thus “irritable bladder,” although at first it may be
                    independent of any such change, soon gives rise to inflammation of the
                    bladder-wall, or cystitis; and many surgeons describe it from the beginning as
                    simple cystitis, while cystitis as described in this article they call catarrhal
                    cystitis. In this division, however, we may describe paralysis, atony,
                    incontinence of urine, stammering micturition, and retention of urine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cystitis.—</hi> Inflammation of the bladder may be acute or
                    chronic. It is due in most cases to the presence of irritating matters in the
                    urine, produced by decomposition of the urine itself or by morbid admixture. The
                    inflammation may result also from traumatic injury, from cold, or in cases of
                    gonorrhoea from extension of the inflammation along the urethra into the bladder
                    (through continuity of tissue). Although frequently ushered in by rigors, the
                    chief symptoms of acute inflammation are local: there is pain over the region of
                    the bladder and frequent micturition. The desire to pass water is often
                    incontrollable, even before more than one or two ounces of urine have been
                    secreted. The urine is much changed in its character, being cloudy from the
                    presence of epithelial scales, pus, mucus cells, and often blood. At this stage
                    also it may be ammoniacal, though this usually comes on later, and is probably
                    caused by septic decomposition of the mine due to the entrance or introduction
                    of organisms into the bladder. The quantity of blood varies, but may be so large
                    as to give the urine a distinct reddish tinge. As a rule, the mucous membrane at
                    the neck of the bladder is the first part to become inflamed, but the whole of
                    the mucous membrane may be affected; resolution, however, usually takes place
                    before more than a portion has been attacked. Chronic cystitis is one of the
                    most common affections of the bladder, and its causes are very various. It
                    sometimes remains after an acute attack has passed off, but more commonly it
                    results from long-continued irritation, such as may be produced by a urinary
                    calculus in or by atony of the bladder. The symptoms are not so severe as in
                    acute cystitis: the urine contains more mucus, but less pus and blood, and there
                    is much less tendency to frequent micturition, the irritability of the bladder
                    being greatly diminished. Frequently very large quantities of mucus are
                    secreted, and the condition is then termed "catarrh of the bladder.” Chronic
                    inflammation is not in itself dangerous; but the patient, so long as it remains,
                    is liable to an attack of acute cystitis, which, superadded to the pre-existing
                    condition of the bladder, may be very serious. An increase in the fibrous
                    elements of the coats of the bladder and hypertrophy of the muscular fibres are
                    a common result of chronic cystitis.</p>
                <p>The treatment in both varieties of the disease consists in giving rest to the
                    inflamed part and in alleviating the pain. Hot sitz-baths may be used two or
                    three times daily for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour at a time; and, if the
                    pain be very severe, hot fomentations with tincture of opium should be applied
                    to the perinaeum or hypogastrium, or a hot douche may be used per rectum.</p>

                <p>Diluent drinks are given, and tincture of hyoscyamus may be prescribed, as it has
                    a very soothing influence. It may be necessary to give morphia, but generally
                    the pain can be allayed without its use. In chronic cystitis the treatment
                    depends very much on the cause, which must if possible be removed. Thus, if the
                    cystitis is due to a calculus in the bladder, the treatment is to remove the
                    calculus (see below). Very often, however, special remedies are employed to
                    relieve the inflammatory condition, and one of the best is washing out the
                    bladder. This is a simple operation, based on the principle of siphon action
                    with a head of water, and is carried out as follows. A catheter is introduced
                    through the urethra into the bladder, and to it the stem of a T-shaped tube is
                    fixed; to each end of the horizontal part a piece of rubber tubing is attached,
                    one piece terminating in a vessel which contains an aseptic warm lotion and is
                    placed at a higher level than the bladder, while the other is led into a
                    receptacle placed lower than the bladder. Six or eight ounces of the lotion are
                    allowed to flow into the bladder; then the flow is checked, and the fluid passes
                    out from the bladder through the other tube. Each tube should have a stop-cock,
                    so that the surgeon can open or close it as he desires. Occasionally bladder
                    drainage is resorted to, and is carried out on the principle of siphon
                        action.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of the most valuable being benzoate of soda. The benzoate in its passage through
                    the blood is changed into hippuric acid, and thus tends to render the urine less
                    alkaline. Attention to the diet of the patient is of great importance in both
                    acute and chronic cystitis; it should be very light, easily digested, and
                    nutritious. Diluents are often of much value, lessening the irritability of the
                    bladder.· All wines and stimulants should be avoided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calculi.—</hi> Important information, as we have already said,
                    is derived both by the surgeon and physician from a careful examination of the
                    urine, whether this be done chemically or microscopically. Not infrequently on
                    such examination crystals, varying in their chemical and physical characters,
                    are found, and if these be in large amount distinct urinary deposits are got
                    from the urine after it has been kept in a vessel for a time. The cause
                    producing these crystals or their presence alone may give rise to disease, as,
                    for instance, oxaluria, a condition in which, in addition to other symptoms, we
                    find oxalate of lime crystals present in the urine. We have here to deal,
                    however, with more than the mere presence of a few crystals disseminated in the
                    urine, viz., with those conditions in which an amalgamation of crystals has
                    occurred, giving rise to a concretion of such deposits into a mass, forming a
                    calculus or stone. When such concretions are so small that they can be passed
                    with the urine through the urethra they are known as <hi rend="italic"
                        >gravel</hi>; but when they are prevented by their size from passing along
                    the urethra they are termed <hi rend="italic">calculi,</hi> and the patient is
                    said to suffer from stone or calculus. Calculus of the bladder constitutes a
                    most formidable and important disease, and its treatment, either medical or
                    surgical, has probably attracted more attention than that of almost any other
                    disease. Urinary calculi occur in all parts of the world and affect both sexes.
                    They are much more common, however, in some regions than in others. Thus, in
                    India they are very common, while in Great Britain, although many persons suffer
                    from calculus in Norfolk and the north of Scotland, very few cases occur among
                    people who live on the western side of the island. From the above facts many
                    have attributed the formation of calculi to special climatic or geological
                    influences, but it is probable that diet acts as a chief factor in their
                    production. Calculi are much rarer in females than in males, and this may
                    perhaps be explained by the shortness and more vertical position of the urethra,
                    so that the contents of the bladder can be more easily evacuated, and by the
                    fact that the habits of the female with regard to diet are more regular than
                    those of the male. The cause of the formation of a calculus may be (<hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>) a tendency in the kidneys to precipitate salts to an
                    abnormal degree, the urine being concentrated and small in amount, or (<hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi>) some abnormal state of the urine in the bladder, or
                        (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the presence of a foreign body in the bladder.
                    Probably the last is the most common cause; for very frequently, when a section
                    of a calculus is made, it is found that some form of foreign body has acted as
                    the nucleus round which urinary deposits have become agglutinated. Such foreign
                    bodies may exist in the bladder or may be introduced from without. Occasionally
                    clots of blood have been found as the nucleus; but one of the commonest is a
                    small uric acid stone, which, having been formed in the kidney, has passed down
                    the ureter into the bladder and there been surrounded by deposits of phosphate
                    of lime, &amp;c. Calculi vary much in their physical characters and chemical
                    constitution. Most frequently only a single stone is present; but very large
                    numbers have been removed from one bladder. The shape of the stone depends on
                    whether it be movable or fixed, and whether there be only one or more in the
                    bladder. A single stone is usually spherical or ovoid, but may be smooth or
                    tuberculated or spinous, this last point being determined chiefly by the
                    composition of the stone; when there are a number of stones present they are
                    usually faceted or many-</p>
                <p>sided. Some stones are hard; others are soft. In size and weight they vary very
                    much: we find them as small as a pea and as large as a child’s head. The largest
                    stone found in the bladder of a human being is in the Royal College of Surgeons’
                    museum of England; and in the Edinburgh university surgical museum there is a
                    stone of very large size. The weight depends not only on the size but also on
                    the composition, and varies from a few grains to the heaviest on record, which
                    weighed 6 lb 3 oz.</p>
                <p>Seven different kinds of calculi are described, but only three are very common.
                    Vesical calculi are classified according to their composition, and five
                    different forms are very generally recognized; but layers of different salts may
                    be found in the same calculus. (1) The first class embraces <hi rend="italic"
                        >uric acid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uratic</hi> calculi. Pure uric acid
                    stones are small and hard, and usually vary in colour from a reddish orange to a
                    brown tint. They are frequently rough, but may be smooth. Uratic stones are
                    seldom pure. They frequently form the nucleus of calculi the outer layers of
                    which are phosphatic. (2) <hi rend="italic">Phosphatic</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">calcareous</hi> calculi consist chiefly of calcium phosphate;
                    stones formed purely of the carbonate of calcium are rare. The stones of this
                    group are white, soft, and friable, especially those composed of phosphate of
                    lime. They frequently attain to a large size, and most commonly occur in persons
                    whose general health has run down to a low ebb. (3) <hi rend="italic">Oxalate of
                        lime</hi> calculi are excessively hard and dense, of a dark brown colour and
                    tuberculated or spinous on their surface; hence they are often called mulberry
                    calculi. This is a form which gives rise to great pain and irritation, so that
                    they are generally removed before they become very large. (4) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cystine</hi> and (5) <hi rend="italic">xanthin</hi> calculi are rare.</p>
                <p>When a stone is present in the bladder, whatever its nature, it acts similarly to
                    any other foreign body, and usually gives rise to a series of definite symptoms.
                    The patient complains of pain in the end of the penis at the completion of
                    micturition. Rough or jolting movements give rise to pain in the region of the
                    bladder. Occasionally there is a sudden stoppage of the flow of urine, which is
                    overcome by a change in position. He suffers from frequency of micturition, just
                    as in any other irritable condition of the bladder. If, in addition to these
                    symptoms, the patient states that at varying intervals he has passed “gravel,”
                    the surgeon is almost certain that a calculus is present; but even with all
                    these symptoms there is only one certain diagnostic sign of the presence of a
                    stone, and that is to feel it. This is done by " sounding” the bladder with a
                    sound,—an instrument resembling a bougie, but made of steel and with a shorter
                    curve. It can be easily turned from side to side within the bladder, the whole
                    of which must be systematically examined, and not only enables the surgeon to
                    ascertain the presence of a stone but, when judiciously used, assists him in
                    determining the size, mobility, situation, number, and hardness of the calculi.
                    This additional information is of the utmost importance in guiding the surgeon
                    to the best method of treatment. In the child the stone can be occasionally felt
                    by passing one finger into the rectum, laying the other hand above the pubes,
                    and pressing; the stone lies between the two hands. In other cases the size can
                    be gauged with the lithotrite, by observing the distance to which the blades are
                    separated when the stone is grasped.</p>
                <p>The treatment of calculi by other means than operative surgery has been found to
                    be of very little value. Attempts have been made to dissolve calculi by internal
                    remedies or by the injection of chemical agents into the bladder; but, although
                    many such methods have been used, and have for a time in many cases been
                    apparently successful, they have without exception been found in the long run to
                    be practically worthless for removing calculi once actually formed. Further, the
                    improvements in operative means for the removal of calculi have advanced to such
                    a degree that it is probably better for a patient, in our present state of
                    knowledge, to be treated by some one of them rather than undergo any attempt at
                    their removal by other means. Nevertheless much can be done towards preventing
                    the formation of calculi in those who have a tendency to their formation, by
                    attention to diet and by the internal administration of drugs.</p>
                <p>Urinary calculi are removed by one of three methods,—(i. ) lithotomy or cutting
                    for stone, (ii.) lithotrity or crushing the stone, and (iii. ) litholapaxy, a
                    modification of lithotrity, and the method now most commonly adopted. In about
                    nine cases out of every ten the stone may be crushed; but occasionally there are
                    some circumstances which render the operation of lithotomy preferable to
                    lithotrity. Thus, where the urethra is constricted, as in organic stricture or
                    enlarged prostate, or where the stone is very large or extremely hard, it is
                    right to cut for the stone instead of making any attempt to crash it. Again, in
                    children lithotomy is safer than lithotrity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lithotomy.—</hi> Cutting for stone has been very long known and
                    practised by surgeons; but up to the commencement of the 19th century it was
                    performed only by a few men, who, bolder than their contemporaries, had
                    specially worked at it and had attained celebrity as skilful lithotomists.
                    Patients went very long distances to be operated on by them, and certain of the
                    older surgeons, as Cheselden, performed a large number of operations with very
                        successful<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0209-0190"/> results. The operation is usually performed
                    by an incision from the perinaeum; but sometimes it is necessary to adopt the
                    high or suprapubic incision. The former method is termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >perineal</hi> lithotomy, and, as the incision most commonly made by the
                    surgeon is a lateral one, it is ordinarily spoken of as <hi rend="italic"
                        >lateral</hi> lithotomy. Lateral lithotomy consists of two distinct
                    stages,—(i.) cutting into the bladder and (ii.) removing the stone. The patient
                    is placed on a table and brought under the influence of an anaesthetic. A
                    grooved staff is passed along the urethra into the bladder to act as a guide for
                    the knife, and the patient is then “tied up in the lithotomy position.” An
                    assistant holds the staff in the middle line of the body and the surgeon makes
                    an incision an inch and a half in length deeply into the perinaeum, until the
                    knife enters the groove of the staff, and then passes it along the groove, thus
                    making an opening through the bladder-wall. The bladder having been thus cut
                    into, a pair of lithotomy forceps is introduced by the perineal wound, and the
                    stone is caught and removed by gently withdrawing the forceps by a rotatory
                    movement. A lithotomy tube is now passed through the wound into the bladder and
                    fixed in position; the patient is untied and carried back to bed. The operation
                    of lithotomy is not a difficult one to perform, nor is it in itself dangerous;
                    sometimes, however, there is a fatal termination, due commonly to one or other
                    of the following causes—haemorrhage (either primary or secondary), organic
                    disease of the urinary organs, or blood poisoning. Haemorrhage may be the result
                    of unskilful operating, the incision having been incorrectly made; or one of the
                    larger vessels in this neighbourhood may have had an abnormal distribution, so
                    that, lying in the line of the incision, it was divided and gave rise to the
                    bleeding which proved fatal. If the stone be a very large one, or the perinaeum
                    very narrow, it is necessary to perform the suprapubic operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Litholapaxy.—</hi> Lithotrity too can be best described if
                    considered under two headings,—(i.) the crushing of the stone and (ii.) the
                    removal of the detritus. The two stages are now carried out at “one sitting,”
                    instead of allowing an interval to elapse between them, as was formerly the
                    practice, and the term <hi rend="italic">litholapaxy</hi> is used to designate
                    this method. The patient having been anaesthetized, the urethra is dilated by
                    the passage of large-sized bougies. Then a few ounces of a warm neutral aseptic
                    fluid are injected into the bladder, and the crashing instrument, the
                    lithotrite, is passed along the urethra into the bladder. The lithotrite has two
                    blades,—a “male’’and a “female,”—the latter fenestrated, the former solid with
                    its surface notched; these blades can be approximated both by a sliding and a
                    screwing movement. The sliding movement is used to grasp the stone; but when the
                    stone is fixed between the blades the screw action is used, as it enables great
                    pressure to be applied evenly, gradually, and continuously. The lithotrite is
                    made of very tough steel, so that even very hard stones may be crushed without
                    any danger of the instrument breaking. It is passed into the bladder with its
                    blades closed; they are then opened and an attempt made to grasp the stone. The
                    stone having been fixed between the blades by the sliding movement, it is then
                    crushed with the screw action, great care being taken not to catch the
                    bladder-wall with the lithotrite. This danger is avoided by raising the point of
                    the lithotrite immediately after grasping the stone and before crashing is
                    begun. The stone breaks into two or more pieces, and these fragments must next
                    be caught and crushed one by one, until they are all reduced to a very small
                    size. If the stone be large and hard, half an hour or longer may be required to
                    crush it sufficiently. When the surgeon fails to catch any more large portions
                    of stone, the presumption is that it has been broken up into small enough
                    pieces; the lithotrite is then withdrawn and the second stage of the operation
                    must be begun. This consists in removing the detritus by means of an aspirator,
                    the best form of which is that invented and used by Sir Henry Thompson. It
                    consists of an elastic bag connected with a trap, into which fragments of stone
                    will fall and not pass out again on the instrument being used at later periods
                    in the operation. A large catheter, with the eye very near the distal end of the
                    short curve, is passed into the bladder; the aspirator, full of an aseptic
                    fluid, is attached to the catheter, and a few ounces of the fluid are expressed
                    from the aspirator into the bladder by squeezing the india-rubber bag. When the
                    pressure is taken off the bag, it dilates and draws by suction the fluid out of
                    the bladder, and with it some of the detritus of the crashed stone, which falls
                    into the trap, and is not expelled on the fluid being re-introduced into the
                    bladder. This manoeuvre is repeated again and again, until all the fragments aud
                    detritus of the stone have been removed. After the operation the patient
                    sometimes suffers from pain and discomfort; but these are not at all severe
                    unless some fragments have been left in the bladder. If the pain be severe, it
                    can very generally be relieved by hot fomentations or a sitz-bath. The patient
                    must be kept in bed for some days after the operation, and in cases where the
                    stone has been large and the bladder irritable the surgeon should insist on him
                    remaining in bed for at least a week. Judging by statistics, the dangers of the
                    operation, if it be gone about with care, are not nearly so great as those of
                    lithotomy, and certainly in those cases which go on favourably the patients are
                    much sooner able to perform their ordinary duties. Fatal terminations, however,
                    do now and again occur, sometimes as a result of injury to the bladder-wall
                    setting up inflammation, which extends to the kidneys, sometimes from
                    suppression of urine. Those cases in which there has been a fatal result most
                    frequently have been complicated with old-standing kidney disease.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Neoplastic Growths.—</hi> The commonest neoplasms found in the
                    bladder are vascular fibromata (often called villous cancers) and epitheliomata;
                    more rarely malignant growths occur. The symptoms produced by tumours vary; but
                    they may cause obstruction to the flow of urine and chronic cystitis, with more
                    or less severe pain. The most important signs are the passage of blood and the
                    presence of tumour cells in the urine. Frequently, however, microscopical
                    examination of the urine fails to discover the presence of tumour cells. The
                    passage of blood may be very intermittent and small in amount; but this
                    intermittent bleeding is one of the most characteristic signs of the existence
                    of a tumour. When the presence of a tumour is suspected, the sound is passed and
                    an attempt made to feel it. Sometimes it can be felt, but more often doubt
                    remains as to whether a tumour does really exist or not. In such cases the
                    endoscope may be had recourse to; but the information derived from its use is
                    not always satisfactory, and a diagnostic incision must then be made into the
                    bladder to verify the diagnosis. When such a diagnostic incision is made, the
                    surgeon must be prepared to remove the tumour, should one be present and capable
                    of removal. Usually the diagnostic incision is perineal; but, if the bladder is
                    capacious, or if the perinaeum is deep and narrow, a more complete examination
                    can be made by a suprapubic opening. The treatment of neoplasms is, as a rale,
                    unsatisfactory. If the growth be pedunculated, it can be removed without great
                    risk to the patient; more commonly, however, the tumour cannot be removed, and
                    then only palliative measures can be adopted, such as allaying the pain and
                    checking the haemorrhage. Great relief is often given by washing out the
                    bladder; but this must be done with very great care, a soft flexible catheter
                    being used, if it can be passed into the bladder, in preference to a rigid
                    one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hypertrophy and Dilatation.—</hi> When there is long-continued
                    obstruction to the flow of urine, as in stricture of the urethra, enlarged
                    prostate, &amp;c., the bladder-wall becomes much thickened, the muscular fibres
                    increasing both in size and number; the interstitial fibrous tissue is also
                    increased. The wall on its inner surface becomes rugose, and the condition is
                    technically known as <hi rend="italic">hypertrophy.</hi> Hypertrophy may be
                    accompanied by <hi rend="italic">dilatation</hi> of the bladder, a condition
                    which the bladder may assume when from any cause the evacuation of its contents
                    is interfered with for a length of time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paralysis</hi> of the bladder is a want of contractile power in
                    the muscular fibres of the bladder-wall. It may result from injuries whereby the
                    spinal cord is lacerated or pressed upon at or below the micturitory centre
                    situated in the lumbar region. The result may be either retention or
                    incontinence of urine: sometimes there is at first retention, which later on is
                    followed by incontinence, while in other cases incontinence results in the first
                    place and then retention. Paralysis is also produced in certain nervous
                    diseases, as in locomotor ataxia, and in various cerebral lesions, as in
                    apoplexy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Atony</hi> of the bladder differs from paralysis in being only
                    a paresis or partial paralysis. It is due to a want of tone in the muscular
                    fibres, and is most frequently the result of habitual overdistension of the
                    bladder, such as may occur in cases of enlargement of the prostate. The patient
                    is unable to empty the bladder, and the condition of atony gets increasingly
                    worse.</p>
                <p>In both paralysis and atony the indication is to carefully prevent
                    over-distension of the bladder by the urine being retained too long, and at the
                    same time to treat by appropriate means the cause which has produced or is
                    keeping up the condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Incontinence of urine</hi> may occur in the adult or in the
                    child, but is due to widely different causes in the two cases. In the child it
                    may be simply a bad habit, the child not having been properly trained; but more
                    frequently there seems to be a want of control in the micturitory centre, so
                    that the child passes its water unwittingly, especially during the night. In
                    adults it is not so much a condition of incontinence in the sense of water being
                    passed against the will, but is rather due to a difficulty in retaining the
                    urine in consequence generally of an over-full bladder,—the water which passes
                    being the overflow from a too full reservoir. It is usually caused by an
                    obstruction external to the bladder, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> enlarged
                    prostate or stricture of the urethra. Occasionally the presence of a calculus
                    may produce the condition. The treatment differs in the case of the child and of
                    the adult. In the child an attempt must be made to improve the tone of the
                    micturitory centre by the use of belladonna or strychnia internally and of a
                    blister or faradism externally over the lumbar region, and every effort should
                    be made to train the child to pass its water at stated times and regular
                    intervals. In the adult the cause which produces the overdistension must be
                    removed if possible; but as a rale the patient has to be provided with a
                    catheter, which he can pass into his bladder and thus thoroughly empty it before
                    it has filled to overflowing<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0210-0191"/>. A soft flexible catheter should be given in
                    preference to a rigid or semi-rigid one. The best form is the red-rubber
                    catheter.</p>
                <p>The condition termed by Sir James Paget <hi rend="italic">stammering
                        micturition</hi> is frequently seen in young men, more rarely in children
                    and adults. This stammering of the urinary apparatus is analogous to speech
                    stammering, and occurs chiefly in those who are nervous and easily put out. It
                    would seem to be due to incoordination of the sphincter and detrusor of the
                    bladder, the former not relaxing synchronously with the contraction of the
                    detrusor, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> and is sometimes caused by
                    external irritation, such as preputial adhesions. Occasionally not a drop of
                    urine can be passed, or a little passes and then a sudden stoppage of the flow
                    occurs, and the more the patient strains the worse he becomes, until at last
                    there is complete retention of urine. Very usually such errors in micturition
                    can be cured by the removal of irritating causes, if they exist, and in these
                    cases, as well as in those in which no such cause can be discovered, great care
                    should be taken to avoid those difficulties which have given rise to the
                    patient’s worst failures. If at any time he should fail to perform the act of
                    micturition, he ought not to strain, but should quietly wait for a little before
                    making any further effort, after which he will often succeed. Regularity in the
                    times of making water is also of much importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Retention of urine</hi> cannot be called a disease of the
                    bladder, but may be the cause of, or result from, bladder disease. It may occur
                    in paralysis of the bladder, or in conditions where the patient is suffering
                    from an illness which blunts the nervous sensibility, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> typhoid fever. It is, however, much more commonly due to
                    obstruction in some part of the urinary passage anterior to the bladder, as in
                    stricture of the urethra or enlargement of the prostate. The patient can usually
                    tell when he last passed any urine; but, even when no such information can be
                    obtained, there are signs which lead the surgeon to a correct diagnosis. Thus,
                    the bladder if much distended can be felt as a rounded swelling above the pubes,
                    and it may even have passed to the level of the umbilicus. Percussion of the
                    hypogastrium gives a dull note. When retention of urine occurs and the bladder
                    is over-distended, it is necessary to evacuate its contents as soon as possible.
                    If there is no obstruction to the flow of urine, the retention being due merely
                    to atony or paralysis of the bladder, a flexible soft catheter is passed into
                    the bladder and the water drawn off. But, when there is an obstruction which
                    cannot be overcome, aspiration of the bladder has to be resorted to, the needle
                    of the aspirator being pushed through the abdominal wall into the bladder. The
                    point of puncture in the abdominal wall is in the middle line just above the
                    symphysis pubis. The bladder has been aspirated in this way very many times in
                    the same person without any evil result. But in all cases strict antiseptic
                    precautions must be adopted. (J. C. )</p>
