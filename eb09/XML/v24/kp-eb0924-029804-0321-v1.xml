                <p><label type="entry">VOSGES</label>, a frontier department of eastern France, was
                    formed in 1790, for the most part of territory previously belonging to Lorraine,
                    with fragments of Franche-Comté, Champagne, and Alsace. The portion belonging to
                    Alsace was ceded to Germany in 1871. Lying between 47° 48' and 48° 32' N. lat.,
                    and 5° 22' and 7° 10' E. long., the department is bounded by Alsace-Lorraine on
                    the E. and by the departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle on the N., Meuse on the
                    N.W., Haute-Marne on the W., and Haute-Saône on <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0322-0299"/> the S. The Vosges Mountains form a natural
                    boundary on the E. The highest point is the Hohneck (4482 feet) near the
                    Schlucht. The south of the department is traversed by the Monts Faucilles (2000
                    feet), which form part of the European watershed, separating the basins of the
                    Rhine and the Rhone. The Moselle and the Meuse, tributaries of the Rhine, have
                    the largest drainage areas in the department; a small district in the north-west
                    belongs to the basin of the Seine (Ornain and Marne), the rest to that of the
                    Rhone. The Moselle rises in the Col de Bussang, and in a N.W. course of 75 miles
                    receives the Moselotte and Vologne on the right; the Mortagne and the Meurthe on
                    the right and the Madon on the left bank also belong to Vosges, though they join
                    the Moselle outside the department. The source of the Saône is on the south-east
                    slope of the Monts Faucilles, and the Canal de l'Est follows the course of the
                    Coney, a tributary of the left bank. The height above the sea, the northward
                    exposure of the valleys, and the impervious subsoil combine to make the climate
                    severe; the average temperature at Épinal (1070 feet) is 49° F. The annual
                    rainfall is 24 inches at Épinal, 31 at St Dié, and more in the mountains.</p>
                <p>Of a total area of 1,452,181 acres, arable land occupies 603,201 acres, grass
                    199,839, wood 361,526, heath, pasture, and uncultivated land 81,486, and
                    vineyards 12,054. The live stock in 1881 included 31,811 horses (of a small but
                    strong breed), 357 asses and mules, 143,827 cattle, 45,634 sheep, 81,488 pigs,
                    19,615 goats, more than 17,000 dogs, 500,000 head of poultry; 17,952 beehives
                    yielded 43 tons 7 cwts. of honey and 18 tons 11 cwts. of wax. 872 tons of cheese
                    were made at Gérardmer. The crops in 1884 were—wheat 1,911,470 bushels, meslin
                    494,483, rye 710,627, barley 103,262, oats 3,225,755, buckwheat 63,409, potatoes
                    17,787,404, dry vegetables 45,974, fodder beetroot 25,060 tons, tobacco 33 tons,
                    hops 79 tons, hemp seed 138 tons, hemp 99 tons, linseed 39 tons, flax 22 tons,
                    hemp, flax, and poppy oils 94 tons, colza seed 206 tons, fodder 457,383 tons,
                    wine 2,869,000 gallons (average of preceding ten years 3,964,441). The
                    department stands first in France for the extent and importance of the woods
                    under forest rule, though only third for the actual area of forest land. The
                    state owns one-third of the forests, private individuals one-fifth, and the
                    communes the rest. Oaks, beeches, hornbeams, birches, aspens, and maples thrive
                    on the plains, beeches and oaks on the higher grounds, and firs, beeches, and
                    pines on the mountains. The annual value of timber produced is £280,000, and
                    9,000,000 fir planks, besides other kinds, are annually cut in 300 sawmills.
                    Traces of gold are found, and the department contains silver and lead mines,
                    copper ore, iron ore (4530 tons of iron annually), zinc, manganese, cobalt, and
                    antimony. In 1884, 681 tons of coal were mined, and in 1882 1595 tons of peat
                    were dug; 1336 persons are employed in 432 quarries of marble, sandstone,
                    granite, and building and lithographic stones. The department is rich in hot,
                    cold, sulphate, sodic, calcium, iron, bicarbonate, and gaseous mineral springs.
                    Those at Plombières were known to the Romans. 37,000 hands are employed in the
                    manufacture of pig and cast iron (for all which wood is the chief fuel) and
                    wares of iron and steel. The cotton industry (135,000 looms and 423,724
                    spindles) has been largely developed since 1871; canvas and linen are woven at
                    Gérardmer (3000 looms). The manufacture of cloth employs 500 workmen, of lace
                    1000, embroidery by the hand and loom 40,000 workwomen, silk spinning 1000
                    spindles. Wool is spun and hosiery manufactured. Coopers’ work (over 300 tons)
                    is exported, as are also sabots. At Épinal several hundred workmen are engaged
                    in the manufacture of images; and musical instruments are made at Mirecourt.
                    1000 workmen are employed in glass-works, and 1937 in paper-mills (10,000 tons
                    of paper and cardboard). The department contains in all 409 industrial
                    establishments; 200,000 tons of coal are imported. There are 281 miles of
                    railway, 177 of national roads, and 3096 of other roads. The Eastern Canal
                    connects the Saône with the Moselle and Meuse. The population in 1881 was
                    408,862, of whom 189,176 were engaged in agriculture and 131,253 in
                    manufactures; the population in 1886 was 413,707. The department forms the
                    diocese of St Dié, has its court of appeal and academy at Nancy, belongs to the
                    district of the corps d’armée of Châlons-sur-Marne, and is divided for
                    administrative purposes into 5 arrondissements (Épinal, Mirecourt, Neufchâteau,
                    Remiremont, St Dié), 29 cantons, and 530 communes. The chef-lieu is Épinal.</p>
