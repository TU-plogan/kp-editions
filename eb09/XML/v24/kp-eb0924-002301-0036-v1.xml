                <p>V is our twenty-second letter; it represents the voiced labio-dental to which F
                    corresponds as the voiceless sound. It has been shown under U that these two
                    symbols were originally one, and that their differentiation took place for
                    convenience of writing only. But it was afterwards put to a good use, although
                    not quite the natural one. It would have been better, while retaining <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi> for the vowel, to have used <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    for the corresponding labial consonant, which is actually denoted by <hi
                        rend="italic">w.</hi> The difference of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi> is simply that of vowel and consonant: for <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi> there is a sufficient opening of the lips to allow the
                    voice to pass through without friction; but for <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the
                    aperture is so much closed, by bringing together either the inner edges of the
                    lips (as in England) or the outer edges (as in some parts of Germany), that
                    there is an audible amount of friction as the voice passes. The organs employed
                    are the lips only in each case, whereas for <hi rend="italic">v</hi> the upper
                    teeth and the lower lip are the factors of the sound.</p>
                <p>The symbol <hi rend="italic">v</hi> does not occur in the oldest of our texts; it
                    is represented by <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, as in “heofon,” “ofer,” “hlaford”
                    (lord). The <hi rend="italic">f</hi> generally is voiced when medial, but
                    voiceless when initial. This absence of two symbols for the corresponding pairs
                    of fricative consonants has been noted already in the use of d (or þ) for both
                        <hi rend="italic">th</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> (see under T); <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> also did duty, as it often does still, for both <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> In Middle English <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi> appears commonly for <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> The
                    introduction of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> into English writing is due to French
                    scribes; as a matter of fact almost all the words which begin with <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> are of French origin.</p>
                <p>It is tolerably certain that in Latin <hi rend="italic">v</hi> represented the
                    labial and not the labio-dental consonant. The arguments in favour of this view
                    are singly not very important, but they are fairly numerous. The interchange of
                    the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> sounds, as in “genua”
                    and “genva,” “solvo” and “soluo,” &amp;c., is most easily explained on the
                    hypothesis that <hi rend="italic">υ = w,</hi> so are the loss of <hi
                        rend="italic">v,</hi> as in “audi(v)i,” “ama(ve)ram,” &amp;c., and the
                    retention of o after <hi rend="italic">v</hi> in words like “cervos” (whereas in
                    other combinations o sank to <hi rend="italic">u),</hi> because “cer-woos” would
                    have been a more inconvenient combination than “cervoos.” Again, the name of the
                    letter should have been “ev,” not “ve,” like all other fricative sounds, “ef,”
                    “el,” “es,” &amp;c.; but in explosives “be,” “de,” “pe,” “te,” with the vowel
                        <hi rend="italic">following.</hi> There is no reason why this should not
                    have been the case if <hi rend="italic">v</hi> were really our <hi rend="italic"
                        >v,</hi> a labio-dental; but if it was <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the name
                    “ew” was practically impossible, because the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> would have
                    been inaudible; therefore it went over to the other class of names. To these
                    arguments may be added others drawn from transliteration. Mr A. J. Ellis <hi
                        rend="italic">(E. E. P.,</hi> ii. p. 513) agrees that Latin <hi
                        rend="italic">υ</hi> cannot have been our labio-dental, but he thinks it
                    probable that it was the South-German <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which differs
                    from the North-German <hi rend="italic">w</hi> (our <hi rend="italic">v,</hi>
                    labio-dental) in the manner described above, with some other points of
                    difference. His chief ground is that it is hard to imagine <hi rend="italic"
                        >w</hi> producing <hi rend="italic">v</hi> except through an intermediate
                    labial of the North-German kind. There is something in this argument. In any
                    case the difference between these two <hi rend="italic">w</hi>-sounds is slight
                    compared with the difference between either of them and the labio-dental <hi
                        rend="italic">v.</hi> At what time the labial passed into the labio-dental
                    of the Romance languages is uncertain. We can fix limits of time before which
                    the change must have taken place: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> it must have been
                    before the time when the Romanized Gauls, trying to pronounce the Teutonic <hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi> in “werra,” “ward,” &amp;c., produced “guerra,”
                    “guard,” &amp;c. If their <hi rend="italic">v</hi> had then had the <hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi>-sound there would have been no difficulty in producing
                    the same sound in Teutonic words.</p>
                <p>In the Roman system of numerals V stands for five. The reason is uncertain. The
                    old view that it represents half ten (X), as D (500) represents half a thousand
                    (M, originally Φ), has no very high degree of probability. It is perhaps as
                    likely that I., II., III., IIII., denoted the uplifted fingers used in counting,
                    and that V denoted the whole hand with the thumb on one side and the four
                    fingers together on the other.</p>
