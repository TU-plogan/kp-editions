                <p><label type="entry">VARNISH</label>. A varnish is a fluid preparation which, when
                    spread out in thin layers, dries either by evaporation or by chemical action
                    into a hard, transparent, and glossy film. Varnishes are used to communicate
                    lustre and brilliance to many different kinds of dressed surfaces, —metal-work,
                    wood, paint, paper, leather, &amp;c.,—and to protect such surfaces from the
                    influence of air and damp. The chief requisites of a good varnish are that it
                    forms a firmly-adherent layer on the surface over which it is spread, that it
                    dries hard, yet with sufficient elasticity and tenacity not to crack with
                    changes of temperature, that it forms a glossy durable surface, and that it
                    dries quickly. The materials which almost exclusively form the permanent body of
                    varnishes are the drying oils and resinous substances, the chief of which are
                    the copals, lac, dammar, elemi, amber, sandarac, mastic, and rosin. For certain
                    forms of varnish the drying oils themselves act as the solvent for the resins,
                    but in other cases volatile solvents are employed. The solvents chiefly used are
                    methylated spirit, wood spirit, ether, benzin, and turpentine and other
                    essential oils. Soluble colouring ingredients are also, in some cases, used in
                    varnishes and lacquers, those principally available being gamboge, dragon’s
                    blood, aloes, cochineal, turmeric, and coal-tar dyes.</p>
                <p>According to the solvents employed, the ordinary kinds of varnish are divided
                    into three classes,—(1) spirit, (2) turpentine, and (3) oil varnishes. Spirit
                    varnishes dry with great rapidity owing to the volatilization of the solvent
                    spirit, leaving a coating of pure resin of great hardness and brilliance, but
                    the film is deficient in tenacity, cracking and scaling readily on exposure. The
                    resin lac, either as grain, shell, or bleached lac, is the basis of most spirit
                    varnishes; but sandarac is also largely used, and to these are added in varying
                    proportions the softer resins,—elemi, Venice turpentine, Canada balsam, mastic,
                    &amp;c.,—which give elasticity and tenacity to the varnish. The solvent is
                    almost exclusively methylated spirit. The resins are ground and mixed with
                    powdered glass, which prevents the resinous particles from agglutinating, and
                    thus facilitates the solvent action of the spirit. The solution is effected by
                    agitation in closed vessels with the aid of heat, and the varnish when strained
                    off must be kept tightly closed from the air. Spirit varnishes are used
                    principally for cabinet-work and turnery, stationery, gilding, and metal-work.
                    Coloured spirit varnishes and lacquers are largely employed for metal-work, for
                    imitation gilding and bronzing, for toys, &amp;c. Turpentine is the solvent
                    principally used for making dammar varnish, the solution being effected by
                    powdering the resin and boiling it with a proportion of spirit of turpentine,
                    after which more turpentine is added in the cold state to bring the preparation
                    to a proper consistency. To increase the tenacity of such dammar varnish some
                    proportion of boiled linseed oil or of oil copal varnish may be added. In place
                    of oil of turpentine other essential oils may be used as solvents, and in
                    practice oil of spike is largely utilized in preparing fine varnishes for oil
                    paintings. Turpentine varnishes are also made in which the principal resinous
                    bodies are sandarac and common rosin; and, moreover, turpentine is largely
                    employed to reduce the consistency and to improve the drying properties of copal
                    varnishes. The basis or solvent of oil or fatty varnishes consists principally
                    of linseed oil; but the other drying oils—poppy and walnut, &amp;c.—may also be
                    used. These oils, without the addition of resins, themselves form varnishes
                    which on exposure in thin layers dry by a process of oxidation into tough glossy
                    films; but the drying proceeds very slowly unless the oils are previously boiled
                    with the red oxide of lead or otherwise treated to increase their power of
                    absorbing oxygen (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Linseed Oil,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 677).
                    It is in the form of boiled oil or of oil prepared with driers that these oils
                    are used in varnish-making. Oil varnishes thus differ from the other classes in
                    the circumstance that the principal solvent is not volatile and dissipated on
                    exposure, but in itself forms an essential and permanent ingredient in the
                    preparation. The resin principally used in oil varnishes is copal, and its
                    varieties differ very much in hardness, that is, in the temperature at which
                    they melt and distil. Hard and semi-hard copals can only be made to mix with and
                    dissolve in oils at the temperature at which they distil, which ranges from 230°
                    to 360° C. The copal in varnish-making is melted and brought to the requisite
                    temperature in a copper vessel. Simultaneously the oil is heated to the
                    boiling-point in a separate copper vessel, and at the proper moment a measured
                    quantity of the boiling oil is added to the liquefied resin. They are then
                    boiled together till the mixture becomes perfectly clear, and by a series of
                    alternate additions of oil and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0107-0092"/> resin at proper temperatures the solution is
                    brought to the desired consistency. After the mixture of oil and resin has
                    sufficiently cooled, oil of turpentine in certain proportion is added. The
                    making of copal varnish is attended with great risk of burning, and special
                    precautions have to be observed for the extinction of the fire that frequently
                    bursts out in these highly-heated and most inflammable bodies. Copal varnish is
                    also made by boiling together the requisite proportions of resin and oil under
                    pressure in a closed vessel, and subsequently adding turpentine, or by
                    dissolving the resin and turpentine at the high heat and adding the oil
                    afterwards. Amber varnish is prepared by the same methods as those followed in
                    preparing copal, but, the resin being still more refractory and insoluble, a
                    higher heat is required. A peculiar varnish forms the basis of the celebrated
                    Japanese lacquer. The substance is a resinous exudation, which is obtained by
                    making incisions in the bark of the Japanese urushi or lacquer-tree, <hi
                        rend="italic">Rhus vernicifera.</hi> The resinous juice on settling in vats
                    separates into two layers, the upper and thinner of which, on mixture with a
                    drying oil, forms a transparent varnish, having a rich yellow colour, which
                    dries into coatings of remarkable tenacity, durability, and lustre (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Japanning,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 592).</p>
