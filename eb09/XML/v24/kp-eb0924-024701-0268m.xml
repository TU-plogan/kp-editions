                <p><label type="entry">VIPER</label>. The vipers constitute a family (<hi
                    rend="italic">Viperidae)</hi> of Old-World, poisonous, viviparous snakes, which
                    have a single movable poison fang on either side of the upper jaw, without any
                    excavation or pit between the eye and the nostril,—thus differing from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Crotalidae.</hi> They have a post-frontal and a maxillary bone,
                    which latter is swollen and upright, articulating with the pre-frontal by a
                    ginglymus, and short—not reaching the premaxilla. Vipers are mostly more or less
                    thick-bodied and short-tailed, the head being entirely covered above with small
                    scales, except in a single species. The nose is often recurved, and some scales
                    of the head are elongated so as to form “horns” in several species. The main
                    points in the anatomy<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> and their
                    zoological relations stated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes.</hi></p>
                <p>There is much diversity of opinion as to the classification of the vipers, and,
                    as Dr Alexander Strauch appears to be the author who has worked out the group
                    with the greatest care and completeness, his classification is here
                    provisionally adopted.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Viperidae</hi> thus consist of three genera, which are
                    distinguished as follows :—</p>

                <p>The common viper <hi rend="italic">(V. berus)</hi> is easily distinguished from
                    the harmless ring-snake by the black and white (or yellow) band behind the head,
                    which is generally conspicuous in the latter animal. It is also distinguishable
                    (apart from individual varieties) from the snake <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coronella,</hi> rare in England, by having a dark V-shaped mark on its head and
                    a dark zig-zag line down the back. It is this viper which has the top of the
                    head covered by shields (which may be regular or irregular in outline) instead
                    of small scales only. It is one of the most widely distributed of snakes, being
                    found from northern Spain eastwards to the island of Saghalin, and from the
                    northern boundary of Persia to beyond the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia, though
                    it is not found in Ireland. It inhabits all sorts of situations, though it
                    prefers a dry soil, and it may be met with at an elevation of 9000 feet above
                    the sea. It seeks its prey at night, and penetrating the burrows of mice will
                    eat their nestlings. Its bite is sometimes fatal to large dogs, and occasionally
                    to weakly children. It brings forth in April and May from five to fourteen
                    young, which are hatched as they are born.</p>
                <p>The other European vipers are <hi rend="italic">V. aspis, V. ammodytes,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">V. latastii.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In collections wherein very many specimens are preserved it
                    is possible to find transitional forms between all the four European
                    species.</p></note><hi rend="italic">V. aspis</hi> is very like the common
                    viper, save as to the scales on the head and the fact that its snout is somewhat
                    turned up. It inhabits France, Switzerland, and Italy. <hi rend="italic">V.
                    ammodytes</hi> is a somewhat larger species, with a singular pointed process
                    extending upwards from the snout end. It is found in Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor,
                    Turkey, Greece, southern Austria, and Italy. <hi rend="italic">V. latastii</hi>
                    is a species intermediate between <hi rend="italic">V. aspis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">V. ammodytes.</hi> It inhabits Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and
                    Algiers. Thus, of the four European vipers, two are also found in Africa and one
                    in both Africa and Asia. There are three exclusively Indian vipers,— <hi
                    rend="italic">V. xanthina, V. persica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">V. russellii.
                    V. xanthina</hi> is an animal about 2½ feet long. As in all the other
                    non-European vipers, the body scales are strongly keeled. It is found in Asia
                    Minor, Syria, and Persia. <hi rend="italic">V. persica</hi> is, as its name
                    implies, a Persian animal. The scales above each eye are so modified as to form
                    a horn. <hi rend="italic">V. russellii</hi> is hornless, but very large: it is
                    said to attain a length of more than 6 feet. It is widely distributed,
                    inhabiting India, Burmah, Siam, Ceylon, Sumatra, and Java.</p>
                <p>Two vipers are common to Asia and Africa. One of these, <hi rend="italic">V.
                    mauritanica,</hi> extends from Algiers to Persia. It may be nearly 5 feet long.
                    The other species, <hi rend="italic">V. cerastes,</hi> is a much smaller snake,
                    never being much more than 20 inches in length. It is remarkable for two long
                    pointed horns (which stand up over either eye), and is widely distributed in
                    North Africa and Arabia. All the other species of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vipera</hi> are exclusively African, and only one is found north of the Sahara.
                    This is <hi rend="italic">V. avizennae.</hi> It has no horns, and only attains a
                    length of about 16 inches. <hi rend="italic">V. superciliaris</hi> is also a
                    small snake, but it has a large rugose supraorbital plate. It comes from
                    Mozambique. The puff-adder (<hi rend="italic">V. arietans)</hi> is a large thick
                    snake, which may be 4 feet long. It is a very deadly animal, and is widely
                    distributed over southern and central Africa, extending to both the east and
                    west coast of that continent. It is without horns. <hi rend="italic">V.
                    nasicornis</hi> is a beautifully coloured, large, and bulky snake, which may be
                    upwards of 6 feet long. Two horns project obliquely forwards from just in front
                    of either nostril. It inhabits southern Africa. It is a very venomous
                    animal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On one occasion
                    one of these snakes, after giving birth to twenty-one young (which bit and
                    killed mice within five minutes of being born), became very ill-tempered, and
                    when two adult males were placed in her cage she bit one with such violence as
                    to break off one of her fangs, which she left, about three-quarters of an inch
                    in length, sticking in his back. He, however, appeared not to suffer the
                    slightest inconvenience, and was never the worse for it (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1871, p. 638).</p></note><hi rend="italic">V.
                    rhinoceros</hi> is another large snake, which comes from both the east and west
                    coasts. It has a pair of horns upstanding between its nostrils, each clothed
                    with but a single shield. <hi rend="italic">V. cornuta</hi> has scaly
                    prominences, which are hardly “horns,” and which consist each of a group of four
                    or five large upright distinct scales placed above one of the eyes. It is a
                    small snake, hardly ever more than 20 inches long. It inhabits western,
                    southern, and eastern Africa. <hi rend="italic">V. caudalis</hi> is a still
                    smaller snake, which has a single scale extending upwards over either eye. It
                    comes from southern Africa, as also does <hi rend="italic">V. schneideri,</hi>
                    which is like the last species, save that it has nothing at all representing
                    horns. <hi rend="italic">V. inornata</hi> is also hornless, though it has the
                    supraorbital region somewhat elevated. It is a very small snake, only about 15
                    inches long. It is a South-African species, as also are <hi rend="italic">V.
                    atropos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">V. atropoides,</hi> which are both hornless
                    and are about 2 feet long.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Echis</hi> consists of but one species (<hi
                    rend="italic">E. carinata),</hi> which has been noticed and figured in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes</hi> (see vol. xxii. p. 198). It is a
                    viper-like snake, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n269/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0269-0248"/> inhabits desert lands or dry plains, and extends
                    from India through Abyssinia and North Africa to Senegal.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Atheris</hi> is made up of several more or less
                    problematical species of snakes, all of which present a great contrast to the
                    other <hi rend="italic">Viperidae,</hi> in that they have long, slender, and
                    laterally compressed bodies with prehensile tails—being altogether adapted for
                    arboreal life. Nevertheless the head is decidedly viperine, sharply marked off
                    from the neck, broad behind, and heart-shaped when looked at from above. These
                    animals are assisted in climbing, not only by their prehensile tails, but also
                    the strongly keeled scales beneath the lower jaw. All the so-called species are
                    inhabitants of tropical Africa,— <hi rend="italic">A. burtoni, A.
                    squamigera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. chloroechis</hi> being found on the
                    west coast. Two new species have been lately discovered, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    anisolepis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. caeviceps,—</hi> both from the
                    Congo.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Acanthophis</hi> is sometimes classed with the
                    vipers, but is here excluded on account of its large, truly colubrine head
                    shields. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 198.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Viperidae</hi> are geographically distributed as follows :—
