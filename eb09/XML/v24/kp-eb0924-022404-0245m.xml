                    of Nola, where he met with a friendly reception. On his return to Severus in
                    Gaul he was ordained; and, having soon afterwards inherited means through the
                    death of his father, he set out for Palestine, where he was received with great
                    respect by Jerome at Bethlehem. The stay of Vigilantius lasted for some time;
                    but, as was almost inevitable, he was dragged into the dispute then raging about
                    Origen, in which he did not see fit wholly to adopt Jerome’s attitude. On his
                    return to the West he was the bearer of a letter from Jerome to Paulinus, and at
                    various places where he stopped on the way he appears to have expressed himself
                    about Jerome in a manner that when reported gave great offence to that father,
                    and provoked him to write a reply <hi rend="italic">(Ep.,</hi> 61). Vigilantius
                    now settled for some time in Gaul, and is said by one authority (Gennadius) to
                    have afterwards held a charge in the diocese of Barcelona. About 403, some years
                    after his return from the East, Vigilantius wrote his celebrated work against
                    superstitious practices, in which he argued against relic worship, as also
                    against the vigils in the basilicas of the martyrs, then so common, the sending
                    of alms to Jerusalem, and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried
                    state, especially in the case of the clergy. All that is known of this work is
                    through Jerome’s treatise <hi rend="italic">Contra Vigilantium,</hi> or, as that
                    controversialist would seem to prefer saying, “Contra Dormitantium.”
                    Notwithstanding Jerome’s exceedingly unfavourable opinion, there is no reason to
                    believe that the tract of Vigilantius was exceptionally illiterate, or that the
                    views it advocated were different from those now held on the subjects with which
                    it deals by most educated men outside the Roman Catholic Church, or even by many
                    within its pale. Soon, however, the great influence of Jerome in the Western
                    Church caused its leaders to espouse all his quarrels, and Vigilantius gradually
                    came to be ranked in popular opinion among heretics. The year of his death is
                    unknown.</p>
