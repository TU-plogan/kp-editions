                    (1500-1547), a painter of the Roman school, whose true name was <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Perino</hi> (or <hi rend="smallcaps">Piero) Buonaccorsi.</hi>
                    He was born in Florence on 28th June 1500. His father ruined himself by
                    gambling, and became a soldier in the invading army of Charles VIII. His mother
                    dying when he was but two months old, he was suckled by a she-goat; but shortly
                    afterwards he was taken up by his father’s second wife. Perino was first
                    apprenticed to a druggist, but soon passed into the hands of a mediocre painter,
                    Andrea da Ceri, and, when eleven years of age, of Ridolfo Ghirlandajo. Perino
                    rapidly surpassed his fellow-pupils, applying himself especially to the study of
                    Michelangelo’s great cartoon. Another mediocre painter, Vaga from Toscanella,
                    undertook to settle the boy in Rome, but first set him to work in Toscanella.
                    Perino, when he at last reached Rome, was utterly poor, and with no clear
                    prospect beyond journey-work for trading decorators. He, however, studied with
                    great severity and spirit from Michelangelo and the antique, and was eventually
                    entrusted with some of the subordinate work undertaken by Raphael in the
                    Vatican. He assisted Giovanni da Udine in the stucco and arabesque decorations
                    of the loggie of the Vatican, and executed some of those small but finely
                    composed Scriptural subjects which go by the name of "Raphael’s Bible ”—Raphael
                    himself furnishing the designs. Perino’s examples are Abraham about to Sacrifice
                    Isaac, Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, Joseph and his Brethren, the Hebrews
                    Crossing the Jordan, the Fall and Capture of Jericho, Joshua Commanding the Sun
                    to Stand Still, the Birth of Christ, His Baptism, and the Last Supper. Some of
                    these are in bronze-tint, while others are in full colour. He also painted,
                    after Raphael’s drawings, the figures of the planets in the great hall of the
                    Appartamenti Borgia. Perino exhibited very uncommon faculty in these works and
                    was soon regarded as second only to Giulio Romano among the great painter’s
                    assistants. To Raphael himself he was always exceedingly respectful and
                    attentive, and the master loved him almost as a son. He executed many other
                    works about Rome, always displaying a certain mixture of the Florentine with the
                    Roman style.</p>
                <p>After Raphael’s death in 1520 a troublous period ensued for Perino, with a plague
                    which ravaged Rome in 1523, and again with the sack of that city in 1527. Then
                    he accepted an invitation to Genoa, where he was employed in decorating the
                    Doria palace, and rapidly founded a quasi-Roman school of art in the Ligurian
                    city. He ornamented the palace in a style similar to that of Giulio Romano in
                    the Mantuan Palazzo del Tè, and frescoed historical and mythological subjects in
                    the apartments, fanciful<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0044-0031"/> and graceful arabesque-work, sculptural and
                    architectural details—in short, whatever came to hand. Among the principal works
                    are the War between the Gods and Giants, Horatius Codes Defending the Bridge,
                    and the Fortitude of Mutius Scaevola. The most important work of all, the
                    Shipwreck of Aeneas, is no longer extant. Perino was particularly good in the
                    technique and colouring of fresco, and his stucco-work was no less highly prized
                    than his pictures; his Genoese paintings are, however, very inferior to those of
                    Raphael in finish, as in other higher qualities, and his style in the nude tends
                    rather towards Michelangelo. The Doria work is moreover extremely unequal. From
                    Genoa Perino twice visited Pisa, and began some painting in the cathedral.
                    Finally he returned to Rome, where Paul III. allowed him a regular salary till
                    the painter’s death. He retouched many of the works of Raphael, and laboured
                    hard on his own account, undertaking all sorts of jobs, important or trivial.
                    Working for any price, he made large gains, but fell into mechanical negligence.
                    Perino was engaged in the general decoration of the Sala Reale, begun by Paul
                    III., when his health, undermined by constant work and as constant
                    irregularities, gave way, and he fell down dead on 19th October 1547. He is
                    buried in the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Perino, though his character and habits of life were not such as to inspire
                    respect, seems to have been generally liked in a certain way; he was, however,
                    jealous of rivals, particularly of Titian when in Rome, and grudging in the
                    instruction of his pupils. He produced some excellent portraits, and his smaller
                    oil pictures combine with the manner of Raphael something of that of Andrea del
                    Sarto. Many of his works were engraved, even in his own lifetime. Daniele da
                    Volterra, Girolamo Siciolante da Sermoneta, Luzio Romano, and Marcello Venusti
                    (Mantovano) were among his principal assistants.</p>
