                    rest, and the year of his death saw the final and formal establishment of the
                    empire. Into the changing life of that stirring time Varro entered deeply, and
                    there was no current in thought, culture, literature, and even politics, with
                    which he was not closely in contact* Few have ever so thoroughly combined the
                    pursuit of scholarship and literature with experience of practical affairs.
                    Dionysius of Halicarnassus well described him as the man of widest experience
                    during his age. Nothing is known of Varro’s ancestors but that they were natives
                    of the Sabine country, where Varro himself was born in the town of Reate. Here
                    he imbibed in his earlier years a good measure of the hardy simplicity and
                    strong seriousness which the later Romans attributed to the men of the early
                    republic,—characteristics which were supposed to linger in the Sabine land after
                    they had fled from the rest of Italy. The chief teacher of Varro was L. Aelius
                    Stilo, the first systematic student, critic, and teacher of Latin philology and
                    literature, and of the antiquities of Rome and Italy. We know from Cicero that
                    Varro also studied at Athens, especially under the philosopher Antiochus of
                    Ascalon. It was the aim of this teacher to lead back the Academic school from
                    the scepticism of Arcesilaus and Carneades to the tenets of the early
                    Platonists, as he understood them. His opponents, however, declared that he
                    identified Platonism with Stoic dogmatism, and that a very slight change in his
                    views would have converted him into a Stoic of the Stoics. When Cicero wrote his
                    <hi rend="italic">Posterior Academics,</hi> he introduced Varro as an
                    interlocutor, and made him expound the views of Antiochus. The influence of
                    Antiochus is most plainly to be traced in the extant remains of Varro’s
                    writings, and indirectly in works like the <hi rend="italic">De Civitate
                    Dei</hi> of Augustine, which owe much to Varro. In spite of controversial
                    statements to the contrary, the differences between Antiocheanism and Stoicism
                    were great and marked, and it is a serious, though a common, error to treat
                    Varro as an adherent of the Stoic school. The political career of Varro seems to
                    have been late and slow; but he arrived at the praetorship, after having been
                    tribune of the people, quaestor, and curule aedile. In politics and war he
                    followed Pompey’s lead; but it is probable that he was discontented with the
                    course on which his leader entered when the first triumvirate was formed, and he
                    may thus have lost his chance of rising to the consulate. He actually ridiculed
                    the coalition in a work entitled the <hi rend="italic">Three-Headed Monster
                    (</hi> T <hi rend="italic">ρικάρανον</hi> in the Greek of Appian). He did not,
                    however, refuse to join the commission of twenty by whom the great agrarian
                    scheme of Caesar for the resettlement of Capua and Campania was carried into
                    execution (59 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> Despite the difference between
                    them in politics, Varro and Caesar had literary tastes in common, and were
                    friends in private life. Under Pompey Varro saw much active service: he was
                    attached to Pompey as pro-quaestor, probably during the war against Sertorius in
                    Spain. We next find him, as legate, in command of a fleet which kept the seas
                    between Delos and Sicily, while Pompey was suppressing the pirates, and he even
                    won the “naval crown,” a coveted reward of personal prowess. A little later he
                    was legate during the last Mithradatic war. In the conflict between Caesar and
                    the Pompeian party Varro was more than once actively engaged. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Civil War</hi> (ii. 17-20) Caesar tells how Varro, when legate in
                    Spain along with Afranius and Petreius, lost his two legions without striking a
                    blow, because the whole region where he was quartered joined the enemy. Caesar
                    curiously intimates that, though Varro did his best for Pompey from a sense of
                    duty, his heaτt was really with the other leader. Nevertheless he proceeded to
                    Epirus before the battle of Pharsalia, and awaited the result at Dyrrachium in
                    the company of Cicero and Cato. Like Cicero, Varro received harsh treatment from
                    Mark Antony after the Pompeian defeat. Some of his property was actually
                    plundered, but restored at the bidding of Caesar, to whom Varro in gratitude
                    immediately dedicated one of his most important writings. The dictator employed
                    the scholar in aiding him to collect and arrange great stores of Greek and Latin
                    literature for the vast public library which he intended to found. We have
                    glimpses of Varro at this time in the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Cicero.
                    The two, though alike in political inclinations and in their love for
                    literature, were antipathetic in their natures,—the one soft in fibre, and vain,
                    richly abundant in expression, and subtly sensitive, the other somewhat harsh,
                    severe, and retiring, solid in learning, and no master of literary form. The
                    impression of Varro’s personality which Cicero gives is unattractive enough, but
                    probably on the whole true. The formation of the second triumvirate again
                    plunged Varro into danger. Antony took possession anew of the property he had
                    been compelled to surrender, and inserted Varro’s name on the list of the
                    proscribed. His friends, however, afforded him protection. He was able to make
                    peace with the triumvirs, but sacrificed his property and much of his beloved
                    library. He was permitted to spend in quiet study and in writing the last
                    fifteen years of his life. He is said to have died (27 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> almost pen in hand.</p>
                <p>Varro was not surpassed in the compass of his writings by any ancient, not even
                    by any one of the later Greek philosophers, to some of whom tradition ascribes a
                    fabulous number of separate works. In a passage quoted by Gellius, Varro
                    himself, when over seventy years of age, estimated the number of “books” he had
                    written at 490; but “book” here means, not merely such a work as was not
                    subdivided into portions, but also a portion of a subdivided work. For example,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satires</hi> numbered 150, and are all counted
                    separately in Varro’s estimate. Jerome made or copied a catalogue of Varro’s
                    works which has come down to us in a mutilated form. From this and from other
                    extant materials Ritschl has set down the number of the distinct literary works
                    at 74 and the number of separate “books” at about 620. The later years of the
                    author’s life were therefore even more fruitful than the earlier. The complete
                    catalogue may be roughly arranged under three heads,—(1) belles lettres, (2)
                    history and antiquities, (3) technical treatises on philosophy, law, grammar,
                    mathematics, philology, and other subjects.</p>
                <p>The first of these three classes no doubt mainly belonged to Varro’s earlier
                    life. In poetry he seems to have attempted nothing that was very elaborate, and
                    little of a serious character. His genius tended naturally in the direction of
                    burlesque and satire.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0108-0093"/>
                <p>In belles lettres he showed himself throughout, both in matter and form, the
                    pupil and admirer of Lucilius. He wrote satires in the style of his master, and
                    he may be one of those to whom Horace alludes <hi rend="italic">(Sat.,</hi> i.
                    10, 47) as having “tried satire in vain.” One poetical work probably consisted
                    of short pieces in the style of the more satirical poems of Catullus. It is
                    doubtful whether, as has often been supposed, Varro wrote a philosophical poem
                    somewhat in the style of Lucretius; if so, it should rather be classed with the
                    prose technical treatises. One curious production was an essay in popular
                    illustrated literature, which was almost unique in ancient times. Its title was
                    <hi rend="italic">Imagines,</hi> and it consisted of 700 prose biographies of
                    Greek and Roman celebrities, with a metrical <hi rend="italic">elogium for</hi>
                    each, accompanied in each case by a portrait. But the lighter works of Varro
                    have perished almost to the last line, with the exception of numerous fragments
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satires.</hi> The Menippus whom Varro
                    imitated lived in the first half of the third century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and was born a Phoenician slave. He became a Cynic philosopher, and
                    is a figure familiar to readers of Lucian. He flouted life and all philosophies
                    but the Cynic in light compositions, partly in prose and partly in verse. The
                    fragments of Varro’s imitations have been frequently collected and edited, most
                    recently by Riese and by Bücheler. The glowing and picturesque account of these
                    fragments given by Mommsen in his <hi rend="italic">History of Rome</hi> is
                    known to all students of Roman literature, but few readers could pass from
                    Mommsen’s picture to a careful study of the passages themselves without severe
                    disappointment. That the remains exhibit variety and fertility, that there are
                    in them numerous happy strokes of humour and satire, and many felicitous phrases
                    and descriptions, is true, but the art is on the whole heavy, awkward, and
                    forced, and the style rudely archaic and untasteful. The Latin is frequently as
                    rough and uncouth as that of Lucilius. No doubt Varro contemned the Hellenizing
                    innovations by which the hard and rude Latin of his youth was transformed into
                    the polished literary language of the late republican and the Augustan age. The
                    titles of the <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satires</hi> are very diverse.
                    Sometimes personal names are chosen, and they range from the gods and demigods
                    to the slaves, from Hercules to Marcipor. Frequently a popular proverb or
                    catchword in Greek or Latin supplies the designation: thus we have as titles
                    “I’ve got You” (῎Εχω σε); “You don’t Know what Evening is to Bring” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nescis quid vesper serus vehat)</hi>; “Know Thyself” <hi
                    rend="italic">(</hi> Γ <hi rend="italic">vωθι σεaυτόv).</hi> Occasionally the
                    heading indicates that the writer is flying at some social folly, as in “Old Men
                    are Children for the Second Time” (∆ίς <hi rend="italic">πaῐδες οΐ
                    γέρovτες)</hi> and in the “Bachelor” <hi rend="italic">(Caelebs).</hi> In many
                    satires the philosophers were pounded, as in the “Burial of Menippus” and
                    “Concerning the Sects” (∏ερί <hi rend="italic">aίρεσέωv).</hi> Each composition
                    seems to have been a genuine medley or “lanx satura”: any topic might be
                    introduced which struck the author’s fancy at the moment. There are many
                    allusions to persons and events of the day, but political bitterness seems to
                    have been commonly avoided. The whole tone of the writer is that of a “laudator
                    temporis acti,” who can but scoff at all that has come into fashion in his own
                    day. From the numerous citations in later authors it is clear that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Menippean Satires</hi> were the most popular of Varro’s writings.
                    Not very unlike the <hi rend="italic">Menippean Satires</hi> were the <hi
                    rend="italic">Libri Logistorici,</hi> or satirical and practical expositions,
                    possibly in dialogue form, of some theme most commonly taken from philosophy on
                    its ethical side. A few fragments in this style have come down to us and a
                    number of titles. These are twofold: that is to say, a personal name is followed
                    by words indicating the subject-matter, as <hi rend="italic">Marius, de
                    Fortuna,</hi> from which the contents may easily be guessed, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sisenna, de Historia,</hi> most likely a dialogue in which the old
                    annalist of the name was the chief speaker, and discoursed of the principles on
                    which history should be written. Among the lighter and more popular works may be
                    mentioned twenty-two books of <hi rend="italic">Orations</hi> (probably never
                    spoken), some funeral eulogies <hi rend="italic">(Laudationes),</hi> some
                    “exhortations” <hi rend="italic">(Suasiones),</hi> conceivably of a political
                    character, and an account of the author’s own life.</p>
                <p>The second section of Varro’s works, those on history and antiquities, form to
                    the present day the basis on which a large part of our knowledge of the earlier
                    Roman history, and in particular of Roman constitutional history, ultimately
                    rests. These writings were used as a quarry by the compilers and dilettanti of
                    later times, such as Pliny, Plutarch, Gellius, Festus, Macrobius, and by
                    Christian champions like Tertullian, Arnobius, and Augustine, who did not
                    disdain to seek in heathen literature the means of defending their faith. These
                    men have saved for us a few remains from the great wreck made by time. Judging
                    from what has been casually preserved, if any considerable portion of Varro’s
                    labours as antiquarian and historian were to be now discovered, scholars might
                    find themselves compelled to reconstruct the earlier history of the Roman
                    republic from its very foundations. Varro’s greatest predecessor in this field
                    of inquiry, the man who turned over the virgin soil, was Cato the Censor. His
                    example, however, seems to have remained unfruitful till the time of Varro’s
                    master, Lucius Aelius Stilo Praeconinus. From his age to the decay of Roman
                    civilization there were never altogether wanting men devoted to the study of
                    their nation’s past; but none ever pursued the task with the advantages of
                    Varro’s comprehensive learning, his indefatigable industry, and his reverent,
                    yet discriminating regard for the men and the institutions of the earlier ages.
                    The greatest work of this class was that on <hi rend="italic">Antiquities,</hi>
                    divided into forty-one books. Of these the first twenty-five were entitled the
                    <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Human Things (Antiquitates Rerum
                    Humanarum),</hi> while the remaining sixteen were designated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Things Divine (Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum),</hi>
                    The book was the fruit of Varro’s later years, in which he gathered together the
                    material laboriously amassed through the period of an ordinary lifetime. The
                    second division of the work was dedicated to Caesar as supreme pontiff’. The
                    design was as far-reaching as that of the <hi rend="italic">Natural History
                    of</hi> Pliny. The general heads of the exposition in the secular portion of the
                    book were four,—(1) “who the men are who act <hi rend="italic">(qui agant),</hi>
                    (2) the places in which they act <hi rend="italic">(ubi),</hi> (3) the times at
                    which they act <hi rend="italic">(quando),</hi> (4) the results of their action
                    <hi rend="italic">(quid agant).’’</hi> In the portion relating to divine affairs
                    there were divisions parallel to these four, with a fifth, which dealt with the
                    gods in whose honour action in divine affairs is taken. Our knowledge of this
                    great book is to a large extent derived from the works of the early Christian
                    writers, and especially from Augustine’s <hi rend="italic">De Civitate Dei.</hi>
                    These lights of the church, as was natural, directed their attention mainly to
                    the portion which treated of the religion of Rome. A glance at the authorities
                    quoted in such a book as Preller’s <hi rend="italic">Römische Mythologie</hi>
                    will suffice to show how largely the imperfect indeed, but nevertheless
                    invaluable, information now attainable concerning the older and un-Hellenized
                    forms of Roman and Italian religious rites depends on the citations by Christian
                    authorities from the <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Rerum Divinarum.</hi> It is
                    a great misfortune that no similar series of citations from the secular part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates</hi> has come down to us. Most of the other
                    historical and antiquarian writings of Varro were special elaborations of topics
                    which he could not treat with sufficient fulness and minuteness in the larger
                    book. The treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Genealogy of the Roman People</hi>
                    dealt mainly with the relation of Roman chronology to the chronology of Greece
                    and the East. Dates were assigned even to mythological occurrences, because
                    Varro believed in the theory of Euhemerus, that all the beings worshipped as
                    gods had once lived as men. To Varro’s researches are due the traditional dates
                    assigned to the era of the kings and to that of the early republic. Minor
                    writings of the same class were the <hi rend="italic">De Vita Populi
                    Romani,</hi> apparently a kind of history of Roman civilization; the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Familiis Trojanis,</hi> an account of the families who “came
                    over” with Aeneas; the <hi rend="italic">Aetia (Αίτια),</hi> an explanation of
                    the origin of Roman customs, on which Plutarch drew largely in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Quaestiones Romanae</hi>; a <hi rend="italic">Tribuum Liber,</hi>
                    used by Festus; and the constitutional handbook written for the instruction of
                    Pompey when he became consul. Nor must the labour expended by Varro in the study
                    of literary history be forgotten. His activity in this direction, as in others,
                    took a wide range. One of his greatest achievements was to fix the canon of the
                    genuine plays of Plautus. The “Varronian plays” were the twenty which have come
                    down to us, along with one which has been lost.</p>
                <p>The third class of treatises, which we have called technical, was also numerous
                    and very varied. Philosophy, grammar, the history and theory of language,
                    rhetoric, law, arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, mensuration, agriculture, naval
                    tactics, were all represented. The only works of this kind which have come down
                    to our days are the <hi rend="italic">De Lingua Latina</hi> (in part) and the
                    <hi rend="italic">De Re Rustica.</hi> The former originally comprised
                    twenty-five books, three of which (the three succeeding the first) are dedicated
                    to a P. Septimius who had served with the author in Spain and the last
                    twenty-one to Cicero. The whole work was divided into three main sections, the
                    first dealing with the origin of Latin words, the second with their inflexions
                    and other modifications, the third with syntax. The books still preserved
                    (somewhat imperfectly) are those from the fifth to the tenth inclusive. The
                    Latin style is harsh, rugged, and far from lucid. As Mommsen remarks, the
                    clauses of the sentences are often arranged on the thread of the relative
                    pronoun like thrushes on a string. The arrangement of the subject-matter, while
                    pretending to much precision, is often far from logical. The fifth, sixth, and
                    seventh books give Varro’s views on the etymology of Latin words. The principles
                    he applies are those which he had learned from the philosophers of the Stoic
                    school,—Chrysippus, Antipater, and others. The study of language as it existed
                    in Varro’s day was thoroughly dominated by Stoic influences. Varro’s etymologies
                    could be only <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> guesses, but he was well aware of
                    their character, and very clearly states at the outset of the fifth book the
                    hindrances that barred the way to sound knowledge. He was thoroughly alive to
                    the importance of not arguing merely from the forms and meanings of words as
                    they existed in his day, and was fully conscious that language and its mechanism
                    should be studied historically. The books from the eighth to the tenth inclusive
                    are devoted to the inflexions of words and their other modifications. These
                    Varro classes all under the head of “declinatio,” which implies a swerving aside
                    from a type. Thus <hi rend="italic">Herculi</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hercules</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manubria</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >manus</hi> are equally regarded<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0109-0094"/> as examples of <hi rend="italic">declinatio.</hi>
                    Varro adopts a compromise between the two opposing schools of grammarians, those
                    who held that nature intended the <hi rend="italic">declinationes</hi> of all
                    words of the same class to proceed uniformly (which uniformity was called <hi
                    rend="italic">analogia)</hi> and those who deemed that nature aimed at
                    irregularity <hi rend="italic">(anomalia).</hi> The matter is treated with
                    considerable confusion of thought. But the <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>
                    incidentally cited concerning old Latin, and the statements of what had been
                    written and thought about language by Varro’s predecessors, are of extreme value
                    to the student of Latin. The other extant prose work, the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Re Rustica,</hi> is in three books, each of which is in the form of a dialogue,
                    the circumstances and in the main the interlocutors being different for each.
                    The dramatic introductions and a few of the interludes are bright and
                    interesting, and the Latin style, though still awkward and unpolished, is far
                    superior to that of the <hi rend="italic">De Lingua Latina.</hi></p>
                <p>A complete collection of the remains of Varro is still a desideratum. The
                    fragments of the different treatises have been partially collected in many
                    separate publications of recent date. The best editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Lingua Latina</hi> are those by C. O. Miiller and by L. Spengel (re-edited
                    by his son in 1885). The most recent and best recension of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Re Rustica</hi> is that of Keil (Leipsic, 1884). Of modern scholars Ritsehl
                    has deserved best of Varro. Several papers in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opuscula</hi> treat of the nature of Varro’s works which have not come down to
                    us. (J. S. R.)</p>
