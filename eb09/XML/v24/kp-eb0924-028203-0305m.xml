                    the S., Novgorod and Olonetz on the W. This immense government, which comprises
                    an area of 155,500 square miles, stretches in a north-easterly direction for 800
                    miles, from Novgorod to the Urals, including the broad depression drained by the
                    Sukhona from the S.W. and the Vytchegda from the N.E., head-waters of the Dwina.
                    From the basin of the Volga it is separated by a flat, swampy, and wooded
                    swelling, where the heads of tributaries belonging to both Arctic and Caspian
                    drainage-areas are closely intermingled. The eastern boundary of Vologda follows
                    the main waterparting of the Urals, which has but few points over 3000 feet;
                    wide <hi rend="italic">parmas,</hi> or woody plateaus, fill up the space between
                    the main Urals and the southern spurs of the Timansk Mountains, in the upper
                    basin of the Petchora, and it is above the parmas—especially over those which
                    are nearest to the Urals proper—that the highest summits of the Urals rise in
                    the form of dome-shaped mountains (Tellpöss, 5540 feet above sea-level;
                    Hoste-piär, 4955 feet; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0306-0283"/> Idjed-kashem, 4225 feet). The Timansk Mountains
                    are a swampy plateau, where the rivers flowing either to the Dwina or to the
                    Petchora take their rise in common marshes; so that on the Myłva portage boats
                    have to be dragged only a distance of three miles through marshy forests to be
                    transported from one system to the other.</p>
                <p>Permian sandstones and cupriferous slates cover most of the territory; only a few
                    patches of Jurassic clays overlie them; while in the east, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ural parmas,</hi> coal-bearing Carboniferous, Devonian, and
                    Silurian slates and limestones appear, covering the crystalline slates of the
                    main ridge. Vast layers of boulder clay and Lacustrine deposits cover the whole.
                    Rock-salt and salt springs, iron ore, millstones, and grindstones are the chief
                    mineral products; but mining is in its infancy.</p>
                <p>Vologda is profusely watered; as many as 4800 rivers and streams have been
                    counted on its maps. The Sukhona, which rises in the south-west and flows
                    north-east past Vologda, Totma, and Velikiy Ustyug, is navigable for 375 miles.
                    After its junction with the Yug (390 miles long), which comes from the south, it
                    becomes the Dwina, which flows north-west, and receives the Vytchegda, another
                    great river, 740 miles long and navigable for 570 miles, which, however, waters
                    a nearly uninhabited region. The Luza, a tributary of the Yug, is also navigated
                    for more than 250 miles. The Petchora, which flows through eastern Vologda, is
                    an artery for the export of corn and the import of fish in the Petchora region,
                    otherwise difficult of access. The Pinega, the Mezen, and the Vaga, all
                    belonging to the Arctic basin, rise in northern Vologda. In the south-west the
                    Sukhona is connected by means of Lake Kuben-skoye and the canal of Alexander of
                    Würtemberg with the upper Volga. Numberless smaller lakes occur, and marshes
                    cover a considerable part of the surface.</p>
                <p>The climate is severe, the average yearly temperature being 36° F. at Vologda
                    (Jan., 10° ∙7; July, 63 <hi rend="superscript"> o∙</hi> 5) and 32° ∙5 at
                    Ust-Sysolsk (Jam, 4 ∙8; July, 61 <hi rend="superscript"> o∙</hi> 7).</p>
                <p>The flora and the physical aspects present a great variety of characters as the
                    traveller moves north-east down the Sukhona and up the Vytchegda, towards the
                    <hi rend="italic">parmas of</hi> the Petchora. In the south-west the forests are
                    cleared, and the dry slopes of the hills are covered with fields and meadows;
                    the population is relatively dense, and nearly one-quarter of the area is under
                    crops. There is a surplus of grain, which is used for distilleries; and apples
                    are extensively cultivated. The flora is middle-Russian. Farther to the
                    north-east the climate grows more severe; but still, until the Dwina is reached,
                    corn succeeds well, and there is no lack of excellent meadows on the
                    river-terraces. Flax is cultivated for export; but only 4 per cent. of the area
                    is tilled, the remainder being covered with thick fir forests, with occasional
                    woods of deciduous trees (birch, aspen, elder). At about the 46th degree of east
                    longitude the larch appears and soon supersedes the fir. Several plants unknown
                    in western Russia make their appearance <hi rend="italic">(Silene tartarica,
                    Anthyllus vulneraria, Euphorbia palustris, Filago arvensis, Lycopodium
                    complanatum, Sanguisorba officinalis).</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Veratrum</hi>
                    is especially characteristic: it sometimes encroaches on the meadows to such an
                    extent as to compel their abandonment. The region of the upper Mezen (the Udora)
                    again has a distinctive character. The winter is so protracted, and the snowfall
                    so copious, that the Zyrians are sometimes compelled to clear away the snow from
                    their barley-fields. But the summer is so hot (a mean of 54° for the three
                    summer months) that barley ripens within forty days after being sown. The
                    Timansk plateaus are a marked boundary for the middle-Russian flora. Those to
                    the east of them are uninhabitable; even on the banks of the rivers the climate
                    is so severe, especially on account of the icy northern winds, that rye and
                    barley are mostly grown only in orchards. The whole is covered with quite
                    impenetrable forests, growing on a soil permeated with water. Mosquitoes swarm
                    in the forests; birds are rare. The Siberian cedar begins, and the lime-tree
                    disappears. Fir, cedar, pine, and larch chiefly compose the forests, with birch
                    and aspen on their outskirts. Hunting is the chief occupation of the Zyrian
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The population (1,172, 250 in 1883 as against 960,850 in 1861), consists chiefly
                    of Great Russians (88 per cent.), and Zyrians (12 per cent.; only 7 per cent.
                    according to Rittich). The Zyrians —a Finnish stem akin to the
                    Permians—constitute the bulk of the population on the Ural slopes. They formerly
                    inhabited the Kama and Vyatka basins, and call themselves Komi-yurt, or
                    Komi-yas, and in the 14th century the Russians hardly distinguished them from
                    the Permians; but they were compelled to migrate northwards into the basins of
                    the Dwina and Petchora, and even across the Urals, by the religious fanaticism
                    of the earlier Christian missionaries. A portion of them now live in Archangel
                    (about 15,000), and their aggregate numbers are estimated at from 100,000 to
                    120,000, but the figures are very uncertain, as they are often hardly
                    distinguishable from the Russians, whose religion and habits they have assumed.
                    They differ widely from the western Finns in having dark eyes and hair; their
                    honesty is proverbial, as also is their industry. They grow corn amidst the
                    forests, after having patiently cleared them, and rear cattle, but are
                    pre-eminently hunters. Their “artels,” guided by a primitive compass, penetrate
                    hundreds of miles into the virgin forests, and bring in vast quantities of
                    squirrel furs and feathered game; they fell timber for export, and gather
                    cedar-nuts, but in doing so are rapidly destroying the cedar-tree.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of the Russians is agriculture, and the average crops of
                    1883 to 1885 were rye, 785,000 quarters; barley, 926,000; oats, 925,000; other
                    grains, 197,000; and potatoes, 107,000 quarters. In 1883 they had 229,500
                    horses, 520,200 cattle, and 392,900 sheep. They also fell timber, prepare tar,
                    pitch, and potash, and manufacture wooden utensils. In the south-west they
                    pursue a variety of domestic trades (spinning, weaving, sewing of plain cloth,
                    &amp;c. ). The manufacturing industry is represented by a few ironworks,
                    distilleries, paper-mills, and a variety of small manufactures; their aggregate
                    production was only £274,500 in 1884. Salt was raised in 1881-84 to the average
                    amount of 65,000 cwts. Flax, linen cloth, linseed, butter, tar, pitch, timber,
                    and furs are the main items of export, the chief centres for trade being
                    Vologda, Verkhovajsk, and Ustyug.</p>
                <p>Vologda is divided into ten districts, the chief towns (with populations in 1881)
                    being <hi rend="smallcaps">Vologda</hi> (17,025), Gτyazovets (2225), Kadnikoff
