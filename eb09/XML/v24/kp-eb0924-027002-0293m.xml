                    appearance on the banks of the chief rivers. The lacustrine depression of the
                    middle Volga and Oka extends into the eastern parts of the government. The Upper
                    Carboniferous limestones, of which it is mostly built up, are covered with
                    Permian sandstones towards the east, and patches of Jurassic clays—denuded
                    remnants of formerly extensive deposits—are scattered over its surface.
                    Cretaceous deposits are supposed to make their appearance in the south. The
                    whole is covered with a thick sheet of boulder clay, considered as the
                    bottom-moraine of the North-European ice-sheet, and overlaid, in its turn, in
                    the depressions, by extensive Lacustrine clays and sands. The soil is thus for
                    the most part unfertile, save in the district of Yurieff, where are found
                    patches of black earth, which of late have occasioned a good deal of discussion
                    among Russian geologists. Iron-ore is widely diffused, and china clay and gypsum
                    are met with in several places. Peat is of common occurrence. As for coal, it is
                    certain that the coal-bearing Lower Carboniferous strata of the Moscow basin
                    would be encountered by boring to a certain depth; no such explorations,
                    however, have yet been made, as forests still cover extensive tracts in the
                    south-east, and the numerous manufactures of Vladimir suffer from no lack of
                    fuel. The climate resembles that of Moscow, but is a little colder, and still
                    more continental; the average yearly temperature at Vladimir is 38° F. (January,
                    16°; July, 66° ∙5).</p>
                <p>The Oka flows through the government for 85 miles, and is navigable throughout.
                    Of its tributaries, the Klyasma is navigable to Kovroff, and even to Vladimir in
                    summer; and timber is floated on the Teza. Small lakes are numerous; that of
                    Plescheyevo or Pereyasłavl (5 miles in length) has historical associations,
                    Peter I. having here acquired in his boyhood his first experiences in
                    navigation. Marshes cover more than half a million acres.</p>
                <p>The population (1,359,330 in 1883) is thoroughly Great Russian; the Finnish
                    tribes, Muroma and Merya, which formerly inhabited the region, have been
                    absorbed by the Slavonians, as also have the Karelians who are supposed to have
                    formerly inhabited the territory; the descendants of the few hundred Karelian
                    families, which were settled by Peter I. on the shores of Lake Pereyaslavl,
                    still, however, maintain their language. Agriculture is carried on everywhere,
                    but is in a prosperous state only on the left bank of the Klyasma, and corn is
                    imported. The culture of flax, both for local manufactures and for
                    export—especially about Melenki—is important; so also are that of hemp and
                    gardening. Natural pastures being by no means deficient, the number of cattle is
                    greater than might be expected in a province so backward in agriculture. The
                    average crops of the years 1883-85 were—rye, 1,400,300 quarters; oats,
                    1,097,000; wheat, 36,400; barley, 63,000; other grains, 250,800; and potatoes,
                    52,300. In 1883 there were 323,000 cattle, 210,050 horses, and 330,050
                    sheep.</p>
                <p>A distinctive feature of Vladimir is the great variety of petty trades carried on
                    in its villages by peasants who still continue to cultivate their allotments and
                    thus combine manufacture with agriculture. Nearly every village has its own
                    specialty, and, while in some of them almost all the male population leave their
                    homes and go in numerous <hi rend="italic">artels</hi> (see vol. xxi. p. 84) all
                    over Russia as carpenters, masons, iron-roof makers, or as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ofeni</hi> (pedlars or travelling merchants), other villages have their
                    specialties in some branch of manufactured produce. Nearly 30,000 carpenters
                    leave Vladimir every year. Whole villages are engaged in painting sacred
                    pictures or ikons, and there are weekly fairs, where no fewer than 130
                    cart-loads of planks for such works are bought every week during winter.
                    Although the ikons are sold at a shilling the hundred, the aggregate trade is
                    valued at £150,000 a year; and the Vladimir (or rather Suzdal) pictures spread
                    all over Russia and the Balkan peninsula. In other villages some 1200 men are
                    employed in making sickles, knives, or locks. Wooden vessels, boxes, and
                    baskets, <hi rend="italic">lapti</hi> (shoes made of lime-tree bark which are
                    worn in Great Russia, and are produced by the million), wheels and sledges,
                    sieves, combs, woollen stockings and gloves, sheepskins and sheepskin gloves for
                    peasants, felt, all kinds of toys, earthenware, and finally all kinds of woven
                    fabrics, are so many specialties of separate villages. In 1884 102,500 persons
                    were directly engaged in petty trades, in which indeed Vladimir occupies the
                    first rank in Russia, the annual production (63,000,000 roubles) being one-third
                    of the total for the whole country, Moscow coming next with 37,300,000
                    roubles.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Vladimir are equally important: out of the aggregate
                    production of the fifty governments of European Russia (1,329,602,000 roubles in
                    1884), Vladimir was returned for 88,827,000 roubles, exclusive of numerous minor
                    manufactures not included in the census. In the number of workmen employed in
                    manufactures (102,900) Vladimir is second only to Moscow, and in its production
                    it is second only to Moscow and St Petersburg. The chief industrial
                    establishments are cotton and linen factories, glass, chemical, and iron works,
                    distilleries, and tanneries.</p>
                <p>Vladimir is divided into fourteen districts, the chief towns of which (with
                    populations in 1884) arc <hi rend="smallcaps">Vladimir</hi><hi rend="italic

                    Kirzhatch (3285), Voznesensk (6000), and Gavriłovsk (1780) have also municipal
                    institutions. Ivanovo, Gusevsk, Khotui, and several others, though mere
                    villages, are more important than some district towns.</p>
