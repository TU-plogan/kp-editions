                    loop made by the winding of the Adige (ancient <hi rend="italic">Athesis).</hi>
                    It lies at the junction of the Adige valley railway and that from Mantua with
                    the Milan, Vicenza, and Venice line, 25 miles north of Mantua and 30
                    south-south-west of Vicenza.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern City.—</hi> The basilica of S. Zeno (an early bishop of
                    Verona who became its patron saint), which stands outside the ancient city, is
                    one of the most interesting churches in Italy, but has been recently much
                    injured by “restoration.” The church was remodelled in the 12th century, to
                    which period most of the existing structure belongs, including the richly
                    sculptured west front and the open “confessio” or crypt, which occupies the
                    eastern half of the church, raising the choir high above the nave, —a plan
                    adopted in S. Miniato near Florence, the cathedral of Parma, at Coire in
                    Switzerland, and elsewhere. This arrangement was probably introduced by the
                    northern invaders of Lombardy. The cloisters of S. Zeno, rebuilt in 1123, are an
                    interesting example of brick and marble construction. Like many other churches
                    in Verona, S. Zeno is mainly built of mixed brick and stone in alternate bands:
                    four or five courses of fine red brick lie between bands of hard cream-coloured
                    limestone or marble,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    neighbourhood of Verona is especially rich in fine limestones and marbles of
                    many different kinds, especially a close-grained cream-coloured marble and a
                    rich mottled red marble, which are largely used, not only in Verona, but also in
                    Venice and other cities of the province. The same quarry produces both kinds,
                    and indeed the same block is sometimes half red and half white.</p></note>
                    forming broad stripes of red and white all over the wall. A similarly variegated
                    effect in red and white is produced by building the arches of windows and doors
                    with alternating voussoirs in brick and marble.<note anchored="true"

                    stands at the northern extremity of the ancient city, by the bank of the Adige;
                    it is inferior in size and importance to S. Zeno, but has a fine 12th-century
                    west front of equal interest, richly decorated with Lombardic sculpture. The
                    rest of the exterior is built in bands of red and white, with slightly
                    projecting pilasters along the walls; it has a noble cloister, with two stories
                    of arcading. Its baptistery, rebuilt early in the 12th century, is a quite
                    separate building, with nave and apse, forming a church dedicated to S. Giovanni
                    in Fonte. Pope Lucius III., who held a council at Verona in 1184, is buried in
                    the cathedral, under the pavement before the high altar. The Dominican church of
                    S. Anastasia is a mine of wealth in early examples of painting and sculpture,
                    and one of the finest buildings in Italy of Semi-Gothic style. It consists of a
                    nave in six bays, aisles, transepts, each with two eastern chapels, and an apse,
                    all vaulted with simple quadripartite brick groining.<note anchored="true"

                    very gracefully painted with floreated bands along the ribs and central patterns
                    in each “cell,” in rich soft colours on a white plastered ground. The eastern
                    portion of the vaulting, including the choir and one bay of the nave, has the
                    older and simpler decorations; the rest of the nave has more elaborate painted
                    ornament,—foliage mixed with figures of Dominican saints, executed in the 15th
                    century.</p>
                <p>On the walls below are many fine frescos, ranging from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>
                    1300 to the 15th century, including Pisanello’s beautiful painting of St George
                    (mentioned below). This church also contains a large number of fine sculptured
                    tombs of the 14th and 15th centuries, with noble effigies and reliefs of saints
                    and sacred subjects. It is mainly built of red brick, with fine nave columns of
                    red and white marble and an elaborate marble pavement inlaid in many different
                    patterns. Its general proportions are specially noble. The church of S. Fermo
                    Maggiore comes next in interest. With the exception of the crypt, which is
                    older, the existing edifice was rebuilt in the 14th century. Its plan is very
                    unusual, consisting of a large nave without aisles, the span being between 45
                    and 50 feet; it also has two shallow transepts and an apsidal east end. The
                    roof, which is especially magnificent, is the finest example of a class which as
                    a rule is only found in Venetia:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Or in churches built by Venetian architects in Istria and
                    other subject provinces.</p></note> the framing is concealed by coving or
                    barrel-vaulting in wood, the surface of which is divided into small square
                    panels, all painted and gilt, giving a very rich effect. In this case the 14th
                    and 15th century painted decorations are well preserved. Delicate patterns cover
                    all the framework of the panelling and fill the panels themselves; at two
                    stages, where there is a check in the line of the coving, rows of half-figures
                    of saints are minutely painted on blue or gold grounds, forming a scheme of
                    indescribably splendid decoration. A simpler roof of the same class exists at S.
                    Zeno; it is trefoil-shaped in section, with a tie-beam joining the cusps. The
                    church of S. Maria in Organo, rebuilt by Sanmichele, contains paintings by
                    various Veronese masters. Though not built till after his death, the church of
                    S. Giorgio in Braida, on the other side of the river, was also designed by
                    Sanmichele, and possesses many good pictures of the Veronese school. There are
                    several other fine churches in Verona, some of early date. One of the 14th
                    century is dedicated to Thomas a Becket of Canterbury.</p>
                <p>The strongly fortified castle built by the Della Scala lords in the 14th century
                    stands on the line of the Roman wall, close by the river. A very picturesque
                    battlemented bridge leads from it to the other shore, sloping down over three
                    arches of different sizes, the largest next to the castle and the smallest at
                    the other end. There are four other bridges across the Adige; one, the graceful
                    Ponte di Pietra, was designed by Fra Giocondo. The 16th-century lines of
                    fortification enclose a very much larger area than the Roman city, forming a
                    great loop to the west, and also including a considerable space on the left bank
                    of the river. In the latter part of the city, on a steep elevation, stands the
                    castle of St Peter, originally founded by Theodoric, mostly rebuilt by Gian
                    Galeazzo Visconti in 1393, and dismantled by the French in 1801. This and the
                    other fortifications of Verona were rebuilt or repaired by the Austrians, but
                    are no longer kept up as military defences. Verona, which is the chief military
                    centre of the Italian province of Venetia, is now being surrounded with a circle
                    of forts far outside the obsolete city walls.</p>
                <p>The early palaces of Verona, before its conquest by Venice, were of very noble
                    and simple design, mostly built of fine red brick, with an inner court,
                    surrounded on the ground floor by open arches like a cloister, as, for example,
                    the Palazzo della Ragione, an assize court, begun in the 12th century. The
                    arches, round or more often pointed in form, were decorated with moulded
                    terra-cotta enrichments, and often with alternating voussoirs of marble. The
                    Scaligeri Palace is a fine example, dating from the 14th century, with, in the
                    cortile, an external staircase leading to an upper loggia, above the usual
                    arcade on the ground floor. It has a very lofty campanile, surmounted by a
                    graceful octagonal upper story. This palace is said to have been mainly built by
                    Can Signorio (Della Scala) about 1370. After the conquest by Venice the domestic
                    buildings of Verona assumed quite a different type. They became feeble copies of
                    Venetian palaces, in which one form of window, with an ogee arch, framed by the
                    dentil moulding is almost always used. The monotony and utter lifelessness of
                    this form of architecture are shown in the meaningless way in which details,
                    suited only to the Venetian methods of veneering walls with thin marble slabs,
                    are copied in the solid marbles of Verona. From the skill of Fra Giocondo (see
                    below), Verona was for many years one of the chief centres in which the most
                    refined and graceful forms of the early Renaissance were developed. The
                    town-hall, with its light open loggia of semicircular arches on the ground
                    floor, was designed by Fra Giocondo towards the end of the 15th century; its
                    sculptured enrichments of pilasters and friezes are very graceful, though
                    lacking the vigorous life of the earlier mediaeval sculptured ornamentation.
                    Verona contains a number of handsome, though somewhat uninteresting, palaces
                    designed by Sanmichele in the 16th century. The finest are those of the
                    Bevilacqua,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The valuable

                    is now the property of the city, and contains a gallery with some good pictures,
                    especially of the Verona, Padua, and Venice schools. As in Venice, many of the
                    16th-century palaces in Verona had stuccoed façades, richly decorated with large
                    fresco paintings, often by very able painters. One of these, the house of the
                    painter Niccolo <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n191/mode/1up"

                    of preservation, and gives a vivid notion of what must once have been the effect
                    of these gorgeous pictured palaces. The episcopal palace contains the ancient
                    and valuable chapter library, of about 12,000 volumes and over 500 MSS., among
                    them the palimpsest of the <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> of Gaius which
                    Niebuhr discovered. The Piazza delle Erbe (fruit market) and the Piazza dei
                    Signori, both in the oldest part of the city, are very picturesque and
                    beautiful, being surrounded by many fine mediaeval buildings. In the former of
                    these a copy of the lion of Venice has recently been erected.</p>
                <p>Verona had a population of 67,080 in 1871, which by 1881 had increased to 68,741.
                    In spite of its pleasant and healthy site, Verona is in winter liable to be cold
                    and rainy, like other places which lie along the southern spurs of the Alps. The
                    Adige, a rapid but shallow river, shrinks to an insignificant stream during the
                    summer. Verona possesses some silk, linen, and woollen manufactures, and carries
                    on a considerable trade in these goods and in grain, hides, flax, hemp, marble,
                    drugs, &amp;c. Amongst the public institutions of the place may be mentioned the
                    public library (1802), the agricultural academy (1768), the botanical garden,
                    various good schools and colleges (including a theological seminary, a lyceum,
                    and gymnasia), and numerous hospitals and charitable organizations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Remains. —</hi> The most conspicuous of the existing
                    Roman remains is the great amphitheatre, a building of the 2d or 3d century,
                    which in general form closely resembled the Colosseum in Rome. Almost the whole
                    of its external arcades, with three tiers of arches, have now disappeared; it
                    was partly thrown down by an earthquake in 1184, and subsequently used as a
                    stone-quarry to supply building materials. Many of its blocks are still visible
                    in the walls of various mediaeval buildings. The interior, with seats for about
                    20,000 people, has been frequently restored, till none of the old seats remain.
                    Traces also exist of extensive baths and of a Roman theatre, the latter outside
                    the most ancient line of walls, close to the left bank of the river. In 1885
                    portions of a number of fine mosaic pavements, dating from the 3d century, were
                    discovered extending over a very large area under the cloister and other parts
                    of the cathedral, about 5 feet below the present floor level. A large number of
                    different patterns exist in a good state of preservation, elaborate in style,
                    but, like all late Roman mosaics, rather coarsely executed with large <hi
                    rend="italic">tesserae.</hi> The Museo Lapidario contains a fine collection of
                    Roman and Etruscan inscriptions and sculpture, mostly collected and published by
                    Scipione Maffei in the 18th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artistic Importance.—</hi> In many respects the resemblance
                    between Verona and Florence is very striking: in both cases we have a strongly
                    fortified city built in a fertile valley, on the banks of a winding river, with
                    suburbs on higher ground, rising close above the main city. In architectural
                    magnificence and in wealth of sculpture and painting Verona almost rivalled the
                    Tuscan city, and, like it, gave birth to a very large number of artists who
                    distinguished themselves in all branches of the fine arts.</p>
                <p>Painting in Verona may be divided into four periods. (i.) The first period is
                    characterized by wall paintings of purely native style, closely resembling the
                    early Christian pictures in the catacombs of Rome. Examples dating from the 10th
                    to the 11th century have been discovered hidden by whitewash on the oldest parts
                    of the nave walls of the church of S. Zeno. They are a very interesting survival
                    of the almost classical Roman style of painting, and appear to be quite free
                    from the generally prevalent Byzantine influence. (ii.) The Byzantine period
                    seems to have lasted during the 12th and 13th centuries. (iii.) The Giottesque
                    period begins contemporaneously with Altichiero da Zevio and Giacomo degli
                    Avanzi, whose chief works were executed during the second half of the 14th
                    century. These two painters were among the ablest of Giotto’s followers, and
                    adorned Verona and Padua with a number of very beautiful frescos, rich in
                    composition, delicate in colour, and remarkable for their highly finished
                    modelling and detail. (iv.) To the fourth period belong several important
                    painters. Pisanello or Vittore <hi rend="smallcaps">Pisano (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> a very charming painter and the greatest medallist of
                    Italy, was probably a pupil of Altichiero.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is every reason to doubt Vasari’s statement that
                    Pisanello was a pupil of Andrea del Castagno.</p></note> Most of his frescos in
                    Verona have perished; but one of great beauty still exists in a very perfect
                    state in the church of S. Anastasia, high up over the arched opening into one of
                    the eastern chapels of the south transept. The scene represents St George and
                    the Princess after the Conquest of the Dragon, with accessory figures, the sea,
                    a mountainous land scape, and an elaborately painted city in the background. The
                    only other existing fresco by Pisanello is an Annunciation in S. Fermo Maggiore.
                    For Pisanello’s pupils and other painters of subsequent date, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Schools of Painting,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 443. Domenico del
                    Riccio, usually nicknamed Brusasorci (1494-1567), was a prolific painter whose
                    works are very numerous in Verona. Paolo Cagliari or Paul <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Veronese (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), though a native of Verona, belongs
                    rather to the Venetian school.</p>
                <p>Verona is specially rich in early examples of decorative sculpture. (i.) The
                    first period is that of northern or Lombardic influence, exemplified in the very
                    interesting series of reliefs which cover the western façades of the church of
                    S. Zeno and the cathedral, dating from the 12th century. These reliefs represent
                    both sacred subjects and scenes of war and hunting, mixed with grotesque
                    monsters, such as specially delighted the rude vigorous nature of the Lombards;
                    they are all richly decorative in effect, though strange and unskilful in
                    detail. Part of the western bronze doors<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>They are frequently stated to be of beaten bronze, but they
                    are really castings, apparently by the <hi rend="italic">cire perdue</hi>
                    process.</p></note> of S. Zeno are especially interesting as being among the
                    earliest important examples in Italy of cast bronze reliefs. They represent
                    scenes from the life of S. Zeno, are rudely modelled, and yet very dramatic and
                    sculpturesque in style.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Part of these doors are covered with bronze reliefs of scenes from the
                    Bible, which are of still earlier date, and were probably brought to Verona from
                    the Rhine provinces.</p></note> Many of the 12th-century reliefs and sculptured
                    capitals in S. Zeno are signed by the sculptor, but these merely constitute
                    lists of names about whom nothing is known. (ii.) In the 13th century the
                    sculpture seems to have lost the Lombard vigour, without acquiring any qualities
                    of superior grace or refinement. The font in the baptistery near the cathedral
                    is an early example of this. Each side of the octagon is covered with a large
                    relief of a Biblical subject, very dull in style and coarse in execution. The
                    font itself is interesting for its early form, one common in the chief
                    baptisteries of northern Italy: like an island in the centre of the great
                    octagonal tank is a lobed marble receptacle, in which the officiating priest
                    stood while he immersed the catechumens. A movable wooden bridge must have been
                    used to enable the priest to cross the water in the surrounding tank. (iii.) The
                    next period is that of Florentine influence. This is exemplified in the
                    magnificently sculptured tombs of the Della Scala lords, designed with steadily
                    growing splendour, from the simple sarcophagus of Martino I. down to the
                    elaborate erection over the tomb of the fratricide Can Signorio, adorned with
                    statuettes of the virtues, to the possession of which he could lay so little
                    claim.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See an eloquent
                    description by Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice,</hi> iii. p. 70 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> The recumbent effigies and decorative details
                    of these tombs are very beautiful, but the smaller figures of angels, saints,
                    and virtues are rather clumsy in proportion. The latest tomb, that of Can
                    Signorio, erected during his lifetime (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1370), is
                    signed “Boninus de Campigliono Mediolanensis Dioscesis.” This sculptor, though
                    of Milanese origin, belongs really to the school of the Florentine Andrea
                    Pisano. One characteristic of the 14th and 15th centuries in Verona was the
                    custom, also followed in other Lombardic cities, of setting large equestrian
                    statues over the tombs of powerful military leaders, in some cases above the
                    recumbent effigy of the dead man, as if to represent him in full vigour of life
                    as well as in death. That which crowns the canopy over the tomb of Can Grande is
                    a very noble, though somewhat quaint, work. (iv.) In the 15th century the
                    influence of Venice became paramount, though this was really only a further
                    development of the Florentine manner, Venice itself having been directly
                    influenced in the 14th century by many able sculptors from Florence.</p>
                <p>The architecture of Verona, like its sculpture, passed through Lombard,
                    Florentine, and Venetian stages. (i.) The church of S. Zeno and the cathedral,
                    both of which were mainly rebuilt in the 12th century, are very noble examples
                    of the Lombardic style, with few single-light windows, and with the walls
                    decorated externally by series of pilasters and by alternating bands of red and
                    white, in stone or brick. The arches of this period are semicircular and rest on
                    round columns and capitals, richly carved with grotesque figures and foliage.
                    Most of the external ornamentation is usually concentrated on the western front,
                    which often has a lofty arched porch on marble columns, resting on griffins or
                    lions devouring their prey. (ii.) The Florentine period (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 1250 to 1400) is represented by the church of S. Anastasia, and by many
                    more or less mutilated palaces, with fine courts surrounded by arcades in one or
                    more stories. The arches are mostly pointed, and in other respects the influence
                    of northern Gothic was more direct in Verona than in Florence. Solidity of mass
                    and simplicity of detail are among the characteristics of this period. (iii.)
                    The Venetian period (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 1400 to 1480) was one of little
                    originality or vigour, the buildings of this date being largely rather dull
                    copies of those at Venice. (iv.) The early Renaissance developed into very
                    exceptional beauty in Verona, mainly through the genius of Fra Giocondo
                    (1435-1514), <pb break="no"

                    the monastery of S. Maria in Organo. He rose to great celebrity as an architect,
                    and designed many graceful and richly sculptured buildings in Venice, Rome, and
                    even in France; he used classical forms with great taste and skill, and with
                    much of the freedom of the older mediaeval architects, and was specially
                    remarkable for his rich and delicate sculptured decorations. The Roman gateway
                    of Gallienus (mentioned below) supplied a special form of window, with a
                    circular arch on pilasters, surmounted by a cornice; this was copied by Fra
                    Giocondo, and has been used by countless architects down to the present day

                    tendency towards that dull scholastic classicism which in the hands of Palladio
                    put an end to all real life in the art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Nothing is certainly known of the history of
                    Verona until it became a Roman colony with the title of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Hist.,</hi> iii. 8, and Strabo, p. 213). Its fertile surroundings, its central
                    position at the junction of several great roads, and the natural strength of its
                    position, defended by a river along two-thirds of its circumference, all
                    combined to make Verona one of the richest and most important cities in northern
                    Italy, although its extent within the walls was not large. The existing remains
                    of wall and gates are shown by inscriptions on them to date from the 3d century;
                    the ancient <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> still exists as an open canal, so that
                    the old part of the city is wholly surrounded by water. One very handsome
                    gateway inside the Roman city, now called the Porta de’ Borsari, was restored in
                    265 by Gallienus. There are, however, traces of a more ancient circuit wall and
                    gates on the old line. The emperor Constantine, while advancing towards Rome
                    from Gaul, besieged and took Verona (312); it was here, too, that Odoacer was
                    defeated (489) by Theodoric the Goth, who built a palace at Verona and
                    frequently resided there. Verona was the birthplace of Catullus.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages Verona gradually grew in size and importance. In early times
                    it was one of the chief residences of the Lombard kings;<note anchored="true"

                    suffered much during the Guelf and Ghibelline struggles, it rose to a foremost
                    position both from the political and the artistic point of view under its rulers
                    of the Scaliger and Della Scala families. The first prominent member of the
                    latter family and founder of his dynasty was Martino I., who ruled over the city
                    from 1260 till his death in 1277. Verona had previously fallen under the power
                    of a less able despot, Ezzelino da Romano, who died in 1259. Alberto della Scala
                    (died in 1301) was succeeded by his eldest son Bartolomeo, who was confirmed as
                    ruler of Verona by the popular vote, and died in 1304. Alboino, the second son,
                    succeeded his brother, and died in 1311, when the youngest son of Alberto, Can
                    Grande, who since 1308 had been joint-lord of Verona with his brother, succeeded
                    to the undivided power. Can Grande (Francesco della Scala, died in 1329) was the
                    best and most illustrious of his line, and is specially famous as the hospitable
                    patron of <hi rend="smallcaps">Dante</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v</hi>.). Other
                    princes of this dynasty, which lasted for rather more than a century, were
                    Giovanni (d. 1350), Martino II. (d. 1351), Can Grande II. (d. 1359), and Can
                    Signorio (d. 1375). In 1389 Gian Galeazzo Visconti, duke of Milan, became by
                    conquest lord of Verona. Soon after his death the city fell by treacherous means
                    into the hands of Francesco II. di Carrara, lord of Padua. In 1404-5, Verona,
                    together with Padua, was finally conquered by Venice, and remained subject to
                    the Venetians till the overthrow of the republic by Napoleon in 1797, who in the
                    same year, after the treaty of Campo Formio, ceded it to the Austrians with the
                    rest of Venetia; and since that time its political history has been linked to
                    that of Venice.</p>
