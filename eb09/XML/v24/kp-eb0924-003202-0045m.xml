                    the younger of twin sons of Fernando de Valdes, hereditary regidor of Cuenca.
                    Juan has often been confounded with his twin-brother Alphonso, who was in the
                    suite of Charles V. in 1520, acted as his Latin secretary from 1524, and died in
                    1532 at Vienna. It has been conjectured that Juan studied at the university of
                    Alcala. We first meet him as the anonymous author of a politico-religious <hi
                    rend="italic">Diálogo de Mercurio y Caron,</hi> apparently written in 1528 and
                    published then or soon after. As this <hi rend="italic">Diálogo</hi> reflected
                    strongly on the corruptions of the Roman Church, Valdes got into difficulties
                    with the Spanish Inquisition, and left Spain for Naples in 1530. He removed in
                    1531 to Rome. On 12th January 1533 he writes from Bologna, where he was in
                    attendance upon the pope, Clement VII.; his criticisms of papal policy had been
                    condoned, inasmuch as in his <hi rend="italic">Dialogo</hi> he had defended the
                    validity of the marriage of Catherine of Aragon to Henry VIII. But in the autumn
                    of 1533 he returned to Naples, and seems never to have left it again. His name
                    has been Italianized into Valdesso and Val d’Esso. It has frequently been
                    asserted that he was appointed by Charles V. as secretary to the viceroy at
                    Naples, Don Pedro de Toledo; but of this there is no evidence, and it seems a
                    “harmonizing” conjecture, based on the confusion between Alphonso and Juan.
                    Curione (writing in 1544) calls him “cavalliere di Cesare,” but there is no
                    proof of his having ever held an official appointment. At his house on the
                    Chiaja he was the centre of a very distinguished circle, literary and religious,
                    and the influence of his conversations and his writings, chiefly circulated in
                    manuscript, stimulated the desire for a spiritual reformation of the church. The
                    first-fruit of his cultured leisure at Naples was a philological treatise, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogo de la Lengua</hi> (written 1533); but, though his friends
                    urged him to seek distinction by his humanistic studies, his bent was towards
                    the spiritual problems of Biblical interpretation and the deep things of the
                    devout life. Vermigli (Peter Martyr) and Marcantonio Flaminio were leading
                    spirits in the coterie of Valdes, which included Vittoria Colonna and her
                    sister-in-law Giulia Gonzaga. On Ochino, whom he furnished with themes for
                    sermons, his influence was very great. Carnesecchi, who had known Valdes at Rome
                    as “a modest and wellbred courtier,” found him at Naples in 1540 “wholly intent
                    upon the study of Holy Scripture,” portions of which he translated from the
                    Hebrew and Greek into Spanish, with comments and suggestive prefaces. To his
                    teaching Carnesecchi ascribes his own complete adoption of the Evangelical
                    doctrine of justification by faith, and at the same time his estrangement from
                    the policy of the Lutheran schism. Valdes died at Naples in May 1541.</p>
                <p>The death of Valdes scattered his band of associates. Ochino and Vermigli
                    abandoned the hope of a regenerated Catholicism, and left Italy. By degrees some
                    of Valdes’s writings were translated into Italian and published. They exhibit
                    great originality and penetration, combined with a delicate vein of
                    semi-mystical spirituality, and retain a large measure of that personal charm
                    which is attributed to their author in all contemporary notices. Llorente finds
                    traces in Valdes of the influence of Tauler’s writings; any such influence must
                    have been at second hand. Valdes was in relations with Fra Benedetto of Mantua,
                    the anonymous author of <hi rend="italic">Del Benefizio di Gesù Cristo
                    Crocefisso,</hi> which was revised by Flaminio (reprinted by Dr Babington,
                    Cambridge, 1855). The suggestion that Valdes was unsound on the doctrine of the
                    Trinity was first made in 1567 by the Transylvanian bishop, Francis David (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Socinus,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 230); it has been adopted by
                    Sand (1684), Wallace (1850), and other anti-Trinitarian writers, and is
                    countenanced by Bayle. Some colour has been given to this view by isolated
                    expressions in his writings, and by the subsequent course of Ochino, whose
                    orthodoxy seems, however, to have been unjustly suspected, from the speculative
                    insight with which he presented objections. But Valdes, though he never treats
                    of the Trinity, even when commenting upon Matt. xxviii. 19, reserving it in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Latte Spirituale</hi> as a topic for advanced Christians,
                    explicitly affirms the consubstantiality of the Son, whom he unites in
                    doxologies with the Father and the Holy Spirit <hi rend="italic">(Opusc.,</hi>
                    p. 145). His interest centred in matters of practical rather than of speculative
                    theology: his great aim was the promotion of a healthy and personal piety.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of his writings.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Dialogo de Mercurio y Caron,</hi> 8vo (no date or place of
                    printing; 1528 ?). An Italian translation, by Nicolo Franco, was printed at
                    Venice without date, and reprinted at the same place in 1545. Both with the
                    original and the translation is generally found a <hi rend="italic">Dialogo</hi>
                    on the sack of Rome in 1527, by Alphonso de Valdes, printed at the same time.
                    Both are ascribed to Juan in the reprint <hi rend="italic">Dos Dialogos</hi> of
                    1850. (2) <hi rend="italic">Diálogo de la Lengua,</hi> written in 1533, first
