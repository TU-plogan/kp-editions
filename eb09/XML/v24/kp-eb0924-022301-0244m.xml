                    (one-fourth), Poitou, and Berry, and formerly known as Haut-Limousin, lies
                    between 45° 26' and 46° 23' N. lat. and 0° 38' and 1° 54' E. long., and is
                    bounded by the Indre on the N., Creuse on the E., Corrèze on the S.E., Dordogne
                    on the S.W., Charente on the W., and Vienne on the N.W. Haute-Vienne belongs to
                    the central plateau of France, and drains partly to the Loire and partly to the
                    Garonne. The highest point (2549 feet) is in the extreme south-east, and belongs
                    to the treeless but well-watered plateau of Millevaches, formed of granite,
                    gneiss, and mica. To the northwest of the Millevaches are the Ambazac (2300
                    feet) and Blond (1690 feet) Hills, both separating the valley of the Vienne from
                    that of the Gartempe, a tributary of the Creuse. The Vienne traverses the
                    department from east to west, passing Eymoutiers, St Léonard, Limoges, and St
                    Junien, and receiving on the right the Maude and the Taurion. The Isle, which
                    flows into the Dordogne, with its tributaries the Auvézère and the Dronne, and
                    the Tardoire and the Bandiat, tributaries of the Charente, all rise in the south
                    of the department. The altitude and inland position of Haute-Vienne, its
                    geological character, and the northern exposure of its valleys make the winters
                    long and severe; but the climate is milder in the west and north-west. The
                    annual rainfall at Limoges is 36 inches.</p>
                <p>Of the total area of 1,360,000 acres 439,215 are cultivated, 4263 are occupied by
                    vineyards, 75,333 by chestnut trees, and 163,135 by dry underwood. The crops in
                    1884 were—wheat 1,242,271 bushels, meslin 34,298, rye 2,482,557, barley 13,300,
                    oats 318,026, buckwheat 1,529,368, maize 65,579, potatoes 6,710,723, beetroot
                    189,000 tons, colza seed 1845 tons, hemp seed 1921, hemp 1200, linseed 93, flax
                    46, hay 387,192, clover 31,527, lucerne 3153, wine 111,430 gallons (average for
                    preceding ten years 141,020 gallons). The live stock included 8371 horses of a
                    shapely and powerful breed, 684 mules, 4975 asses, 146,131 cattle, 507,443 sheep
                    of native and 43,593 of improved breed, 104,263 pigs, and 9642 goats. There were
                    36,601 beehives (104½ tons of honey and 34½ tons of wax). The department is on
                    the whole unproductive. The chestnut is here characteristic, as the apple in
                    Normandy, and with the potato and turnip it forms the chief food of the people.
                    The brooks are fringed by fine meadows, and the hills are covered with heaths or
                    forests of beech, hornbeam, oak, birch, and chestnut. The mineral wealth
                    consists of iron, copper, tin, wolfram, antimony, serpentine, fine-grained
                    granite, gneiss, garnets, emeralds, and a kind of porphyry, which takes a fine
                    polish. There are inexhaustible supplies of china clay, in which an export trade
                    is carried on with Russia and America. 5800 workmen are employed in porcelain
                    manufactories, 650 in paper and pasteboard mills (annual product, £100,000), 560
                    in wool and cotton spinning mills and manufactories of flannel, druggets,
                    woollen cloaks, and carpets, 600 in shoe-making (annual product, £100,000), 600
                    in manufactories of sabots, 340 in glove manufactories, 370 in tan-yards, 325 in
                    leather-dressing works, 130 in coach-building and wheelwrights’ shops, 125 in
                    cabinet workshops, 325 in printing works, and 100 in distilleries (annual
                    product, £480,000). In 1878 1153 tons of iron were produced, and there are
                    forges, foundries, copper-works, and manufactories of agricultural and other
                    implements. Porcelain, china clay, woven goods, boots and shoes, sabots, gloves,
                    leather, cattle, horses, wood, chestnuts, hemp, and paper are exported; corn,
                    wine, coal, raw materials, and various manufactured articles are imported. There
                    are in Haute-Vienne 234 miles of railway, and 234 of national and 3191 of other
                    roads. This department, with that of Corrèze, forms the diocese of Limoges; it
                    belongs to the district of the Limoges court of appeal and army corps, has its
                    academy at Poitiers, and is divided for purposes of administration into 4
                    arrondissements (Limoges, population of town 63,707 in 1886; Bellac, 4015;
                    Rochechouart, 1829; and St Yrieix, 3556), 27 cantons, and 203 communes. The
                    population in 1881 was 349,332 and in 1886 363,182, an increase of 117,982 since
                    1801. Limoges is the chef-lieu. St Yrieix has an early Gothic church of the 12th
                    century, kaolin mines, porcelain manufactories, and tan-yards. St Junien (5454)
                    has an interesting bridge and houses of the 13th century, and numerous
                    manufactories of gloves, paper, porcelain, sabots, and woven goods. St Leonard
                    (3427), the birthplace of Gay-Lussac, possesses a remarkable church of the 11th
                    and 12th centuries, tanyards, paper-mills, and copper-works. At Châlus (1675)
                    Richard Coeur de Lion died.</p>
