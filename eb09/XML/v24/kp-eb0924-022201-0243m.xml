                    Poitou (four-fifths of its present area), Touraine (one-seventh), and Berry,
                    lies between 46° 3' and 47° 10' N. lat. and 0° 6' W. and 1° 12' E. long., and is
                    bounded by Deux-Sèvres on the W., Charente on the S., Haute-Vienne on the S.E.,
                    Indre on the E., Indre-et-Loire on the N.E. and N., and Maine-et-Loire on the
                    N.W. The river Vienne, which gives its name to the department, with its
                    tributaries the Creuse (subtributary the Gartempe) on the east and the Clain on
                    the west, flows from south to north. The general slope of the department is in
                    the same direction, the highest point (764 feet) being in the south-east and the
                    lowest (115 feet) at the junction of the Vienne and the Creuse. In the south the
                    Charente, on the northwest the Dive, and in the west some streams belonging to
                    the basin of the Sèvre-Niortaise drain small portions of the department. The
                    average temperature is 54° Fahr. The prevailing winds are from the south-west
                    and west. The annual rainfall is 23 inches.</p>
