                <p><label type="entry">VOICE</label> is produced by the vibrations of the vocal
                    cords, two ligaments or bands of fibrous elastic tissue situated in the larynx.
                    It is to be distinguished from <hi rend="italic">speech,</hi> which is the
                    production of sounds intended to express ideas. Many of the lower animals have
                    voice, but none have the power of speech in the sense in which man possesses
                    that faculty. There may be speech without voice, as in whispering, whilst in
                    singing a scale of musical tones we have voice without speech. Regarding speech,
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Phonetics</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Speech-Sounds;</hi> also the articles on the various letters of the
                    alphabet.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Physiological Anatomy.—</hi> The organ of voice, the <hi
                        rend="italic">larynx,</hi> is situated in man in the upper and fore part of
                    the neck, where it forms a well-known prominence in the middle line. It opens
                    below into the trachea or windpipe, and above into the cavity of the pharynx,
                    and it consists of a framework of cartilages, connected by elastic membranes or
                    ligaments, two of which constitute the true vocal cords. These cartilages are
                    movable on each other by the action of various muscles, which thus regulate the
                    position and the tension of the vocal cords. The trachea conveys the blast of
                    air from the lungs during expiration, and the whole apparatus may be compared to
                    an acoustical contrivance in which the lungs represent the wind chest and the
                    trachea the tube passing from the wind chest to the sounding body contained in
                    the larynx. Suppose two tight bands of any elastic membrane, such as thin sheet
                    india-rubber, stretched over the end of a wide glass tube so as to leave a
                    narrow chink between the free borders of the membrane, and that a powerful blast
                    of air is driven through the tube by a bellows. The pressure would so distend
                    the margins of the membrane as to open the aperture and allow the air to escape;
                    this would cause a fall of pressure, and the edges of the membrane would spring
                    back by their elasticity to their former position; again the pressure would
                    increase, and again the edges of the membrane would be distended; and those
                    actions would be so quickly repeated as to cause the edges of the membrane to
                    vibrate with sufficient rapidity to produce a musical tone, the pitch of which
                    would depend on the number of vibrations executed in a second of time. The
                    condensation and rarefaction of the air thus produced are the chief cause of the
                    tone, as Von Helmholtz has pointed out, and in this way the larynx resembles the
                    syren in its mode of producing tone (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics).</hi>
                    It is evident also that the intensity or loudness of the tone would be
                    determined by the amplitude of the vibrations of the margins of the membrane,
                    and that its pitch would be affected by any arrangements effecting an increase
                    or decrease of the tension of the margins of the membrane. The pitch might also
                    be raised by the strength of the current of air, because the great amplitude of
                    the vibrations would increase the mean tension of the elastic membrane. With
                    tones of medium pitch, the pressure of the air in the trachea is equal to that
                    of a column of mercury of 160 mm.; with high pitch, 920 mm.; and with notes of
                    very high pitch, 945 mm.; whilst in whispering it may fall as low as that
                    represented by 30 mm. of water. Such is a general conception of the mechanism of
                    voice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cartilages</hi> form the framework of the larynx. They
                    consist of three single pieces (the thyroid, the cricoid, and the cartilage of
                    the epiglottis) and of three pairs (two arytenoids, two cornicula laryngis or
                    cartilages of Santorini, and two cuneiform cartilages or cartilages of
                    Wrisberg), see figs. 1 and 2. The epiglottis, the cornicula laryngis, the
                    cuneiform cartilages, and the apices of the arytenoids are composed of yellow or
                    elastic fibro-cartilage, whilst the cartilage of all the others is of the
                    hyaline variety, resembling that of the costal or rib cartilages. These
                    cartilages are bound together by ligaments, some of which are seen in figs. 1
                    and 2, whilst the remainder are represented in fig. 3. The ligaments specially
                    concerned in the production of voice are the <hi rend="italic">inferior
                        thyro-arytenoid ligaments,</hi> or true vocal cords. These are composed of
                    fine elastic fibres attached behind to the anterior projection of the base of
                    the arytenoid cartilages, <hi rend="italic">processus vocalis,</hi> 3 in fig. 3,
                    and in front to the middle of the angle between the wings or laminae of the
                    thyroid cartilage. They are practically continuous with the lateral cricothyroid
                    ligaments, 6 in fig. 3.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cavity</hi> of the larynx is divided into an upper and
                    lower portion by the narrow aperture of the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> or
                    chink between the edges of the true vocal cords, the <hi rend="italic">rima
                        glottidis.</hi> Immediately above the true vocal cords, between these and
                    the false vocal cords, there is on each side a recess or pouch termed the <hi
                        rend="italic">ventricle</hi> of Morgagni, and opening from each ventricle
                    there is a still smaller recess, the <hi rend="italic">laryngeal pouch,</hi>
                    which passes for the space of half an inch between the superior vocal cords
                    inside and the thyroid cartilage outside, reaching as high as the upper border
                    of that cartilage at the side of the epiglottis. The ventricles no doubt permit
                    a free vibration of the trιιe vocal cords (Quain). The upper aperture of the
                    glottis is triangular, wide in front and narrow behind; and, when seen from
                    above by means of the laryngoscope, it presents the view represented in fig. 4.
                    The aperture is bounded in front by the epiglottis, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    behind by the summits of the arytenoid cartilages, <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi>
                    and on the sides by two folds of mucous membrane, the aryteno-epiglottic folds,
                        <hi rend="italic">ae.</hi> The rounded elevations corresponding to the

                    the cushion of the epiglottis, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> are readily seen in the

                    12 millimetres across its widest part, according to the degree of dilatation. In
                    females and in males before puberty the antero - posterior diameter is about 17
                    millimetres and its transverse diameter about 4 millimetres. The vocal cords of
                    the adult male are in length about 15 millimetres, and of the adult female about
                    11 millimetres. The larynx is lined With a layer of epithelium, which is closely
                    adherent to underlying structures, more especially over the true vocal cords.
                    The cells of the epithelium, in the greater portion of the larynx, are of the
                    columnar ciliated variety, and by the vibratory action of the cilia mucus is
                    driven upwards, but over the true vocal cords the epithelium is squamous.
                    Patches of squamous epithelium are also found in the ciliated tract above the
                    glottis, on the under surface of the epiglottis, on the inner surface of the
                    arytenoid cartilages, and on the free border of the upper or false cords.
                    Numerous mucous glands exist in the lining membrane of the larynx, more
                    especially in the epiglottis. In each laryngeal pouch there are sixty to seventy
                    such glands, surrounded by fat.</p>
                <p>We are now in a position to understand the action of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >muscles</hi> of the larynx by which the vocal cords, forming the <hi
                        rend="italic">rima glottidis,</hi> can be tightened or relaxed, and by which
                    they can be approximated or separated. Besides certain extrinsic
                    muscles—sterno-hyoid, omo-hyoid, sterno-thyroid, and thyro-hyoid— which move the
                    larynx as a whole, there are <hi rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> muscles which move
                    the cartilages on each other. Some of these are seen in fig. 5. These muscles
                    are (oe) the crico-thyroid, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the posterior
                    crico-arytenoid, <hi rend="italic">(c</hi>) the lateral crico-arytenoid, <hi
                        rend="italic">(d)</hi> the thyro - arytenoid, (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) the
                    arytenoid, and (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) the aryteno - epiglottidean. Their
                    actions will be readily understood with the aid of the diagrams in fig. 6. (1)
                    The <hi rend="italic">crico-thyroid</hi> is a short thick triangular muscle, its
                    fibres passing from the cricoid cartilage obliquely upwards and outwards to be
                    inserted into the lower border of the thyroid cartilage and to the outer border
                    of its lower horn. When the muscle contracts, the cricoid and thyroid cartilages
                    are approximated. In this action, however, it is not the thyroid that is
                    depressed on the cricoid, as is generally stated, but, the thyroid being fixed
                    in position by the action of tho extrinsic muscles, the anterior border of the
                    cricoid is drawn upwards, whilst its posterior border, in consequence of a
                    revolution around the axis uniting the articulations between the lower cornua of
                    the cricoid and the thyroid, is depressed, carrying the arytenoid cartilages
                    along with it. Thus the vocal cords are stretched. (2) The <hi rend="italic"
                        >thyro-arytenoid</hi> has been divided by anatomists into two parts—one, the
                    internal, lying close to the true vocal cord, and the other, external,
                    immediately within the ala of the thyroid cartilage. Many of the fibres of the
                    anterior portion pass from the thyroid cartilage with a slight curve (concavity
                    inwards) to the processus vocalis at the base of the arytenoid cartilage. They
                    are thus parallel with the true vocal cord, and when they contract the
                    arytenoids are drawn forwards, carrying with them the posterior part of the
                    cricoid and relaxing the vocal cords. Thus the thyro-arytenoids are the
                    antagonists of the crico-thyroids. Ludwig has pointed out that certain fibres
                        (<hi rend="italic">portio-ary-vocalis)</hi> arise from the side of the cord
                    itself and pass obliquely back to the processus vocalis. These will tighten the
                    parts of the cord in front and relax the parts behind their points of
                    attachment. Some of the fibres of the outer portion run obliquely upwards from
                    the side of the crico-thyroid membrane, pass through the antero-posterior fibres
                    of the inner portion of the muscle, and finally end in the tissue of the false
                    cord. These fibres have been supposed to render the edge of the cord more
                    prominent. Other fibres inserted into the processus vocalis will rotate slightly
                    the arytenoid outwards, whilst a few passing up into the aryteno-epiglottidean
                    folds may assist in depressing the epiglottis (Quain).</p>
                <p>(3) The <hi rend="italic">posterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lateral
                        crico-arytenoid</hi> muscles have antagonistic actions, and may be
                    considered together. The <hi rend="italic">posterior</hi> arise from the
                    posterior surface of the cricoid cartilage, and passing upwards and outwards are
                    attached to the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid. On the other hand, the
                        <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> arise from the upper border of the cricoid as
                    far back as the articular surface for the arytenoid, pass backwards and upwards,
                    and are also inserted into the outer angle of the base of the arytenoid before
                    the attachment of the posterior crico - arytenoid. Imagine the pyramidal form of
                    the arytenoid cartilages. To the inner angle of the triangular base are
                    attached, as already described, the true vocal cords; and to the outer angle the
                    two muscles in question. The posterior crico-arytenoids draw the outer angles
                    backwards and inwards, thus rotating the inner angles, or processus vocalis,
                    outwards, and, when the two muscles act, widening the rima glottidis. This
                    action is opposed by the lateral crico-thyroids, which draw the outer angle
                    forwards and outwards, rotate the inner angles inwards, and thus approximate the
                    cords. (4) The <hi rend="italic">arytenoids</hi> pass from the one arytenoid
                    cartilage to the other, and in action these cartilages will be approximated and
                    slightly depressed. (5) The <hi rend="italic">aryteno-epiglottidean</hi> muscles
                    arise near the outer angles of the arytenoid; their fibres pass obliquely
                    upwards, decussate, and are inserted partly into the outer and upper border of
                    the opposite cartilage, partly into the aryteno-epiglottic fold, and partly join
                    the fibres of the thyro-arytenoids. In action they assist in bringing the
                    arytenoids together, whilst they also draw down the epiglottis, and constrict
                    the upper aperture of the larynx. The vocal cords will be also relaxed by the
                    elasticity of the parts.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">General Physiological Characters.—</hi> As already stated,
                    the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">loudness</hi> of voice
                    depends on the amplitude of the movement of the vocal cords. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pitch</hi> depends on the number of vibrations per second; and the length,
                    size, and degree of tension of the cords will determine the number of
                    vibrations. The more tense the cords the higher the pitch, and the greater the
                    length of the cords the lower will be the pitch. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >range</hi> of the human voice is about three octaves, that is from fa <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (87 vibrations per second) to sol <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 4</hi> (768 vibrations). In men, by the development of the
                    larynx, the cords become more elongated than in women, in the ratio of 3 to 2,
                    so that the male voice is of lower pitch and is usually stronger. At the age of
                    puberty the larynx grows rapidly, and the voice of a boy “breaks”</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0298-0275"/>
                <p>in consequence of the lengthening of the cords, generally falling an octave in
                    pitch. A similar change, but very much less in amount, occurs at the same period
                    in the female. At puberty in the female there is an increase of about one-third
                    in the size of the glottis, but it is nearly doubled in the male, and the adult
                    male larynx is about one-third greater than that of the female. In advanced life
                    the upper notes of the register are gradually weakened and ultimately disappear,
                    whilst the character of the voice also changes, owing to loss of elasticity
                    caused by ossification, which first begins about middle life in the thyroid
                    cartilage, then appears in the cricoid, and much later in the arytenoid. Eunuchs
                    retain the voices of childhood; and by careful training it is possible in normal
                    persons to arrest the development of the larynx so that an adult male can still
                    sing the soprano parts sometimes used in cathedral choirs. The ranges of the
                    different varieties of voice are shown in the following diagram, where the
                    dotted lines give the range of certain remarkable voices, and the figures
                    represent vibrations per second.</p>
                <p>There is thus a range for ordinary voices of nearly two octaves, and certain rare
                    voices may have a range of three and a half octaves. A basso named Gaspard
                    Forster passed from fa _ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to la <hi rend="subscript"
                        > 3</hi>; the younger of the sisters Sessi had a contralto voice from do <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to fa <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>; the voice of
                    Catalani ranged three and a half octaves; a eunuch singer, Farinelli, passed
                    from la <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to re <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>; Nilson,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Il Flauto Magico,</hi> can take fa <hi rend="subscript">
                        5</hi>; and Mozart states that he heard in Parma in 1770 a singer, Lucrezia
                    Ajugari, range from sol <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to do <hi rend="subscript">
                        6</hi>, which she gave purely, whilst she could execute trills on re <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. The latter is the most highly pitched voice
                    referred to in musical literature, an octave and a half above the highest
                    ordinary soprano. The range of these voices is shown in dotted lines in the
                    accompanying diagram, and the number of vibrations per second is also noted,
                    taking the middle C of the piano as 256 vibrations per second. It will be
                    observed that the lowest note of Gaspard Forster’s voice is not much above the
                    pitch at which the perception of musical tone begins, and that from this note to
                    the upper note of Lucrezia Ajugari there is a range of nearly six octaves,
                    whilst the extreme range of ordinary voices, from the lowest bass to the highest
                    soprano, is a little over three octaves. It is also interesting to observe in
                    connexion with this that the range of the human ear for the perception of
                    musical tone is from do _ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to do <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, or from about 32 to 33,768 vibrations per
                    second,—eleven octaves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> of the human voice depends on the same laws
                    that determine the quality, clang-tint, or timbre of the tones produced by any
                    musical instrument. Musical tones are formed by the vibrations of the true vocal
                    cords. These tones may be either pure or mixed, and in both cases they are
                    strengthened by the resonance of the air in the air-passages and in the
                    pharyngeal and oral cavities. If mixed—that is, if the tone is compounded of a
                    number of partials—one or more of these will be strengthened by the cavities
                    above the cords acting as a resonator; and so strongly may these partials be
                    thus reinforced that the fundamental one may be obscured, and a certain quality
                    or timbre will be communicated to the ear. Further, Von Helmholtz has shown that
                    special forms of the oral cavity reinforce in particular certain partials, and
                    thus give a character to vowel tones,—indeed to such an extent that each vowel
                    tone may be said to have a fixed pitch. This may be proved by putting the mouth
                    in a certain form, keeping the lips open, and bringing various tuning forks
                    sounding feebly in front of the opening. When a fork is found to which the
                    resonant cavity of the mouth corresponds, then the tone of the fork is
                    intensified, and by thus altering the form and capacity of the oral cavity its
                    pitch in various conditions may be determined. Thus, according to Von Helmholtz,
                    the pitch corresponding to the vowels may be expressed :—</p>

                <p>Donders has given a third result, differing from each of the above; and there is
                    little doubt that much will depend on the quality of tone peculiar to different
                    nationalities. By means of Koenig’s manometric flames with revolving mirror the
                    varying quality of tone may be illustrated: with a pure tone, the teeth in the
                    flame-picture are equal, like the serrations of a saw, whilst usually the tone
                    is mixed with partials, which show themselves by the unequal serrations. It is
                    thus certain that quality of voice depends, not merely on the size, degree of
                    elasticity, and general mobility of the vocal cords, but also on the form of the
                    resonating cavities above, and there can be no doubt that very slight
                    differences in these may produce striking results.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Condition of the Larynx in the Various Registers.—</hi> In
                    singing, one can readily observe that the tone may appear to come chiefly from
                    the chest, from the throat, or from the head, or it may show the peculiar
                    quality of tone termed falsetto. Authorities differ much in the nomenclature
                    applied to these varieties of the voice. Thus the old Italian music masters
                    spoke of the voce di petto, voce di gola, and voce di testa. Madam Seiler
                    describes five conditions, namely, the first series of tones of the chest
                    register, the second series of tones of the chest register, the first series of
                    tones of the falsetto register, the second series of tones of the falsetto
                    register, and the head register. French writers usually refer to two registers
                    only, the chest and the head; whilst Behnke gives three registers for male
                    voices (lower thick, upper thick, and upper thin), and five for the voices of
                    women and children (lower thick, upper thick, lower thin, upper thin, and
                        small).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    practically than as implying any marked physiological differences in the
                    mechanism of the larynx during the production of the tones in the different
                    registers. By means of the laryngoscope it is possible to see the condition of
                    the rima glottidis and the cords in passing through all the range of the
                    voice.</p>
                <p>In 1807 Bozzini first showed that it was possible to see into the dark cavities
                    of the body by illumining them with a mirror, and in 1829 Babington first saw
                    the glottis in this way. In 1854 Garcia investigated his own larynx and that of
                    other singers, and three years later Türck and especially Czermak perfected the
                    construction of the laryngoscope. In 1883 Lennox Browne and Emil Behnke obtained
                    photographs of the glottis in the living man. The laryngoscope is a small
                    mirror, about the diameter of a shilling, fixed to the end of a long handle at
                    an angle of 125° to 130°. This mirror is gently pushed towards the back of the
                    throat, and if sufficient light be thrown into the mouth from a lamp, and if the
                    eye of the observer be in the proper position, by angling the small mirror it is
                    not difficult to get a view of the glottis. The light from the lamp is reflected
                    by the mirror down on the glottis, from this it is reflected back to the mirror,
                    and then by the mirror it is finally reflected to the eye of the observer.
                    Usually the observer has in front of his eye a mirror by which a powerful beam
                    of light can be thrown from a lamp into the mouth and throat. In the centre of
                    the mirror there is a small hole through which the eye of the observer sees the
                    image in the small mirror at the back of the throat. By placing a second plane
                    mirror in front of the face, an observer can easily study the mechanism of his
                    own larynx.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A cheap and
                            efficient form of auto-laryngoscope was constructed by the late Dr David

                <p>Suppose the picture of the larynx to be examined in the small mirror at the back
                    of the throat, an image will be seen as in fig. 4. During calm breathing, the
                    glottis is lance-shaped, between the yellowish white cords. A deep inspiration
                    causes the glottis to open widely and in favourable circumstances one may look
                    into the trachea. When a sound is to be made, the vocal cords are brought close
                    together, either along their whole length, as in fig. 7, or only along the
                    ligamentous portion, the space between the arytenoids being still open, as in
                    fig. 8. Then when the sound begins the glottis opens (fig. 4), the form of the
                    opening influencing the kind of voice, whilst the degree of tension of the cords
                    will determine the pitch.</p>
                <p>During inspiration the edges of the true vocal cords may occasionally be close
                    together, as in sobbing, and it has been pointed out by various observers that
                    during inspiration the false cords are easily separated, even when they touch,
                    and during expiration, owing to dilatation of the ventricles, they come together
                    and may readily close. Thus, from the plane of the cords, the true cords are
                    most easily closed during inspiration and the false cords during expiration.
                    Wyllie clearly showed in 1865 that the false vocal cords play the chief part in
                    closure of the glottis during expiration (<hi rend="italic">Edin. Med.
                        Jour.,</hi> 1866). Lauder Brunton and Cash have confirmed Wyllie’s results,
                    and have shown further that the function of the false cords is to close the
                    glottis and thus fix the thorax for muscular effort; and they adduce many facts
                    from comparative anatomy in favour of this view, these cords being strongly
                    developed in those animals whose habits render fixation serviceable, whilst, on
                    the other hand, they are absent or weakly developed in animals where fixation is
                    of little or no service <hi rend="italic">(Jour. Anat. and Physiol.,</hi> vol.
                    xvii.).</p>
                <p>During the production of the <hi rend="italic">chest</hi> voice, the space
                    between the arytenoid cartilages is open, and between the vocal cords there is
                    an ellipsoidal opening which gradually closes as the pitch of the sound rises
                    (see figs. 9, 10, 11). During <hi rend="italic">head</hi> voice, the opening
                    between the arytenoids is completely closed; the portion between the vocal cords
                    is open, but in place of being almost a narrow straight slit as in chest voice,
                    it is wide open so as to allow an escape of more air (see fig. 12). The
                    condition of the cords during <hi rend="italic">falsetto</hi> is, according to
                    Müller, one in which the cords can only vibrate at their margins, and especially
                    in the middle, in consequence of the false cords pressing downwards upon them.
                    Oertel, on the other hand, states that in falsetto the cords vibrate throughout
                    their length, “but that they form nodal lines parallel to the free borders of
                    the loops or bellies of vibration” (Beaunis). Probably in these circumstances
                    the membranes become much thinner. Oertel also found that during the falsetto
                    voice the epiglottis became erect, the apices of the arytenoids were directed
                    backwards, and the whole larynx became narrower but longer from before
                    backwards. Behnke says that, in the production of the “small register,” the
                    mechanism “consists in the formation of an oval orifice in the front part of the
                    glottis which contracts the more the higher the voice ascends, the vocal
                    ligaments being, in the hinder part, pressed together so tightly that scarcely
                    any trace of a slit remains” (Lennox Brown and Behnke, <hi rend="italic">op.
                        cit.).</hi> Illingworth is of opinion that falsetto (and even the ordinary
                    voice) is produced in the “same way as the mouth is used in whistling” (see <hi
                        rend="italic">Edin. Med. Jour.,</hi> 1876). This view may be true to some
                    extent as regards falsetto, but it will not hold good for the ordinary
                    voice.</p>
                <p>The crico-thyroid muscle is supplied by the superior laryngeal branch of the
                    pneumogastric nerve, and all the other muscles by the inferior or recurrent
                    laryngeal branch <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0300-0277"/> of the same nerve. The superior laryngeal is
                    also the sensory nerve of the larynx. Stirling has found ganglionic cells in the
                    course of this nerve. Paralysis of the motor fibres causes aphonia, or loss of
                    voice. If one cord is paralysed the voice may be lost or become falsetto in
                    tone. Sometimes the cords may move in breathing or during coughing, but be
                    motionless during an attempt at the production of voice. Rarely, incomplete
                    unilateral paralysis of the recurrent nerve, or the existence of a tumour on
                    each cord, thus making them unequal in length, may cause a double tone, or <hi
                        rend="italic">diphthongia</hi> (Türck). Hoarseness is caused by roughness or
                    swelling of the cords.</p>
