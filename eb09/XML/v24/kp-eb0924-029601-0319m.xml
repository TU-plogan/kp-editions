                    >Wolsey,</hi> though in an English letter he writes himself <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Voluzene),</hi> a Scottish humanist of the first half of the 16th century,
                    whose elegant Latinity, but still more the thoughtful beauty of his Christian
                    philosophy, claims for him a high place among the scholars of his age. That he
                    was born near Elgin, and studied philosophy at Aberdeen, as is stated in the
                    notice of his life published in 1619 by Thomas Wilson in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adamsoni Poemata Sacra,</hi> may be only an inference (though probably a just
                    one) from a passage in the dialogue <hi rend="italic">De Tranquillilate
                    Animi,</hi> more than half of which consists of a description of the abode of
                    tranquillity, based on a dream that, as we are told, came to the author, when he
                    had been a student of philosophy for four years, after a conversation on the
                    pleasant banks of the Lossie with John Ogilvy, afterwards rector of Cruden.
                    Proceeding to Paris, he became tutor to a nephew (or really a bastard son) of
                    Cardinal Wolsey, and this connexion led to repeated visits to England, where he
                    was well seen by the king, and formed, with men like John Fisher, Stephen
                    Gardiner, and Thomas Cromwell, connexions that were not dissolved by Wolsey’s
                    fall, for he was in England as late as 1534. In Paris he knew George Buchanan,
                    who afterwards wrote a graceful epitaph on his friend’s death, and found patrons
                    in the cardinals Jean de Lorraine (to whom he dedicated in 1531 a Latin
                    exposition of Psalm XV.) and Jean du Bellay. With the latter he started in 1534
                    for Italy, but, being detained by sore sickness at Avignon, found a new patron
                    in the bishop of the diocese, the learned and pious Sadolet, who procured for
                    him the mastership of the school at Carpentras, with a salary of seventy crowns.
                    Volusenus felt himself a little out of place in a grammar school, all his tastes
                    leaning to philosophy, and it would seem that from Carpentras he made repeated
                    visits to Lyons (where Gesner saw him, still a young man, in 1540), probably
                    also to Italy, where he made many friends, perhaps even to Spain, for Alciat
                    tells us that he had acquired French, Italian, and Spanish “par frequentation
                    des nations.” A letter of Sadolet from Rome in 1546 shows that he had then
                    resolved to return to Scotland, and was concerned to know what course he should
                    hold in the religious dissensions of the time. He died on the journey, however,
                    at Vienne in Dauphiné.</p>
                <p>The authorities for the life of Wilson are well brought together by Irving in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lives of Scottish Writers</hi> (1839); with the exception of
                    two letters in the <hi rend="italic">Bannatyne Miscellany,</hi> vol. i., the
                    most important of them had already been collected in Wishart’s edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">De Tranquillitate</hi> (8vo, Edin., 1751). Irving, however,
                    overlooked Wilson’s earliest works, <hi rend="italic">Fl. Vol. ad illustr. Dom.
                    Card. Lotharingorum Ρs. xv. Enarratio</hi> (4to, Paris, 1531) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fl. Vol. Britanni in Psalmum nobis 50 Hebraeis vero 51 ad. ..
                    Stephanum Winto-niensem Episcopum Enar.</hi> (4to, Paris, 1532). These show that
                    his linguistic studies embraced Hebrew as well Greek and Latin. Wilson’s
                    reputation, however, rests on the beautiful dialogue already cited, and first
                    printed by Gryphius at Lyons in 1543. From internal evidence it appears to have
                    been composed about that time, but the subject had exercised the writer for many
                    years. The dialogue shows us Christian humanism at its best, not yet breaking
                    with the church and somewhat afraid of authority, but open to new light,
                    tolerant and yet believing. Volusenus is a great admirer of Erasmus, but
                    censures in him a lack of purity in his Latin and a certain want of philosophy.
                    Latinity and philosophical training are his own distinguishing points, but his
                    philosophy is Christian and Biblical rather than classical or scholastic. To
                    analyse his argument would here be out of place; the title of the dialogue
                    itself shows that he takes a fresh and independent view of the chief good of
                    Christian ethics, and it is sufficient to observe that from this point of view
                    he ultimately reaches a doctrine as to the witness of the Spirit and the
                    assurance of grace which breaks with the traditional Christianity of his time
                    and contains ethical motives akin to, though not identical with, those of the
                    German Reformation. The verses which occur in several parts of the dialogue, and
                    the poem which concludes it, give Wilson a place among Scottish poets, but not
                    nearly so high as that which he occupies among philosophical writers on
                    Christianity.</p>
