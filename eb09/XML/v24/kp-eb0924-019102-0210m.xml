                    79 in succession to Vitellius. He was born in the year 9, in the Sabine country
                    near Reate. His father was a taxcollector and money-lender on a small scale; his
                    mother, however, was a lady of pretty good family, with a brother a senator. She
                    encouraged her son to look up in the world. After having served with the army in
                    Thrace and been a quaestor in Crete and Cyrene, Vespasian rose to be aedile and
                    praetor, having meanwhile taken to wife the daughter of a Roman knight, Flavia
                    Domitilla, by whom he had two sons, Titus and Domitian, both of whom succeeded
                    him. Having already served in Germany, in the years 43 and 44, in the reign of
                    Claudius, he had the command of a legion in Britain under Aulus Plautius, and
                    saw much hard fighting, reducing to subjection the Isle of Wight and penetrating
                    very possibly into Devonshire and the neighbourhood of Exeter. He proved himself
                    a thoroughly able soldier, while in his habits he was simple and frugal; in
                    short, says Tacitus (<hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> ii. 5), “but for his avarice
                    he was equal to the generals of old days.” In 51 he was for a brief space
                    consul; soon afterwards he went as governor to Africa, where, according to
                    Tacitus (ii. 97), his rule was “infamous and odious,” according to Suetonius <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vesp.,</hi> 4), “upright and highly honourable,” though he admits
                    that there was a serious local disturbance in which the governor was pelted with
                    turnips. On leaving Africa there was a story (Suet., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vesp.,</hi> 4) that he got his livelihood as a dealer of some sort,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ad
                    mangonicos quaestus descenderat.</hi></p></note> which, if true, shows that he
                    did not turn his provincial governorship to profit. He went with Nero’s suite to
                    Greece, and in 67 was appointed to conduct the war in Judaea, which was
                    threatening general commotion throughout the East, owing to a widely spread
                    notion in those parts that from Judaea were to come the future rulers of the
                    world. Vespasian, who had a strong vein of superstition, was made to believe
                    that he was himself to fulfil this expectation, and all manner of omens and
                    oracles and portents were applied to him. He also found encouragement in
                    Mucianus, the governor of Syria; and he had a soldiery thoroughly devoted to
                    him, although he was at the same time a strict disciplinarian and reformer of
                    abuses. Vespasian had, however, plenty of practical good sense, and he knew well
                    how to strike down a foe. All eyes in the East were now upon him; Mucianus and
                    the Syrian legions were eager to back him up; and on 1st July 69, while he was
                    at Caesarea, he was proclaimed emperor, first by the army in Egypt, and then by
                    his troops in Judaea. The legions of the East at once swore to him the customary
                    oath of allegiance. Nevertheless Vitellius had on his side the veteran legions
                    of Gaul and Germany, Rome’s best troops. But the feeling in Vespasian’s favour
                    quickly gathered strength, and the armies of Moesia, Pannonia, and Illyricum
                    soon declared for him, and made him in fact master of half of the Roman world.
                    They entered Italy on the north-east under the leadership of Antonius Primus,
                    defeated the army of Vitellius at Bedriacum, sacked Cremona, and advanced on
                    Rome, which they entered after furious fighting and a frightful confusion, in
                    which the Capitol was destroyed by fire. The new emperor received the tidings of
                    his rival’s defeat and death at Alexandria, whence he at once forwarded supplies
                    of corn to Rome, which were urgently needed, along with an edict or a
                    declaration of policy, in which he gave assurance of an entire reversal of the
                    laws of Nero, especially those relating to treason. While in Egypt he became
                    more and more imbued with superstition, consulting astrologers and allowing
                    himself to be flattered into a belief that he possessed a divine power which
                    could work miracles. Leaving the war in Judaea to his son Titus, he arrived at
                    Rome in 70, where he restored the Capitol, rebuilt a great part of the city,
                    enforced discipline in the army, which under Vitellius had become utterly
                    demoralized, and with the co-operation of the senate put the government and the
                    finances on a sound footing. By his own example of simplicity of life, he put to
                    shame the luxury and extravagance of the Roman nobles and initiated in many
                    respects a marked improvement in the general tone of society. As censor he
                    raised <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0211-0192"/> the character of the senate, removing unfit and
                    unworthy members, and promoting good and able men, among them the excellent
                    Julius Agricola. In 70 a formidable rising in Gaul, headed by Claudius Civilis,
                    was suppressed; the Jewish War was brought to a close by Titus’s capture of
                    Jerusalem, and in the following year, after the joint triumph of Vespasian and
                    Titus, memorable as the first occasion on which a father and his son were thus
                    associated together, the temple of Janus was closed, and the Roman world had
                    rest for the remaining nine years of Vespasian’s reign. The peace of Vespasian
                    passed into a proverbial phrase. In 78 Agricola went to Britain, and both
                    extended and consolidated the Roman dominion in that province, pushing his arms
                    into North Wales and the Isle of Anglesey. In the following year Vespasian died,
                    in his 70th year.</p>
                <p>The avarice with which both Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Hist.</hi>, ii. 5) and
                    Suetonius (<hi rend="italic">Vesp.,</hi> 16) stigmatize Vespasian seems really
                    to have been an enlightened economy, which, in the disordered state of the Roman
                    finances, was an absolute necessity. Vespasian could be liberal to impoverished
                    senators and knights, to cities and towns desolated by natural calamity, and
                    especially to men of letters and of the professor class, several of whom he
                    pensioned with salaries of as much as £800 a year. Quintilian is said to have
                    been the first public teacher who enjoyed this imperial favour. Vespasian may be
                    fairly credited with doing his best to improve and elevate the tone of the age
                    by spreading those intellectual tastes with which personally he was not much in
                    sympathy. Pliny’s great work, the <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> was
                    written during Vespasian’s reign, and dedicated to his son Titus, who almost
                    shared the emperor’s throne (see TITUS). Some of the philosophers, pedants in
                    reality, who talked idly of the good old times of the republic, and thus
                    indirectly encouraged conspiracy, provoked him into reviving the obsolete penal
                    laws against this class, but only one, Helvidius Priscus, was put to death, and
                    he had affronted the emperor by studied insults. “I will not kill a dog that
                    barks at me” were words honestly expressing the temper of Vespasian. Much was
                    spent on public works and the restoring and beautifying of Rome during his
                    reign,—a new forum, the splendid temple of Peace (symbolizing the sentiment of
                    the age), the public baths, and the vast Colosseum being begun under
                    Vaspasian.</p>
                <p>To the last Vespasian was a plain, blunt soldier, with decided strength of
                    character and ability, and with a steady purpose to establish good order and
                    secure the prosperity and welfare of his subjects. In his habits he was punctual
                    and regular, transacting his business early in the morning, and enjoying his
                    siesta after a drive. He had not quite the distinguished bearing looked for in
                    an emperor. He was free in his conversation, and his humour, of which he had a
                    good deal, was apt to take the form of rather coarse jokes. He could jest, it
                    was said, even in his last moments. “Methinks I am becoming a god,” he whispered
                    to those around him. There is something very characteristic in the exclamation
                    he is said to have uttered in his last illness, “An emperor ought to die
                    standing.”</p>
