                <p><label type="entry">VESPUCCI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Amerigo</hi></label>
                    (1451-1512), navigator, was born at Florence on 9th March 1451. His father,
                    Nastugio Vespucci, was a notary, and his uncle, to whom he owed his education,
                    was a scholarly Dominican and a friend of Savonarola. As a student Amerigo
                    showed a preference for natural philosophy, astronomy, and geography. He was
                    placed as a clerk in the great commercial house of the Medici, then the ruling
                    family in Florence. About 1490 he was sent by Lorenzo de’ Medici to Spain, and
                    in January 1492 he was at Cadiz, along with an associate, Donato Nicolini,
                    probably as an agent of the Medici. Shortly after this he seems to have entered
                    the service of a Florentine merchant, Juonato Berardi, established at Seville,
                    who had fitted out the second expedition of Columbus in 1493. Berardi had also
                    undertaken to fit out twelve ships for the king of Spain, and on his death in
                    December 1495 Vespucci was commissioned to complete the contract. There is no
                    proof that Vespucci accompanied Columbus on either his first or his second
                    voyage, though there can be no doubt that the two Italians were known to each
                    other. As Ferdinand had recalled the monopoly conceded to Columbus, the new
                    passion for exploring became widespread and adventurers of all kinds were
                    constantly leaving Spain for the West. On the authority of Vespucci himself, he
                    sailed, possibly as astronomer, with one of these adventurous expeditions from
                    Cadiz, on 10th May 1497. After touching at the Canaries, the four vessels are
                    stated to have reached after twenty-seven* days “a coast which we thought to be
                    that of a continent”; from Vespucci’s account this may have been Campeachy Bay.
                    Thence they doubled Cape Sable and may even have reached Cape Hatteras. Finally,
                    after sailing about a hundred leagues to an archipelago, the chief island of
                    which was called Iti, they made for Spain and reached Cadiz on 15th October
                    1498. Still following Vespucci’s own statement, he on 16th May 1499 started on a
                    second voyage in a fleet of three ships under Alonzo de Ojeda. They reached the
                    coast of Brazil about Cape St Roque, sailed north to the mouth of the Amazons,
                    round to the Gulf of Maracaibo, and on to San Domingo. The expedition returned
                    to Cadiz on 8th September 1500. Entering the service of Dorn Manuel of Portugal,
                    Vespucci took part in a new expedition to the “Land of Parrots” (Brazil), which
                    left Lisbon on 10th May 1501. Cape St Roque was reached on 16th August; Rio
                    Janeiro Bay was discovered and named on New Year’s Day 1502; and in April the
                    expedition appears to have got as far as South Georgia. It reached Lisbon again
                    on 7th September 1502. Next year, on 10th June, Vespucci started from Lisbon on
                    his fourth expedition, with six ships under Coelho, the object being to reach
                    Malacca by sailing west. At the island of Fernando Noronha Vespucci’s ship
                    separated from the others and sailed to Bahia and then to Cape Frio, where he
                    built a fort. He returned to Lisbon on 18th June 1504. In 1505 he went back to
                    Spain and re-entered the service of Ferdinand, settling in Seville. According to
                    one account, Vespucci made two other voyages to the isthmus of Panama. In 1508
                    he was appointed <hi rend="italic">piloto mayor.</hi> He died at Seville on 22d
                    February 1512.</p>
                <p>If his own account is trustworthy, Vespucci reached the mainland of America
                    eighteen days before Cabot. Yet he was attached to the expedition only in a
                    subordinate capacity, and, had it not been that his name has become attached to
                    the New World, it is probable he would scarcely have been heard of. It seems to
                    be credible, however, that in a letter written soon after his return from his
                    third voyage he referred to the newly discovered lands as the “New World.”
                    Vespucci’s claim to have touched the American mainland before Cabot has been
                    hotly disputed, and the controversial literature on the subject is voluminous.
                    The facts, as accepted by those who admit his claims, or at least his good
                    faith, are these. After his fourth voyage, that is after 1504, he wrote a diary
                    called <hi rend="italic">Le Quαttre Giornale.</hi> No fragment of the original
                    exists, and it is only known by allusion. He also wrote several letters to his
                    former schoolfellow Soderini, the gonfalier or chief magistrate of Florence. One
                    of these only remains, and that not in the original, but in a Latin translation
                    printed at the monastery of St Die in the Vosges on 25th April 1507. The
                    statement is that a French translation of Vespucci’s original had been given to
                    King René, who was patronizing the college at St Dié. Waldseemüller
                    (Hylacomylus) made use of this letter in his <hi rend="italic">Cosmographiae
                    Introductio,</hi> published at St Dié in 1507. Here it is that we have the first
                    suggestion of a name for the New World in the words—“A fourth part of the world,
                    which, since Amerigo found it, we may call Amerigé or America”; and again, “now
                    a fourth part has been found by Amerigo Vespucci, and I do not see why we should
                    be prevented from calling it <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0212-0193"/><hi rend="italic">Amerigé</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">America.”</hi> Since Humboldt discussed the subject in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Examen Critique de l'Histoire de la Géographie du Nouveau
                    Continent,</hi> vol. iv. (1837), the general weight of opinion has been that
                    Vespucci did not make the 1497 voyage, and that he had no share in the first
                    discovery of the American continent, but that there is not sufficient evidence
                    to convict him of deliberate falsification. Varnhagen, however, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Amerigo Vespucci</hi> (Lima, 1845) and many other writers on the
                    subject maintain Vespucci’s right to be regarded as a member of the
                    expedition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The whole question is very thoroughly discussed in vol. ii. of
