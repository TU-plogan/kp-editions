                    late and worthless compilation, and the only trustworthy information concerning
                    his career is drawn from a few passing allusions in the book itself. The family
                    of Valerius was poor and undistinguished; for the great Valerii Maximi who are
                    conspicuous in the annals of the early Roman republic cannot be traced lower
                    than the Punic Wars. Valerius himself professes to have owed everything to
                    Sextus Pompeius, who was descended from a paternal uncle of the great Pompey.
                    This Pompeius was a kind of minor Maecenas, and the centre of a literary circle
                    to which Ovid belonged; he was also the intimate of the most literary prince of
                    the imperial family, Germanicus. He took Valerius with him when he went to Asia
                    as proconsul. Although Valerius does not state that his profession was that of a
                    teacher of rhetoric, the fact is betrayed by every page of his writings. In his
                    prooemium he plainly intimates that he is putting forth a kind of commonplace
                    book of historical anecdotes for use in the schools of rhetoric, where the
                    pupils were severely trained in the art of embellishing speeches by references
                    to history. The title for the work in the MSS. is “Books of Memorable Deeds and
                    Utterances.” No ancient reader would have expected accuracy in such a book, and
                    the indignation expressed by many modern scholars at its glaring historical
                    errors has been much misplaced. The stories are very loosely and irregularly
                    arranged in nine books, each book being divided into sections, and each section
                    bearing as its title the topic, most commonly some virtue or vice, or some merit
                    or demerit, which the stories in the section are intended to illustrate. Most of
                    the tales are from Roman history, but each section has an appendix consisting of
                    extracts from the annals of other peoples, principally the Greeks. The
                    exposition exhibits strongly the two currents of feeling which are intermingled
                    by almost every Roman writer of the empire,—the feeling that the Romans of the
                    writer’s own day are degenerate creatures when confronted with their own
                    republican predecessors, and the feeling that, however degenerate, the
                    latter-day Romans still tower above the other peoples of the world, and in
                    particular may take much comfort to themselves from their moral superiority to
                    the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The range of authorities from whom the collection is drawn is undoubtedly narrow.
                    It has even been maintained that Valerius used four authors only,—Cicero, Livy,
                    Sallust, and Pompeius Trogus; there are, however, clear traces of others, as of
                    Varro, Asinius Pollio, and Herodotus. By far the largest part of the material
                    comes from Cicero and Livy, though each is only mentioned once by name. Valerius
                    was neither a well-read nor an able man. His treatment of his material was
                    careless and unintelligent in the extreme; but for all that he did not miss his
                    aim. Even though in one tale Tanaquil be made the wife of Ancus Martius, and in
                    another Aeschylus be mistaken for Pericles, though the Scipios and the Catos be
                    mingled in confusion, though conflicting versions of the same occurrence be
                    given, and the most startling anachronisms presented, yet the excerpts are none
                    the less apt illustrations, from the rhetorician’s point of view, of the
                    circumstance or quality they were meant to illustrate. Scholars have long since
                    ceased to corrupt the text of Valerius, as Pighius did, to save his character
                    for historical accuracy, nor do they now, with Perizonius, distort his meaning
                    for the pleasure of adding to the list of his sins. What, then, are his claims
                    to the attention of modern students? In the first place, the existing literary
                    remains of the time in which he wrote are extremely scanty, and mere scarcity
                    confers value on many articles which are in themselves poor. And even on the
                    historical side we owe something to Valerius. He often used sources now lost to
                    us, and where he touches on his own time he affords us some glimpses of the much
                    debated and very imperfectly recorded reign of Tiberius. His attitude towards
                    the imperial household has often been misunderstood, and he has been represented
                    as a mean flatterer of the same type with Martial. But, if the references to the
                    imperial administration be carefully scanned, they will be seen to be
                    extravagant neither in kind nor in number. Few will now grudge to Tiberius, when
                    his whole action as a ruler is taken into account, such a title as “salutaris
                    princeps,” which seemed to a former generation a specimen of shameless
                    adulation. The few allusions to Caesar’s murderers and to Augustus hardly pass
                    beyond the conventional style of the writer’s day. The only passage which can
                    fairly be called fulsome is a rhetorical paean over the death of Sejanus. But it
                    is as a chapter in the history of the Latin language that the work of Valerius
                    chiefly deserves study. Without it our view of the transition of classical into
                    silver Latin would be much more imperfect than it is. Erasmus declared that
                    Valerius is no more like <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n55/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0055-0042"/> Cicero than a mule is like a man, which is only
                    another way of saying that he had in excess the faults of his age. The entire
                    life, thought, and literature of the first century and a half of the empire were
                    steeped in the influences of rhetoric, enthroned in the seat of education. In
                    Valerius are presented to us, in a rude and palpable form, all the rhetorical
                    tendencies of the age, unsobered by the sanity of Quintilian and unrefined by
                    the taste and subtlety of Tacitus. Here we have the loathing for direct and
                    simple statement and the pursuit of novelty at any price. Every device which can
                    put a gloss of newness on the language is eagerly adopted. The barrier between
                    the diction of poetry and that of prose is broken down; the uses of words are
                    strained; monstrous metaphors are invented; there are startling contrasts, dark
                    innuendoes, and highly coloured epithets; the most unnatural variations are
                    played upon the artificial scale of grammatical and rhetorical figures of
                    speech. It is a most instructive lesson in the history of Latin to set side by
                    side and compare minutely with each other a passage of Valerius and its
                    counterpart in Cicero or Livy.</p>
                <p>In the MSS. of Valerius a tenth book is given, which consists of the so-called
                    “liber de praenominibus,” the work of some grammarian of a much later date. The
                    collection of Valerius was much used for school purposes, and its popularity in
                    the Middle Ages is attested by the large number of MSS. in which it has been
                    preserved. Like other school books it was epitomated. One complete epitome,
                    probably of the 4th or 5th century, bearing the name of Julius Paris, has come
                    down to us; also a portion of another by Januarius Nepo-tianus. The best edition
                    of Valerius with explanatory matter is that by C. Kempf (Berlin, 1854); the best
                    text is that by C. Halm (Leipsic, 1865).</p>
