                    of inhabitants, the products of combustion of illuminating agents, and other
                    causes. In estimating the amount of air to be supplied, account must be taken of
                    the standard of purity which is aimed at and of the rate at which vitiation
                    occurs.</p>
                <p>Of the various impurities that are found in the air of inhabited rooms carbonic
                    acid forms the most ready index of the ventilation. The open air of London and
                    other large inland towns contains about four parts by volume of this gas in
                    10,000 of air. In the country and in towns near the sea two or three and a half
                    parts in 10,000 is a more usual proportion. Authorities on ventilation usually
                    take four parts in 10,000 as the standard for pure air, and use the excess over
                    that quantity in estimating the adequacy of the air supply. But they differ as
                    to the proportion <pb break="no"

                    in good ventilation. It is generally admitted that the air in which people dwell
                    and sleep should not under any circumstances be allowed to contain more than ten
                    parts in 10,000. This has been accepted as the permissible proportion by
                    Carnelley, Haldane, and Anderson, after an extensive examination of the air of
                    middle and lower class dwellings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    eight volumes of carbonic acid in 10,000 of air,<note anchored="true"

                    as the maximum permissible in good ventilation. Parkes, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manual of Hygiene,</hi> quotes observations which point to an equally exacting
                    standard as desirable.</p>
                <p>The rate at which an adult respires carbonic acid varies widely with his
                    condition of repose, being least in sleep, greater in waking rest, and very much
                    greater in violent exercise. As a basis on which to calculate the air necessary
                    for proper ventilation we may take the production of carbonic acid by an adult
                    as 0∙6 cubic feet per hour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This estimate is based on the observations of Pettenkofer, Angus Smith, and
                    Parkes.</p></note> Hence he will produce per hour, in 6000 cubic feet of air, a
                    pollution amounting to one part of carbonic acid in 10,000 of air. If the excess
                    of carbonic acid were to be kept down to this figure (1 in 10,000), it would be
                    necessary to supply 6000 cubic feet of fresh air per hour; if the permissible
                    excess be two parts in 10,000, half this supply of fresh air will suffice; and
                    so on. We therefore have the following relation between (1) the quantity of air
                    supplied per person per hour, (2) the excess of carbonic acid which results, and
                    (3) the total quantity of carbonic acid present, on the assumption that the
                    fresh air that is admitted contains four parts by volume in 10,000 :—</p>

                <p>Thus, to preserve the lowest standard of purity tolerated by sanitarians,
                    ventilation must go on at the rate per person of 1000 cubic feet per hour, and
                    3000 cubic feet per hour are required to preserve the higher standard on which
                    some authorities insist. Parkes advises a supply of 2000 cubic feet of air per
                    hour for persons in health and 3000 or 4000 cubic feet for sick persons. The

                <p>Gas lights add to the vitiation of the air of rooms at a rate which may be
                    roughly estimated by treating one cubic foot of gas burnt per hour as nearly
                    equivalent to one adult person, so far as the production of carbonic acid is
                    concerned. Thus an ordinary burner, giving a light of about twenty candles and
                    burning four cubic feet of gas per hour, uses the air of three or four men.</p>
                <p>The purity of the air of a room depends, of course, to some extent, on the
                    proportion of its cubic capacity to the number of inmates. The influence of
                    capacity is, however, often overrated. Even when the allowance of space is very
                    liberal, if no fresh air be supplied, the atmosphere of a room quickly falls
                    below the standard of purity specified above; on the other hand, the space per
                    inmate may be almost indefinitely reduced if sufficient means are provided for
                    systematic ventilation. Large rooms are good, chiefly because of their action as
                    reservoirs of air in those cases (too common in practice) where no sufficient
                    provision is made for continuous ventilation, and where the air is changed
                    mainly by intermittent ventilation, such as occurs when doors or windows are
                    opened. It must be borne in mind, too, that no room is hermetically sealed. In
                    the absence of proper inlets and outlets casual ventilation goes on through
                    every chink and cranny, and even by diffusion through the plaster of the walls.
                    The ventilation given in this way is generally most inadequate; but a large room
                    has at least the advantage over a small one that it offers more chances for the
                    casual entrance of fresh air, as well as a larger wall-surface through which
                    diffusion may occur. It has also the advantage that a greater volume of air may
                    more easily be passed through it than through a small room in a given time,
                    without causing disagreeable draughts. A general idea of the cubic capacity per
                    inmate, allowed by law or by custom in certain cases, is given in the table

                <p>To realize the need of provision for ventilation, it is only necessary to compare
                    these figures with those already given for the rate of consumption of air.
                    Taking the lowest permissible degree of purity (10 parts of carbonic acid in
                    10,000), we see that, if no fresh air were allowed to enter, the dweller in a
                    middle-class house would make the atmosphere of his room unfit for breathing
                    after occupying it for 1 hour, and that the sleeping rooms of the poor would
                    fall below the standard in 13 minutes.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere of rooms is changed partly by diffusion, but chiefly by actual
                    currents of air. The experiments of Pettenkofer have shown that air passes to a
                    very sensible extent through the substance of brick walls. In houses built of
                    stone the movement of air through the walls must be insignificant; but, as
                    regards individual rooms, what is chiefly important in this connexion is the
                    percolation through dry plaster, causing an exchange of atmosphere to occur
                    between the inside of the room and the space within the lining of the wall,
                    which is generally in communication with other parts of the building and with
                    the external air. In order that the atmosphere of a room should be changed by
                    means of air currents, three things are necessary,—(1) an inlet or inlets for
                    the air, (2) an outlet or outlets, and (3) a motive force to produce and
                    maintain the current. One might think it needless to <pb break="no"

                    that, in providing appliances which are intended to act as ventilators, one or
                    other of the three essentials is not unfrequently overlooked. In systems which
                    are distinguished by the general name of <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">artificial</hi> ventilation special provision is made for
                    driving the air, by fans, or by furnaces, or by other contrivances to be
                    described more fully below. In what is called <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>
                    ventilation no special appliance is used to give motive force, but the forces
                    are made use of which are supplied by (1) the wind, (2) the elevated temperature
                    of the room’s atmosphere, and (3) the draught of fires used for heating. A
                    careful distinction should be drawn between cases in which these motive forces
                    are skilfully taken advantage of, by the use of proper inlets and outlets, to
                    give the best result attainable without special appliances for driving the air,
                    and other cases, unfortunately too common in practice, where the ventilation is
                    left to take care of itself. In a fair comparison of a mechanical with the
                    natural system we should exclude examples in which the ventilation is haphazard,
                    or in which as near an approach to no ventilation is reached as the conditions
                    of modern architecture will permit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Domestic Ventilation.—</hi> The chief agent in domestic
                    ventilation is the chimney; when a bright fire is burning in an open grate, it
                    rarely happens that any other outlet for foul air from a room need be provided.
                    The column of hot air and burnt gases in the chimney is less heavy, because of
                    its high temperature, than an equal column of air outside; the pressure at the
                    base is therefore less than the pressure at the same level outside. This
                    supplies a motive force compelling air to enter at the bottom through the grate
                    and through the opening over the grate, and causing a current to ascend. The
                    motive force which the chimney supplies has not only to do work on the column of
                    air within the chimney, in setting it in motion and in overcoming frictional
                    resistance to its flow: it has also to set the air entering the room in motion
                    and to overcome frictional resistance at the inlets. In many cases the latter
                    part of the chimney’s work is the more considerable of the two. From want of
                    proper inlets air has to be dragged in at a high velocity and against much
                    resistance, under the doors, between the window sashes, and through a hundred
                    other chinks and crevices for which we have to thank imperfeet carpentry and
                    half-seasoned timber. Under these conditions the air enters in small streams or
                    narrow sheets, ill-distributed and moving so fast as to form disagreeable
                    draughts, the pressure in the room is kept so low that an opened door or window
                    lets in a deluge of cold air, and the current up the chimney is much reduced. If
                    the attempt is made to stop draughts by applying sand-bags and listing to the
                    crevices at which air streams in, matters only become worse in other respects;
                    the true remedy of course lies in providing proper inlets.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The absence of proper inlets for air in a
                    house where several fires are burning involves a danger that is much more
                    serious than other effects of bad ventilation. When the air which is required to
                    take the place of that discharged by the chimneys can only struggle in through
                    small openings, the pressure within the house falls considerably below that of
                    the outer air, the water traps under basins and closets are liable to be forced,
                    and foul air is drawn in from every leak in soil-pipe or drain. The writer has
                    found a house drawing what seemed to be its main supply of “fresh” air from the
                    public sewer, through a defective joint between the soil-pipe and the
                    (untrapped) house-drain.</p></note> The discharge of air by an ordinary open
                    fire and chimney varies widely, depending on the rate of combustion, the height
                    and section and form of the chimney, and the freedom with which air is entering
                    the room. About 10,000 cubic feet per hour is probably a fair average, about
                    enough to keep the air fresh for half-a-dozen persons.<note anchored="true"

                    Commissioners, 1861.</p></note> Even when no fire is burning the chimney plays
                    an important part in ventilation: the air within an inhabited room being
                    generally warmer than the air outside, it is only necessary that an up-current
                    should be started in order that the chimney should maintain it, and it will
                    usually be found that a current is, in fact, passing up.<note anchored="true"

                <p>When a room is occupied for any considerable length of time by more than about
                    half-a-dozen persons, the chimney outlet should be supplemented by others, which
                    usually take the form of gratings in the ceiling or cornices in communication
                    with flues leading to the open air. Frequently these openings are protected from
                    down-draught by light flap valves of oiled silk or sheet mica, opening outwards.
                    To increase the efficiency of the ventilating action of the chimney, Dr Arnott
                    advocated (in 1849) that an opening should be made near the ceiling, into the
                    chimney, guarded by a flap valve of this type, with the object of providing a
                    direct exit for the foul warm air that gathers in the upper region of a room,
                    especially when gas is burnt. To make Arnott’s valve of much service it should
                    be larger than the size usually supplied; even then it has the drawback that,
                    notwithstanding the protection given by the valve, enough back-flow may occur to
                    blacken the wall and ceiling with soot near the opening. If a valve near the
                    ceiling be provided, it is probably better in most cases to lead its outlet
                    shaft direct to the open air than to lead it into the chimney.</p>
                <p>With regard to inlets, a first care must be to avoid such currents of cold air as
                    will give the disagreeable and dangerous sensation of draught. At ordinary
                    temperatures a current of outer air to which the body is exposed will be felt as
                    a draught if its velocity exceeds 2, or at most 3, feet per second. The current
                    entering a room may, however, be allowed to move with a speed much greater than
                    this without causing discomfort, provided its direction keeps it from striking
                    directly on the persons of the inmates. To secure this, it should enter, not
                    horizontally nor through gratings on the floor, but vertically through openings
                    high enough to carry the entering stream into the upper atmosphere of the room,
                    where it will mix as completely as possible with warm air before its presence
                    can be felt. A favourite form of inlet is Sheringham’s (see fig. 1). When opened
                    it forms a wedge-shaped projection into the room, and admits air in an upward
                    stream through the open top. It is usually placed near the ceiling; but a lower
                    place in the wall would be better. Other inlets are made by using hollow
                    perforated blocks of earthenware, called air-bricks, built into the wall; these
                    are often shaped on the inner side like an inverted louvre-board or Venetian
                    blind, with slots that slope so as to give an upward inclination to the entering
                    stream.</p>
                <p>In another and most valuable form of ventilator, the introduction of which is due
                    to Mr Tobin of Leeds, the fresh air enters vertically upwards. The usual
                    arrangement of Tobin’s tube (shown in front elevation and section in fig. 2) is
                    a short vertical shaft of metal plate or wood which leads up the wall from the
                    floor level to a height of 5 or 6 feet. Its lower end communicates with the
                    outer air through an airbrick or built opening in the wall; from its upper end,
                    which is freely open, the current of fresh air rises in a smooth stream,
                    clinging, as it were, to the wall, and scarcely changing its direction until it
                    has passed far above the level of the opening. Various forms of section may be
                    given to the tube: if placed in a corner it will be triangular or segmental;
                    against a flat wall a shallow rectangular form is most usual; a lining of wood
                    forming a dado may even be made to serve as a Tobin tube by setting it out a
                    little way from the wall. The tube is often furnished with a regulating valve;
                    but this is a doubtful advantage, as it tempts the inmates to stop the
                    ventilation for no better reason than that the room is cold; in exceptional
                    circumstances, such as the presence of an invalid, the opening may be stopped or
                    reduced by laying a board over it. Contrivances are occasionally added for
                    cleansing the entering air. A muslin or canvas bag hung in the tube, or a screen
                    stretched diagonally across it, may be used to filter out dust; the same object
                    is served in some degree by forcing the air, as it enters the tube at the
                    bottom, to pass in close contact with the surface of water in a tray, by means
                    of a deflecting plate. These complications have a double drawback: they require
                    frequent attention to keep them in order and by putting resistance in the way of
                    the stream they are apt to reduce the efficiency of the ventilation.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When the air is not filtered,
                    and when it has been warmed before entering, the vertical direction of the
                    stream is readily traced by dust which is deposited on the wall in a nearly
                    upright column, spreading slightly fan-wise as it rises. With cold air the
                    deposit of dust is comparatively slight. The difference is due to the fact
                    noticed and explained by Mr John Aitken, that air quickly deposits any suspended
                    particles when it is brought into contact with a surface colder than itself, but
                    retains them in suspension if the surface be warmer than the air (<hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> vol. xxxiii., 1884, p. 239). Another
                    domestic illustration of the same fact is given by the greater dustiness of
                    walls and furniture in a stove-heated room than in a room heated by an open
                    fire.</p></note> The air entering by a Tobin tube may be warmed by a coil of hot
                    pipes within the tube or by a small gas-stove (provided of course with a flue to
                    discharge<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0177-0160"/> outside the products of combustion); or the tube
                    may draw its supply, not directly from the outer atmosphere, but from a hotair
                    flue or from a room or corridor where the air has been already warmed. The
                    opening should always be about the level of a man’s head, but the tube need not
                    extend down to the floor: all that is essential is that it should have
                    sufficient length to let the air issue in a smooth vertical current without
                    eddies (fig. 3).</p>
                <p>These inlets are at once so simple and effective that no hesitation need be felt
                    in introducing them freely in the rooms of dwelling-houses. When no special
                    provision is made for them in the walls, the advantage of a current entering
                    vertically may still be in some degree secured by help of certain makeshift
                    contrivances. One of these, suggested by Dr Hinkes Bird, is to open one sash of
                    the window a few inches and fill up the opening by a board; air then enters in a
                    zig-zag course through the space between the sashes. Another plan is to have a
                    permanent vertical slot between the sashes by making the top of the lower sash
                    stand out a little from the bottom of the upper one. Still another plan is to
                    have a light frame of wood or metal or glass made to fit in front of the lower
                    sash when the window is opened, forming virtually a Tobin’s tube in front of the
                    window (see fig. 4, where a portion of the frame is broken away to show the
                    position of the window sash). This last contrivance allows the fresh air as
                    ready access as may be wished; and, unlike the others, it is still effective
                    when the blind is drawn down. A Tobin’s tube, however, is better placed against
                    a dead wall than below a window, for the ascending current is liable to be
                    broken by the window recess and by the down-draught which a window causes by its
                    cooling action on the air of the room. The principle of giving entering currents
                    an upward direction is turned to useful account in a simple contrivance (see
                    fig. 5) for preventing the disagreeable cold draught which comes along the floor
                    of a room from the chink beneath the door. The clearance under the door is made
                    a little greater than usual, and a thin piece of wood is set on the inner side
                    as close as possible to the floor and at a distance of half an inch or so from
                    the surface of the door; the air then enters in a vertical stream.</p>
                <p>As an example of the systematic ventilation of dwelling-rooms on a large scale,
                    the following particulars may be quoted of arrangements that have been
                    successfully used in English barracks for more than twenty years. One or more
                    outlet-shafts of wood are carried from the highest part of the room, discharging
                    some feet above the roof under a louvre; the number and size of these shafts are
                    such as to give about 12 square inches of sectional area per head, and the
                    chimney gives about 6 square inches more per head. About half the air enters
                    cold through air-bricks or Sheringham valves at a height of about 9 feet from
                    the floor, and the other half is warmed by passing through flues behind the
                    grate. The inlets taken together give an area of about 11 square inches per
                    head. A fairly regular circulation of some 1200 cubic feet per head per hour is
                    found to take place, and the proportion of carbonic acid ranges from 7 to 10
                    parts in 10,000.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>De

                <p>In the natural ventilation of churches, halls, and other large rooms we often
                    find air admitted by gratings in the floor or near it, —an offensive plan, since
                    it fouls the air, besides causing objectionable draughts, unless the temperature
                    is very carefully regulated. The inlets should consist, like Tobin’s tubes, of
                    upright flues rising to a height of about 6 feet above the floor, from which the
                    air proceeds in vertical streams. If the air is to be warmed before it enters,
                    the supply may be drawn from a chamber warmed by hot-water or steam pipes or by
                    a stove, and the temperature of the room may be regulated by allowing part of
                    the air to come from a hot chamber and part from outside, the two currents
                    mixing in the shaft from which the inlets to the room draw their supply. If a
                    basement or story below the room to be ventilated is available, a good plan is
                    to carry the inlet tubes vertically down through it and warm the air in them, so
                    that the height of the warm column assists the flow. Outlets usually consist of
                    gratings or plain openings at or near the ceiling, preferably at a considerable
                    distance from points vertically above the inlet tubes. One of the chief
                    difficulties in natural ventilation is to guard them against down-draught
                    through the action of the wind. Numberless forms of cowl have been devised with
                    this object, and often with the further intention of turning the wind to useful
                    account by making it assist the up-current of foul air. Some of these exhaust
                    cowls are of the revolving class: a hood or trumpet-shaped mouth, opening
                    horizontally and supported about a vertical axis so as to be free to turn, is
                    kept facing away from the wind by means of a large vane. To make the wind help
                    the up-current, a horizontal conical tube is fixed within the cowl, pointing
                    towards the wind and discharging through the trumpet-mouth of the cowl, where it
                    exhausts by suction, on the principle of the jet-pump. Revolving cowls are
                    liable to fail by sticking, and, apart from that, when the wind blows in
                    shifting gusts they cannot respond quickly enough to its changes of direction to
                    prevent it from occasionally blowing down. Fixed cowls are to be preferred; they
                    are designed in many forms, of which Mr Buchan’s may be cited as a good

                    the vertical exhaust flue through which the foul air rises; near the top this
                    expands into a polygonal chamber, <hi rend="italic">bbbb,</hi> with vertical
                    sides, consisting partly of perforated sheet-metal plates; outside of these are
                    fixed vertical curved guide-plates, <hi rend="italic">c,c,c,c;</hi> the wind,
                    blowing between these and the polygonal chamber, sucks air from the centre
                    through the perforated sides. Perhaps no form of cowl is entirely free from
                    liability to down-draughts. The most complete safeguard is to place in the
                    exhaust flue a set of flap-valves opening only outwards.</p>
                <p>Fig. 7 shows the arrangement of exitvalves employed by Mr Buchan; the valves <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a, a</hi> are flaps of oiled silk working on a wooden grid <hi
                    rend="italic">bb,</hi> which is inclined enough to let them hang free of it when
                    no current is passing; beyond them is a door closing-valve c, worked by hand by
                    the cord <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; and the whole is enclosed in a box, with
                    glass sides <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> through which the action of the valves
                    may be seen. When the outlets are guarded by valves of this type they may
                    discharge through a plain box with louvred sides; an exhaust cowl, however, may
                    still be used with advantage to assist the ventilation under favourable
                    conditions of the wind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The two things that supply motive force in automatic ventilation—the difference
                    of temperature between inner and outer air and the wind—are so variable that
                    even the best arrangements of inlets and outlets give a somewhat uncertain
                    result. To secure a strictly uniform delivery of air, unaffected by changes of
                    season or of weather, the influence of these irregular motive forces must be as
                    far as possible minimized, and recourse must be had to an artificial method of
                    driving the air.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial or Mechanical Ventilation.—</hi> This finds
                    application on the largest scale in the ventilation of collieries, by methods
                    which are fully described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Coal</hi> (vol. vi. pp.
                    70-71) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mining</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 460). Motive force is
                    supplied to the up-cast shaft either by a furnace at the base, which heats the
                    rising column of air, or (in more modern practice) by a centrifugal fan, such as
                    Guibal's, exhausting air from the top. The long galleries and workings through
                    which the air has to be driven oppose so much resistance that the pressure
                    required to move a sufficient volume of air is immensely greater than is ever
                    necessary or desirable in the artificial ventilation of buildings.</p>
                <p>A broad distinction may be drawn between what are sometimes called vacuum and
                    plenum methods of artificial ventilation. In the former, as in colliery
                    ventilation, the motive force is applied at the outlets: air is drawn from the
                    rooms, and the pressure of their atmosphere is less than the pressure outside.
                    In the latter the motive force is applied at the inlets: air is pushed in, and
                    the pressure within the room is greater than outside. The plenum method has
                    distinct advantages: it makes the air escape instead of coming <pb break="no"

                    opening to the outer air; it avoids drawing foul and mouldy air from sewers and
                    basement; and with it, more easily than with the other, one may guard against
                    the disturbing influence of wind. In the plenum method the air is driven by
                    pumps or by fans; in the vacuum method pumps are rarely if ever used: suction is
                    produced by fans or by heating the column of air in a long vertical shaft
                    through which the discharge takes place. Water jets and steam jets have also
                    been employed to impel the air.</p>
                <p>Extraction by a hot-air shaft is a common mode of ventilating hospitals and other
                    public buildings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    Inst. Mech. Eng.,</hi> 1867, p. 61.</p></note> Heat is applied by a furnace or
                    stove at the bottom of the shaft, or by coils of hot-water or steam pipes, which
                    should not extend up the shaft farther than can be helped. In the lecture
                    theatre of the Paris art conservatory, ventilated by Morin, where this means of
                    extraction is employed, fresh air enters through the ceiling and foul air is
                    drawn off through the floor from under the Seats; this reversal of the natural
                    direction of the current is of course only possible when a sufficient external
                    motive force is applied. The House of Commons furnishes another example: there
                    the air, after being warmed and moistened, or cooled by water spray, as the
                    state of the atmosphere may require, is admitted through large gratings in the
                    floor, which are covered by porous matting to prevent draughts; outlets from the
                    top of the House lead by flues to the Victoria tower, where a furnace maintains
                    the current in an up-cast shaft.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    account as effective ventilating agents by letting the foul air escape through
                    shafts placed over them, which they heat at the base.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, for example, Morin’s account of the
                    ventilation of the Théâtre Lyrique, Paris.</p></note> What is known in America
                    as the Ruttan or Smead system of ventilation, successfully applied in many
                    schools there, employs a hot-air shaft to furnish motive power. In warm weather
                    a stove at the base of the shaft is used to heat the column; in cold weather the
                    exhaust air from the rooms is so much warmer than the atmosphere outside that
                    the up-cast shaft acts without additional heating. This is in fact an example in
                    which the classification of systems into natural and artificial breaks down. The
                    supply of fresh air is warmed as it enters by passing through chambers
                    containing tubular metal stoves; the outlets are at or near the floor level. A
                    curious feature in the arrangements is that the foul air, in passing to the
                    up-cast shaft, is drawn through the privies, where it desiccates all
                    discharges.</p>
                <p>Extraction by fans presents no features requiring special remark. A favourite fan
                    for the purpose is the Blackman propeller, the nearly flat form of which allows
                    it to be readily placed in walls and partitions. One of these fans, 4 feet in
                    diameter, when driven at a speed of about 330 revolutions per minute, is said to
                    discharge 15,000 cubic feet of air per minute with an expenditure of
                    one-horsepower. Though this is a good performance, it should be observed that
                    for ventilating purposes, where air has to be driven in large volume with low
                    velocity and under low pressure, fans, while they have the advantage of being
                    less bulky, are less efficient than pumps, for they require that the air in
                    passing through them should move much faster than in other parts of its course,
                    and much of the energy of this motion is wasted in eddies. When fans are used to
                    blow air into buildings, they should deliver into a chamber of considerable
                    size, that the air may become nearly still before it passes into the
                    distributing flues. Loss of power may be avoided to some extent by receiving the
                    air in a channel which gradually enlarges as it leaves the fan.</p>
                <p>The plenum method, with fans to drive the air, is exemplified on a large scale in
                    the ventilation of St George’s Hall, Liverpool,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech.
                    Eng.,</hi> 1863, p. 194.</p></note> where there are four large fans in the
                    basement, driven by a 10- horse-power steam-engine. The building is heated by
                    passing the air through chambers containing coils of hot-water and steam pipes;
                    after the air is warmed it is moistened by injecting steam, and provision is
                    made for washing it by water-spray before it reaches the fans.</p>
                <p>When fans are used, either with suction or with pressure, the amount of the
                    current is not strictly independent of those variable motive forces which are
                    the sole agents in natural ventilation; the case is analogous to that of an
                    electric circuit in which several sources of electromotive force are at work,
                    assisting or opposing one another. The fan may be the main agent in circulating
                    the air; but differences of temperature, and at times the action of the wind,
                    may make large variations in the resultant effect. The case is different when
                    pumps are used. A certain quantity of air is delivered at each stroke, and the
                    only effect of these irregular forces is to make the power required to drive the
                    pump sometimes greater and sometimes less. Provided there are no casual inlets
                    and outlets, the amount of air supplied is known with certainty: the ventila
                    tion under these conditions is sometimes described as <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive.</hi> Good recent examples of positive plenum ventilation are to be
                    found in Dundee University College and in a number of schools in Dundee and
                    Aberdeen, where the arrangements have been designed by Mr W. Cunningham. Some of
                    these are ordinary doubleacting reciprocating pumps, driven generally by water
                    engines. The pumps are rectangular wooden boxes, stiffened by iron ribs, and
                    provided at top and bottom with inlet valves, consisting of a number of short
                    waterproof cloth flaps working against a vertical wooden grid. The piston, which
                    is also of wood, has a vertical travel; it is held in place and worked by wire
                    ropes above and below, which lead over pulleys to the water motor; and the
                    piston is balanced by a counterweight on the descending branch of the upper
                    rope. À piston 5 feet square, with a stroke of 5 feet, works at 20 strokes per
                    minute and delivers 150,000 cubic feet per hour.</p>
                <p>In other instances, where the volume of air is greater than could easily be dealt
                    with by common pumps, Mr Cunningham uses revolving pumps of the Root’s blower
                    type (shown in transverse vertical section through the revolving “pistons” in
                    fig. 8). At the</p>
                <p>Dundee College a battery of five of these blowers, each discharg ing over 150,000
                    cubic feet of air per hour, is driven easily by a gas engine of two-horse-power.
                    The rooms are heated by having coils of Perkins’s high pressure hot - water
                    pipes in the main distributing flues. The inlets are flat upright tubes
                    extending up the side walls to a height of nearly 6 feet, and open at the top.
                    Ample proof of the advantage that results from giving a vertical direction to
                    the entering current is supplied by the success of Mr Cunningham’s arrangements,
                    where this form of inlet is exclusively adopted. Alternative outlets are
                    generally provided in the end walls, one group near the ceiling, another a few
                    feet from the foot. They are fitted with doors which allow one or other to be
                    closed; the high-level outlets are used in warm weather, when the fresh air that
                    comes in is comparatively cool; the low-level ones are used in cold weather,
                    when the fresh air, having been heated before it enters, would tend to rise and
                    pass out too directly if the outlets near the ceiling were open. The outlet
                    shafts communicate with a louvred tower or turrets on the roof. Each room
                    receives a volume of air equal to its cubic capacity in about 12 minutes, so
                    that the atmosphere is completely changed five times in an hour. The inlets are
                    proportioned to do this without allowing the velocity with which air enters to
                    exceed 6 feet per second.</p>
                <p>The " Aeolus” water-spray ventilator of Kind and Mestern is an example of a
                    mechanical ventilator using a jet of water to impel the air. A nozzle at the top
                    of a circular air-shaft delivers a conical sheet of water, which impinges on the
                    sides of the shaft a little way below and carries down with it a considerable
                    stream of air. This ventilator is used either to force air into rooms or to draw
                    it out; in the former case a small gas-stove is often added to heat the
                    supply.</p>
                <p>For the ventilation of greenhouses and hot-houses, see vol. xi. p. 231.</p>
                <p>The advantage of ample and systematic ventilation is not to be measured only by
                    the low proportion of carbonic acid it secures. Carbonic acid is not the only
                    test of vitiation; it is not even the most dangerous impurity. Another criterion
                    of the foulness of close air is the amount of oxidizable organic matter it
                    contains; still another,—and a most valuable one,—is the number of
                    micro-organisms, especially of bacteria. The micro-organisms may be determined
                    by Hesse’s method of slowly passing a given volume of the air to be examined
                    through a tube coated inside with beef jelly; the germs are deposited on the
                    nutrient jelly and each becomes in a few days the centre of a very visible
                    colony. In outside air the number of micro-organisms, as tested in this way,
                    varies greatly: it <pb break="no"

                    in well-ventilated rooms it ranges from 1 to 20; in close schoolrooms as many as
                    600 per litre have been found. The elaborate researches of Carnelley, Haldane,
                    and Anderson<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1887, vol. clxxviii. B, p. 61.</p></note> on
                    the air of dwellings and schools illustrate well the value of this test. One of
                    the uses to which they have put it has been to compare schools known to be well
                    ventilated (by mechanical means) with schools ventilated at haphazard or not
                    ventilated at all. A large number of trials were made in each case; in the
                    mechanically ventilated schoolrooms the average number of micro-organisms was 17
                    per litre, and in the others 152. Results of great interest were obtained by the
                    experiment of stopping the mechanical ventilators for a few hours or days.
                    Tested by the proportion of carbonic acid, the air of course became very bad;
                    tested by the number of micro-organisms, it remained comparatively pure, the
                    number being, in fact, scarcely greater than when ventilation was going on, and
                    far less than the average in “naturally ventilated” schools. This proves in a
                    striking way the advantage of systematic ventilation. The bad effect of a foul
                    stagnant atmosphere is cumulative. An habitually close room acts as a nursery of
                    micro-organisms, which a casual flushing with fresh air will not remove; an
                    habitually well-ventilated room is kept in great measure clear of these
                    dangerous inmates, and its atmosphere may be occasionally overtaxed without
                    causing the number of them to be seriously increased. (J. A. E.)</p>
