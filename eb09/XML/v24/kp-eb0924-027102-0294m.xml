                    miles, and a width at its entrance of 112 miles, is divided into two large
                    bays—Amur and Usuri—by the hilly peninsula of Muravioff-Amurskiy, continued in a
                    group of islands, of which the Kozakevitch or Russkiy (Johanga-tun) is the
                    largest. A narrow strait, which has received the high-sounding name of the
                    Eastern Bosphorus, separates this from the peninsula, and Vladivostok occupies
                    the northern shore of one of its horn-like expansions, which the Russians have
                    called the Golden Horn <hi rend="italic">(Zolotoi Rog).</hi> The depth of the
                    Eastern Bosphorus ranges from 13 to 20 fathoms, and that of the Golden Horn from
                    5 to 13, the latter thus affording a spacious harbour, —one of the finest,
                    indeed, in the world. The hills are covered with forests of oak, lime, birch,
                    maple, cork, walnut, acacia, ash, aspen, poplar, elm, apple, pear, and wild
                    cherry, with a rich undergrowth of the most varied shrubs. Excellent timber is
                    supplied by oak and cedar forests not far off. The climate, however, is severe,
                    if compared with that of corresponding latitudes in Europe. Though standing in
                    almost the same parallel as Marseilles, Vladivostok has an average annual
                    temperature of only <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0295-0272"/> 38°∙5 F., and, although the gulf itself never
                    freezes, a thin ice-crust forms along the shores in December, keeping ships
                    ice-bound for from thirty to forty-five days.</p>
                <p>The settlement of Vladivostok, though founded only in 18G1, had in 1886 12,500
                    inhabitants, chiefly military; and for hundreds of miles inland the sole
                    population consists of the small military posts by which communication is
                    maintained up the Suifun to Lake Khangka and the Cossack settlements on the
                    Usuri. Vladivostok is connected with headquarters by telegraph.</p>
                <p>Since the transference of the navy workshops from Nikolaievsk the place has
                    gained in importance. It has a pro-gymnasium for boys (60 pupils), a club, and a
                    newspaper. The imports of both Russian and foreign goods during the last five
                    years have reached an average of from 2½ to 8 millions of roubles; but the
                    exports are insignificant. Some 3000 or 4000 Coreans find employment in the Gulf
                    of Peter the Great in gathering the edible seaweed <hi rend="italic">Laminaria
                    saccharina,</hi> of which about 70,000 cwts. (£45,000) are sent to China
                    annually. The discovery of gold in the neighbouring alluvial deposits brought
                    together some hundreds of Chinese, but the Russian Government compelled them to
                    withdraw. The amount of gold is, however, not believed to be remunerative.</p>
                <p>The Gulf of Peter the Great was discovered in 1852 by the French corvette
                    “Capricieuse,” and named the Golfe d’Anville. Two years later Count Putyatin, on
                    board the frigate “Pallada,” described the south-western part of the gulf and
                    the Bay of Possiet. In 1855 an English squadron mapped its middle portion as far
                    as Lefu (Askold) Island, and gave it the name of Victoria Bay. The whole gulf
                    was mapped in 1859 by the Russian ships “America” and “Stryelok,” and two years
                    later a Russian post, which afterwards received the name of Vladivostok, was
                    established.</p>
