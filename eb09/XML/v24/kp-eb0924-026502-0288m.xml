                    Roman architect and engineer, whose full name was <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus
                    Vitruvius Pollio,</hi> the author of a very celebrated work on architecture.
                    Nothing is known about his personal history, except what can be gathered from
                    incidental remarks in his own writings. Owing to the discovery of a number of
                    inscriptions relating to the Gens Vitruvia at Formiae in Campania (Mola di
                    Gaeta), it has been suggested that he was a native of that city, and he has been
                    less reasonably connected with Verona on the strength of an existing arch of the
                    3d century, which is inscribed with the name of a later architect of the same
                    family name—“Lucius Vitruvius Cerdo, a freedman of Lucius.” From Vitruvius
                    himself we learn that he was appointed, in the reign of Augustus, together with
                    three others, a superintendent of <hi rend="italic">balistae</hi> and other
                    military engines, a post which, he says, he owed to the friendly influence of
                    the emperor’s sister, probably Octavia (<hi rend="italic">De Architectura,</hi>
                    i. pref.). In another passage (v. 1) he describes a basilica and adjacent aedes
                    Augusti, of which he was the architect. From viii. 3 it has been supposed that
                    he had served in Africa in the time of Julius Caesar, probably as a military
                    engineer, but the words will hardly bear this interpretation. He speaks of
                    himself as being low in stature, and at the time of his writing bowed down by
                    age and ill-health (ii. pref.). He appears to have enjoyed no great reputation
                    as an architect, and, with philosophic contentment, records that he possessed
                    but little fortune. Though a great student of Greek philosophy and science, he
                    was unpractised in literature, and his style is very involved and obscure. To a
                    great extent the theoretical and historical parts of his work are compiled from
                    earlier Greek authors, of whom he gives a list at i. 1 and viii. 3. The
                    practical portions, on the contrary, are evidently the result of his own
                    professional experience, and are written with much sagacity, and in a far
                    clearer style than the more pedantic chapters, in which he gives the somewhat
                    fanciful theories of the Greeks. Some sections of the latter, especially those
                    on the connexion between music and architecture, the scale of harmonic
                    proportions, and the Greek use of bronze vases to reverberate and strengthen the
                    actors’ voices in the theatre, are now almost wholly unintelligible.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">De Architectura</hi> is divided into ten books, each with a
                    preface, in which occur most of the personal facts about himself. It is
                    dedicated to Augustus, and that fact is really all that is known with regard to
                    the date at which Vitruvius lived, though many attempts have been made to gather
                    more minute indications from the internal evidence of his writings: for example,
                    the omission of any mention of the Pantheon in Rome has been taken as an
                    argument to show that he wrote before it was built in 27 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> This, however, and other arguments of the same kind are obviously of
                    but little weight. Vitruvius’s name is mentioned by Frontinus in his work on the
                    aqueducts of Rome; and most of what Pliny says <hi rend="italic">(H.N.,</hi>
                    xxxv. and xxxvi.) about methods of wall-painting, the preparation of the stucco
                    surface, and other practical details in building is taken almost word for word
                    from Vitruvius, especially from vi. 1, though without any acknowledgment of the
                    source.</p>
                <p>From the early Renaissance down to a comparatively recent time the influence of
                    Vitruvius’s treatise has been remarkably great. Throughout the period of the
                    classical revival Vitruvius was the chief authority studied by all architects,
                    and in every point his precepts were accepted as final. In some cases a failure
                    to understand his meaning led to curious results; for example, the mediaeval
                    custom, not uncommon in England, of placing rows of earthenware jars under the
                    floor of the stalls in church choirs appears to have been an attempt to follow
                    out Vitruvius’s remarks about the advantages of placing bronze vases round the
                    auditorium of theatres. Bramante, Michelangelo, Palladio, Vignola, and earlier
                    architects were careful students of Vitruvius’s work, which through them has
                    largely influenced the architecture of almost all European countries down to the
                    present century, a very remarkable instance of the success and influence of a
                    book being actively redeveloped a very long time—about fifteen centuries—after
                    its author’s lifetime. There is no reason to suppose that the book was either
                    popular or influential among the ancient Romans, and yet in more modern times
                    its influence has been unbounded. Its archaeological value is very great, as
                    without it we should find it very difficult to understand the uses of the
                    various parts of such houses as those at Pompeii, and many interesting details
                    with regard both to construction and design would have remained
                    unintelligible.</p>
                <p>Bk. i. opens with a dedication to Augustus. C. 1 is on the science of
                    architecture generally, and the many different branches of knowledge with which
                    the trained architect ought to be acquainted, viz., grammar, music, painting,
                    sculpture, medicine, geometry, mathematics, and optics; c. 2 is on the general
                    principles of architectural design; c. 3 on the considerations which determine a
                    design, such as strength, utility, beauty, and the like; c. 4 on the nature of
                    different sorts of ground for sites; c. 5 on walls of fortification; c. 6 on
                    aspects towards the north, south, and other points; c. 7 on the proper
                    situations of temples dedicated to the various deities. Bk. ii. relates to
                    materials (preface about Dinocrates, architect to Alexander the Great). C. 1 is
                    on the earliest dwellings of man; c. 2 on systems of Thales, Heraclitus,
                    Democritus, &amp;c.; c. 3 on bricks; c. 4 on sand; c. 5 on lime; c. 6 on
                    pozzolana; c. 7 on kinds of stone for building; c. 8 on methods of constructing
                    walls in stone, brick, concrete, and marble, and on the materials for stucco; c.
                    9 on timber, time for felling it, seasoning, &amp;c.; and c. 10 on the fir trees
                    of the Apennines. Bk. iii., on styles, has a preface on ancient Greek writers.
                    C. 1 is on symmetry and proportion; c. 2 on various forms of Greek temples, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in antis, prostyle, peripteral, dipteral,

                    almost universal opinion that it was decastyle had led to the needless theory
                    that the passage containing this statement was corrupt.</p></note> c. 3 on
                    intercolumniation—pycnostyle, systyle, eustyle, &amp;c.; c. 4 on foundations,

                    on styles and orders, has a preface to Augustus on the scope of the work. The
                    subjects of its nine chapters are— (1) the Corinthian, Ionic, and Doric orders;
                    (2) the. ornaments of capitals, &amp;c.; (3) the Doric order; (4) proportions of

                    exercise of athletes; (12) of harbours and quays. Bk. vi. is on sites and
                    planning, and the preface treats of various Greek authors. C. 1 is on selection
                    of sites; c. 2 on the planning of buildings to suit different sites; c. 3 on
                    private houses, their construction and styles, the names of the different
                    apartments; c. 4 on the aspects suited for the various rooms; c. 5 on the
                    various sorts of buildings fitted for special positions; c. 6 on farms and
                    country houses; c. 7 on Greek houses and the names of various parts; c. 8 on
                    construction of houses in wood, stone, brick, or concrete. Bk. vii., mostly on
                    methods of decoration, has a preface (as usual) on the opinions of ancient Greek
                    writers, with lists of Greek sculptors, architects, and writers on architecture,
                    and of Roman architects. C. 1 has for its subject pavements and roads, their
                    construction, mosaic floors; c. 2 is on white stucco for walls (<hi
                    rend="italic">opus albarium)</hi>; c. 3 on concrete vaults, gypsum mouldings,
                    stucco prepared for painting; c. 4 on building of hollow walls to keep out the
                    damp, wall decoration by various processes; c. 5 on methods and styles of wall
                    painting, the debased taste of his time; c. 6 on fine stucco made of pounded

                    murex purple, and imitations of murex dye. Bk. viii. is on hydraulic
                    engineering, and the preface on theories of the ancients. C. 1 treats of the
                    finding of good water, its quality according to the soil it runs through; c. 2
                    of rain-water and rivers —rivers in various countries; c. 3 of hot springs,
                    mineral waters, with an account of the chief medicinal springs of the world; c.
                    4 of selection of water by observation and experiment; c. 5 of instruments for
                    levelling used by aqueduct engineers; c. 6 of construction of aqueducts, pipes
                    of lead, clay, &amp;c., cisterns, fountains, poisoning from lead pipes,
                    hydraulic cement, settling tanks, and other valuable matter on the subject of
                    water-supply. Bk. ix. is on astronomy. The preface treats of Greek sciences,
                    geometry, the discovery of specific gravity by Archimedes, and other valuable
                    discoveries of the Greeks, and of Romans of his time who have vied with the
                    Greeks—Lucretius in his poem <hi rend="italic">Be Rerum Natura,</hi> Cicero in

                    sun-dials and their inventors. Bk. X. is on machinery, with a preface concerning
                    a law at ancient Ephesus compelling an architect to complete any public building
                    he had undertaken; this, he says, would be useful among the Romans of his

                    windlasses, axles, pulleys, and cranes for moving heavy weights, such as those
                    used by Chersiphron in building the great temple of Diana at Ephesus, and on the
