                    took his name, near Troyes in Champagne, about the year 1160. Not merely his
                    literary and historical importance, but almost all that is known about him comes
                    from his chronicle of the fifth crusade, or <hi rend="italic">Conquête de
                    Constantinople.</hi> Nothing is positively known of his ancestry, for the
                    supposition (originating with Du Cange) that a certain William, marshal of
                    Champagne between 1163 and 1179, was his father appears to be erroneous.
                    Villehardouin himself, however, undoubtedly held this dignity, and certain
                    minute and perhaps not very trustworthy indications, chiefly of an heraldic
                    character, have led his most recent biographers to lay it down that he was not
                    born earlier than 1150 or later than 1164. He introduces himself to us with a
                    certain abruptness, merely specifying his own name as one of a list of knights
                    of Champagne who with their count, Thibault, took the cross at a tournament held
                    at Escry-sur-Aisne at Advent 1199, the crusade in contemplation having been
                    started by the preaching of Fulk de Neuilly, who was commissioned thereto by
                    Pope Innocent III. The next year six deputies, two appointed by each of the
                    three allied counts of Flanders, Champagne, and Blois, were despatched to Venice
                    to negotiate for ships. Of these deputies Villehardouin was one and Quesnes de
                    Béthune, the poet, another. They concluded a bargain with the seigniory for
                    transport and provisions at a fixed price. Villehardouin had hardly returned
                    when Thibault fell sick and died; but this did not prevent, though it somewhat
                    delayed, the enterprise of the crusaders. The management of that enterprise,
                    however, was a difficult one, and cost Villehardouin another embassy into Italy
                    to prevent if possible some of his fellow-pilgrims from breaking the treaty with
                    the Venetians by embarking at other ports and employing other convoy. He was
                    only in part successful, and there was great difficulty in raising the
                    chartermoney among those who had actually assembled (in 1202) at Venice, the sum
                    collected falling far short of the stipulated amount. It is necessary to
                    remember this when the somewhat erratic and irregular character of the
                    operations which followed is judged. The defence that the crusaders were bound
                    to pay their passage-money to the Holy Land in one form or other to the
                    Venetians is perhaps a weak one in any case for the attack on two Christian
                    cities, Zara and Constantinople; it becomes weaker still when it is found that
                    the expedition never went or attempted to go to the Holy Land at all. But the
                    desire to discharge obligations incurred is no doubt respectable in itself, and
                    Villehardouin, as one of the actual negotiators of the bargain, must have felt
                    it with peculiar strength.</p>
                <p>The crusaders set sail at last, and Zara, which the Venetians coveted, was taken
                    without much trouble. The question then arose whither the host should go next.
                    Villehardouin does not tell us of any direct part taken by himself in the
                    debates on the question of interfering or not in the disputed succession to the
                    empire of the East,— debates in which the chief ecclesiastics present strongly
                    protested against the diversion of the enterprise from its proper goal. It is
                    quite clear, however, that the marshal of Champagne, who was one of the leaders
                    and inner counsellors of the expedition throughout, sympathized with the
                    majority, and it is fair to point out that the temptation of chivalrous
                    adventure was probably as great as that of gain. He narrates spiritedly enough
                    the dissensions and discussions in the winter camp of Zara and at Corfu, but is
                    evidently much more at ease when the voyage was again resumed, and, after a fair
                    passage round Greece, the crusaders at last saw before them the great city of
                    Constantinople which they had it in mind to attack. When the assault was decided
                    upon, Villehardouin himself was in the fifth “battle,” the leader of which was
                    Mathieu de Montmorency. But, though his account of the siege is full of personal
                    touches, and contains one reference to the number of witnesses whose testimony
                    he took for a certain wonderful fact, he does not tell us anything of his own
                    prowess. After the flight of the usurper Alexius, and when Isaac, whose claims
                    the crusaders were defending, had been taken by the Greeks from prison and
                    placed on the throne, Villehardouin, with Montmorency and two Venetians, formed
                    the embassy sent to arrange terms. He was again similarly distinguished when it
                    became necessary to remonstrate with Alexius, the blind man’s son and virtual
                    successor, on the non-keeping of the terms. Indeed Villehardouin’s talents as a
                    diplomatist seem to have been held in very high esteem, for later, when the
                    Latin empire had become a fact, he was charged with the delicate business of
                    mediating between the emperor Baldwin and Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, in
                    which task he had at least partial success. He was also appointed marshal of
                    “Romanie”—a term very vaguely used, but apparently signifying the mainland of
                    the Balkan Peninsula, while his nephew and namesake, afterwards prince of
                    Achaia, took a great part in the Latin conquest of Peloponnesus. Villehardouin
                    himself before long received an important command against the Bulgarians. He was
                    left to maintain the siege of Adrianople when Baldwin advanced to attack the
                    relieving force, and with Dandolo had much to do in saving the defeated
                    crusaders from utter destruction, and conducting the retreat, in which he
                    commanded the rear guard, and brought his troops in safety to the sea at
                    Rodosto, and thence to the capital. As he occupied <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0251-0230"/> the post of honour in this disaster, so he had
                    that (the command of the vanguard) in the expedition which the regent Henry made
                    shortly afterwards to revenge his brother Baldwin’s defeat and capture. And,
                    when Henry had succeeded to the crown on the announcement of Baldwin’s death, it
                    was Villehardouin who fetched home his bride Agnes of Montferrat, and shortly
                    afterwards commanded under him in a naval battle with the ships of Theodore
                    Lascaris at the fortress of Cibotus. In the settlement of the Latin empire after
                    the truce with Lascaris Villehardouin received the fief of Messinople (supposed
                    to be Mosynopolis, a little inland from the modern Gulf of Lagos, and not far
                    from the ancient Abdera) from Boniface of Montferrat, with the record of whose
                    death the chronicle abruptly closes.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing account only those particulars which bear directly on
                    Villehardouin himself have been detailed; but the chronicle is as far as
                    possible from being an autobiography, and the displays of the writer’s
                    personality, numerous as they are, are quite involuntary, and consist merely in
                    his way of handling the subject, not in the references, as brief as his
                    functions as chronicler will admit, to his own proceedings. The chronicle of
                    Villehardouin is justly held to be the very best presentation we possess of the
                    spirit of chivalry, not the designedly exalted and poetized chivalry of the
                    romances, not the self-conscious and deliberate chivalry of the 14th century,
                    but the unsophisticated mode of thinking and acting which brought about the
                    crusades, stimulated the vast literary development of the 12th and 13th
                    centuries, and sent knights-errant, principally though not wholly of French
                    blood, to establish principalities and kingdoms throughout Europe and the nearer
                    East. On the whole, no doubt, it is the more masculine and practical side of
                    this enthusiastic state of mind which Villehardouin shows. No woman makes any
                    but the briefest appearance in his pages, though in reference to this it must of
                    course be remembered that he was certainly a man past middle life when the
                    events occurred, and perhaps a man approaching old age when he set them down.
                    Despite the strong and graphic touches here and there, exhibiting the impression
                    which the beauty of sea and land, the splendour of Constantinople, the magnitude
                    of the effete but still imposing Greek power made on him, there is not only an
                    entire absence of dilation on such subjects as a modern would have dilated on
                    (that was to be expected), but an absence likewise of the elaborate and painful
                    description of detail in which contemporary <hi rend="italic">trouvères</hi>
                    would have indulged. It is curious, for instance, to compare the scanty
                    references to the material marvels of Constantinople which Villehardouin saw in
                    their glory, which perished by sack and fire under his very eyes, and which live
                    chiefly in the melancholy pages of his Greek contemporary Nicetas, with the
                    elaborate descriptions of the scarcely greater wonders of fabulous courts at
                    Constantinople itself, at Babylon, and elsewhere to be found in his other
                    contemporaries, the later <hi rend="italic">chanson de geste</hi> writers and
                    the earlier embroiderers of the Arthurian romances and <hi rend="italic">romans
                    d’aventures.</hi> And this latter contrast is all the more striking that
                    Villehardouin agrees with, and not impossibly borrows from, these very writers
                    in many points of style and phraseology. The brief chapters of his work have
                    been justly compared to the <hi rend="italic">laisses</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tirades</hi> of a chanson in what may be called the vignetting of the subject
                    of each, in the absence of any attempt to run on the narrative in the precise
                    forms, and in poetical rather than prosaic wordorder of the sentences.
                    Undoubtedly this half-poetic style (animated as it is and redeemed from any
                    charge of bastardy by the freshness and vigour which pervade it) adds not a
                    little to the charm of the book. Its succession of word pictures, conventional
                    and yet vigorous as the illuminations of a mediaeval manuscript, and in their
                    very conventionality free from all thought of literary presentation, must charm
                    all readers. The sober lists of names with which it opens; the account of the
                    embassy, so business-like in its estimates of costs and terms, and suddenly
                    breaking into a fervent description of how the six deputies, “prostrating
                    themselves on the earth and weeping warm tears, begged the doge and people of
                    Venice to have pity on Jerusalem;” the story immediately following how the young
                    count Thibault of Champagne, raising himself from a sickbed in his joy at the
                    successful retura of his ambassadors, “leva sus et chevaucha, et laz! com grant
                    domages, car onques puis ne chevaucha que cele foiz,” compose a most striking
                    overture. Then the history relapses into the business vein and tells of the
                    debates which took place as to the best means of carrying out the vow after the
                    count’s decease, the rendezvous, too ill kept at Venice, the plausible
                    suggestion of the Venetians that the balance due to them should be made up by a
                    joint attack oil their enemy, the king of Hungary. Villehardouin does not in the
                    least conceal the fact that the pope (“l'apostoilles de Rome,” as he calls him
                    in the very phrase of the chansons) was very angry with this; for his own part
                    he seems to think of little or nothing but the reparation due to the republic,
                    which had loyally kept its bargain and been defrauded of the price, of the
                    infamy of breaking company on the part of members of a joint association, and
                    perhaps of the unknightliness of not taking up an adventure whenever it presents
                    itself. For here again the restoration of the disinherited prince of
                    Constantinople supplied an excuse quite as plausible as the liquidation of the
                    debt to Venice. A famous passage and one short enough to quote is that
                    describing the old blind doge Dandolo, who had " Grant ochoison de remanoir
                    (reason for staying at home), car viels hom ere, et si avoit les yaulx en la
                    teste biaus et n’en veoit gote (goutte),” and yet was the foremost in fight.</p>
                <p>It would be out of place to attempt any further analysis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conquête</hi> here. But it is not impertinent, and is at the same time an
                    excuse for what has been already said, to repeat that Villehardouin’s book,
                    brief as it is, is in reality one of the capital books of literature, not merely
                    for its merit, but because it is the most authentic and the most striking
                    embodiment in contemporary literature of the sentiments which determined the
                    action of a great and important period of history. There are but very few books
                    which hold this position, and Villehardouin’s is one of them. If every other
                    contemporary record of the crusades perished, we should still be able by aid of
                    this to understand and realize what the mental attitude of crusaders, of
                    Teutonic knights, and the rest was, and without this we should lack the
                    earliest, the most undoubtedly genuine, and the most characteristic of all such
                    records. The very inconsistency with which Villehardouin is chargeable, the
                    absence of compunction with which he relates the changing of a sacred religious
                    pilgrimage into something by no means unlike a mere filibustering raid on the
                    great scale, add a charm to the book. For, religious as it is, it is entirely
                    free from the very slightest touch of hypocrisy or indeed of self-consciousness
                    of any kind. The famous description of the crusades, <hi rend="italic">gesta Dei
                    per Francos,</hi> was evidently to Villehardouin a plain matter-of-fact
                    description, and it no more occurred to him to doubt the divine favour being
                    extended to the expeditions against Alexius or Theodore than to doubt that it
                    was shown to expeditions against Saracens and Turks.</p>
                <p>The person of Villehardouin reappears for us once, but once only, in the
                    chronicle of his continuator, Henri de Valenciennes. There is a great gap in
                    style, though none in subject, between the really poetical prose of the first
                    historian of the fifth crusade and the Latin empire and the awkward mannerism
                    (so awkward that it has been taken to represent a “disrhymed” verse chronicle)
                    of his follower. But the much greater length at which Villehardouin appears on
                    this one occasion shows us the restraint which he must have exercised in the
                    passages which deal with himself in his own work. He again led the vanguard in
                    the emperor Henry’s expedition against Burilas the Bulgarian, and he is
                    represented by the Valenciennes scribe as encouraging his sovereign to the
                    attack in a long speech. Then he disappears altogether, with the exception of
                    some brief and chiefly diplomatic mentions. Du Cange discovered and quoted a
                    deed of donation by him dated 1207, by which certain properties were devised to
                    the churches of Notre Dame de Foissy and Notre Dame de Troyes, with the
                    reservation of life interests to his daughters Alix and Damerones, and his
                    sisters Emmeline and Haye, all of whom appear to have embraced a monastic life.
                    A letter addressed from the East to Blanche of Champagne is cited, and a papal
                    record of 1212 styles him still “marshal of Romania.” The next year this title
                    passed to his son Erard; and 1213 is accordingly given as the date of his death,
                    which, as there is no record or hint of his having returned to France, may be
                    supposed to have happened at Messinople, where also he must have written the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conquête.</hi></p>
                <p>The book appears to have been known in the ages immediately succeeding his own;
                    and, though there is no contemporary manuscript in existence, there are some
                    half dozen which appear to date from the end of the 13th or the course of the
                    14th century, while one at least appears to be a copy made from his own work in
                    that spirit of unintelligent faithfulness which is much more valuable to
                    posterity than more intelligent editing. The first printed edition of the book,
                    by a certain Blaise de Vigenère, dates from 1585, is dedicated to the seigniory
                    of Venice (Villehardouin, it should be said, has been accused of a rather unfair
                    predilection for the Venetians), and speaks of either a part or the whole of the
                    memoirs as having been printed twelve years earlier. Of this earlier copy
                    nothing seems to be known. A better edition, founded on a Netherlandish<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0252-0231"/> MS., appeared at Lyons in 1601. But both these
                    were completely antiquated by the great edition of Du Cange in 1657, wherein
                    that learned writer employed all his knowledge, never since equalled, of the
                    subject, but added a translation, or rather paraphrase, into modern French which
                    is scarcely worthy either of himself or his author. Dom Brial gave a new edition
                    from different MS. sources in 1823, and the book figures with different degrees
                    of dependence on Du Cange and Brial in the collections of Petitot, Buchon, and
                    Michaud and Poujoulat. All these, however, have been superseded for the modern
                    student by the editions of Μ. Natalis de Wailly (1872 and 1874), in which the
                    text is critically edited from all the available MSS. and a new translation
                    added. The charm of Villehardouin can escape no reader; but few readers will
                    fail to derive some additional pleasure from the two essays which Sainte-Beuve
                    devoted to him thirty years ago, and which may be found reprinted in the ninth
                    volume of the <hi rend="italic">Causeries du Lundi.</hi> (G. SA. )</p>
