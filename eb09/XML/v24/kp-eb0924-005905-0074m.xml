                    (1599-1641), painter, was born in Antwerp on 22d March 1599. Though the name of
                    Van Dyck is frequently met with in the list of Antwerp painters, Anthony’s
                    pedigree cannot be traced beyond his grandparents, who were silk mercers of some
                    standing. He was the seventh of twelve children of Francis Van Dyck, an Antwerp
                    tradesman in good circumstances, and <pb break="no"

                    Bois-le-Duc. His mother, Maria Cupers, who died when he was scarcely eight years
                    of age, seems to have attained a certain degree of excellence in art needlework.
                    Of the boy’s early education nothing is known. He was little over ten when he
                    was apprenticed to Henry Van Balen, the painter of many delicate little
                    pictures, also an occasional collaborator of Rubens, and the master of Snyders.
                    From a document discovered some twenty years ago in the state paper office at
                    Brussels, relating to a lawsuit between a picture dealer and an Antwerp
                    churchman, which arose out of the sale, in 1660, of a series of Apostles’ heads
                    ascribed to Van Dyck, it appears that, as far back as 1615, Van Dyck had worked
                    independently, with pupils of his own, and that his pictures were greatly valued
                    by artists and amateurs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Prof. Woermann has identified several of the Apostles’ heads here spoken of
                    with some paintings in the gallery at Dresden.</p></note> Before he was nineteen
                    (February 1618) Van Dyck became a full member of the Antwerp guild of painters;
                    and some idea of his ability at the time may be gained from the excellent
                    portraits of an old lady and gentleman, ascribed till quite recently to Rubens,
                    in the Dresden gallery (Nos. 854 and 855). Dated 1618, they were originally
                    entered as works of Van Dyck, and, as Prof. Woermann observes, are undoubtedly
                    the same as those spoken of by Mols in his MS. annotations on Walpole’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Anecdotes,</hi> now in the library at Brussels. But the same
                    admiration cannot be accorded to the earliest religious composition known to
                    have been painted by him—Christ Falling under the Cross, in St Paul’s at
                    Antwerp. This picture, of some ten life-size figures, still preserved in the
                    place for which it was originally destined, distinctly proves that from the
                    outset of his career Van Dyck’s power of conception was vastly inferior to his
                    refined taste as a portrait painter. At first sight it would seem also that with
                    him, as with most other Flemish painters of the period, every conception,
                    whether sacred or profane, needed to be cast in the mould of Rubens. It would be
                    too much, however, to assert that Van Dyck at this time stood under the guidance
                    of that master; their association indeed does not seem to have begun until 1619,
                    and Bellori (1672), who got his information from Sir Kenelm Digby, Van Dyck’s
                    bosom friend, tells us that he was first employed in making drawings (probably
                    also chiaroscuros) for the use of the great master’s engravers, and that among
                    works of the kind one of the first was the Battle of the Amazons (1619).</p>
                <p>In 1620 we know that Van Dyck was working with Rubens, for on 20th March, in
                    making arrangements with the Antwerp Jesuits for the decoration of their church,
                    the great master is allowed to avail himself of his pupil’s assistance, and
                    obtains for him the promise of a picture. This proof of Van Dyck’s personal
                    reputation is fully confirmed (17th July) by a correspondent of the earl of
                    Arundel, who speaks of Van Dyck as a young man of one and twenty whose works are
                    scarcely less esteemed than those of his master, and adds that, his relations
                    being people of considerable wealth, he could hardly be expected to leave his
                    home. Van Dyck was, however, thus persuaded, for on 28th November Sir Toby
                    Mathew mentions the artist’s departure to Sir Dudley Carleton, adding that he is
                    in receipt of an annual pension of £100 from the king. There is evidence of Van
                    Dyck’s presence in London till the end of February 1621. He is first mentioned
                    in the order-books of the Exchequer on the 17th of that month as receiving a
                    reward of £100 “for special service by him performed for His Majesty,” and on
                    the 28th, “Antonio van Dyck, gent., <hi rend="italic">His Majesties
                    servant,</hi> is allowed to travaile 8 months, he havinge obtayneid his Ma <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ties</hi> leave in that behalf, as was signified by the E.
                    of Arundell.” What Van Dyck did in London is not known. Among his numerous
                    paintings still preserved in English houses one only is admitted as belonging to
                    the period of this first visit, a full-length portrait of James I. in the royal
                    collection. That he was at the time a portrait painter of the rarest merit may
                    easily be seen from his own likeness of himself when still quite young and
                    beardless, in the National Gallery (London), in the Pinakothek at Munich, and in
                    the private collections of the duke of Grafton and Sir Richard Wallace. In this
                    last admirable specimen the young painter has represented himself in the
                    character of Paris. Early paintings by Van Dyck are certainly not scarce in
                    British galleries; and at Dulwich there is his admirable Samson and Delilah,
                    wrongly ascribed to Rubens.</p>
                <p>Van Dyck is supposed to have profited by his leave of absence to visit Paris and
                    The Hague; but it is much more probable that the eight months were spent in
                    Antwerp, where Rubens was greatly in need of his assistance for the church of
                    the Jesuits. After this Van Dyck most probably returned to London and remained
                    there till the end of 1622, when his father died. The precise date of his
                    departure for Italy—perhaps at the beginning and certainly in the course of
                    1623—has not been ascertained. But he is known to have left with Rubens a
                    considerable number of paintings, most of which have been identified in Madrid,
                    Berlin, Dresden, &amp;c., and show that study, as well as advice, had long since
                    made the painter acquainted, through Rubens, with those principles of
                    picturesque expression which he was now about to see exemplified so splendidly
                    in the works of the Venetian and Genoese schools. His previous acquaintance with
                    many excellent examples of Titian, Tintoretto, and others in Rubens’s own
                    collection can alone account for the remarkably glowing tints of Van Dyck’s
                    earliest paintings. In fact, such works as the Martyrdom of St Peter (Brussels),
                    the Crowning with Thorns (Berlin), the Betrayal of Christ (Madrid and Lord
                    Methuen), St Martin Dividing his Cloak (Windsor Castle),—a magnificent
                    production, generally ascribed to Rubens, but easily identified through Van
                    Dyck’s admirable sketch at Dorchester House,—incontestably prove that, in point
                    of colouring, Venice at this moment stood higher in his predilection than
                    Antwerp.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to dwell on a number of tales connected with Van Dyck’s early
                    life, all of which have on closer examination proved to be apocryphal; but one
                    story has been too frequently told to be altogether ignored. At the very outset
                    of his Italian journey the inflammable youth was captivated by the beauty of a
                    country girl, and for the love of her painted the altar-piece still to be seen
                    in the church at Saventhem near Brussels, in which he himself is supposed to be
                    represented on a grey horse, given by Rubens to his pupil. It is now known,
                    however, that the picture was commissioned by a gentleman living at Saventhem
                    (to the charms of whose daughter Van Dyck in reality seems not to have been
                    altogether insensible), and a closer study makes it almost certain that it was
                    executed after, not before, his Italian journey. On a reduced scale, and with
                    the omission of two or three figures, the St Martin at Saventhem is a
                    reproduction of the picture at Windsor Castle.</p>
                <p>No master from beyond the Alps ever took up a higher position than Van Dyck among
                    the most celebrated representatives of Italian art. Study, as a matter of
                    course, had been one of his principal objects. No doubt can be entertained as to
                    the great influence exerted by the works of Titian and Paul Veronese in the
                    development of his genius; still the individuality of the painter remains a
                    striking feature of what may be termed his Italian works, especially portraits.
                    Their peculiar character seems to originate even more in the stateliness of the
                    personages <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n76/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0076-0061"/> he was fortunate enough to have as sitters than
                    in any desire to follow individual predilection or prevailing fashion. As in
                    later years Van Dyck gives us a striking picture of the higher classes in
                    England, so at this stage he makes us acquainted with Italian beauty and style;
                    and at no other period is his talent more advantageously shown than in some of
                    the glorious portraits he painted at Rome, at Florence, and above all at Genoa.
                    At Rome he resided with Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio, who had been papal nuncio in
                    Flanders from 1607 to 1617. For this patron were painted several works of very
                    great importance, the most renowned being the prelate’s own portrait, now in the
                    Pitti Palace at Florence. Another work was a Crucifixion, representing Christ
                    dying on the cross with uplifted eyes. Most probably the picture spoken of by
                    Bellori ought to be identified with the admirable edition now in the gallery at
                    Naples, catalogued as “Scuola di Van Dyck,” unsurpassed by any of those at
                    Antwerp, Paris, Vienna, Rome, or elsewhere. Besides these he painted religious
                    subjects and portraits, several of which are reckoned among his finest examples,
                    such as the portrait of Francis Duquesnoy, the famous sculptor, belonging to the
                    king of the Belgians, and those of Sir Robert Shirley and his wife, in Persian
                    attire, now at Petworth.</p>
                <p>Bellori tells us of Van Dyck’s prepossessing appearance, of his elegance and
                    distinction, altogether so different from the habits of his compatriots in Rome,
                    who formed a jovial “gang,” as they termed their association. Van Dyck seems to
                    have kept out of their way, and incurred in consequence such annoyance as made
                    his stay in Rome much shorter than it would otherwise have been. In the company
                    of Lady Arundel, who tried to persuade him to return to England, he travelled to
                    Turin, and perhaps produced some of the paintings now in the royal gallery
                    there, such as the spirited portrait of Thomas of Savoy on his splendid black
                    charger. But he was eager to reach Genoa, where Rubens had worked with great
                    success some twenty years before, and where his Antwerp friends, Luke and
                    Cornelis de Wael, for many years resident in Italy, now were. Van Dyck remained
                    their guest for several months, and their portraits, now in the Pinacoteca
                    Capitolina at Rome (engraved by W. Hollar from the monochrome at Cassel), may be
                    supposed to have been one of his first Genoese productions. Though several of
                    the palaces of the “superb” city no longer retain their treasures, and among the
                    specimens of Van Dyck’s genius still left too many have been greatly injured by
                    cleaning and retouching, Genoa can still boast of a good number of his most
                    attractive productions, portraits of the beautiful ladies and haughty cavaliers
                    of the noble houses of Doria, Brignole Sale, Pallavicini, Balbi, Cattaneo,
                    Spinola, Lommelini, and Grimaldi. It would scarcely be possible to speak too
                    highly of such works as the portrait of the lady in white satin and the Durazzo
                    children at the Durazzo Palace, the Balbi children at Panshanger, the Marchesa
                    Balbi at Dorchester House, the equally beautiful portraits of the Lommelini and
                    of the knight in black armour, buff jacket, and boots in the national gallery at
                    Edinburgh, or the Marchesa Brignole Sala at Warwick Castle. Van Dyck’s “Genoese
                    manner” is a current expression, and indeed his Genoese portraits are remarkable
                    for their richness of tonality and what might be called royal splendour, perhaps
                    never before attained in works of the kind. This we may suppose to have had its
                    origin, not only in his recent study of Titian (Van Dyck having, it is said,
                    first spent some time at Venice), but also in decorative necessities,—the size
                    of the palatial galleries and the rich hues of the Genoese velvets, on which
                    these portraits were to find their place, obliging the painter to find a most
                    uncommon strength of contrast. It must also be acknowledged that the beauty and
                    distinction of Van Dyck’s models are greatly enhanced by a splendour of costume
                    entirely different from the dulness then prevalent almost everywhere else. In
                    Italy, moreover, he found the reality of those gorgeous backgrounds, —flowing
                    draperies, beautiful gardens, ornamental pillars, marble terraces and
                    balustrades,—which elsewhere must be regarded as fictions merely. Here, finally,
                    he was for the first time called upon to paint some of his grandest equestrian
                    portraits, and the often-recurring grey steed with flowing mane (an admirable
                    study of which belongs to Lord Brownlow) was first employed for the portrait of
                    Antonio Giulio Brignole (still at Genoa) and for another picture which we may
                    suppose to represent the same personage at Stafford House. As with Rubens,
                    Titian seems to have been paramount in Van Dyck’s regard. Copies in great number
                    we know he possessed of the master’s best works, and several little sketches in
                    the British Museum bear proof of his devout study of the great Venetian. Some of
                    Van Dyck’s earlier paintings, religious and mythological,—the Tribute Money
                    (Brignole Palace), Holy Family (Turin), Virgin and Saints (Louvre), Virgin
                    (Grosvenor House), Martyrdom of St Lawrence (S. Maria dell’ Orto, Venice),
                    Bacchanal (Lord Belper), engraved at Genoa as early as 1628, St Sebastian
                    (Edinburgh),—are certainly Titianesque in the extreme. Still the master’s
                    individuality is not obliterated, and the gallery at Parma has a Virgin with the
                    Infant Asleep which may be termed a marvel of realistic simplicity.</p>
                <p>Van Dyck is said to have sailed from Genoa to Palermo and there to have painted
                    several persons of rank, including the viceroy, Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy.
                    While in Sicily he became acquainted with the painter Sofonisba Anguisciola (or
                    Angussola), who was then over ninety years of age and blind; and he was wont to
                    say he had received more valuable information from a blind woman than from many
                    a seeing man. No important works of Van Dyck are now to be found in Sicily.
                    Bellori tells us that a plague broke out and compelled him to leave abruptly,
                    taking with him an unfinished picture of St Rosalia, destined for a
                    confraternity of that name, and which was completed in Genoa. The composition
                    was repeated in Antwerp for the Bachelors’ Brotherhood, a picture now in Vienna.
                    Van Dyck most probably remained in Genoa till 1627, and here in all likelihood
                    he met and painted the sculptor George Petel, whose portrait is now in Munich,
                    and who was frequently employed by Rubens; the De Jodes, father and son, the
                    celebrated engravers, who are represented together in a masterly portrait in the
                    Capitol at Rome, the companion picture to the brothers De Wael; and Nicholas
                    Laniere, musician-in-chief to Charles I., a painting spoken of in Van der Dort’s
                    catalogue as “done beyond the seas.” Laniere was in Italy precisely at this time
                    and it was through his portrait (now at Windsor Castle), Walpole assures us,
                    that Van Dyck attracted the notice of Charles I.</p>
                <p>Embarking for Marseilles, Van Dyck is said to have stopped at Aix with Peiresc,
                    the famous scholar and friend of Rubens, and thence to have gone to Paris, where
                    most probably he painted the beautiful portrait of Langlois the print-seller
                    (belonging to Mr W. Garnett), a work still influenced by Italian reminiscences,
                    and had the opportunity of meeting Callot, Simon Vouet, and Dupuy, the king’s
                    librarian,—all of whose portraits were engraved from his drawings in Antwerp.
                    According to some authors, he also worked in Holland before returning to his
                    native town; but the supposition rests entirely on two portraits in the museum
                    at The Hague, dated 1627 and 1628, and representing a lady and gentleman, with
                    the Sheffield arms. The lady is easily identified by a well-known print by
                    Clouwet as Anne Wake. The Wake family resided in <pb break="no"

                    there. There is no recorded proof of Van Dyck’s return to Antwerp before 6th
                    March 1628. One of his sisters had died in a convent the year before, and he now
                    made a will in favour of Susan and Isabella, two other sisters, also nuns. That
                    Van Dyck was in Antwerp on 18th May is proved by a letter from Lord Carlisle to
                    Buckingham (Sainsbury, CIII.), but it is stated in Bullart’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Académie,</hi> published in 1682, that he returned again to London in 1629,
                    without, however, attracting the king’s attention. It is very likely that Lady
                    Arundel’s endeavours to get him back to England were now successful, and that
                    the beautiful portrait of Lord Thomas, at Stafford House, belongs to this
                    period.</p>
                <p>Great as may have been the strength of Italian reminiscence, from the moment Van
                    Dyck again trod Flemish soil the influence of Rubens became predominant, and we
                    can scarcely doubt that a competition speedily arose between master and pupil.
                    At this period churches and convents were numerous and richly endowed; and the
                    number of pictures, stained glass windows, and elaborate carvings in Belgian
                    churches before the French conquest was enormous. Hardly fifty years had elapsed
                    since these buildings had been stripped of their artistic treasures, and the
                    devout were now eager once more to adorn them with productions of the greatest
                    painters. Hence Van Dyck’s share could be very copious without in any degree
                    interfering with the vast undertakings assigned to Rubens. The latter was also
                    absent for many months in 1629 and 1630, so that Van Dyck was for a time the
                    first master in the Netherlands. Among the earliest works after his return to
                    Antwerp we find the Crucifixion, given to the Dominican nuns, in accordance with
                    the wish expressed by the painter’s dying father, and now in the Antwerp museum.
                    The figures are life-size, and at the foot of the cross, besides a weeping
                    angel, are St Catherine of Siena and St Dominic. Neither in type nor in general
                    effect does it suggest the master’s immediately preceding works. As a new
                    feature we observe a kind of elegance, not entirely free from mannerism, which
                    is often conspicuous with Van Dyck even when the technical excellence commands
                    our warmest admiration. Inspiration, as Waagen observes, was far more limited
                    with Van Dyck than with Rubens. His truly delicate nature led him to restrain
                    his conceptions within the bounds of an academic evenness, generally more
                    pleasing to the uninitiated than the strength of expression which sometimes
                    imparts a sort of violence to the works of Rubens. To Van Dyck’s second—more
                    justly speaking third—manner belong some of his best religious works. The
                    Crucifixion in the cathedral at Mechlin is termed by Sir Joshua Reynolds one of
                    the finest pictures in the world. Other Crucifixions are in St Michael’s at
                    Ghent (sketches in Lord Brownlow’s collection and the Brussels museum) and in
                    the church at Termonde. Still finer are the two works painted for the Antwerp
                    Jesuits and now at Vienna,—the Blessed Herman Joseph Kneeling before the Virgin
                    and St Rosalia Crowned by the Infant Saviour. To this period likewise belong the
                    celebrated Elevation of the Cross at Courtrai and the St Augustine in Ecstasy,
                    in the church of the Jesuits at Antwerp; the general effect of this last, it
                    must be acknowledged with Reynolds, is inferior to the beautiful engraving by De
                    Jode, and also to the earl of Northbrook’s magnificent sketch. At Dulwich we
                    find the first idea of the composition, with many interesting differences. It
                    may be a matter of individual preference to pronounce Van Dyck’s Flemish
                    portraits superior to those of an earlier period; but nobody can fail to admit
                    that, technically speaking, they indicate a further step towards perfection. The
                    darkness of the Genoese portraits has vanished: broad daylight now freely
                    illuminates the model, and such works as the portraits of Cornelius Van der
                    Geest (National Gallery, London) and Ambrogio Spinola (Rev. W. H. Wayne) are
                    perhaps as close to material excellence as any painting could be. The
                    full-length likenesses of Philip Le Roy (1630) and his wife (1631) (at
                    Manchester House) and of Mary Louisa of Tassis (Prince Liechtenstein, Vienna)
                    are not only the finest examples of the master’s talent, but deserve to rank
                    among the most beautiful portraits ever painted. The Snyders at Castle Howard is
                    regarded by Waagen as not inferior to the most celebrated Raphaels, Titians, or
                    Holbeins; and of almost equal excellence are the Wife of Colin de Nole in the
                    Munich gallery, the Lady and her Daughter at the Louvre, and the Lady in Black
                    at Cassel.</p>
                <p>Rapidly rising to honour and wealth, Van Dyck shared with Rubens the official
                    title of court painter, and his numerous portraits of the Infanta in her
                    monastic garb (Paris, Vienna, Turin, Parma, &amp;c.) bear testimony to the great
                    favour in which he stood with her. When Mary de’ Medici, after her flight from
                    France, took up her residence in Brussels (1631), she honoured Van Dyck, as well
                    as Rubens, with repeated visits, and several times called upon him to paint her
                    likeness, as well as those of Gaston of Orleans and his wife Margaret of
                    Lorraine, and several of the personages of their court. From Gerbier’s letters
                    we learn that Van Dyck at this time was contemplating another journey to
                    England, and was very anxious to be commissioned by the infanta and the queen of
                    France to take over their portraits as presents for the king and royal family.
                    He soon travelled to The Hague to paint the prince and princess of Orange and
                    their son. Quite at the beginning of 1632 Constantine Huygens, who was then
                    living at The Hague, inscribes in his diary, “Pingor a Van Dyckio.” When,
                    towards the end of March, Van Dyck sailed for England, he took all these
                    portraits with him, as we learn from an account of the 8th of August 1632
                    (Carpenter’s <hi rend="italic">Pictorial Notices).</hi> Dutch authors speak of a
                    visit paid by Van Dyck to Frans Hals at Haarlem, and of a portrait of the latter
                    through which the Antwerp master was at once recognized by his Dutch colleague.
                    An engraving of a portrait of Hals after Van Dyck seems to confirm the
                    story.</p>
                <p>In undertaking this new journey to London, Van Dyck was assured of success, for
                    Gerbier’s letters show that the king had personally desired his presence. As
                    early as March 1629 Endymion Porter, one of the gentlemen of the king’s
                    bedchamber, had been commissioned to order a picture from Van Dyck, Rinaldo and
                    Armida. The composition is well known through De Balliu’s first-rate engraving,
                    and the canvas, now belonging to the duke of Newcastle, may be looked upon as
                    one of the master’s finest creations. Rubens was in London at the time the
                    picture arrived, and to him we may in a great measure attribute the realization
                    of Van Dyck’s plans and the exceptional favours bestowed upon him almost from
                    the day of his arrival in London. Besides the title of painter in ordinary, and
                    the grant of an annual pension of &lt;£200, he received the honour of knighthood
                    after a residence of less than three months at court (5th July 1632). Van Dyck
                    rapidly achieved popularity among the higher classes, and, as Walpole says, his
                    works are so frequent in England that to most Englishmen it is difficult to
                    avoid thinking of him as their countryman.</p>
                <p>His refined nature is strikingly illustrated in his admirable interpretation of
                    English beauty and style. And, if Van Dyck be compared to Mytens and Cornelius
                    Janssen, the most distinguished painters employed by the English court
                    immediately before him, few artists, whether in England or elsewhere, have more
                    richly endowed their models with distinction of feature and elegance in bearing.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0078-0063"/> him may be applied what Opie says of Titian,
                    “that he combines resemblance with dignity, costume with taste, and art with
                    simplicity.” We are particularly struck with the thorough and immediate
                    identification of his talent with local tastes and exigencies. Charles I. and
                    Henrietta Maria, although pictured by several other painters, are known to
                    posterity exclusively through Van Dyck, not from a greater closeness of
                    resemblance to the original, but from a particular power of expression and
                    bearing, which, once seen, it is impossible to forget. Lodged at the expense of
                    the crown, with a summer residence at Eltham Palace, Van Dyck was frequently
                    honoured with the visits of the king at his studio at Blackfriars. Portraits now
                    followed each other with a rapidity scarcely credible to those unacquainted with
                    the artist’s method. In fact, his mode of living and his love of pleasure
                    sufficiently explain his great need of money. During the first year of his
                    presence in England he painted the king and queen a dozen times. The first of
                    these noble portraits is the admirable full length of Charles I., with the queen
                    and their two eldest children, at Windsor Castle. The style he adopted in
                    England is generally termed his third manner; we might better say his fourth, as
                    he already had a very particular style before he set out on his Italian journey.
                    De Piles gives us some account of Van Dyck’s methods at this period of his
                    career. He began with a small sketch on grey paper with black and white chalks,
                    or a monochrome in oils. This study was passed on to assistants in order to be
                    copied on the required scale. When the clothes were sufficiently advanced by the
                    pupils from those sent by the model, as well as the background and accessories,
                    the master was enabled in a few sittings of an hour each to complete the work.
                    Van Dyck excelled in painting the hands; he is said to have kept special models
                    for this part of his work. It need hardly be said that a system of this kind,
                    although employed by Rubens for his larger creations, was exceedingly ill
                    adapted to portrait painting. In Van Dyck’s later productions we too often
                    detect marks of haste, as if the pencil were becoming a mere implement of
                    trade.</p>
                <p>Nearly the whole of 1634 and 1635 were spent by Van Dyck in the Netherlands.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is not generally known
                    that his brother, an Antwerp priest, had been called over by the queen to act as
                    her chaplain.</p></note> The archduchess died on 1st December 1633, and Van Dyck
                    naturally wished to get his official title renewed by her successor, Ferdinand
                    of Austria, brother of Philip IV. That Van Dyck’s residence in Antwerp was only
                    to be temporary is shown by the power given to his sister Susan for the
                    administration of his affairs in Belgium (14th April 1634). On the arrival of
                    the new governor Van Dyck was immediately called upon to paint his likeness, a
                    picture now in the Madrid gallery, where the same personage is also represented
                    by Rubens and Velazquez. Several other portraits of Ferdinand, either in his
                    cardinal’s robes or in military dress, by Van Dyck, occur elsewhere. One on
                    horseback was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, in 1887 as the duke of
                    Alva (the property of Mr S. Kynaston Mainwaring). Van Dyck was greatly in demand
                    at this time, and his prices were correspondingly high, as the Antwerp
                    municipality found when they asked for a portrait of the late infanta to
                    decorate one of the triumphal arches for the reception of the new governor. The
                    most important of Van Dyck’s works, at any rate as a portrait painter, belong to
                    this period. The picture representing in life size the members of the Brussels
                    corporation, which was destroyed by fire during the siege of 1695, is spoken of
                    with intense admiration by several writers. Bullart, for instance, is very
                    enthusiastic about its fine colour and lifelike qualities. Among the religious
                    paintings of undis puted excellence belonging to the same period are the
                    Adoration of the Shepherds in the church at Termonde, and the Deposition, where
                    the body of Christ rests upon the lap of the Virgin, in the Antwerp museum.
                    Among the portraits are the admirable full length of Scaglia, the king’s
                    frequent agent in the Netherlands (at Dorchester House; a replica in the museum
                    at Antwerp), the equestrian portrait of Albert of Arenberg (Arenberg Palace at
                    Brussels), and a portrait of the same nobleman on foot, in the black velvet
                    Spanish dress with golden chamberlain’s key (long said to be Rubens) at
                    Althorpe, the full length of Helena Fourment, Rubens’s second wife (at St
                    Petersburg), the beautiful duchess of Havre, Mary Clara de Croy, signed and
                    dated 1634 (Mr Ayscough Fawkes), and other members of the same family (at
                    Munich), Thomas of Savoy (at Berlin), an admirable half length of a lady in
                    black (in the Belvedere at Vienna), and above all the grandiose picture in which
                    John of Nassau is represented at full length, with his wife and children (at
                    Panshanger). Several portraits of Brussels and Antwerp magistrates must also· be
                    mentioned, the most important being John Van Mer-straeten, a Brussels lawyer (at
                    Cassel).</p>
                <p>After being chosen honorary president of the Antwerp guild of St Luke, Van Dyck
                    returned to London before the end of 1635. In spite of the vast number of his
                    later portraits, some of them deserve to be ranked among the most celebrated of
                    his productions. The royal children in the gallery at Turin (1635), the
                    portraits of Charles I. in the Louvre and in the National Gallery, London, the
                    picture of the Pembroke family at Wilton House, Sir George and Sir Francis
                    Villiers, and the earls of Bristol and Bedford, at Althorpe, as well as those of
                    Francis Russell, fourth earl of Bedford, and Anne Carr, his consort, at Woburn
                    Abbey (1636), all belong to the years immediately following the master’s return
                    from the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>He now married Lady Mary Ruthven, daughter of Sir Patrick Ruthven and
                    grand-daughter of the earl of Gowrie. There are several portraits of her by her
                    husband, the most important being in the Munich gallery, in which she is
                    represented in white satin, playing on the violoncello. She is also said to
                    figure as the Virgin in a picture belonging to Lord Lyttelton. There is a
                    capital engraving of her by Bolswert. In another picture, said to be Mary
                    Ruthven (belonging to Mr J. C. Herford), an exceedingly handsome lady is
                    represented as Herminia Putting on Clarinda’s Armour. There can be no doubt as
                    to the model having been Margaret Lemon, a celebrated beauty, whose portrait was
                    engraved by W. Hollar and J. Morin and painted by Van Dyck at Hampton Court.
                    “She was,” says Μ. Law, in his excellent catalogue of this gallery, “the most
                    beautiful and celebrated, though far from being the only mistress of Van Dyck.
                    The great artist, in fact, loved beauty in every form, and found the seduction
                    of female charms altogether irresistible. She lived with him at his house at
                    Blackfriars.” The precise date of Van Dyck’s marriage has not been ascertained.
                    It was probably towards the end of 1639. The union is said to have been promoted
                    by the artist’s friends in order to save him from the consequence of his
                    pernicious way of living. Margaret Lemon resented the event most cruelly, and
                    tried to maim Van Dyck’s right hand.</p>
                <p>Van Dyck found few occasions in England to paint anything but portraits. He seems
                    to have been decidedly underrated by the king and queen as an imaginative
                    painter. At the very time of his employment on the beautiful portraits of
                    Henrietta Maria, destined to serve as models for Bernini’s bust, Gerbier was
                    secretly negotiating with Jordaens, by order of Charles, for the decoration of
                    the queen’s apartments at Greenwich (1639). There exists at Belvoir Castle a
                    sketch by Van Dyck representing a <pb break="no"

                    grandiose composition, engraved by Cooper. We know from Bellori that Van Dyck
                    had suggested through his friend Sir Kenelm Digby, for the banqueting room at
                    Whitehall, a series of decorations illustrating the history of the order of the
                    Garter, and that the king had been much pleased with the idea. The plan,
                    however, failed through the excessively high price asked by the painter, and
                    perhaps also because the king had thought of having the work done in tapestry.
                    Van Dyck’s pension was five years in arrear, and, instead of £560, he received
                    finally, besides his pension, only £200.</p>
                <p>When the news of Rubens’s death reached London (June 1640) Van Dyck contemplated
                    a return to his native country, and a letter from Ferdinand of Austria to Philip
                    IV. speaks of his intended journey to Antwerp on St Luke’s Day (18th October).
                    Rubens had left unfinished a series of paintings commanded by the king of Spain,
                    and from correspondence published by Professor Justi we learn that Van Dyck had
                    been thought of to give them the finishing touch. But he absolutely refused to
                    finish them. It was then agreed that he should paint an independent canvas
                    destined to complete the series. Van Dyck was delighted with this order, and
                    Ferdinand tells his brother that he returned to London in great haste “to make
                    preparations for his change of residence; possibly,” adds the letter, “he may
                    still change his mind, for he is stark mad.” Whether Van Dyck found it possible
                    to work during his short stay in the Netherlands is a matter of doubt. In the
                    museum at The Hague are six medallion portraits of Constantine Huygens and his
                    children, dated 1640. They have till lately been ascribed to Van Dyck, but are
                    now said to be by Adrian Hannemann, a Dutchman, and one of his ablest
                    assistants. In any case they are of small importance. Most authors suppose that
                    Van Dyck’s principal object in travelling to the Continent was to be entrusted
                    with the decoration of one of the galleries of the Louvre. There may be some
                    truth in this, for Mariette speaks of a letter he saw, written by Claude Vignon,
                    the French painter, in January 1641, asking Langlois for an introduction to Van
                    Dyck, who was then in Paris. Unfortunately the great painter was thwarted in his
                    aspirations. His health was beginning to fail. After his return to London he was
                    frequently obliged to interrupt his work; and a letter written (13th August)
                    from Richmond by Lady Anne Roxburgh to Baron W. van Brederode at The Hague
                    states that the portraits of the Princess Mary had been greatly delayed through
                    Van Dyck’s illness, and that the prince’s (William II. of Orange) would be ready
                    in eight days. “As Van Dyck intends leaving England in the course of ten or
                    twelve days at latest,” she adds, “he will take the paintings himself to the
                    princess of Orange.” These portraits, now in the museum at Amsterdam, are the
                    last Van Dyck painted in England. They are considered to be inferior; and the
                    last edition of the catalogue terms them copies. But of works dated 1639 the
                    portrait of Lady Pembroke, in the gallery at Darmstadt, is a really fine
                    specimen; and to the same year belongs a full-length portrait of Arthur Goodwin
                    at Chatsworth. The twin portrait of Thomas Carew and Thomas Killigrew, in the
                    royal collection, dated 1638, is certainly most delicate, but very weak in tone
                    and slight in handling. Van Dyck sailed in September, and probably spent some
                    time with his Antwerp friends. In October he reached Paris, and succeeded in
                    obtaining some important work, when, on 16th November, he was compelled to
                    resign his commissions on account of the state of his health. Scarcely three
                    weeks later (9th December 1641) he died at his residence at Blackfriars. Van
                    Dyck was buried in old St Paul’s, where a Latin inscription was placed on his
                    tomb by Charles I.</p>
                <p>An elegy in Cowley’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> speaks, not only of the
                    painter’s talent, but of his amiable disposition. We may perhaps point to the
                    coincidence that a Mrs Cowley is in Van Dyck’s will (of 1st December) named
                    guardian of his child, Justiniana Anna, born only eight days before her father’s
                    death. The painter had in the Netherlands an illegitimate daughter, Maria
                    Theresia, who was entrusted to his sister, and to whom he bequeathed £4000. The
                    name of her mother is not known. Not long after her husband’s death Lady Van
                    Dyck became the second wife of Sir Richard Pryse of Gogerddan in Cardiganshire.
                    She was dead in 1645. Justiniana Van Dyck, who was married when scarcely twelve
                    years old to Sir John Stepney of Prendergast, was also something of an artist:
                    she painted a Crucifixion, with four angels receiving Christ’s blood in
                    chalices. A similar subject had been painted by Van Dyck, as Bellori tells us,
                    for the duke of Northumberland. After the Restoration a pension of £200 for.
                    life was granted to Justiniana Van Dyck, who died before 1690.</p>
                <p>Van Dyck is one of the most brilliant figures in the history of art. That he
                    should, in the same subjects chosen by Rubens, have attained the same degree of
                    expression was scarcely possible. Rubens was exceptional precisely through the
                    sweep and power of his imagination; but Van Dyck, applying the same principles
                    to portrait painting, was no less exceptional. Titian, Raphael, Rembrandt,
                    Velazquez, and Frans Hals are not, on the whole, superior to him in this branch.
                    They often delight us with their technical excellence or penetrating study of
                    individuality, but their conception remains entirely different from that of Van
                    Dyck. With him as with Rubens physiognomical interpretation is so intimately
                    connected with picturesque necessity that his portraits scarcely ever fail to
                    leave an indelible impression on the mind. Burnet observes that with Van Dyck
                    the union of the figure and the background seems to have been a principle, not
                    only in respect of light and shade, but also of colour. Thus the shapes of his
                    lights are extended or doubled by means of a curtain in the background, &amp;c.
                    Hence Van Dyck, quite unlike the Dutch, is not what may be termed an intimate
                    portraitist. In his eyes a prince, a warrior, a statesman, an artist belong to
                    the world and to posterity, and in the realization of this idea he attains a
                    degree of excellence seldom if ever attained before him. His works may be found
                    lacking in solidity or displaying an unnecessary amount of motion in attitude,
                    but these defects are easily compensated by a sense of proportion, an elegance
                    in outline, a variety of conception united in his best works to the most able
                    technic.</p>
                <p>Properly speaking, Van Dyck cannot be said to have formed a school. He was
                    followed to London by some of his earlier collaborators, and there soon met a
                    considerable number of others. Jan van Reyn, David Beek, Adrian Hannemann,
                    Mathew Merian, John Bockhorst (Lang Jan), Remy van Leemput, and Peter Thys were
                    foremost among foreigners, Henry Stone and William Dobson among Englishmen. To
                    their assistance the master owed much; but they are also responsible for the
                    vast number of constantly-recurring copies which go by his name. It often
                    requires a very discriminating eye to distinguish some of these copies from the
                    original paintings. Nevertheless after Van Dyck’s death many of his coadjutors
                    produced works of undeniable merit. No school more strikingly reflects the
                    influence of Van Dyck than the British school. Stone and Dobson were, properly
                    speaking, the most fortunate of his continuators; and there is little doubt that
                    such masters as Reynolds, Gainsborough, Lawrence, and Raeburn owe a large
                    measure of their superiority to their study of his works.</p>
                <p>Though Van Dyck’s reputation greatly suffered through the numerous copies he
                    allowed his pupils to take from his works, the case is otherwise with engraving:
                    Vorsterman, Pontius, Peter de Jode, P. Balliu, and S. Bolswert were seldom more
                    fortunate than when under his guidance. De Jode’s St Augustine, Bolswert’s Ecce
                    Homo and Crucifixion, Vorsterman’s Deposition, and especially Pontius’s Herman
                    Joseph rank among the masterpieces of the art of engraving. Van Dyck was himself
                    an incomparable etcher, and with the needle arrived at a degree of excellence
                    scarcely inferior to that exhibited in his paintings. Such prints as the
                    portraits of Vorsterman, John de Wael, Snyders, Josse de Momper, Adam van Noort,
                    and above all his own effigy, bear witness to his prodigious knowledge of
                    design. Print collectors pay extravagant prices for a first proof taken from the
                    plates engraved by Van Dyck himself. Mr Sackville Bale’s copy of the portrait of
                    Wawerius fetched £600. Van Dyck also employed some of the best engravers of his
                    time for the production of a gallery of illustrious heads, men and women, of
                    different countries. Whether all were taken from life is questionable. Gustavus
                    Adolphus and Wallenstein he can hardly have met. Du Breucq, the architect, he
                    never knew. But all the sketches and drawings were done by himself, and are
                    often met with in public and private galleries. The engravings are sometimes
                    very beautiful and in their first states very rare. Published successively by
                    Martin van der Enden, Giles Hendrickx, and John Meyssens, the collection
                    originally consisted of sixteen warriors and statesmen, twelve scholars, and
                    fifty-two artists. Hendrickx raised the number to ninety-nine, and used as a
