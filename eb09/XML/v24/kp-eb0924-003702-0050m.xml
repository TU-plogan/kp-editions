                    the Greek fathers, and a large proportion of the solutions given by him and his
                    followers subsequently became, though in a modified form, accepted doctrines.
                    The dogmatic of Origen lies at the foundation of the orthodox dogmatic of the
                    church, and it in its turn had its prototype in that of the Valentinian school.
                    Valentinus was the first man in Christendom who for other than merely apologetic
                    purposes sought to fuse together the results of Greek philosophy with the
                    substance of the Gospel, combined the exalted ethic of the Platonic and
                    Neopythagorean schools with the preaching of the evangelical pulpit, and treated
                    the manifestation of Jesus as the keystone in the great structure of thought
                    which Greek science had reared. His theology is, so to speak, the central pier
                    of the bridge connecting the Jewish with the Christian Alexandrians. He may
                    perhaps be regarded as superior to Philo in sober-mindedness and in acuteness,
                    and as having excelled Origen at once in delicacy of religious and moral
                    perception and in vigour of language, though he was far behind him in learning
                    and in extent of knowledge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Tertullian tells us that among all the Christian “collegia” that of Valentinus
                    was the most crowded,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    divided are evidence of the wealth of his influence. Even his enemies have
                    praised his “ingenium et eloquium” <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Valent.,</hi> 4).
                    Tertullian, Clement, Origen, Jerome, and Adamantius agree in testifying that he
                    was a man of singular gifts. The few extant fragments of his writings fully
                    confirm this: there is not one of them that is not marked by originality and
                    depth. And his disciples, although they have partly deteriorated his teachings
                    by undisciplined fancies and inappropriate mythologizing, have, every one of
                    them, something particular and valuable to say. Their influence did not cease
                    until in the catechetical school of Alexandria the church found teachers of her
                    own who were at once scientific theologians and defenders of the church of
                    orthodoxy.</p>

                    flourished under Pius (140-155), and was still there in the time of Anicetus <hi
                    rend="italic">(c.</hi> 155-166). This we learn from Irenaeus (iii. 4, 3), who
                    lets us see that his main activity was in Rome. He further tells us that
                    Polycarp during his sojourn in that city was the means of converting some
                    Valentinians. Tertullian supplements <hi rend="italic">(De Praescr.,</hi> 30)
                    Irenaeus with the information that Valentinus originally attached himself in
                    Rome to the main body of the church, but “ob inquietam semper curiositatem qua
                    fratres quoque vitiabat,” after having been twice temporarily suspended from
                    communion, he was ultimately cut off. This statement shows that the Roman Church
                    did not, to begin with, possess the standards by which to try Valentinus. The
                    sections of the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd</hi> of Hermas which treat of the
                    Gnostics represent them as still continuing to exist within the church, although
                    their dangerous character was already known. It was not, then, until the
                    bishopric of Anicetus that the Roman Church succeeded in ridding itself of the
                    Valentinian collegia. It seems very doubtful whether there is any good
                    foundation for Tertullian’s further allegation <hi rend="italic">(Adv.
                    Valent.,</hi> 4) that Valentinus was ambitious of obtaining the episcopate of
                    Rome and that his failure in this caused him to break with the church.
                    Hippolytus will have it (see Epiphanius and Philaster) that Valentinus
                    afterwards went to Cyprus as a declared heretic. We are not in a position to
                    control this statement; but the words of Irenaeus would almost lead to the
                    conclusion that he died in Rome. At any rate there is no reason to suppose that
                    he was alive much later than 160. Tertullian, in spite of a disposition to bring
                    him down to as recent a period as possible, does not seem to think of him as
                    living in the time of Marcus Aurelius. But in the school of Valentinus it was
                    asserted that their master had been a pupil of Theodas, a <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Valent.,</hi> 2) seems to imply that Valentinus was also
                    the author of a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Sophia.</hi> Perhaps this is
                    the source from which Irenaeus’s systematic account of the Valentinian doctrine
                    (i. 11, 1) was indirectly taken. Tertullian speaks of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psalms</hi> of Valentinus <hi rend="italic">(De Car.,</hi> xvii. 20); the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Muratorian Fragment</hi> seems also to refer to
                    these; and in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophumena</hi> of Hippolytus (vi. 37) a
                    considerable fragment from them is given. The “gospel” of Valentinus is spoken
                    of below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sources.—</hi> All that we possess of Valentinus and his
                    disciples are the fragments preserved by their opponents, the fathers of the
                    church. We cannot therefore put implicit confidence in all that they tell us, or
                    accept as of primary importance in the doctrine of the Valentinians all that
                    they represent as such. The extant fragments of the writings of Valentinus
                    himself, as well as of those of his scholars (Ptolemaeus, Heracleon, Theodotus,
                    and others), fortunately enable us to set their theology in a more worthy light
                    than does the fantastic “system” which Irenaeus has given. Of the four ancient
                    treatises against the Valentinians known to Tertullian we possess but one, that
                    of Irenaeus, those of Justin, Miltiades, and Proculus being lost. The loss of
                    Justin is most to be regretted, for he was a contemporary, and wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Syntagma</hi> probably in Rome at the time when Valentinus was
                    actually labouring there. In Rome some sixty years later the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Muratorian Fragment</hi> also took notice of him. Proculus wrote a
                    special polemic against him, while Miltiades wrote in the same sense in Asia
                    Minor and Irenaeus in Gaul about 180. Tertullian’s <hi rend="italic">Adversus
                    Valentinianos</hi> was composed in Carthage some twenty years later, and Clement
                    engaged in a work of a similar nature almost simultaneously at Alexandria.
                    Against the Marcionite Church the fathers were equally energetic, Marcion and
                    Valentinus during the period between 150 and 230 passing for the most dangerous
                    heretics. Our oldest and at the same time fullest source is the work of
                    Irenaeus, which rests upon a tract of Ptolemaeus and probably makes use of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Valentinus himself. Tertullian’s <hi rend="italic">Adversus Valentinianos</hi>
                    is largely taken from Irenaeus, but contains some things that are original and
                    of very great value: he had either himself read some Valentinian works, or had
                    at least obtained authentic information as to their contents. Our best sources
                    for Valentinus himself are the <hi rend="italic">Stromata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eclogues of</hi> Clement of Alexandria, who had read much of
                    Valentinus and something of Heracleon, and gives extracts from both. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Excerpta ex Theodoto</hi> are also invaluable. Hippolytus in both
                    his works against heretics has transcribed Irenaeus; yet in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophumena</hi> he has followed a new source in describing the
                    Valentinian system. Origen made a careful study of Heracleon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary on John's Gospel,</hi> and in his own <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentary</hi> he frequently refers to it both approvingly and otherwise. The
                    numerous fragments he has preserved have very great value for the historian.
                    Lastly, Irenaeus and Hippolytus have been transcribed by Epiphanius, who also
                    has preserved various matters of importance, particularly the letter of
                    Ptolemaeus to Flora.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Valentinians.—</hi> The school of Valentinus soon divided into

                    vi. 35; Tert., <hi rend="italic">Adv. Valent.,</hi> 4.</p></note> Both in turn
                    subdivided into various sections; but the Asiatic branch on the whole preserved
                    most faithfully the teaching of the master. His influence spread even beyond the
                    limits of the schools. Tatian, for example, in his later period indubitably
                    derived much from Valentinus, and the fathers of the Alexandrian school were
                    very largely indebted to him. Even in the time of Epiphanius Valentinians still
                    existed in some districts of Egypt. The Italian branch had as heads of its
                    schools Secundus, another master of uncertain name (Colarbasus? Epiphanius? see
                    Iren., i. 11, 3), Ptolemaeus, Heracleon, Theotimus, and Alexander. Secundus
                    modified the master’s doctrine of the aeons and introduced a dualism into it.
                    The anonymous scholar shows tokens of Pythagorean influence. But the most
                    important, exceeding in the extent of their influence even the master himself,
                    were Ptolemaeus and Heracleon. The former made into hypostases the aeons which
                    Valentinus himself had regarded as impersonal powers of the one Godhead. He is
                    the systematic and Biblical theologian <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of
                    the Valentinian school, conspicuous for a powerful if also undisciplined
                    phantasy; and in his letter to Flora he shows how thorough has been his study of
                    the</p>
                <p>Old Testament, and how penetrating, how carefully considered, and how pointed his
                    criticism of it. Heracleon, mentioned also by Irenaeus, earned distinction by
                    his <hi rend="italic">Commentary (υπομνήματα) on the Gospel according to
                    John,</hi> for it is probably the first scientific commentary that Christendom
                    produced. Clement <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> iv. 9, 73) calls him the most
                    eminent teacher of the Valentinian school. He appears to have shown much greater
                    sobriety than Ptolemaeus, whose speculations recall those of the later
                    Neoplatonists in a most striking manner, just as we find Valentinianism
                    generally to have anticipated, not only the later scientific theology of the
                    Catholic Church, but also Neoplatonism. Of Theotimus all that we know is
                    Tertullian’s remark <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Valent.,</hi> 4): “multum circa
                    imagines legis operatus est.” Tertullian is also our sole informant about
                    Alexander <hi rend="italic">(De Came,</hi> 17-20). He seems to have busied
                    himself specially with the Christological problem, and to have written under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Syllogismi</hi> a treatise into which quotations from
                    Valentinus’s <hi rend="italic">Psalms</hi> were introduced as authorities.</p>
                <p>The names mentioned as those of leaders of the Asiatic school are Axionicus,

                    disciple. Clement of Alexandria has preserved excerpts of a very inconsecutive
                    character and in a very corrupt text from a systematic work, and some
                    commentaries of Theodotus (Έκ <hi rend="italic">τῶv ϴϵoδότoυ κaί τής άνατ ολικής
                    καλουμένης διδασκαλίας κατά τούς Oύαλεvτίvoυ χρόνους έπιτoμaι).</hi> These
                    excerpts, which constitute one of the most important sources for Gnosticism
                    generally, have not hitherto received the attention they deserve. Zahn <hi
                    rend="italic">(Forschungen,</hi> iii. p. 123 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> has
                    tried to make out that Theodotus is identical with Theodas, Valentinus’s master.
                    But from the excerpts it seems hardly probable that they should be the work of a
                    man who must have written at latest under the emperor Trajan. Bardesanes, though
                    originally influenced by Valentinus, ultimately took up peculiar and independent
                    ground of his own, and through him Valentinus exercised a great influence upon
                    the Syrian Church, which continued until the 4th century (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Syriac Literature,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 827). In Asia Minor the
                    Valentinian collegia continued until past the middle of the 4th century (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Epp. Juliani).</hi> The church fathers bring into connexion with
                    Valentinus the Magian Marcus, as to whose doctrine we are very adequately
                    informed by Irenaeus, but it is questionable whether he can really be reckoned
                    as one of the disciples of that master.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Teaching of Valentinus.—</hi> Valentinus made his appearance at
                    a time when the Christian communities were still destitute of any fixed
                    doctrinal system: they were still associations pledged to a holy life on the
                    ground of their faith in the one spiritual God and in His Son Jesus Christ,
                    closely held together by the bonds of brotherly love, and strictly separated
                    from the world and from them that are without by the consciousness of having
                    received the Holy Ghost. But an enormous volume of facts, of sayings, and of
                    thoughts had by this time become current within the church, material drawn from
                    the Old Testament, from the Gospel history, from the Pauline epistles, from
                    other early Christian writings, and from the Hellenistic and apocalyptic
                    literature of the Jews. How this material was to be arranged, how it was to be
                    kept within bounds, and with what degree of authority it was to be invested were
                    questions still unsettled. But one thing was certain—Paul had declared it, and
                    every Christian apostle, prophet, and teacher had repeated it—that the Christian
                    faith guaranteed knowledge supreme and complete, and led on from truth to truth.
                    Another thing was sure—that all human wisdom was but folly in presence of this
                    new “divine” wisdom, which was inclusive of all human knowledge. The means,
                    moreover, by which every saying, every fact was to be turned into a profound
                    thought had for long been known and in use in the Christian communities,—that of
                    allegory. But as yet there was no settled principle fixing the manner in which
                    the allegorical method was to be applied, or determining what were the ruling
                    thoughts of Scripture. The attitude of Christian teachers towards the Jewish
                    wisdom was as indeterminate as it was towards Greek philosophy. The Pauline
                    theology was intelligible only to a very few, and the Old Testament was as it
                    were a veritable sphinx. It was understood to be a superhuman book, but it was
                    also understood that much of its contents, if taken literally, was valueless. In
                    what sense was it to be understood? How much of it was to be taken literally and
                    how much spiritually? Was everything to be taken spiritually? According to what
                    principle was it on this assumption to be interpreted? Was the whole of it the
                    revealed word of the Most High, or were various authors to be recognized? Might
                    it possibly be that part of it was divine, part heroical, part genial, part
                    natural, part false, and part devilish? Or was it perhaps true that no part of
                    the book proceeded from the Most High God, that nothing was pneumatic, but all
                    psychical or carnal? And, if the Old Testament was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n52/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0052-0039"/> to be allegorized, must not the narratives and
                    the sayings of the Gospels be also treated in the same way? Was not allegory
                    here also the pathway to the thought? If the opening chapters of Genesis and the
                    histories of the patriarchs and of the people of Israel were a profound
                    philosophical poem, why should not also the life of Jesus Christ be only the
                    veil of a cosmic mystery? All these questions had within the period from 60 to
                    130 exercised, not indeed the great mass of believers, for these were
                    uneducated, but thinking Christians; and the more the Christian preaching
                    enlarged its scope, the more Christians came into contact with Syrian,
                    Samaritan, Egyptian, and Greek wisdom, and the more they found themselves called
                    upon to make comparisons and to bring into clearness that which is peculiar to
                    and distinctive of Christianity, it was inevitable that these questions should
                    stir the minds of educated Christians all the more intensely. Upon the one basis
                    of faith in Jesus Christ accordingly there were about the year 130 a great
                    variety of groups, differing from one another in doctrine, worship,
                    organization, and the like,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Harnack, <hi rend="italic">Dogmengesch.,</hi> i. p. 171 <hi
                    rend="italic">sg.</hi></p></note> but differing also in their attitude to
                    Christianity at large, some keeping themselves aloof from it because they
                    regarded it as wholly perverted, others being driven out from it, others again,
                    while remaining within the main body, yet forming special schools, or " mystery”
                    unions, and so on. In Syria, as also in other portions of the Roman empire, the
                    gospel was associated with Semitic “cultus wisdom” and with the abstruse
                    speculations of a physical science still in its childhood; the entire Old
                    Testament was rejected and an attitude of opposition assumed towards
                    fellow-members in the great Christian union.</p>
                <p>These developments, however, could reckon on only a relatively small degree of
                    encouragement within the Graeco-Roman world. The barbaric elements they
                    contained were too conspicuous, and on the other hand they were too far removed
                    from Jewish-Christian tradition and from Christian common sense. But the
                    attractiveness must have been very great when, on the basis of Christian
                    tradition and the mysterious traditions of Oriental peoples, a system was set up
                    with the aids of Greek philosophical science for a school of “knowing ones” or
                    “Gnostics,” and a cultus organized for a community of the “initiated.” This was
                    what Basilides and Valentinus achieved. The importance of Valentinus lies in the
                    facts, firstly, that he recognized the relationship (for such a relationship
                    really existed) between the theogonic-cosmogonic myth-wisdom of western Asia and
                    the Neopythagorean, Platonic, and Philonic philosophy; secondly, that he touched
                    all this rich and varied material which he had appropriated with the magic wand
                    of the Platonic conception of the universe, and thus transmuted the whole into
                    entities of a purely spiritual character; and thirdly, that he gave a decisive
                    part to the appearance of Jesus Christ in that great drama which the history of
                    the higher and the lower cosmos presented to his mind. In all this he had no
                    design of setting up a new “confession,” and still less any notion (as Marcion
                    had) of utterly remodelling Christianity. He was prevented from cherishing any
                    such ideas by his conviction that men were divided by the inalterable
                    constitution of their natures into three classes,—the “pneumatic,” men of the
                    spirit, genial natures, in whom sparks of the divinity are found; the
                    “psychical,” moral men, who can if they choose be ethically good; and " hylic
                    <hi rend="italic">” or</hi> carnal, hopelessly chained to that which is
                    perceived by the senses. The ordinary members of Christendom at large he held to
                    be “psychical,” and esteemed them as such. But he did not regard their
                    Christianity as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Christianity, rather only as its
                    exoteric form. Alongside of the exoteric there had all along, according to him,
                    existed an esoteric. The apostles did not say out everything to everybody, but
                    on the contrary communicated to the “spiritual ones” a secret doctrine into
                    which only select persons might be initiated, and that not until after long and
                    careful probation. This secret teaching included a special dogmatic, a special
                    ethic, and a special worship. But it was not out of all connexion with the
                    Christianity that was publicly taught. We can observe in the history of the
                    Valentinian schools the zeal with which they strove to adapt themselves to the
                    Christianity publicly professed, and to follow it in all its developments. The
                    Valentinians always, so far as they possibly could, accepted such things as the
                    development of the canon (agitated for by themselves) within the church at
                    large, the building up of a tradition, the symbols framed, and the like; to this
                    Irenaeus, Tertullian, and the Alexandrians all bear witness. In this they
                    present the strongest possible contrast to Marcion and his church, who from the
                    outset took up an attitude of the utmost hostility to the main body of
                    Christians. Hence they expressly even controverted Marcionitism, as the letter
                    of Ptolemaeus to Flora and the polemic of Bardesanes against the Marcionite
                    Prepon show. If such was the unvarying attitude of Valentinus’s scholars, it is
                    fair to attribute it also to Valentinus himself. In his day indeed the dogmatic,
                    ethical, and legal advances of Christendom at large were still in their most
                    rudimentary stage, but what there was of them must have been valued by him even
                    then as the exoteric form of Christianity, to which he superadded his own
                    Gnostic esoteric form. In this respect he was the forerunner of Clement and
                    Origen, who likewise distinguish Gnostic from common Christianity, and very
                    probably learned the distinction from Valentinus and his scholars. But his
                    connexion with both was of a still more intimate character. They are related not
                    only by virtue of the fact that they all regarded the gospel as the religion of
                    the perfect Hellenically - cultured spiritual man, but also by the large-hearted
                    disposition they cherished, and the settled purpose they manifested, to
                    appropriate everything noble and great in the history of humanity, to rank it
                    according to its proper value, and to find a place for it in the edifice of
                    Christian philosophy. And it is very interesting to notice that they completely
                    set aside the Greek and Roman mythologies, regarding them as worthless and
                    devilish. The formal peculiarity of the Valentinian Gnosis is that it places all
                    moral and intellectual ideas, possessions, and entities in a descending scheme
                    of genetic development. With Valentinus himself they figure as “motus et
                    affectus” of the Godhead, the ultimate cause of all things, the alone Good; by
                    his scholars they are hypostatized. This descending development
                    (self-revelation) of the Godhead takes place with a holy rhythm. At this point
                    the Pythagorean speculations about numbers on the one hand and the ancient
                    Semitic astrological wisdom on the other seemed important to Valentinus; but
                    everything is made spiritual: even the old Semitic antithesis of “male” and
                    “female” is adopted, but with an altered meaning.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The earliest opponents of the Valentinians
                    distinguished them sharply from the “Gnostics.” They rightly perceived that the
                    Semitic and mythological element was for the Valentinians merely the material,
                    which they filled with the spirit of Hellenism. Some of the heads of schools,
                    however, dealt with this material in a highly fantastic fashion, and accordingly
                    the church fathers say with justice that “inolescentes doctrinae Valentinianorum
                    in silvas jam exoleverunt Gnosticorum” (Tert., <hi rend="italic">Adv.
                    Valent.,</hi> 39).</p></note> The whole inner development of the primal cause
                    (<hi rend="italic">βύθoς)</hi> into the pleroma, the cosmos of perfection, is
                    designed to explain how it was that this world of appearance, of mixture, and of
                    sin arose. Valentinus was a strict monotheist, but at the same time he discerned
                    in the present world the mingling of irreconcilable elements. The problem then
                    was how, while acknowledging the absolute perfection, goodness, and causality of
                    God, to reconcile with this the existence of the actual
                    pneumatico-psychico-hylic world, and at the same time to show the possibility of
                    redemption in the case of those who are capable of it. Valentinus solved this
                    problem by assuming that the self-unfolding of the Godhead is at the same time
                    to be thought of as a dissipation of energy. God alone is <hi rend="italic"

                    thirtieth and last aeon, Sophia,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The number 30 comes from astronomy: at bottom the aeons of
                    Valentinus are 29 ½, the number of days in the lunar month.</p></note> has the
                    element of imperfection in the strongest degree. This belongs to it in the form
                    of “passion” (<hi rend="italic">πάθoς</hi>), the passionate desire after full
                    knowledge of and fusion with the primal God. This passion for the pleroma,
                    having seduced the aeon into overstepping its proper bounds, is accordingly
                    separated from it and removed out of oneness with it; it thus falls into
                    nothingness, the <hi rend="italic">κέvωμα,</hi> but gives the impulse to the
                    making of this world. This world is the outward shaping of nothingness, of
                    appearance, through connexion with the fallen wisdom. It is a feeble copy of the
                    pleroma without any abiding hold, but it includes pneumatic portions, though
                    these have fallen very low. It was fashioned by the demiurge, an intermediate
                    being brought forth by the fallen wisdom. The demiurge is psychical, and thus
                    has no feeling and no understanding for the pneumatic which adhered to the
                    elements of the world he framed. But over against the sensuous powers included
                    in this world, so far as it is derived from nothingness, the demiurge is the
                    representative of order, righteousness, freedom for better things, and the men
                    who have received something of his spirit are those earnest moral natures who
                    strive against their passions and aim at <hi rend="italic">justitia
                    civilis.</hi> Far above these stand the pneumatic ones, who, like their mother,
                    have the strong passion of genius towards that which is highest, and in this
                    possession, in knowledge and in the desire for knowledge, are raised far above
                    the antithesis of the hylic (the devil) and the psychic (the demiurge). They
                    carry within them an indestructible and divine element which is unintelligible
                    to their very maker, but they are placed in a world which is foreign to them;
                    they are as men imprisoned and fettered. Here it is that the Christian idea of
                    redemption comes in. Jesus Christ appears. The declarations about Him in the
                    Valentinian school were exceedingly various. We can find traces in them of all
                    the contemporary and later Christologies of the Christian Church, even of the
                    Adoptian. What they all had in common was (1) the idea that Jesus Christ made
                    manifest was an exceedingly complex Being, in whom two or three natures, or even
                    a greater number, had to be distinguished (compare Origen’s Christology); (2)
                    the conviction that the highest element in the Redeemer was not one of the aeons
                    which had somehow parted with some of its potential energy, but was the perfect
                    self-manifestation of the Good, the Supreme God Himself; (3) the conception that
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n53/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0053-0040"/> the physical nature of Jesus Christ was no actual
                    corporeity, but either something psychical or something pneumatical. This Jesus
                    Christ then delivers all who are pneumatic in the world by communicating
                    knowledge. By full knowledge of God, of the world, and of themselves they are
                    raised above the world, enter upon their undying divine life, and finally are
                    brought by Christ into the pleroma. But psychical persons also are redeemed by
                    Him. They who hitherto have been brought up according to the laws of the Old
                    Testament, that is, of the demiurge, now receive the perfect law; Jesus moreover
                    by His death procured for them the forgiveness of sins. They are now therefore
                    in a position to lead a perfect moral life, and after death, if they have made a
                    right use of their freedom, shall be brought to an abode of bliss. The
                    Valentinian ethic shows a fine combination of spiritual freedom with the element
                    of asceticism. Their thesis, that primarily it is not the outward act but the
                    intention that is important, was misunderstood by the fathers of the church as
                    if they had given permission to pneumatic persons to live in licence, to deny
                    the faith under persecution, and the like. But there is no foundation for this.
                    The fragments we possess from writings of Valentinus and his school show rather
                    that they were second to no Christian body in moral earnestness. The
                    Valentinians appear to have joined in the religious worship of the main body of
                    the church so long as they were tolerated within it. But along with this they
                    celebrated their own mysteries, in which only the initiated might take part.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing sketch only the broad general outlines of the Valentinian
                    theology have been indicated. In all the schools, and even with Valentinus
                    himself, it was much richer and more complicated than has been indicated. But
                    all was strictly wrought out, and even the apparently abstruse served always for
                    the expression of a weighty thought. Very manifold and various were in
                    particular the doctrines about the fallen wisdom (Sophia) and about its
                    relations to the world and the demiurge; very various also were the views of
                    Jesus and of Christ and of their relation to the pleroma of the aeons. Finally
                    their representations about “Horos” differed widely. “As a harlot daily changes
                    her attire,” says Tertullian in his malicious way, “so do the Valentinians
                    change their opinions.” But none of these differences affected the oneness of
                    the general view. That the history of redemption constitutes along with the
                    history of nature and of the world one grand drama, that it is for scientific
                    cosmology to explain how it is that the “mixtures” have come to pass, and that
                    it is for scientific soteriology to show how the “separations” have been brought
                    about, as to these matters all were at one. Equally were they at one in their
                    view of Christ as the absolute revelation of God, and in the persuasion that the
                    creator of the world is identical with the God of the Old Testament, and is an
                    “intermediate” Being. But the various Valentinian schools were above all united
                    in their attitude towards the Scriptures. They were Biblical theologians: that
                    is to say, they started from the conviction that complete wisdom lay only in the
                    words of Jesus Christ, or, in other words, in the Gospels. They accordingly
                    sought to base their systems throughout on the words of the Lord, applying to
                    these the allegorical method. In a secondary degree they availed themselves also
                    of the writings of the apostles. Their dogmatic claimed—as afterwards did that
                    of Origen—to be evangelical and apostolic; but, since they interpreted the New
                    Testament after the same method as that which Philo applied to the Old, it was
                    as a rule Platonic thought that they introduced into the plain and simple words
                    of Jesus, and thus the fathers of the church were not without justification in
                    calling them “sectatores Platonis” (Tert., <hi rend="italic">De Praescr.,</hi>
                    30). As their method of exegesis supplied them with the means of everywhere
                    finding the sense that suited them, it is highly improbable that they were at
                    the trouble to prepare any new scriptures. The fathers do not as a rule charge
                    them with either fabrication or falsification, but only with perversion of the
                    Word through wrong interpretations. Nor did they dispute or reject the Roman
                    creed; they simply, by a peculiar interpretation, put their own meaning upon it;
                    yet at the same time they had alongside of it their own “regula fidei.” It is
                    hardly probable that they possessed an “evangelium veritatis” of their own, but
                    it is not impossible. They subjected the Old Testament to an admirable religious
                    criticism. Ptolemaeus distinguished in the law (1) what the demiurge had said,
                    (2) what came from Moses, (3) what the later teachers of the law had added.
                    Amongst those portions which were regarded as having proceeded from the demiurge
                    himself, he again distinguished three groups :—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                    Decalogue, which is of perpetual obligation, and which only required to be
                    completed by Christ (in the sermon on the mount); (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                    those commands which were given only for a season on account of the shortcomings
                    of the people, and which were abolished by Christ; (c) the ceremonial law, which
                    had a typical meaning that was fulfilled by Christ. They denied that anything in
                    the Old Testament came from the supreme God, the God of goodness and love.</p>
                <p>From the fragments of Valentinus and of Heracleon and Theodotus the student can
                    learn how these Valentinians anticipated the ecclesiastical speculations of
                    subsequent centuries. The following points may be mentioned in this
                    connexion:—(1) the speculation as to <hi rend="italic">όμοούσιος, ὅμoιoς,
                    έτερούσιος, άγέvvητos,</hi> and γε <hi rend="italic">vvητόs,</hi> by which they
                    prepared the way for the Unitarian problem in its scientific shape; (2) their
                    speculation about “Jesus” and “Christ” and about His various natures, by which
                    they opened the way for later Christology; (3) their scientific allegorical
                    treatment of the New Testament Scriptures and their undertaking to found their
                    whole system upon the sacred writings of Christianity, thus anticipating
                    Origen’s dogmatic; (4) their distinction of the perficienda, abroganda, and
                    implenda in the Old Testament, which paved the way for the doctrine of Irenaeus
                    and Tertullian in reference to the law; (5) their doctrine of baptism; (6) their
                    doctrine of the Lord’s Supper; (7) their doctrine of purification after death,
                    in which they anticipated the later dogma of purgatory (Origen, Augustine,
                    Gregory I.); (8) their twofold ethic (for psychical and for pneumatic persons;
                    see Clement and Origen, as also the monachism of the Catholic Church); (9) and
                    finally the view destined later to play so large a part within the church, that
                    the soul of the Christian Gnostic is the bride of Christ.</p>
