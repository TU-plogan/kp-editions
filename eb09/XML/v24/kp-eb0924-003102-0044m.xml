                    Maurice, together with some villages south of the Simplon Pass, and Monthey, Val
                    d’Illiez, and Bouveret beyond St Maurice, on the left bank of the river. The
                    total area of the canton is 2026∙3 square miles, which is exceeded only by that
                    of Grisons (Graubünden) and of Bern. Of this 930∙4 square miles are classed as
                    productive, forests covering 243∙2 and vineyards 9; of the remainder 375∙1
                    square miles consist of snow and ice. The highest point of the canton is Monte
                    Rosa (15,217 feet), and within its borders rises the Dorn (14,942 feet), the
                    loftiest peak entirely in Swiss territory. The population in 1880 was 100,216
                    (males predominating), an increase of 3329 since 1870. French is the native
                    tongue of 67,214 and German of 31,962, the former dwelling (roughly speaking)
                    west and the latter east of a line drawn north and south across the valley of
                    the Rhone between Sierre and Leuk. The bulk (99,316) of the inhabitants are
                    staunch Roman Catholics. The canton forms the diocese of Sion (founded in 4th
                    century), which before 1513 was in the ecclesiastical province of
                    Moutiers-en-Tarentaise (Savoy), and since then has been immediately dependent on
                    the pope. In the canton there are three famous houses of Austin canons
                    regular—St Maurice (founded as a Benedictine monastery, as distinct from the
                    see, in 515 by Sigismund of Burgundy), the hospice on the Great St Bernard
                    (first mentioned in 1125), and that on the Simplon Pass (first mentioned in
                    1235). Ecclesiastical affairs are managed without any control or interference on
                    the part of the state, though the cantonal legislative assembly selects as
                    bishop one of four candidates nominated by the chapter of Sion. The only town of
                    any size is the capital, Sion or Sitten (4871 inhabitants in 1880). The
                    population are mainly engaged in agricultural pursuits, and great efforts have
                    been made to improve matters lately, while the Rhone has been embanked to
                    prevent disastrous floods. Much wine <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Muscat and
                    Vin du Glacier) and a vast quantity of grapes are exported. Education is
                    compulsory and free, but very backward. A railway runs from Brieg to Bouveret.
                    The mineral waters of Leukerbad and Saxon are well known, and in summer the
                    canton is a favourite haunt of tourists.</p>
                <p>The Vallis Poenina was won by the Romans after a great fight at Octodurus
                    (Martigny) in 57 B.C., and was so thoroughly Romanized that the Celtic
                    aboriginal inhabitants and the Teutonic Burgundian invaders (5th cent.) became
                    Romance-speaking peoples. According to a tradition which can be traced back to
                    the middle of the 8th century, the “Theban legion” was martyred at St Maurice
                    about 285. Valais formed part of the kingdom of Transjurane Burgundy (888),
                    which fell to the empire in 1032, and later of the duchy of Burgundia Minor,
                    which was held from the emperors by the house of Zäringen (extinct 1218). In 999
                    Rudolph III. of Burgundy gave all temporal rights and privileges to the bishop
                    of Sion, who was later styled “praefect and count of the Valais,” and is still a
                    prince of the Holy Roman empire; the pretended donation of Charlemagne is not
                    genuine. The bishops had much to do in keeping back the Zäringen, and later the
                    counts of Savoy. The latter, however, succeeded in winning most of the land west
                    of Sion, while in the upper part of the valley there were many feudal lords
                    (such as the lords of Raron and the counts of Visp). About the middle of the
                    13th century we find independent communities or " tithings” (“dizains” or
                    “zehnten ”) growing up. In the same century the upper part of the valley was
                    colonized by Germans from Hasli (Bern), who thoroughly Teutonized it, though
                    many Romance local names still remain. In 1354 the liberties of the seven
                    “tithings” (Sion, Sierre, Leuk, Raron, Visp, Brieg, and Conches) were confirmed
                    by the emperor Charles IV. A little later the influence of Savoy became
                    predominant, and the count secured to his family the bishopric of Sion, of which
                    he was already the suzerain. His progress was resisted by the tithings, which in
                    1388 utterly defeated the forces of the bishop, the count, and the nobles at
                    Visp, this being a victory of the Teutonic over the Romance element in the land.
                    From 1384 the Morge stream (a little below Sion) was recognized as the boundary
                    between Savoyard or Lower Valais and episcopal or Upper Valais. For the
                    connexion of the latter with the Val d’Ossola, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Switzerland,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 785. By the election of Walther von Supersax of
                    Conches as bishop in 1457 the Teutonic element finally won the supremacy. On the
                    outbreak<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0045-0032"/> of the Burgundian War the bishop of Sion and the
                    tithings made a treaty with Bern. In November of the same year (1475) they
                    seized all Lower Valais up to Martigny, and in 1476 (March), after the victory
                    of Granson, won St Maurice, Evian, Thonon, and Monthey. The last three districts
                    were given up in 1477, but won again in 1536, though finally by the treaty of
                    1569 Monthey, Val d’Illiez, and Bouveret alone were permanently annexed to
                    Valais. These conquered districts (or Lower Valais) were always ruled as subject
                    lands by the bishop and tithings of Upper Valais. In 1533 a close alliance was
                    made with the Catholic cantons; but by 1551 the Protestants had won so much
                    ground that toleration was proclaimed by the local assembly. In 1586 Upper
                    Valais became a member of the Golden League, and finally in 1603-4 the four
                    tithings of Conches, Brieg, Visp, and Raron carried the day in favour of the old
                    faith against those of Leuk, Sierre, and Sion. In 1790-91 Lower Valais rose in
                    revolt; but it was not finally freed till 1798, when the whole of Valais became
                    part of the Rhodanic, and then one of the cantons of the Helvetic, Republic.
                    Such prolonged and fierce resistance was, however, offered to French rule by the
                    inhabitants that in 1802 Bonaparte declared Valais an independent republic, yet
                    in 1810, for strategic reasons, he incorporated it with France as the
                    “department of the Simplon,” and it was not freed till the Austrians came in
                    1813. In 1815 a local assembly was created, in which each of the seven tithings
                    of Upper and each of the six of Lower Valais (though the latter had nearly
                    double the population of the former) elected four members, the bishop being
                    given four votes. In 1832 Valais joined the League of Sarnen to maintain the
                    Federal Pact of 1815. In 1838-40 it was convulsed by a struggle between the
                    Conservative and Radical parties, the split into two half cantons being only
                    prevented by the arrival of Federal troops. The constitution was revised in 1839
                    and 1844; the local assembly was to be elected according to population, and the
                    bishop was given a seat instead of his four votes. In 1843 Valais was one of the
                    Sonderbund, and in 1844 civil war raged, many Liberals being slain at the bridge
                    of Trient (May 1844). The introduction of the Jesuits embittered matters, and
                    Valais was the last canton to submit in the Sonderbund War (1847); it contented
                    itself, however, with voting steadily against the acceptance of the Federal
                    constitutions of 1848 and 1874. By the constitution of 1847 all ecclesiastical
                    immunities were swept away, and the bishop lost his seat in the assembly. That
                    constitution was revised in 1852, and the present one is dated 1875. There is
                    now a legislative assembly of 101 members, elected for four years by all male
                    citizens of twenty years, in the proportion of one member to 1000 inhabitants,
                    and an executive council of five members, holding office for four years, and
                    chosen by the legislative assembly, though in a certain proportion to the
                    different districts of the canton (two for the upper part, one for Sion, two for
                    the lower part). The “financial referendum” exists, by which when a capital
                    expenditure of £2400, or an annual one of £800 for three years, is to be
                    incurred, or it is proposed to raise the property tax higher than 1½ per cent.,
                    the proposal must be submitted to and approved by a popular vote.</p>
