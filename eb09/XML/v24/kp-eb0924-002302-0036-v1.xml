                    a cow), the name given in France to the Jennerian practice of cowpoxing, shortly
                    after the practice began in England (1799). The procedure was based almost
                    exactly on the earlier practice of inoculating the smallpox, the matter being
                    inserted under the skin of the arm by a lancet point; also the continuance of
                    the same stock from arm to arm through a series of cases was an idea taken from
                    some of the more adroit variolators. To replace smallpox inoculation by cowpox
                    inoculation under certain specified circumstances was Jenner’s tentative
                    project. The history of the introduction of cowpoxing, given in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Jenner</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 623), is here supplemented from
                    the point of view of historical criticism.</p>
                <p>It is right to say that the views expressed in the present article diverge in
                    many points from the opinions generally received among medical men, and must be
                    regarded not as the exposition of established and undisputed doctrine, but as
                    the outcome of an independent and laborious research.</p>
                <p>Jenner’s originality consisted in boldly designating cowpox as <hi rend="italic"
                        >variolae vaccinae</hi> or smallpox of the cow, and in tracing cowpox itself
                    back to the grease of the horse’s hocks. The latter contention was at length set
                    aside by practical men as a crude fancy; the former designation is just as
                    arbitrary and untenable. It was elaborately shown by Pearson in 1802, and has
                    often been confirmed by subsequent writers, that the vesicle of inoculated
                    cowpox, even while it remains a vesicle, is quite unlike a single pustule of
                    smallpox. But it is only for the vesicular stage of cowpox that there is even an
                    allegation of likeness to variola; the vesicle of natural or unmodified cowpox
                    is only the stage of the disease before it becomes an ulcer, either inflammatory
                    or indurated. Inoculated horse grease has the same vesicular stage; and so also
                    has the venereal pox when it is inoculated experimentally on the skin.<note

                <p>Jenner’s originality in starting vaccination in practice is for the most part
                    misunderstood. When he published his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry</hi> in June
                    1798, he had twice succeeded in raising vaccine vesicles by experiment,—the
                    first time in 1796 with matter from a milker’s accidental sore, and the second
                    time in March 1798 with matter direct from the cow. The first experiment was not
                    carried beyond one remove from the cow; the second was carried to the fifth
                    remove, when the succession failed. A third experiment, in the summer of 1798,
                    failed from the outset; and his fourth and last experiment, in November-December
                    1798, led to nothing but extensive phagedenic ulceration in two cases out of six
                    vaccinated.</p>

                <p>In this posture of affairs Woodville of the inoculation hospital, London,
                    succeeded in January 1799 in starting a succession of arm-to-arm vaccinations
                    from a London cow, which were exceptionally free from the ulcerative
                    termination. From that source Jenner himself was supplied with lymph in
                    February, while more than two hundred practitioners both at home and abroad were
                    supplied some three weeks later. There was a quarrel with Woodville in due
                    course, and an attempt to set up an authentic Jennerian lymph independent of the
                    London stock. But the merits of this claim (which otherwise rests on the vague
                    evidence of Marshall) may be judged of by the fact that Ring’s application to
                    Jenner in September 1799 for genuine lymph was answered by the latter with a
                    supply of matter which was none other than Woodville’s own stock, after six
                    months’ use in the country. Woodville’s stock was used all over the world down
                    to 1836. By that time there were numerous complaints that the lymph was
                    degenerating, and a widespread feeling that it was necessary to “go back to the
                    cow.” Apart from the numerous original cases of cowpox alleged to have been
                    found in Würtemberg, the first new authentic source was the Passy cow of 1836.
                    From the accidental vesicles on the milker’s hand Bousquet, the director of
                    vaccination in Paris, started a new stock, which partly superseded Woodville’s
                    lymph hitherto in use in France. In 1838 Estlin of Bristol, after several years’
                    vain endeavours, heard of original cowpox in Jenner’s own parish of Berkeley
                    (Gloucestershire), where the disease was so far forgotten that the milkers were
                    for several days unaware that the vesicles on their hands had been contracted
                    from cows. Estlin’s new geniture is one of the most fully recorded in the
                    history of vaccination. In the same year, and the two following years (1838-41),
                    Ceely of Aylesbury found some half-dozen distinct occurrences of cowpox in the
                    dairy-farms of his district, and cultivated lymph from them. His account of the
                    natural history of cowpox in the cow, and of the effects of primary lymph when
                    inoculated on the human arm, is by far the most comprehensive and candid that
                    has ever been given; without it we should hardly have understood the real nature
                    of cowpox. Bousquet, Estlin, and Ceely are the chief writers who have
                    authentically described the establishment of new stocks of cowpox lymph since
                    Woodville’s original report of 1799. There are numerous other references, less
                    detailed, to original cowpox in the cow, and to vaccinations therefrom, in
                    England, on the Continent, and in the United States; some of these came to light
                    in the inquiry of the Epidemiological Society in 1852. One of the best-known
                    cases of comparatively recent times is the Beaugency cow of 1866, which has been
                    the source of much of the calf-lymph of the Dutch, Belgian, and other vaccine
                    “farms.” Another French case occurred in the Gironde in November 1881, and is
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> of the Academy of Medicine (p.
                    17, 1882). In England the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Veterinarian</hi>
                    inserted a notice in the number for August 1879, making a request to their
                    readers for lymph “from vesicles on the teats of cows in cases of so-called
                    natural cowpox.” The only answer to it hitherto has been an intimation in June
                    1880 that there was a case of cowpox at Halstead in Essex, which was visited by
                    Ceely and others and pronounced by the former to be of the nature of eczema. In
                    18/6 the disease was found at a farm near Reykjavik in Iceland, where it had
                    never been seen before; it was of the old type, producing sores on the milkers’
                    hands, and causing much alarm by its unfamiliar character.<note anchored="true"

                            still occurs, but is now hardly recognized as such. The inquiry into an
                            outbreak of scarlet fever in December 1885, traced to a dairy at Hendon
                            (Middlesex), elicited the fact that the inculpated cows, as well as
                            seventy or eighty at two other farms, were affected with what the
                            dairymen called “cowpox” (see Cameron, <hi rend="italic">Trans</hi>. <hi
                                rend="italic">Epid. Soc.,</hi> April 1886). A similar outbreak in
                            November 1887, involving 160 cows and 7 milkers at four farms in
                            Wiltshire, was clearly proved by Crookshank to be the historical cowpox
                            of Jenner and Ceely, by the evidence of identity in the sores on the
                            cows’ teats and in the sores or vesicles on the milkers’ hands or faces,
                            and by the production of correct vaccine vesicles in calves inoculated
                            with lymph from a vesicle on the face of a milker (<hi rend="italic"

                <p>The so-called calf lymph is as remote from the cow as ordinary humanized lymph;
                    it differs from the latter merely in the circumstance that the calf (on its
                    shaven belly) becomes the vaccinifer, instead of the child, and that the cycle
                    of the disease is very much abbreviated or contracted in the calf: the vesicles
                    are distended with lymph about the fourth or fifth day, instead of the seventh
                    or eighth, and are almost unattended by areolar redness and constitutional
                    disturbance, the animal being able to support fifty to a hundred or more
                    vesicles without the smallest inconvenience. On the child’s arm the vesicles
                    after calf-lymph are slower in development than in the calf, and are attended by
                    areola, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Under the influence of theory, “vaccine” lymph has been got from two sources that
                    have absolutely nothing to do with cowpox; and, oddly enough, the matter from
                    these sources has been so managed as to produce correct vesicles on the child’s
                    arm. One source is the grease of the horse’s hocks and the other is smallpox
                    itself.</p>
                <p>The grease of the horse was known to produce vesicles and subsequent ulcers on
                    the hands almost indistinguishable from those of accidental cowpox. There was
                    also the tradition (which breaks down when tested by facts) that accidental
                    infection with the grease protected from smallpox. Jenner held that all
                    “genuine” cowpox came from horse-grease; and, after he had raised vaccine
                    vesicles on the arms of children by matter from the cow’s teats, he proceeded to
                    try whether he could not raise the same kind of vesicle experimentally by matter
                    once removed from the horse’s hocks. The experiment succeeded, just as the
                    accident had done. The vesicle (represented in plate 2 of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Inquiry)</hi> ulcerated, and the boy died of what is vaguely termed a
                    “fever” in one place and a “contagious fever” in another. The same kind of
                    inconsequent logic suggested the experiment of inoculating the matter of
                    horse-grease upon the skin of the cow’s teats, the object being to prove the
                    identity of cowpox with the grease. That too succeeded in the hands of Loy of
                    Whitby. Loy also inoculated children with the same matter, and raised vesicles
                    on their arms, which were, of course, the same as the accidental vesicles
                    (compared to the blister raised by a burn). Sacco of Milan actually used the
                    equine matter on a large scale, instead of cowpox matter; and De Carro of Vienna
                    " equinated” many persons in that city with lymph sent him by Sacco. Baron
                    prints a memorandum of Jenner, dated 23d July 1813, relating to “equine virus
                    which I have been using from arm to arm for these two months past, without
                    observing the smallest deviation in the progress and appearance of the pustules
                    from those produced by vaccine,” and a second note, dated 17th May 1817, in
                    which Jenner says he “took matter from Jane King (equine direct) for the
                    National Vaccine Establishment. The pustules beautifully correct.” This is not
                    the place to enter upon the pathology of horsegrease; and, as a matter of fact,
                    equination has not been much practised on the whole. According to Jenner’s own
                    data, it was an occasional constitutional disease of the horse’s hocks in wet
                    seasons, which was communicable to the hands of men in the form of large whitish
                    vesicles, ending in corroding and painful open sores (see the case reported to
                    him by Fewster, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> ed. 1800, p. 96).</p>
                <p>The other anomalous source of “vaccine” is human smallpox. Jenner having
                    succeeded in passing off his doctrine that cowpox is smallpox of the cow, it
                    occurred to some persons about forty years after to prove the doctrine by
                    experiment, the proof being to variolate the cow on the udder. This was
                    accomplished in 1838, after much trouble, by Thiele in Kazan (Russia), who
                    inoculated several thousands of persons with the variolous matter “passed
                    through the system of the cow.” Within a few months of that experiment, the same
                    thing was attempted by Ceely of Aylesbury, who succeeded, after many failures,
                    in raising a large variolous pock, not on the udder of the cow, but on the
                    mucous membrane of the vulva. The first experiment with the matter of this pock
                    was undesigned; his assistant pricked his hand with the lancet which had just
                    been dipped into the large pustule, and in due course had an attack of smallpox.
                    Ceely persevered with his experiments (having meanwhile variolated another
                    heifer at five places on the vulva), and in due time so “managed” his matter as
                    to produce vesicles on the human arm (without general eruption on the skin),
                    which were regarded at Cheltenham and other places as <pb break="no"

                    of the period. But the real practical application of this idea was reserved for
                    Badcock, a dispensing chemist at Brighton. It does not appear that any authentic
                    or fully detailed account of Badcock’s experiments has been published;<note

                    but he thus summarized the results some forty years later (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Pall Mall Gazette,</hi> Jan. 23, 1880):—“By careful and repeated
                    experiments 1 produced, by the inoculation of the cow with smallpox, a benign
                    lymph of a non-infectious and highly protective character. My lymph has now been
                    in use at Brighton for forty years, and is at the present time the principal
                    stock of lymph employed there, being that exclusively used by the public
                    vaccinators.” At Boston, U.S., the same kind of lymph was raised and put in use
                    in 1852. But at Attleborough, Mass., the same experiment had in 1836 led to
                    disaster. Smallpox was inoculated on a cow’s udder, and the product used to
                    vaccinate about fifty persons. The result was an epidemic of smallpox, a panic,
                    and the suspension of business.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Bost. Med. and Surg. Journ.,</hi>
                            1860, p. 77.</p></note> On the face of it this method was simply
                    variolating the cow (on a mucous membrane if the hairless or shaven skin failed)
                    and inoculating the human subject with that curiously disguised smallpox matter.
                    However, it was thought necessary to hold an experimental inquiry upon it, and
                    in 1865 a commission of the Lyons Society of Medicine reported that, “in
                    vaccinating according to the method of Thiele and Ceely, we are merely
                    practising the old inoculation, rendered uniformly benign, it may be, by the
                    care taken to inoculate only the first product (l' <hi rend="italic">accident
                        primitif),</hi> but preserving for certain all its risks in respect to

                    inquiry for the Local Government Board, wherein he had Ceely’s cooperation. In
                    1879 the Irish Local Government Board prevented the use of similar variolous
                    lymph by threatening to prosecute under the Act making the inoculation of
                    smallpox penal. Notwithstanding the common sense of the case, and these
                    experimental proofs, the official view taken by the medical department in 1857,
                    that Thiele, Ceely, and Badcock had established the correctness of Jenner’s
                    doctrine of variolae vaccinae, is still held very tenaciously by the profession.
                    It is too simple and attractive to be soon given up; but perhaps the best way to
                    get rid of it is to state in plain terms what cowpox itself really is.</p>
                <p>Although there is no difficulty in drawing up a complete natural history of
                    cowpox, thanks to the laborious and exact studies of Ceely, yet the attention
                    has been so much diverted to side issues that the facts to be stated in this
                    section will come before most readers with the aspect of novelty. The other
                    original authorities besides Ceely are Jenner himself, Pearson (who collected
                    information by circular in the months following Jenner’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Inquiry),</hi> Bousquet (1836), Estlin (1838), and Crookshank (1888). The
                    Würtemberg inquiry, published by Hering (Stuttgart, 1839), is made up of very
                    indifferently authenticated or incomplete statements, which have not the same
                    value as the rest, and are at variance with them on the most essential
                    points.</p>
                <p>Cowpox as an infective disease arises in cow-houses here and there, and at wide
                    intervals of time, out of a common physiological or constitutional eruption of
                    some particular cow, usually a heifer in her first milk, very often in the
                    spring season or at some other crisis of the year or of the animal’s
                    life-history. It never arises except in milch cows; it occurs nowhere in the cow
                    but on the teats, or, by infection, on adjoining parts of the udder. All the
                    characters by which we know it distinctively as cowpox are associated with the
                    fact of milking, or with the inevitable traction on teats that are the subject
                    of an otherwise unimportant eruption. The primary disorder, as Ceely describes
                    it, is an eruption of a few pimples, the size of a vetch or larger, hard and
                    solid at first, but at length slightly vesiculated on the summit. It is only
                    rarely that a series of events ensues on this basis which constitute cowpox as
                    we know it; they ensue in some one animal out of many in the same byre, and
                    years may elapse before the event happens again. The pimples on the teats are
                    made to bleed by what Ceely calls “the merciless manipulations of the milkers”;
                    the blood forms crusts, which are dislodged every six hours; and indurated
                    ulcers form on the sites of the original pimples.</p>
                <p>The process being thus made inveterate owing to the incessant interference of the
                    milker’s hands, it becomes communicable to the other cows. The milkers can
                    usually point out some one cow in which the disease began; and it spreads slowly
                    through a byre, taking sometimes as long as three months to go the round of all
                    the animals. An animal already infected at one or more places on its teats may
                    become infected at other places on the teats and body of the udder, either by
                    the traction of milking or by the contact of parts when the cow is lying
                    down.</p>
                <p>The ulcers heal sometimes slowly, sometimes more quickly; they may heal under
                    crusts, or as open sores; induration and rounding of the edges are distinctive,
                    along with much thickening of the base. The scars are also indurated, rounded
                    arid elevated at the edges, and smooth or puckered on the surface; they are
                    often as large as a walnut. It is not easy to see a vesicular stage of the
                    disease even in the cows infected from the initial spontaneous case; and Ceely
                    had for the most part to be content with the coagulated matter of crusts to
                    vaccinate with. The process is, in fact, bound up from first to last in the most
                    intimate and essential manner with the operation of milking. Cowpox “undisturbed
                    by the milker’s hands” has no existence in the originating cow; it is the
                    persistent irritation that makes it a pox. It is communicable, also, to the
                    hands of the milkers themselves, and by their filthy hands to their faces.
                    Jenner mentions a good many such cases; Pearson has collected several; and Ceely
                    gives three in very full detail. As in the inoculated venereal pox, the
                    infection proceeds for a time under the skin, making a bluish-white vesicle; it
                    eats away the tissues round the margin, where the fluid makes the skin bulge out
                    into the characteristic tumid ring. After the fourteenth day the vesicle will
                    have become an eschar, the average size of a sixpenny piece, which comes away
                    and leaves a sore. The open sore is a regular part of the infection in the
                    milker’s hand. Various regions of the face get infected by contact from the
                    hands: Jenner mentions the case of “a poor girl who produced an ulceration on
                    her lip by frequently holding her finger to her mouth to cool the raging of a
                    cowpox sore by blowing upon it”; another of Jenner’s cases had the sore on the
                    wing of the nose; one of Ceely’s cases had an ulcer on the temple three-quarters
                    of an inch long; in a case observed by Crookshank there was a very large vesicle
                    and subsequent sore over the left cheek-bone. The local infection is accompanied
                    by constitutional disturbance, more or less severe, including headache, pains in
                    the loins, vomiting, and sometimes delirium. The axillary glands become painful,
                    usually about the fourth day, and remain hard for some time. Eruptions occurred,
                    but there is very little said about them.</p>
                <p>As might have been expected, the effects of experimental infection with cowpox
                    matter were the same as the accidental. They are spoken of as the effects of
                    “primary lymph,” that is to say, lymph direct from the cow’s teats or from the
                    milker’s sore hand, or in the earlier removes from these sources. Jenner’s
                    experience of primary lymph was very much the same as Bousquet’s, Estlin’s, and
                    Ceely’s forty years later. Woodville’s, on the other hand, was exceptionally
                        reassuring;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But
                            Addington (On <hi rend="italic">the Inoculation of the Cowpox,</hi>
                            Birmingham, 1801), who got his lymph from Woodville, was not equally
                            fortunate: of eleven cases at the beginning of his series five ended in
                            ulceration, after that the cases all ended in a “dry scab.”</p></note>
                    had it not been so, it is not likely that cowpoxing on the large scale would
                    ever have survived the initial discouragements entailed by the use of primary
                    lymph. The process on the child’s arm was on the whole the same as on the
                    milker’s hand, allowing for the more deliberate mode of inoculation and for
                    different texture of the skin. The vesicle grew to a great size up to the
                        fourteenth<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0039-0026"/> day, and often became an ulcer, either
                    excavated under the crust or absolutely open. Estlin did not entirely get rid of
                    ulceration until after the twenty-ninth remove from the cow. The constitutional
                    disturbance was often severe in infants: axillary tenderness and swelling were
                    somewhat constant, and eruptions were especially frequent about the second to
                    the fourth week, including macular roseola, lichen, and pemphigoid bullae. At
                    each successive remove from the cow the cycle of the process became more
                    contracted, and the constitutional disturbance, <hi rend="italic">caeteris
                        paribus,</hi> became less. Bousquet gives a plate which shows by parallel
                    series of figures the differences between the vesicles of the old lymph
                    (Woodville’s, nearly forty years old) and the lymph from the Passy cow. The new
                    lymph induced a process more protracted at every stage: the vesicle continued to
                    enlarge at the periphery for several days after the common vaccine vesicle of
                    the period would have ceased to extend. It was not at its maximum until about
                    the end of the second week, and it then became an eschar and a sore. Bousquet
                    confesses that he first understood “les frayeurs de Jenner” when he saw the
                    ulcerative and other effects of primary lymph. After a certain number of removes
                    from the cow the cycle became so contracted that the vesicle was full at the
                    eighth or ninth day; the abbreviation of its life-history enabled it to heal
                    without ulcerating. It thus becomes the ordinary vaccine vesicle as we know it,
                    which heals under a scab, and leaves the peculiar punctated scar of
                    subcrustaceous repair. The abbreviation or mitigation is effected by taking
                    lymph from each successive vaccinifer at as early a period as it can be got,
                    until the golden mean of safe vaccination, namely, maturity at the eighth day,
                    is reached. That corresponds to Jenner’s rule of taking the matter for
                    vaccination before the areola appears; if the vesicle be emptied after that
                    period, the lymph from it is apt to cause ulceration, or, as Ceely puts it, we
                    have “all the inconveniences of primary lymph.” It is thus clear that humanized
                    cowpox might be easily cultivated back to its original type; and, as a matter of
                    fact, it has sometimes been so cultivated back by misadventure, with serious
                    consequences to the vaccinated.</p>
                <p>The risks of vaccination may be divided into the risks inherent in the cowpox
                    infection and the risks contingent to the puncture of the skin. Of the latter
                    nothing special requires to be said; the former will be discussed under the five
                    heads of (1) erysipelas, (2) jaundice, (3) skin eruptions, (4) vaccinal ulcers,
                    and (5) so-called vaccinal syphilis.</p>
                <p>(1) A slight degree of erysipelas was recognized by Jenner himself, and even
                    postulated by him, as part of the natural history of cowpox in man; and it is so
                    recognized by the more unbiased writers of recent date.<note anchored="true"

                    for it corresponds to the appearance of the areola (eighth or ninth day), that
                    efflorescence round the pock being normally a slight erysipelas. It may start,
                    however, from the puncture or scratch in the skin, after a day or two’s
                    interval; but that form of it (the “early erysipelas” of German writers) is much
                    rarer than the erysipelas of the areola, or “late erysipelas.” Primary lymph, or
                    lymph in the first removes, is most apt to excite an extensive and spreading
                    areolar redness. In the ordinary course of vaccination remote from the cow the
                    intensity of the superficial redness and deep infiltration would seem to depend
                    mostly on the child’s constitution, or on whatever concurrence of circumstances
                    serves to recall the “inconveniences of primary lymph.” The registrar-general’s
                    tables of mortality for England and Wales have contained an entry of “erysipelas
                    after vaccination” from 1855 down to 1881, when the entry was changed to “cowpox
                    and other effects of vaccination,” the numbers at the same time nearly doubling.
                    The fatal cases of erysipelas in infants under one year referred to vaccination
                    are but a small fraction of the whole mortality from erysipelas at that age, a
                    mortality which is far greater than at any other period of life. It is quite
                    certain that in foundling hospitals, such as that of St Petersburg, the
                    erysipelas of vaccination has been the starting-point of disastrous epidemics of
                    erysipelas affecting the inmates generally. There is no means of knowing whether
                    the same has been the case among the population at large. In Table I. the column
                    of deaths from erysipelas in general, among infants of the first year in England

                <p>erysipelas after vaccination, The post-vaccinal inflammation sometimes takes the
                    form of phlegmon; but there is no separate entry for that as a special sequel of
                    vaccination. Many of the alleged deaths from erysipelas after vaccination have
                    been the subject of coroner’s inquests; the verdict is often an open one, and
                    even such cases as those near Gainsborough in 1876 and at Norwich in 1882 were
                    found to have been returned (all but one) by the certifying medical
                    practitioners as due to erysipelas merely. It may be assumed that "after
                    vaccination” is not certified unless the case has left no doubt in the minds of
                    the jury or of the certifying medical attendant. The increase in the first
                    column from 0 in 1855 to 32 in 1880 is probably in appearance only, and due to
                    more correct diagnosis.</p>
                <p>(2) It is only within the last few years that jaundice has been recognized as a
                    post-vaccinal effect; and at present there is only one accepted instance of it
                    on the large scale. This was the epidemic among re-vaccinated adults in a large
                    shipyard at Bremen from October 1883 to April 1884. Owing to an alarm of
                    smallpox, 1289 workmen were re-vaccinated between the 13th August and 1st
                    September with the same humanized lymph preserved in glycerin; of these 191 had
                    jaundice at various intervals down to the month of April following.
                    Circumstantial evidence (agreement and difference) clearly traced the epidemic
                    to the vaccination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                            Lürman, <hi rend="italic">Berl. klin. Wochenschrift,</hi> 1885, p.
                            20.</p></note> In future an outlook will be kept for this effect of
                    vaccination; at present it has no intelligible theory. It may be noted that the
                    lymph which caused the Bremen epidemic was mixed with glycerin.</p>
                <p>(3) The eruptions that follow vaccination are proper to cowpox infection.
                    Although little is said about them in the accidental infection of milkers, they
                    were very common in the practice of Estlin, Ceely, and others with primary
                    lymph. The eruption is a kind of exanthem, or “secondary” of the local
                    infection, and does not ordinarily appear before the second week. One of its
                    commonest forms is a patchy rose-rash, or macular roseola, not easily
                    distinguishable from the macular roseola of syphilis.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Parrot, <hi rend="italic">La Syphilis
                                Héréditaire,</hi> 1886, p. 33.</p></note> Another form is lichen or
                    dry papules, apt to scale; it may also occur as a vesicular eruption, and in the
                    form of pemphigoid bullae or blebs. In one of Ceely’s cases the eruption
                    extended to the whole mucous membrane of the mouth and throat. A peculiarity of
                    the exanthem is that it may come and go several times before it finally
                    disappears; and, like other skin eruptions, specific or non-specific, it may
                    become inveterate. The widespread belief that much of the eczema of childhood
                    dates from vaccination is not by any means to be dismissed as a mere fancy. The
                    skin-disorders that followed vaccination in the first years of the practice were
                    declared by Birch and others to be new in type. At present the vaccinal
                    eruption, especially on the scalp, is sometimes distinguished by the size and
                    form of the crusts, and by scars remaining for a time.</p>
                <p>(4) Ulceration of the vaccine vesicle, or of the site of it, is one of the
                    commoner forms of “bad arm.” It is a return to the native or untamed characters
                    of cowpox on the cow’s teats, or on the milker’s hands or face, or in the
                    child’s arm after experimental inoculation with primary lymph. It crops out not
                    unfrequently in everyday practice, and is probably dependent for the most part
                    on the lateness at which the lymph was taken for vaccination, or on retardation
                    of the process in the vaccinifer, or on emptying the latter’s vesicles too much;
                    however, it may result from picking the scab or otherwise dislodging it. The
                    ulceration usually proceeds to some depth in the form of a crater under the
                    crust, and is attended with induration and rounding of the edges and induration
                    of the base. According to Bohn (<hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p. 166), it may
                    alarm practitioners by its resemblance to syphilis. In other cases the crust is
                    wanting and the ulceration has the distinct type of phagedena. The
                        de-stπιction<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0040-0027"/> of tissue in either case may be very
                    extensive, going “down to the bone” and having as much as an inch or more of
                    superficial area. Healing is frequently an affair of weeks, and may be aided by
                    mercurial treatment. There are no statistics of this sequel of vaccination; but
                    the frequency or infrequency of it may be learned in conversation with any
                    intelligent chemist whose shop is resorted to by the poor, or with a medical
                    practitioner of average experience.</p>
                <p>(5) It has been proved by many experiments, undesigned or otherwise, in Paris
                    (1831 and 1839), Vienna (1854), and elsewhere, that an infant with congenital
                    syphilis develops correct vaccinal vesicles, provided its skin be clear of
                    eruption and the lymph have been taken at the usual time; also that the lymph
                    taken from the correct vesicles of a syphilitic child produces correct vesicles
                    in its turn, but does not produce syphilis in the vaccinated child. The
                    congenital taint is, in fact, irrelevant to the course of cowpox infection. So
                    far as experiment and casual experience can prove anything, that has been
                    proved; the recent attempt to disprove it by an officer of the Local Government
                    Board <hi rend="italic">(Report</hi> for 1882, .p. 46) is vitiated by fallacies,
                    and has no value against the overwhelming testimony collected thirty or forty
                    years ago. What, then, is the meaning of the numerous outbreaks of syphilis in
                    groups of children or adults vaccinated or re-vaccinated with lymph from one
                    source?</p>
                <p>A careful examination of these cases shows that syphilis at the source of the
                    vaccine matter was in all cases an after-thought, that in most of the cases
                    there was no evidence for it, and that in the remaining cases the evidence was
                    so far-fetched as to be unlikely (apart from the known <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> improbability), or that the traces of constitutional infection
                    found in the vaccinifer were subsequent to vaccination, and therefore capable of
                    being explained as an effect concurrent with the more obvious symptoms in those
                    vaccinated therefrom. The effects, however, were very much the same as in the
                    venereal pox. The vaccine vesicle either became an indurated or phagedenic sore,
                    as described in the foregoing section on vaccinal ulcers, or the scar opened
                    into an indurated sore after the usual sub-crustaceous healing was complete, or
                    became indurated without opening. The axillary and cervical glands were often
                    indurated. In most of the epidemics there were a certain number of cases in
                    which the effects were purely local, or confined to one only of the seats of
                    puncture; if these had not occurred along with others in a group, they would
                    have been counted as ordinary vaccinal ulcers. But there were often secondary
                    symptoms as well, including the roseolar, lichenous, or (rarely) pemphigoid
                    eruption, and not unfrequently condylomata <hi rend="italic">circa anum et
                        genitalia.</hi> In some epidemics (but not in all) there were, in a small
                    minority of the cases, mucous patches on the tonsils, tongue, or lips, tending
                    to ulcerate; and in some of the Italian outbreaks the infection spread among the
                    mothers and other members of the households in the form of specific sores of the
                    nipples, with or without constitutional symptoms. Affections of the bones and
                    viscera do not seem to have followed; fatalities were not very common.</p>
                <p>It will be hard to persuade medical authorities that these secondary effects are
                    not the result exclusively of the venereal pox. The evidence, however, does not
                    allow us to assume any other specific infection than that of cowpox, which, as
                    we know, has its proper secondary exanthem in the form of macular roseola,
                    lichen, or pemphigus; the eruption has even been known to affect the mouth and
                    throat. The evidence from epidemics of vaccinal sore arms teaches us that
                    condylomata, mucous patches of the tonsils, tongue, and lips, and even iritis,
                    are also possible, although far from invariable, among the “secondaries” of the
                    primary vaccinal ulcer. The most general fact that comes out in these epidemics
                    is that the lymph was taken late from the vaccinifer, or that the vesicles of
                    the vaccinifer were drained dry to vaccinate a large number, or that the same
                    vaccinifer λvas used for arm-to-arm inoculation on two successive days. It is
                    not difficult to see how, in those circumstances, the abbreviated cycle of
                    humanized cowpox may be departed from and the native or untamed characters of
                    cowpox infection reverted to. Cowpox, indeed, is parallel with the venereal pox,
                    both in the circumstances of its becoming an infective ulceration (indurated or
                    suppurating) and in its secondary or constitutional manifestations as an
                    infection in man. But the “bad” lymph has hardly ever been used beyond the
                    second remove; and there the parallel fails.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the so-called syphilitic epidemics after vaccination,
                    including those that have been considered spurious, because they were either
                    anomalous in type from the point of view of syphilitic infection or had no
                    obvious causal connexion with that disease.</p>

                <p>Attention was drawn to these cases because they occurred in groups varying in
                    number from 10 to 100 or more, which made considerable stir, especially in
                    country districts. It is unlikely that all cases have been reported. In the
                    third <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the clinical hospital of Manchester,
                    Whitehead states the results of his inquiries on post-vaccinal illness in
                    children. Setting aside most of the cases of illness vaguely alleged by the
                    mothers to have been the consequence of vaccination, he admits as truly
                    post-vaccinal 34 cases of syphilis or pseudo-syphilis; of these he enumerates
                    only 14 in his table of 63 cases of children’s syphilis of all kinds, the other
                    20 cases being omitted, it would appear, not because there was any doubt of
                    their being post-vaccinal, but because they were not of the perfect type of
                    infantine syphilis. Such was the experience of a competent observer at a single
                    hospital during a period of 20 months. Whitehead’s <hi rend="italic">Report</hi>
                    was published in 1859; but, when Hutchinson published his first series of London
                    cases in 1871, the subject was considered to be quite new. Here again it was the
                    concurrence of some ten cases in a group that helped the reluctant assent of the
                    profession. The first group of London cases had hardly begun to be talked of
                    when one of Hutchinson’s colleagues was led by two cases of skin disease at a
                    hospital to follow up the traces of another group, the very existence of which
                    was unsuspected by the public vaccinator or general practitioners in whose
                    district the eleven patients with vaccinal ulcers and occasional secondaries
                    resided.</p>
                <p>In the registrar-general’s tables of mortality for England and Wales about
                    one-half of the deaths from “cowpox and other effects of vaccination,” or nearly
                    thirty per annum, may be put down to effects of vaccination other than
                    erysipelas; but there is nothing to show that these were fatal cases of vaccinal
                    ulcers with constitutional symptoms or marasmus. On the other hand, the table of
                    deaths from syphilis shows an enormous and steady increase in the number of
                    deaths of infants under the age of one. In the first year of compulsory
                    vaccination (1854) the deaths suddenly increased by one-half, and the increase
                    has gone on steadily since then (see Table II.) The interpretation of the fact
                    is by no means easy or free <hi rend="italic">Infantine Death-Rate from Syphilis

                    besides vaccination; and it is significant that the tables for Scotland show the
                    mortality to be chiefly in the first three months of life, whereas the statutory
                    limit for vaccination in that country is six months.</p>
                <p>In the polemical writings of anti-vaccinists, such diseases as scrofula,
                    tubercle, hooping-cough, diarrhoea, and other common causes of infantine
                    mortality are alleged to have increased owing to vaccination. There is ‘little
                    or no reason, in theory or in experience, to suspect that tuberculous or
                    scrofulous infection is ever communicated by vaccine lymph. As regards the above
                    and other infantine maladies, vaccination may predispose the child to fall into
                    them, in so far as it produces, or ought in theory to produce, a considerable
                    constitutional disturbance and presumably a loss, for a brief period, of the

                <p>The value of cowpox as a protection against smallpox may now be judged of apart
                    from the fanciful doctrine of variolae vaccinae by which it was originally
                    recommended. It has been put to a test extending over eighty years; and in some
                    circumstances it has been possible to apply the logical methods of agreement and
                    difference with a good deal of cogency. The besetting fallacy of all vaccination
                    logic is that of <hi rend="italic">post hoc ergo propter hoc</hi>; and the only
                    way to escape it is to hold intelligent views of the history, the natural
                    history, and the epidemiology of smallpox. This will necessitate a brief
                    excursus.</p>
                <p>Smallpox, which is really a tropical skin disease of the nature of lichen turned
                    pustular, or of ecthyma, must be judged according to what we know of foreign
                    pestilences in general. Perhaps we are safest to take a line through the
                    behaviour of the plague. Plague in western Europe had the start of smallpox by a
                    good many years, if we speak only of prevalence on the large scale. “Throughout
                    the 16th century,” says Hirsch, “the plague was a permanent form of disease on
                    the continent of Europe. . . . During the first two-thirds of the 17th century
                    we still meet with it over an equally wide area and equally often. But in the
                    last thirty years of that century the plague was observed to be retreating
                    gradually from the soil of Europe.” It was not only in London after the fire of
                    1666 but also in Denmark and Sweden, in Italy, in Holland and Belgium, in
                    Switzerland, in France, in western Germany, and in Spain that the years
                    1660-1680 saw the last of plague; it lingered only in the Levant, in Poland, and
                    in other parts of north-eastern Europe, with occasional epidemic visits, such as
                    those of Messina and Marseilles. Now it has left the Levant and Egypt, has
                    abandoned even Mesopotamia and Arabia, and retreated to a few poor villages on
                    the Perso-Armenian frontier. Or, take the example of leprosy, which owed its
                    existence rather to the widespread or national concurrence of the same causes in
                    various countries than to the travelling of an infection: Italy had it first and
                    lost it first, and nearly every other country in Europe saw its rise, its
                    general prevalence, its decline, and its extinction, the northern countries
                    keeping it longest. Again, typhus fever was a standing disease so long as Europe
                    was the theatre of protracted wars and all their consequences; but, like other
                    infections, typhus gradually declined and has almost disappeared since the
                    conditions on which it depended ceased.</p>
                <p>Leaving these parallels and coming to the facts of smallpox itself, it rose to
                    prominence in western Europe in the 16th century, and in England in the

                            in 1365 being so rendered, although it was probably the ordinary
                            bubo-plague of the period. The pox of Elizabethan writers was the French
                            pox or great pox (syphilis), which overran Europe as an epidemic in
                            1494. Its prominent character at its first appearance was the loathsome
                            affection of the skin (especially the face); hence when variola came on
                            the scene it was called the lesser pox, or smallpox.</p></note> From the
                    early part of the 18th century a remission was noted; but the latter half of
                    that century saw a considerable extension of the area of the disease, for which
                    the practice of inoculation has been blamed. It is a mistake to suppose that
                    smallpox has shown a tendency towards a universal infection; for all its chances
                    it has kept within moderate limits of age and place, and extended only by
                    repeated provocation. Thus, Hirsch says of the western hemisphere, “A still more
                    terrible source for America was the importation of Negro slaves, so much so that
                    in after years, particularly in South America and the West Indies, not only the
                    first appearances of smallpox, but every fresh outbreak of it, could be traced
                    to importation from Africa,”—the African continent being then, as now and
                    always, one of its principal native seats. In Europe it has been peculiarly a
                    disease of infancy and of the most crowded parts of cities. It has had victims
                    among the upper classes, just as cholera has had; but, like that disease, its
                    habitat is among the crowded poor; and it would have touched the
                    wellto-do-classes less in former times if there had always been spacious
                    west-end quarters in cities or the modern “passion for clean linen,” personal
                    ablutions, and fresh air. Tenement houses and ill-ventilated courts or alleys
                    have been the natural harbourage of smallpox; in proportion as these have been
                    demolished the disease has disappeared or been circumscribed in its area. It is
                    fallacious to estimate its prevalence now in ratio of the whole population; for
                    a just comparison of one period with another, we have to take into account, not
                    the death-rate per million living, but the death-rate per million still living
                    under the old-world conditions. From the earliest period of its history in
                    Europe, the disease has had its seasons of quickening or revival, with long
                    intervals of quiescence; only in the most crowded parts of Western cities has it
                    ever been endemic from year to year. These epidemic outbursts have varied much
                    in intensity and in area, the conditions of variation being mostly unknown. In
                    that respect, it need hardly be said, smallpox is like other epidemic
                    diseases.</p>
                <p>During the early years of the 19th century there was a marked remission of the
                    epidemic outbursts of the disease in most parts of Europe. The amount of
                    vaccination during those years was in considerable; in particular it hardly
                    touched the poor. Thus, at the time of the Norwich epidemic of 1819, it was
                    estimated (by Cross) that only one-fourth of the inhabitants were vaccinated,
                    and these almost exclusively the well-to-do. At the same time the practice of
                    inoculating smallpox, which was with good reason blamed for keeping the
                    contagion generally diffused and active among the non-inoculated, began to be
                    discontinued and soon ceased altogether. Undoubtedly there was a marked decline
                    in smallpox during the first fifteen years of the century, but the associated
                    circumstances are as complex as the fact itself is simple. We have to bear in
                    mind the old law of periodic exacerbation and dormancy, the cessation of a
                    practice (inoculation) which almost certainly interfered with the natural
                    tendency of smallpox as a foreign pestilence to die out, and the unusual
                    prevalence of typhus fever (on the Continent), and other displacing or
                    substitutive factors in the death-rate. To what extent vaccination was a factor
                    will have to be decided by the experience of a period when the practice was much
                    more generally in vogue. For that purpose we may here restrict the inquiry to
                    England and Wales, premising that the experience of other European countries
                    where vaccination has been equally practised is not different.</p>

                <p>In the first years of the table the deaths from smallpox of children under five
                    were to those of all other ages in the ratio of 3 to 1 or of 5 to 2 (at Norwich
                    in 1819 there were 530 deaths, of which half were in infants under two, and all
                    the rest save ten were in children under ten years); the disproportion lessened
                    gradually, until about 1864 it was nearly 4 to 3; in 1870 the proportion was
                    nearly equal; and from that time onward the preponderance leaves the age of
                    infancy and childhood, so that in 1884 the deaths under five were three times
                    fewer than those at all other ages. The great epidemic of 1871-72 brought out
                    that remarkable change of incidence most decidedly. Taking the mortality of 1871
                    as an instance, the significance of the changed incidence on the periods of life
                    is that the 7770 deaths under the age of five would, in pre-compulsion times,
                    have had a complement of no more than 2500 deaths in the later periods of life,
                    or that the actual mortality of 15,356 above the age of five would have had a
                    complement of some 40,000 or 45,000 deaths below that age. (In British India in
                    1884 of 333,000 deaths 72 per cent. were of children under 12 in Bengal, and 64
                    per cent. in Madras. ) Apart from the changed incidence of smallpox, Table III.
                    shows merely the caprices of the disease as an epidemic. After every epidemic
                    outburst the disease declines and sometimes looks as if it were about to die out
                    altogether. The alarm attending each severe epidemic has induced the legislature
                    to make the vaccination law more stringent and vaccinators to insert more of the
                    virus, so that the periodic subsidence has corresponded to, and has seemed to be
                    owing to, the better enforcement of the practice; but there have always been
                    alternating periods of quiescence and exacerbation, irrespective of any
                    prophylactic. Moreover, smallpox being a foreign contagious skin disease lurking
                    in congenial haunts, it would be quite according to precedent that it should one
                    day cease absolutely in a community where sanitary progress had advanced so far
                    as to take the ground from under the feet of the pestilence; such absolute
                    cessation would have no more necessary connexion with almost universal
                    vaccination than the alternating quiescence and recrudescence of epidemics have
                    been connected with each new Act of Parliament. The epidemic of 1871-72 was one
                    of the worst in the whole history of European smallpox; and it may be that it
                    was one of the last flickers of a slowly expiring flame. The universal practice
                    of cowpoxing, however, is based upon the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0042-0029"/> assumption that this contagious skin disease
                    imported from the tropics is a thing that Europe must reckon with for an
                    indefinite time. On the other hand, the teaching of epidemiology is that a
                    foreign pestilence never stays unless it finds quarters suited to its existence,
                    and that it may even take its departure capriciously, as in the case of the
                    plague, after it has had a certain career, or on being displaced by some
                    congener such as typhus. Vaccination is considered to have turned smallpox in
                    great part aside from the early years of life and thrown it more than ever upon
                    the later ages, while measles and other maladies proper to childhood have at the
                    same time increased.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                            Farr, <hi rend="italic">Reg. Gen. Report</hi> for 1867, p. 213: “To
                            operate on mortality, protection against every one of the fatal zymotic
                            diseases is required; otherwise the suppression of one disease-element
                            opens the way to another” (p. 219). He quotes Watt (1813) to show that
                            the decrease of smallpox mortality among infants in Glasgow from 1783 to
                            1812 was balanced by a great increase in the infantine deaths from
                            measles. See also Guy, <hi rend="italic">Journ. Statist. Soc.,</hi>

                <p>Thus far as regards the utility of vaccination to the state; we have now to
                    consider its utility to the individual. Do the vaccinated escape in an epidemic?
                    or, if they do not escape an attack of smallpox, do they escape death from it?
                    In answer to the first question, apart from the familiar negative experience of
                    everyone, we have the statistics of smallpox hospitals, which relate to the
                    poorer class and probably do full justice to the fact of non-vaccination,
                    inasmuch as the unvaccinated residue is mostly to be found in those slums and
                    tenements of the poor where smallpox (now as always) is apt to linger. At the
                    Eastern Metropolitan Hospital (Homerton) from its opening early in 1871 to the
                    end of 1878 there were 6533 admissions for smallpox, of which 4283 had
                    vaccination marks, 793 had no marks although vaccinated, and 1477 were
                    unvaccinated, giving a proportion of 0∙29 unvaccinated. In the epidemic
                    hospitals of Liverpool, Glasgow, and Dublin the proportion was 0∙25 during the
                    same period. For some of the German states the proportion of unvaccinated cases
                    comes out a good deal less than one-fourth; thus, in Bavaria in 1871 of 30,742
                    cases 29,429 were in vaccinated persons, or 95∙7 per cent., and 1313 in the
                    un-vaccinated, or 4∙3 per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    outbreaks of recent years the victims have been nearly all vaccinated <hi
                        rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> at Bromley in 1881, a total of 43 cases, including
                    sixteen confluent, all vaccinated).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Nicolson, <hi rend="italic">Lancet,</hi> 27th August
                            1881. .</p></note> In the army and navy, where vaccination and
                    re-vaccination are absolutely without exception, the proportion is accordingly
                    0. It would thus appear that the rather excessive proportion of cases among the
                    small residue of unvaccinated in the civil population must have other associated
                    circumstances besides non-vaccination; and these are not far to seek.</p>
                <p>The next question is the death-rate among the vaccinated and unvaccinated
                    respectively. The total death-rate from smallpox in modem times is almost the
                    same as it was in the 18th century; large aggregates collected by Jurin and
                    others in pre-vaccination times show a mortality of 18∙8 per cent., and
                    corresponding aggregates in English and American hospitals, mostly since 1870,
                    show a mortality of 18∙5 per cent. It has, however, to be borne in mind that the
                    division into discrete, confluent, and malignant smallpox is an old one; that a
                    mild type was quite common in the 17th and 18th centuries, and was now and then
                    characteristic of whole epidemics, just as in the case of scarlatina; and that
                    the vaccinated are at present liable to be attacked by the confluent and
                    malignant disease as well as by the discrete. But are the vaccinated liable to
                    the fatal forms of smallpox in the same proportion as the unvaccinated? It is
                    only since 1879 that the registrar-general’s tables for England and Wales have
                    attempted to supply data bearing on this; and it will be seen from the following
                    abstracts (Tables IV. - VII.) that the data are still far from being sufficient

                <p>These figures may be made to prove anything, according to the bias of the

                    precise: among the 29,429 cases of smallpox in vaccinated persons there were
                    3994 deaths, while among the 1313 unvaccinated cases there were 790 deaths; of
                    the latter no fewer than 743 deaths were of infants in their first year. The
                    mortality among both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated is always excessive for
                    infancy. Feeble health, as well as non-vaccination, is a factor in the very
                    excessive smallpox mortality at that tender age.</p>
                <p>The returns from special smallpox hospitals make out a very small death-rate (6
                    per cent.) among the vaccinated and a very large death-rate (40 to 60 per cent.)
                    among the unvaccinated. The result is doubtful <hi rend="italic">qua</hi>
                    vaccination, for the reason that in pre-vaccination times the death-rate (18∙8
                    per cent.) was almost the same as it is now in the vaccinated and unvaccinated
                    together (18∙5). At the Homerton Hospital from 1871 to 1878 there were admitted
                    793 cases in which “vaccination is stated to have been performed, but without
                    any evidence of its performance”; the deaths in that important contingent were
                    216, or 27∙2 per cent., but they are not permitted to swell the mortality among
                    the vaccinated.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Birkenhead in 1877 reveal to us the rather surprising fact that his column of
                    “unvaccinated” contained, not only cases that were admittedly not vaccinated,
                    but also those that were “without the faintest mark”; of the 72 cases in that
                    column no fewer than 53 died. His column of “unknown” contained 80 per cent. of
                    patients who protested that they had been vaccinated (28 deaths in 220 cases or
                    12∙7 per cent. ). Those who passed muster as veritably vaccinated were 233, of
                    whom 12 died (5∙1 per cent.). With reference to this question of the marks, it
                    has to be said that cowpox scars may be temporary, that their “goodness” or
                    “badness” depends chiefly on the texture of the individual’s skin and the
                    thickness or thinness of the original crust, and that the aspect of the scar, or
                    even its total absence some years or even months after, may be altogether
                    misleading as to the size and correctness in other respects of the vaccine
                    vesicle, and of the degree of constitutional disturbance that attended it. This
                    was candidly recognized by Ceely,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    disputed by anyone who knows something of cowpox and of how it has been
                    mitigated, and of the various ways in which the tissues of individuals may react
                    to an inoculated infection. In confluent cases the marks on the arm would be
                    less easily seen.</p>

                <p>The practice of re-vaccination was first recommended in England by G. Gregory,
                    and in Germany for the army by Heim (1829). It has been more or less the law in

                    of school pupils at the age of twelve is an integral part of the vaccination
                    law.” Notwithstanding the fact that Prussia was the best re-vaccinated country
                    in Europe, its mortality from smallpox in the epidemic of 1871 was higher
                    (69,839) than in any other northern state. The efficacy of re-vaccination is
                    sometimes sought to be proved by the immunity of nurses in smallpox hospitals.
                    The experiment of not re-vaccinating the nurses was tried at the smallpox
                    hospital of the South Dublin Union in 1871-72; 29 out of the 36 attendants had
                    not been re-vaccinated, and these all escaped smallpox as well as the other
                        seven.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    But nurses are not rarely chosen from among those who have had smallpox, and
                    cases of smallpox in re-vaccinated nurses are not unknown.<note anchored="true"

                    large scale comes from the army. According to a competent statistician (A.
                    Vogt), the death-rate from smallpox<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0043-0030"/> in the German army, in which all recruits are
                    re-vaccinated, was 60 per cent. more than among the civil population of the same
                    age; it was ten times greater among the infantry than among the cavalry, and
                    sixty times more among the Hessians than among the Würtembergers. The Bavarian
                    contingent, which was re-vaccinated without exception, had five times the
                    death-rate from smallpox in the epidemic of 1870-71 that the Bavarian civil
                    population of the same ages had, although re-vaccination is not obligatory among
                    the latter.</p>
                <p>The susceptibility to cowpox infection diminishes with age; among the pupils of
                    twelve years in Prussian schools it fails in about one-fourth of the attempts,
                    and at later periods of life the proportion of failures is still greater.</p>
                <p>It is often alleged that the unvaccinated are so much inflammable material in the
                    midst of the community, and that smallpox begins among them and gathers force so
                    that it sweeps even the vaccinated before it. Inquiry into the facts has shown
                    that at Cologne in 1870 the first unvaccinated person attacked by smallpox was
                    the 174th in order of time, at Bonn the same year the 42d, and at Liegnitz in
                    1871 the 225th.</p>
                <p>State-supported facilities for vaccination began in England in 1808 with the
                    National Vaccine Establishment. In 1840 vaccination fees were made payable out
                    of the rates. The first compulsory Act was passed in 1853, the guardians of the
                    poor being intrusted with the carrying out of the law; in 1854 the public
                    vaccinations under one year of age were 408,824, as against an average of
                    180,960 for several years before. In 1867 a new Act was passed, rather to remove
                    some technical difficulties than to enlarge the scope of the former Act; and in
                    1871 the Act was passed which compelled the boards of guardians to appoint
                    vaccination officers. The guardians also appoint a public vaccinator, who must
                    be duly qualified to practise medicine, and whose duty it is to vaccinate (for a
                    fee of one shilling and sixpence) any child resident within his district brought
                    to him for that purpose, to examine the same a week after, to give a
                    certificate, and to certify to the vaccination officer the fact of vaccination
                    or of insusceptibility. The Local Government Board awards a considerable sum in
                    premiums for totals of successful vaccination, at a higher scale of one shilling
                    for each case, and a lower scale of sixpence. The vaccination officer sees that
                    all infants are vaccinated, either publicly or privately, before they are three
                    months old (in Scotland six months), unless there is reason for postponing the
                    operation. He acts also as registrar of vaccinations. Parents refusing to obey
                    the summons taken out by the vaccination officer are liable to a penalty of
                    twenty shillings for each offence. In 1880 the president of the Local Government
                    Board brought in a bill to repeal the part of the Act relating to cumulative
                    penalties; but the bill was withdrawn owing to protests from the medical
                    profession. In a number of populous unions of England a majority of the
                    guardians are decided not to prosecute under the Vaccination Act; in other
                    unions prosecutions are not unfrequent, the convictions having amounted in 1885
                    to upwards of two thousand, and having usually led to distraint of goods (rarely
                    to imprisonment) in default of paying the fine. In England about two-thirds of
                    all infants are vaccinated at the public expense.</p>
                <p>Vaccination was made compulsory in Bavaria in 1807, and subsequently in the
                    following countries :—Denmark (1810), Sweden (1814), Würtemberg, Hesse, and
                    other German states (1818), Prussia (1835), Roumania (1874), Hungary (1876), and
                    Servia (1881). It is compulsory by cantonal law in ten out of the twenty-two
                    Swiss cantons; an attempt to pass a federal compulsory law was defeated by a
                    plebiscite in 1881.</p>
                <p>In the following countries there is no compulsory law, but Governmental
                    facilities and compulsion on various classes more or less directly under
                    Governmental control, such as soldiers, state employés, apprentices, school
                    pupils, &amp;c. :—France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Norway, Austria,
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>In only a few States or cities of the American Union is there a vaccination
                    statute; in Canada there is none. Vaccination has been compulsory in South
                    Australia since 1872, in Victoria since 1874, and in Western Australia since
                    1878. In Tasmania a compulsory Act was passed in 1882. In New South Wales there
                    is no compulsion, but free facilities for vaccination. Compulsion was adopted at
                    Calcutta in 1880 and since then at eighty other towns of Bengal, at Madras in
                    1884, and at Bombay and elsewhere in the presidency a few years earlier.</p>
                <p>Re-vaccination was made compulsory in Denmark in 1871 and in Roumania in 1874; in
                    Holland it was enacted for all school pupils in 1872. The various laws and
                    administrative orders which had been for many years in force as to vaccination
                    and re-vaccination in the several German states were consolidated in an imperial
                    statute of 1874.</p>
