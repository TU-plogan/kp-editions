                    He was of good burgher extraction, and, following the traditions of his family,
                    applied himself to commerce. During the early years of the 14th century he
                    travelled in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, seeing men and things with the
                    sagacity alike of the man of business and of the historian. Before leaving
                    Florence, or rather in the interval between one journey and another, he had at
                    least taken some part in that troubled period of civil contentions which Dino
                    Compagni has described, and which swept Dante Alighieri into banishment. In 1301
                    Villani saw Charles of Valois ruining his country under the false name of
                    peacemaker, and was witness of all the misery which immediately followed.<note

                    left Italy, and in September 1304 he visited Flanders. It is not well
                    ascertained when he returned to his native city. He was certainly living there
                    shortly after the emperor Henry VII. had come to Italy in 1312, and probably he
                    had been there for some time before. While still continuing to occupy himself
                    with commerce, he now began to take a prominent part in public affairs. In 1316
                    and 1317 he was one of the priors, and shared in the crafty tactics whereby Pisa
                    and Lucca were induced to conclude a peace with Florence, to which they were
                    previously averse.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> bk. ix. ch. 80.</p></note> In 1317 he also had charge
                    of the mint, and during his administration of this office he collected its
                    earlier records and had a register made of all the coins struck in Florence up
                    to his day. In 1321 he was again chosen prior; and, the Florentines having just
                    then undertaken the rebuilding of the city walls, he and some other citizens
                    were deputed to look after the work. They were afterwards accused of having
                    diverted the public money to private ends; but Villani clearly established his
                    innocence. He was next sent with the army against Castruccio Castracane, lord of
                    Lucca, and was present at its defeat at Altopascio. In 1328 a terrible famine
                    visited many provinces of Italy, including Tuscany, and Villani was appointed to
                    guard Florence from the worst effects of that distressing period. He has left a
                    record of what was done in a chapter of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi>
                    which still remains a monument of the economic wisdom in which the mediaeval
                    Florentines were often so greatly in advance of their age.<note anchored="true"

                    121.</p></note> In 1339, some time after the death of Castruccio, some rich
                    Florentine merchants, and among them Villani, treated for the acquisition of
                    Lucca by Florence for 80,000 florins, offering to supply the larger part of that
                    sum out of their own private means; but the negotiations fell through, owing to
                    the discords and jealousies then existing in the Government <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chron., X.</hi> 143). The following year Villani superintended the making of
                    Andrea Pisano’s bronze doors of the baptistery (see vol. xix. p. 122). In the
                    same year he watched over the raising of the campanile of the Badia, erected by
                    Cardinal Giovanni Orsini <hi rend="italic">(Chron.,</hi> x. 177). In 1341 the
                    acquisition of Lucca was again under treaty, this time with Martino della Scala,
                    for 250,000 florins. Villani was sent with others as a hostage to Ferrara, where
                    he remained for some months (xi. 130, 133, 135). He was present in Florence
                    during the unhappy period that elapsed between the entry of the duke of Athens
                    and his expulsion by the Florentines (xii. 1, 2, 8, 15, 16). Involved through no
                    fault of his own in the failure of the commercial company of the Bonaccorsi,
                    which in its turn had been drawn into the failure of the company of the Bardi
                    (1345), Villani towards the end of his life suffered much privation and for some
                    time was kept in prison.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Boccaccio.</p>
                <p>The idea of writing the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> was suggested to Villani
                    under the following circumstances. “In the year of Christ 1300 Pope Boniface
                    VIII. made in honour of Christ’s nativity a special and great indulgence. And I,
                    finding myself in that blessed pilgrimage in the holy city of Rome, seeing her
                    great and ancient remains, and reading the histories and great deeds of the
                    Romans as written by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Paulus Orosius, and
                    other masters of history who wrote the exploits and deeds, both great and small,
                    of the Romans and also of strangers in the whole world . . . considering that
                    our city of Florence, the daughter and offspring of Rome, is on the increase and
                    destined to do great things, as Rome is in her decline, it appeared to me
                    fitting to set down in this volume and new chronicle all the facts and
                    beginnings of the city of Florence, in as far as it has been possible to me to
                    collect and discover them, and to follow the doings of the Florentines at length
                    . . . and so in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this
                    book, in honour of God and of the blessed John, and in praise of our city of
                    Florence.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> bk. viii. ch. 36.</p></note> Villani’s work, written
                    in Italian, makes its appearance, so to say, unexpectedly in the historical
                    literature of Italy, just as the history of Florence, the moment it emerges from
                    the humble and uncertain origin assigned to it by legend, rises suddenly into a
                    rich and powerful life of thought and action. Nothing but scanty and partly
                    legendary records had preceded Villani’s work, which rests in part on them. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Gesta Florentinorum</hi> of Sanzanome, starting from these
                    vague origins, begins to be more definite about 1125, at the time of the union
                    of Fiesole with Florence. The <hi rend="italic">Chronica de Origine
                    Civitatis</hi> seems to be a compilation, made by various hands and at various
                    times, in which the different legends regarding the city’s origin have been
                    gradually collected. The <hi rend="italic">Annales Florentini Primi</hi>
                    (1110-1173) and the <hi rend="italic">Annales Florentini Secundi</hi>
                    (1107-1247), <pb break="no"

                    from 1197 to 1267, and another chronicle, formerly attributed, but apparently
                    without good reason, to Brunetto Latini, complete the series of ancient
                    Florentine records. To these must, however, be added a certain quantity of facts
                    which were to be found in various manuscripts, being used and quoted by the old
                    Florentine and Tuscan writers under the general name of <hi rend="italic">Gesta
                    Florentinorum.</hi> Another work which used to be reckoned among the sources of
                    Villani is the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of the Malespini</hi>; but very grave
                    doubts are now entertained as to its authenticity, and many hold that at best it
                    is merely a remodelling, posterior to Villani’s time, of old records unknown to
                    us, from whieh several chroniclers may have drawn, either without citing them at
                    all or only doing so in a vague manner. The <hi rend="italic">Cronaca
                    Fiorentina</hi> of Villani goes back to Biblical times and comes down to 1346.
                    The wide universality of the narrative, especially in the times near Villani’s
                    own, while it bears witness to the author’s extensive travels and to the
                    comprehensiveness of his mind, makes one also feel that the book was inspired
                    within the walls of the universal city. Whereas Dino Compagni’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is confined within definite limits of time and
                    place, this of Villani is a general chronicle extending over the whole of
                    Europe. Dino Compagni feels and lives in the facts of his history; Villani looks
                    at them and relates them calmly and fairly, with a serenity which makes him seem
                    an outsider, even when he is mixed up in them and is himself their originator.
                    While very important for Italian history in the 14th century, this work is the
                    cornerstone of the early mediaeval history of Florence. Of contemporary events
                    Villani has a very exact knowledge. Having been a sharer in the public affairs,
                    and in the intellectual and economic life, of his native city, at a time when in
                    both it had no rival in Europe, he depicts what he saw with the vividness
                    natural to a clear mind accustomed to business and to the observation of
                    mankind. He was Guelph, but without passion; and his book is much more taken up
                    with an inquiry into what is useful and true than with party considerations. He
                    is really a chronicler, not an historian, and has but little method in his
                    narrative, often reporting the things which occurred long ago and far off just
                    as he heard them and without criticism. Every now and then he falls into some
                    inaccuracy; but such defects as he has are largely compensated for by his
                    valuable qualities. He was for half a century eyewitness of his history, and
                    provides abundant information on the constitution of Florence, its customs,
                    industries, commerce, and arts; and among the chroniclers throughout Europe he
                    is perhaps unequalled for the value of the statistical data he has preserved. As
                    a writer Villani is clear and acute; and, though his prose has not the force and
                    colouring of Compagni, it has the advantage of greater simplicity, so that
                    taking his work as a whole he may be regarded as the greatest chronicler who has
                    written in Italian. The many difficulties connected with the publication of this
                    most important text have hitherto prevented the preparation of a perfect
                    edition. The Italian Historical Institute, lately founded, has, however,
                    undertaken to reprint on a wider scheme the great collection of Muratori.</p>
                <p>Villani’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> was continued by two other writers of
                    the same name. (1) <hi rend="smallcaps">Matteo Villani,</hi> his brother, of
                    whom nothing is known save that he was twice married, and that he died of the
                    plague in 1363, continued it down to the year of his death. Matteo’s work,
                    though inferior to Giovanni’s, is nevertheless very valuable. A more prolix
                    writer than his brother and a less acute observer, Matteo is well informed in
                    his facts, and for the years of which he writes is one of the most important
                    sources of Italian history. (2) <hi rend="smallcaps">Filippo Villani,</hi> the
                    son of Matteo, flourished in the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th
                    century. In his continuation, though showing greater literary ability, he is
                    very inferior as an historian to his predecessors. His most valuable work was a
                    collection of lives of illustrious Florentines. Twice, in 1401 and 1404, he was
                    chosen to explain in public the <hi rend="italic">Dimna Commedia</hi> in the
                    Florentine “studio.” The year of his death is unknown.</p>
