                    corporation, usually with the authority of a licence from the Chancery, the
                    vicar was the person appointed by the appropriators for the cure of souls in the
                    parish. He was at first generally a member of the corporation. After the
                    dissolution in the reign of Henry VIII. these appropriated benefices became —as
                    indeed they had been in the church in general up to the Lateran council of
                    1179—vested in lay impropriators,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Appropriation</hi> is the term for the

                    >impropriation</hi> for its possession by a layman.</p></note> but the legal
                    position of the vicar remained the same. He was not a parson in the proper sense
                    of the word (in fact parson and vicar are often distinguished in old statutes),
                    and his stipend was at the discretion of the impropriator. Where he had the
                    enjoyment of tithes, they were in most cases, apart from prescription, the small
                    as distinguished from the great tithes, that is, such as the impropriator found
                    it most difficult to collect. There was, however, no consistent rule in the
                    matter: what were rectorial tithes in some parishes might be vicarial in others.
                    The position of the vicar, at first so insecure and uncertain, was gradually
                    ameliorated by legislation. 15 Ric. II. c. 6 provided for the sufficient
                    endowment of the vicarage. 4 Hen. IV. c. 12 repeated this provision, and in
                    addition enacted that the vicar should be a secular priest, not removable at the
                    caprice of the appropriators, and canonically instituted and inducted. Among
                    numerous other Acts may be noticed 29 Car. II. c. 8, making perpetual temporary
                    augmentations of vicarages, and 3 Geo. IV. c. 72, enabling them to be in certain
                    cases converted into rectories. In Scotland vicarage teinds were the subject of
                    many Acts of the Scottish parliament. Until they became a fixed burden on the
                    land they were payable out of minor and accidental products, were established by
                    usage, and lost by negative prescription. 27 and 28 Vic. c. 33 provided for the
                    commutation of those vicarage teinds of fish which had not up to then been
                    commuted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Perpetual Curate.—</hi> Where a benefice was appropriated <hi
                    rend="italic">ad mensam monachorum</hi> or was from any other cause without the
                    services of a regular vicar, it did not fall within the statutes relating to
                    vicars, and was served by a temporary curate, generally a regular ecclesiastic
                    belonging to the appropriating corporation. After the dissolution the curate in
                    charge became perpetual, inasmuch as he could not be removed except by the
                    bishop. By 2 and 3 Vict. c. 49 every church or chapel augmented by the governors
                    of Queen Anne’s Bounty and having a district is a perpetual curacy; so, as a
                    rule, are new churches built under the Church Building Acts. By 31 and 32 Vict.
                    c. 117 the incumbent of every parish or new parish for ecclesiastical purposes,
                    not being a rector, is to be styled the vicar, and his benefice is to be
                    designated a vicarage. This Act only confers a more honourable name upon the
                    perpetual curate; it does not in any way alter his legal position.</p>

                    refused to hear objections to the confirmation by the dean and chapter of
