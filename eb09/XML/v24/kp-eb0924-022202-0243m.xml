                    bank of the Rhone, at the point where it is joined by the Gère, 19 miles S. of
                    Lyons by the railway to Marseilles. On the north, east, and south the town is
                    sheltered by low hills. Its site is an immense mass of ancient débris, which is
                    constantly yielding interesting antiquities. Along the Gère are traces of the
                    ramparts of the old Roman city; on Fort Pipet, to the east of the town, are the
                    remains of a theatre and citadel and some vestiges of a pantheon and an
                    amphitheatre; and in the interior of the town are two arches of a theatre and
                    the balustrade of a magnificent staircase. The ancient aqueducts, restored in
                    1822, still convey the waters of the Gère from a distance of 4 or 5 miles; and
                    there are several pieces of Roman road to be seen in the neighbourhood. The Plan
                    de 1’Aiguille, a truncated quadrangular pyramid 55 feet high, resting on a
                    portico with four arches, used to be pointed out as the tomb of Pontius Pilate
                    (who, according to tradition, died here), but it is now recognized as having
                    been part of the spina of a large circus, the outlines of which have been
                    traced. The temple of Augustus and Livia, a rectangular building of the
                    Corinthian order, was rebuilt at the end of the 2d century, and in the 5th
                    century was converted into a church. The “festival of reason” was celebrated in
                    it at <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0244-0223"/> the Revolution; and it has only lately been
                    restored, and the houses built against it cleared away. The museum in the
                    town-hall is very rich in antiquities. The cathedral of St Maurice, exhibiting
                    the finest Gothic architecture in Dauphiné, was begun at the end of the 12th
                    century in the Transitional Burgundian style, on the ruins of a church which had
                    been finished in 1107, and it was consecrated by Pope Innocent IV. in 1251.
                    There is neither apse nor transept, and the building (315 feet long, 118 wide,
                    and 89 high) is a singular mixture of the Romanesque and Gothic styles. The best
                    part is the façade, finished in 1533, which rises majestically from a terrace
                    overhanging the Rhone. Parts of the church of St André-le-Bas, which was used as
                    a chapel by the dukes of Burgundy, are as old as the 9th century, and most of it
                    was built in 1152. The church of St Peter, at present (1888) undergoing
                    restoration, is one of the oldest in France, dating from the 6th century; the
                    porch is in the most primitive Romanesque style; and the side walls, decorated
                    with two rows of arches resting on marble columns (9th century), are unique in
                    France. The steeple belongs to the 12th century, and the vaults were rebuilt by
                    Soufflot in the 18th century. Among the many tombs is that of St Mamert. In the
                    square fronting the town-hall is a statue of Ponsard the dramatist, who was born
                    at Vienne. The Gère supplies the motive power to numerous factories. About one
                    million yards of cloth are annually produced, and from 8000 to 9000 hides are
                    dressed. The other industrial establishments include a paper-mill, an iron and
                    copper foundry (400 men), iron-works, foundries, lapidaries’ workshops,
                    glass-works, brick-works, and calcining and refining furnaces in connexion with
                    the lead and zinc mines in the neighbourhood. Grain is an important article of
                    commerce. A suspension bridge connects Vienne with the right bank of the Rhone,
                    where the village of St Colombe occupies part of the site of the ancient town.
                    Near St Romain-en-Gal is a tower built by Philip of Valois to defend the right,
                    or French, bank, as distinguished from the left, which belonged to the empire.
                    The population in 1881 was 22,740 (commune 26,060), and in 1886 23,011 (commune
                    25,480).</p>
                <p>Vienne was originally the capital of the Allobroges, and was embellished and
                    fortified by Julius Caesar, who made it a colony. Tiberius granted the citizens
                    the <hi rend="italic">jus Italicum.</hi> The ramparts, pierced by five gates,
                    enclosed a lower, middle, and upper town. Vienne was the residence of a praetor,
                    had a senate, consuls, and a garrison of five legions, and was the seat of a
                    celebrated school. A bridge of five arches connected it with the new town on the
                    right bank. Postumus (see vol. xx. p. 776) was proclaimed Caesar here in 259,
                    and Vienne became the capital of a provincial empire, which under himself and
                    his successors, Victorinus and Tetricus, lasted fourteen years. Christianity was
                    introduced by St Crescens in the 2d century, and St Lupicin is named as the
                    first archbishop. The archbishops of Vienne all through the Middle Ages disputed
                    the title of primate of Gaul with those of Lyons. Vienne was conquered by the
                    Burgundians in 438, and sacked by the Lombards in 558 and by the Saracens in
                    737. It was one of the residences of Boso, king of Burgundy and Provence (879),
                    who died and was buried here. After the fall of the second kingdom of Burgundy,
                    Vienne became the chef-lieu of a county, for which the nobility and clergy
                    disputed, and which was finally seized by the counts of Albon. In 1349 Humbert
                    II. ceded Vienne with all Dauphiné to France. The town was sacked in 1562 by
                    Baron des Adrets, was claimed by both Roman Catholics and Protestants, but
                    declared for the League in 1590, and was compelled to surrender to the duke of
                    Montmorency, who destroyed the citadel and ramparts. The archbishopric was
                    suppressed in 1790. Vienne was the birthplace of St Julian (3d century); and
                    pope Calixtus II. (Guy of Burgundy; <hi rend="italic">ob.</hi> 1124) was one of
                    its archbishops.</p>
