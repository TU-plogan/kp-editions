                    Sainte-Beuve, in the rather ill-natured essay which he devoted to Vigny after
                    his death, expresses a doubt whether the title of count which the poet bore was
                    very well authenticated, and hints that no very ancient proofs of the nobility
                    of the family were forthcoming; but it is certain that in the 18th century
                    persons of the name occupied positions which were not open to any but men of
                    noble birth. For generations the ancestors of Alfred de Vigny had been soldiers,
                    and he himself joined the army at the age of sixteen. But the Revolutionary and
                    Napoleonic wars were over, and after twelve years of life in barracks he
                    retired, preserving, however, a very high estimate of the duties and career of
                    the soldier. While still serving he had made his mark by the publication in 1822
                    of a volume of poems, and in 1826 by another, together with the famous prose
                    romance of <hi rend="italic">Cinq-Mars.</hi> Sainte-Beuve asserts that the poet
                    antedated some of his most remarkable work. This may or may not be the case; he
                    certainly did not and could not antedate the publication, and it so happens that
                    some of his most celebrated books— <hi rend="italic">Eloa, Dolorida,
                    Moϊse,—</hi> appeared before the work of younger members of the Romantic school
                    whose productions strongly resemble these poems. It is quite certain that the
                    other Alfred—Alfred de Musset— felt the influence of his elder namesake, and an
                    impartial critic might discern no insignificant marks of the same effect in the
                    work of Hugo himself. Even Lamartine.</p>

                <p>considerably Vigny’s elder and his predecessor in poetry, seems rather to have
                    been guided by Vigny than Vigny by him. No one can read <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dolorida</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Le Cor</hi> without seeing that the author
                    had little to learn from any of his French contemporaries and much to teach
                    them. At the same time Vigny, either from indolence, or from fastidiousness, or
                    from being a “barren rascal,” or from fear of losing the high position which he
                    had gained, hardly attempted anything more in poetry proper during the more than
                    thirty years of his life, and his entire poems, including posthumous fragments,
                    form but one very small pocket volume. <hi rend="italic">Cinq-Mars,</hi> which
                    at least equalled the poems in popularity, will hardly stand the judgment of
                    posterity so well. It had in its favour the support of the Royalist party, the
                    immense vogue of the novels of Walter Scott, on which it was evidently modelled,
                    the advantages of an exquisite style, and the taste of the day for the romance
                    as opposed to the novel of analysis. It therefore gained a great name both in
                    France and abroad. But any one who has read it critically must acknowledge it to
                    be disappointing. The action is said to be dramatic; if it be so, it can only be
                    said that this proves very conclusively that the action of drama and the action
                    of the novel are two quite different things. To the reader who knows Scott or
                    Dumas the story is singularly uninteresting (far less interesting than as told
                    in history); the characters want life; and the book generally stagnates. Alfred
                    de Vigny’s admirable French and the quasi-poetical beauty of detached passages
                    alone save it from positive dulness. Its author, though always as a kind of
                    outsider (the phrase constantly applied to him in French literary essays and
                    histories being that he shut himself up in a “tour d’ivoire”), attached himself
                    more or less to the Romantic movement of 1830 and the years immediately
                    preceding and following it, and was stimulated by this movement both to drama
                    and to novel-writing. In the year before the revolution of July he produced at
                    the Théâtre Français a translation or rather paraphrase of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Othello,</hi> and an original piece, <hi rend="italic">Maréchale d'Ancre.</hi>
                    In 1832 he published the curious book <hi rend="italic">Stello,</hi> and in 1835
                    he brought out his drama of <hi rend="italic">Chatterton,</hi> which shocked
                    French taste even after five years of Romantic education, by the hero’s suicide,
                    but had a considerable success. The same year saw the publication of <hi
                    rend="italic">Servitude et Grandeur Militaires,</hi> a singular collection of
                    sketches rather than a connected work, in which Vigny’s military experience, his
                    idea of the soldier’s duties, and his rather poetical views of history were all
                    worked in. The subjects of <hi rend="italic">Chatterton</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Othello</hi> naturally suggest a certain familiarity with English,
                    and in fact Alfred de Vigny knew English well, lived in England for some time,
                    and married an Englishwoman. His father-in-law was, according to French gossip,
                    so conspicuous an example of insular eccentricity that he never could remember
                    his son-in-law’s name or anything about him, except that he was a poet, by which
                    fact and the kindness of casual Frenchmen who went through the list of the chief
                    living poets of their country he was sometimes able to discover his daughter’s
                    husband’s designation. In 1842 Alfred de Vigny was elected to the Academy, whose
                    meetings he frequented with an assiduity rather surprising in a man of such
                    retired habits and (still according to Sainte-Beuve) rather troublesome to his
                    colleagues. But he produced nothing save a few scraps; and, beyond the work
                    already enumerated, little has to be added except his <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    d'un Poète</hi> and the poems called <hi rend="italic">Les Destinées,</hi>
                    edited, with a few fragments, by M. Louis Ratisbonne immediately after his
                    death. Among his dramatic work, however, should be mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quitte pour la Peur</hi> and an adaptation of the <hi rend="italic">Merchant of
                    Venice</hi> called <hi rend="italic">Shylock. Les Destinées</hi> excited no
                    great admiration in France, but they contain some exceedingly beautiful poetry
                    of an austere kind, such as the magnificent speech of Nature in “La Maison du
                    Berger” and the remarkable poem entitled “La Colère de Samson.” Vigny died at
                    Paris on 17th September 1863.</p>
                <p>The later life of Alfred de Vigny was almost wholly uneventful, and for the most
                    part, as has been said, spent in retirement. His reputation, however, is
                    perfectly secure. It may, and probably will, rest only on his small volume of
                    poems, though it will not be lessened, as far as qualified literary criticism is
                    concerned, should the reader proceed to the rest of the work. The whole of his
                    non-dramatic verse does not amount to 5000 lines; it may be a good deal less.
                    But the range of subject is comparatively wide, and extraordinary felicity of
                    execution, not merely in language, but in thought, is evident throughout. Vigny,
                    as may be seen in the speech of Nature referred to above, had the secret,—very
                    uncommon with French poets,—of attaining solemnity without grandiosity, by means
                    of an almost classical precision and gravity of form. The defect of volubility,
                    of never leaving off, which mars to some extent his great contemporary Hugo, is
                    never present in him, and he is equally free from the looseness and disorders of
                    form which are sometimes blemishes in Musset, and from the effeminacy of
                    Lamartine, while once more his nobility of thought and plentifulness of matter
                    save him from the reproach which has been thought to rest on the technically
                    perfect work of Théophile Gautier. The dramatic work is, perhaps, less likely to
                    interest English than French readers, the local colour of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chatterton</hi> being entirely false, the sentiment conventional in the
                    extreme, and the real pathos of the story exchanged for a commonplace devotion
                    on the poet’s part to his host’s wife. In the same way, the finest passages of
                    <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> simply disappear in Vigny’s version. In his
                    remaining works the defect of skill in managing the plot and characters of prose
                    fiction, which has been noticed in <hi rend="italic">Cinq-Mars,</hi> reappears,
                    together (in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Journal d’un Ρoëte</hi> and
                    elsewhere) with signs of the fastidious and slightly affected temper which was
                    Vigny’s chief fault as a man. In his poems proper none of these faults appear,
                    and he is seen wholly at his best. It should be said that of his posthumous work
                    not a little had previously appeared piecemeal in the <hi rend="italic">Reime
                    des Deux Mondes,</hi> to which he was an occasional contributor. The prettiest
                    of the complete editions of his works (of which there are several) is to be
                    found in what is called the <hi rend="italic">Petite Bibliothèque
                    Charpentier.</hi> (G. SA. )</p>
