                    Marquis de</hi> (1715-1747), a moralist and miscellaneous writer of considerable
                    originality and power, was born at Aix in Provence on 6th August 1715. His
                    family was poor though noble; he was very badly educated; and his health was
                    weak. He, however, entered the army early and served for more than ten years,
                    taking part in the Italian campaign of 1736, and in the disastrous expedition to
                    Bohemia six years later in support of Frederick the Great’s designs on Silesia,
                    in which the French were abandoned by their ally. Vauvenargues suffered greatly
                    from the hardships of Belle-Isle’s winter retreat, and indeed never recovered
                    from them. He was also much troubled by his poverty, and in a private letter
                    written to a very intimate friend he discusses the possibility of obtaining a
                    loan from a certain rich acquaintance by undertaking, first to get his son into
                    his own regiment, or secondly to marry one of his daughters within a short time
                    and with only a reasonable dowry. Nevertheless Vauvenargues was, according to
                    the standard of that time, a most honourable man. Indeed he seems to have pushed
                    honour to the point of naivety, if it be true that, weary of waiting for
                    promotion, he addressed himself, not to any minister, or, more wisely still, to
                    some favourite, but to the king himself. This unsophisticated proceeding had of
                    course no result, and Vauvenargues threw up his commission, hoping—but
                    unsuccessfully— to obtain a post in the diplomatic service. His ill-luck pursued
                    him: for, having joined his family in Provence, he fell ill with a bad form of
                    smallpox, which still further weakened him. This was in 1744. He had, besides
                    the correspondence above referred to with a certain Μ. de Saint Vincens,
                    maintained one, still more interesting and likewise only recently known, with
                    the celebrated and eccentric Marquis de Mirabeau, the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Ami des Hommes,</hi> the father of the great Mirabeau. He had
                    also, when in garrison at Nancy, begun an exchange of letters with Voltaire, who
                    had a very high opinion of him, and this, with his natural inclinations,
                    determined him to <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Introduction à la Connaissance de l'Esprit Humain,</hi> with
                    certain <hi rend="italic">Réflexions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Maximes</hi>
                    appended. He died of lung disease at Paris on 28th May 1747.</p>
                <p>The bulk of Vauvenargues’s work is very small, but its interest is very
                    considerable. In the <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Réflexions,</hi> and in the minor fragments it consists, in fact,
                    of detached and somewhat desultory thoughts, in the style wherein the 18th
                    century so much delighted, on questions of moral philosophy and of literary
                    criticism. Sainte-Beuve has mildly said that as a literary critic Vauvenargues
                    “shows inexperience.” It would be truer to say that this part of his work has no
                    value or interest beyond that of curiosity. He had no knowledge of any language
                    but his own, and his literary criticism is limited to a repetition in crude form
                    of the stock ideas of his time. Thus he exaggerates immensely the value of
                    Racine and Boileau, but depreciates Corneille and even Molière. It is almost
                    sufficient to say that he blames Molière for choosing “des sujets si bas,” and
                    shows an entire ignorance of all French literature before the 17th century, and
                    of all other literature whatsoever, except a certain second-hand acquaintance
                    with the classics. As a writer he stands far higher. His style is indeed,
                    according to strict Academic judgment, somewhat incorrect, and when he attempts
                    rhetorical flourishes (which is not often) they have usually the artificial and
                    affected character—stilted or namby-pamby— which mars so much 18th-century work.
                    His strength, however, is not really in any way that of a man of letters, but
                    that of a moralist. Even here he is not superior to the weaknesses of his time.
                    In his day the anti-religious or anti-Christian movement of thought was not
                    fully declared, and he did not adopt the complete <hi rend="italic"
                    >philosophe</hi> attitude; in his letters, at any rate, he poses somewhat
                    ostentatiously as “neutral” between the religious and the anti-religious school.
                    In some of his maxims about politics there is also traceable the hollow and
                    confused jargon about tyrants and liberty which did so much to bring about, and
                    to embitter when brought about, the struggles of the Revolution. It is in morals
                    proper, in the discussion and application of general principles of conduct, that
                    Vauvenargues shines. No century has ever excelled the 18th in moral theory,
                    whatever may have been its deserts in respect of moral practice, and no
                    18th-century moralist has excelled Vauvenargues. He is not an exact
                    psychologist, much less a rigorous metaphysician. He has no worked-out or
                    workable theory of moral obligation or of the moral sense. His terminology is
                    merely popular and loose, and he hardly attempts the co-ordination of his ideas
                    into any system. His real strength is in a department which the French have
                    always cultivated with greater success than any other modern people,—the
                    expression in more or less epigrammatic language of the results of acute
                    observation of human conduct and motives. The chief distinction between
                    Vauvenargues and his great predecessor La Rochefoucauld is that Vauvenargues,
                    unlike La Rochefoucauld, thinks nobly of man, and is altogether inclined rather
                    to the Stoic than to the Epicurean theory. He has indeed been called a modern
                    Stoic, and, allowing for the vagueness of all such phrases, there is much to be
                    said for the description.</p>
                <p>An edition of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> of Vauvenargues, slightly
                    enlarged, appeared in the year of his death, and in part or in whole has been
                    frequently reprinted, all editions, however, being superseded by that of Μ.
                    Gilbert (2 vols., Paris, 1857), which contains the previously unpublished
                    correspondences above referred to and all other attainable matter, including
                    some <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> some “characters” in
                    imitation of Theophrastus and La Bruyère, and numerous short pieces of criticism
                    and moralizing. Vauvenargues has been frequently written about, the comments
                    best worth reading, besides those contained in Gilbert’s edition, being four
                    essays by Sainte-Beuve in <hi rend="italic">Causeries du Lundi,</hi> vols. iii.
                    and xiv.</p>
