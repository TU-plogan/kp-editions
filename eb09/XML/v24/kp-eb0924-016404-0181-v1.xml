                <p><label type="entry">VERGNIAUD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre
                        Victurnien</hi></label> (1753-1793), French orator and Revolutionist, was
                    born on 31st May 1753 at Limoges. He was the son of a merchant of that town, who
                    lost the greater part of his means by speculation. The boy was early sent to the
                    college of the Jesuits at Limoges, and soon achieved distinction. Turgot was
                    then intendant of Limousin. In his presence young Vergniaud on one occasion
                    recited some verses of his own composition. Turgot was struck with the talent
                    they displayed, and by virtue of his patronage Vergniaud, having gone to Paris,
                    was admitted to the College of Plessis. It is impossible to read the speeches of
                    Vergniaud without being convinced of the solidity of his education, and in
                    particular of the wide range of his knowledge of the classics, and of his
                    acquaintance—familiar and sympathetic—with ancient philosophy and history.</p>
                <p>Duputy, president of the parlement of Bordeaux, with whom Vergniaud became
                    acquainted, conceived the greatest admiration and affection for him and
                    appointed him his secretary. Vergniaud was thereafter called to the bar (1782).
                    The influence of Duputy gained for him the beginnings of a practice; but
                    Vergniaud, though capable of extraordinary efforts, too often relapsed into
                    reverie, and was indisposed for study and sustained exertion, even in a cause
                    which he approved. This weakness appears equally in his political and in his
                    professional life: he would refuse practice if his purse were moderately well
                    filled; he would sit for weeks in the assembly in listlessness and silence,
                    while the policy he had shaped was being gradually undermined, and then rise,
                    brilliant as ever, but too late to avert the calamities which he foresaw. In
                    1789 Vergniaud was elected a member of the general council of the department of
                    the Gironde. Being deeply stirred by the best ideas of the Revolutionary epoch,
                    he found a more congenial sphere for the display of his great powers in his new
                    position. About this period he was charged with the defence of a member of the
                    national guard of Brives, which was accused of provoking disorders in the
                    department of La Corrèze. Abandoning all reserve, Vergniaud delivered one of the
                    great orations of his life, depicting the misfortunes of the peasantry in
                    language of such combined dignity, pathos, and power that his fame as an orator
                    spread far and wide.</p>
                <p>By the self-denying ordinance of the constituent assembly France was deprived of
                    the whole talent and experience of its members in that new body—the legislative
                    assembly— for which they were declared ineligible; and the election of new men
                    was proceeded with. Vergniaud was chosen a representative of the Gironde in
                    August 1791, and he forthwith proceeded to Paris. The legislative assembly met
                    on 1st October. For a time, according to his habit, he refrained from speaking;
                    but on 25th October he ascended the tribune, and he had not spoken long before
                    the whole assembly felt that a new power had arisen which might control even the
                    destinies of France. This judgment was re-echoed outside, and he was almost
                    immediately elected president of the assembly for the usual brief term. Between
                    the outbreak of the Revolution and his election to the legislative assembly the
                    political views of Vergniaud had undergone a decided change. At first he had
                    lauded a constitutional monarchy; but the flight of Louis filled him with
                    distrust of the sovereign, and his views in favour of a republic were rapidly
                    developed. The sentiments and passions which his eloquence aroused were,
                    however, watchfully utilized by a more extreme party. It happened thus even with
                    his first assembly speech, on the <hi rend="italic">emigres.</hi> His proposal
                    was mainly that a treble annual contribution should be levied on their property;
                    but the assembly confiscated their goods and decreed their deaths. One great
                    blot on his reputation is that step by step he was led on to palliate violence
                    and crime, to the excesses of which his eyes were only opened by the massacres
                    of September, and which ultimately overwhelmed the party of Girondists which he
                    led. The disgrace to his name is indelible that on 19th March 1792, when the
                    perpetrators of the massacre of Avignon had been introduced to the assembly by
                    Collot d’Herbois, Vergniaud spoke indulgently of their crimes and lent the
                    authority of his voice to their amnesty. In language, sometimes turgid, but
                    nearly always of pure and powerful eloquence, he worked at the theme of the <pb

                    developed into that of the counter-revolution; and in his occasional appearances
                    in the tribune, as well as in the project of an address to the French people
                    which he presented to the assembly on 27th December 1791, he shook the heart of
                    France, and, especially by his call to arms on 18th January, shaped the policy
                    which culminated in the declaration of war against the king of Bohemia and
                    Hungary on 20th April. This policy in foreign affairs, which he pursued through
                    the winter and spring of 1791-92, he combined with another,—that of fanning the
                    suspicions of the people against the monarchy, which he identified with the
                    counter-revolution, and of forcing on a change of ministry. On 10th March
                    Vergniaud delivered a powerful oration in which he denounced the intrigues of
                    the court and uttered his famous apostrophe to the Tuileries: “In ancient times
                    fear and terror have often issued from that famous palace, let them re-enter it
                    to-day in the name of the law !” The speech overthrew De Lessart, whose
                    accusation was decreed; and Roland, the nominee of the Girondists, entered the
                    ministry. By the month of June the opposition of Vergniaud (whose voice still
                    commanded the country) to the king rose to fever heat. On 29th May Vergniaud
                    went so far as to support the disbanding of the king’s guard. But he appears to
                    have been unaware of the extent of the feelings of animosity which he had done
                    much to arouse in the people, probably because he was wholly unconnected with
                    the practices of the party of the Mountain as the instigators of actual
                    violence. This party used Vergniaud, whose lofty and serene ideas they applauded
                    and travestied in action. Then came the riot of the 20th of June and the
                    invasion of the Tuileries. He rushed among the crowd, but was powerless to quell
                    the tumult. Continuing for yet a little longer his course of feverous, almost
                    frenzied, opposition to the throne, on 3rd July he electrified France by his
                    bold denunciation of the king, not only as a hypocrite and a despot, but as a
                    base traitor to the constitution. His speeches breathe the very spirit of the
                    storm, and they were perhaps the greatest single factor in the development of
                    the events of the time. On the 10th of August the Tuileries was stormed, and the
                    royal family took refuge in the assembly. Vergniaud presided. To the request of
                    the king for protection he replied in dignified and respectful language. An
                    extraordinary commission was appointed: Vergniaud wrote and read its
                    recommendations that a national convention be formed, the king be provisionally
                    suspended from office, a governor appointed for his son, and the royal family be
                    consigned to the Luxembourg. Hardly had the great orator attained the object of
                    his aim, the overthrow of Louis as a sovereign, when he became conscious of the
                    awful forces by which he was surrounded, and his eyes were opened to the infamy
                    of their régime.</p>
                <p>The terrible revelation silenced him for a time. But the massacres of September
                    again unchained his eloquence. He denounced the massacres—their inception, their
                    horror, and the future to which they pointed—in language so vivid and powerful
                    that it raised for a time the spirits of the Girondists, while on the other hand
                    it aroused the fatal opposition of Robespierre and of his followers within and
                    without the convention.</p>
                <p>The questions whether Louis XVI. was to be judged, and if so by whom, were the
                    subject of protracted debate in the convention. They were of absorbing interest
                    to Paris, to France, and to Europe; and upon them the Girondist leader at last,
                    on 31st December 1792, broke silence, delivering one of his greatest orations,
                    probably one of the greatest combinations of sound reasoning, sagacity, and
                    eloquence which has ever been displayed in the annals of French politics. He
                    pronounced in favour of an appeal to the people. He pictured the consequences of
                    that temper of vengeance which animated the Parisian mob, and was fatally
                    controlling the policy of the convention, and the prostration which would ensue
                    to France after even a successful struggle with a European coalition, which
                    would spring-up after the murder of the king. The great effort failed; and four
                    days afterwards something happened which still further endangered Vergniaud and
                    his whole party. This was the discovery of a note signed by him along with
                    Gaudet and Gensonné and presented to the king two or three weeks before the 10th
                    of August. It contained nothing but sound and patriotic suggestions; but it was
                    greedily seized upon by the enemies of the Gironde as evidence of treason. On
                    16th January 1793 the vote began to be taken in the convention upon the
                    punishment of the king. Vergniaud voted early, and voted for death. The action
                    of the great Girondist was and will always remain inscrutable; but it was
                    followed by a similar verdict from nearly the whole party which he led. On the
                    17th Vergniaud presided at the convention and it fell to him, labouring under
                    the most painful excitement, to announce the fatal result of the voting. Then
                    for many weeks he sank, exhausted, into silence.</p>
                <p>When the institution of a revolutionary tribunal was proposed by the
                    Robespierrists, Vergniaud vehemently opposed the project, denouncing the
                    tribunal as a more awful inquisition than that of Venice, and avowing that his
                    party would all die rather than consent to it. Their death by stratagem had
                    already been planned, and on 10th March they had to go into hiding. On the 13th
                    Vergniaud boldly exposed the conspiracy in the convention, taking occasion to
                    discuss the profanation by the extremists of the name of liberty, and
                    distinguishing between a true and spurious equality, employing with reference to
                    the latter his famous simile of the bed of Procrustes. The antagonism caused by
                    such an attitude had reached a significant point when on 10th April Robespierre
                    himself laid his accusation before the convention. He fastened especially upon
                    Vergniaud’s letter to the king and his support of the appeal to the people as a
                    proof that he was a moderate in its then despised sense. Vergniaud made a
                    brilliant extemporaneous reply, and the attack for the moment failed. But now,
                    night after night, Vergniaud and his colleagues found themselves obliged to
                    change their abode, to avoid assassination, a price being even put upon their
                    heads. Still with unfaltering courage they continued their resistance to the
                    dominant faction, till on the 2d of June 1793 things came to a head. The
                    convention was surrounded with an armed mob, who clamoured for the “twenty-two.”
                    In the midst of this it was forced to continue its deliberations. The decree of
                    accusation was voted, and the Girondists were proscribed.</p>
                <p>Vergniaud was offered a safe retreat. He accepted it only for a day, and then
                    returned to his own dwelling. He was kept under surveillance there for nearly a
                    month, and in the early days of July was imprisoned in La Force. He carried
                    poison with him, but never used it. His tender affection for his relatives
                    abundantly appears from his correspondence, along with his profound attachment
                    to the great ideas of the Revolution, and his noble love of country. On one of
                    the walls of the Carmelite convent, to which for a short time the prisoners were
                    removed, Vergniaud wrote in letters of blood—“Potius mori quain foedari.” Early
                    in October the convention brought forward its indictment of the twenty-two
                    Girondists. They were sent for trial to the Revolutionary tribunal, before which
                    they appeared on the 27th of October. The procedure was a travesty of justice.
                    Conscious of innocence, but certain of death, Vergniaud preserved silence, and
                    his example was largely followed by his companions. By the end of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0183-0166"/> the fourth day of trial it became evident
                    that the demeanour of the prisoners was touching the hearts of the people and
                    making them relent. Then suddenly came the order from the alarmed committee of
                    safety to bring the proceedings to an end. Gensonné demanded to be heard in
                    defence of the prisoners. This was refused; a verdict of guilty followed, and a
                    sentence of death. Valazé stabbed himself to the heart and fell dead among his
                    comrades. They were conducted to the conciergerie, which they entered singing
                    the Marseillaise. Early on the following morning, 31st October 1793, they were
                    conveyed to the scaffold, again singing on the way the national chant, and
                    keeping up the strain till one by one they were guillotined. Vergniaud was
                    executed last. (T. S.)</p>
