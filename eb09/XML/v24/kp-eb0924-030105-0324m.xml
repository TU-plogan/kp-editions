                <p><label type="entry">VULTURE</label>, the name of certain birds whose best-known
                    characteristic is that of feeding upon carcases, and these birds, owing to this
                    obscene habit, are in many hot countries regarded with favour as useful
                    scavengers. The genus <hi rend="italic">Vultur,</hi> as instituted by Linnaeus,
                    is now restricted by ornithologists to a single species, <hi rend="italic">V.
                    monachus,</hi> of which more presently, the other species included therein by
                    him, or thereto referred by succeeding systematists, being elsewhere relegated
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lämmergeyer);</hi> but the most
                    important taxonomic change that has been introduced is that by Prof. Huxley <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, pp. 462-464), who pointed out the
                    complete structural difference between the Vultures of the New World and those
                    of the Old, regarding the former as constituting a distinct Family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cathartidae</hi> (which, however, would be more properly named <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarcorhamphidse),</hi> while he united the latter with <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0325-0302"/> the ordinary diurnal Birds-of-Prey as <hi
                    rend="italic">Gypaetidae.</hi> This arrangement seems to overlook the
                    signification of some considerable distinctions, and to the present writer it
                    would appear more reasonable to recognize the existence of a Family <hi
                    rend="italic">Vulturidae,</hi> confined to the true Vultures of the Ancient
                    Continent, equal in rank to the <hi rend="italic">Falconidae,</hi> while fully
                    admitting the claim made on behalf of the New-World forms for the same
                    standing.</p>
                <p>The American Vulture may be said to include four genera :—(1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarcorhamphus,</hi> the gigantic Condor, the male distinguished by a large
                    fleshy comb and wattles; (2) <hi rend="italic">Gypagus,</hi> the King-Vulture,
                    with its gaudily-coloured head and nasal caruncle; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catharista,</hi> containing the so-called Turkey-Buzzard of English-speaking
                    Americans with its allies; and (4) <hi rend="italic">Pseudogryphus,</hi> the
                    great Californian Vulture—of very limited range on the western slopes of North
                    America, and threatened with speedy extinction through the use of poison. Though
                    all these birds are structurally so different from the true Vultures of the Old
                    World, in habits the <hi rend="italic">Vulturidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarcorhamphidae</hi> are much alike, and of several of the latter—</p>
                <p>particularly of the Condor and the Turkey-Buzzard—we possess rather elaborate
                    accounts by excellent observers, as Darwin, Alexander Wilson, and Mr Gosse—whose
                    works are readily accessible.</p>
                <p>The true Vultures of the Old World, <hi rend="italic">Vulturidae</hi> in the
                    restricted sense, are generally divided into five or six genera, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">Neophron</hi> has been not unjustifiably separated as forming a
                    distinct Subfamily, <hi rend="italic">Neophroninae,—</hi> its members, of
                    comparatively small size, differing both in structure and habit considerably
                    from the rest One of them is the so-called Egyptian Vulture or Pharaoh’s Hen,
                    <hi rend="italic">N. percnopterus,</hi> a bird whose delicacy of build and
                    appearance contrast forcibly with its choice of the most filthy kind of food. It
                    is a well-known species in some parts of India,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the eastern part of the Indian peninsula
                    it is replaced by a smaller race or (according to some authorities) species, <hi
                    rend="italic">N. gingianus,</hi> which has a yellow instead of a black
                    bill.</p></note> and thence westward to Africa, where it has an extensive range.
                    It also occurs on the northern shores of the Mediterranean, and on three
                    occasions has strayed to such a distance from its usual haunts as to have twice
                    suffered capture in England, and once even in Norway. Of the genera composing
                    the other Subfamily, <hi rend="italic">Vulturinae,</hi> space is wanting to say
                    much. <hi rend="italic">Gyps</hi> numbers seven or eight local species and
                    races, on more than one of which the English name Griffon has been fastened. The
                    best known is <hi rend="italic">G. fulυus,</hi> which by some authors is
                    accounted “British,” from an example having been taken in Ireland, though under
                    circumstances which suggest its appearance so far from its nearest home in Spain
                    to be due to man’s intervention. The species, however, has a wider distribution
                    on the European continent (especially towards the north-east) than the Egyptian
                    Vulture, and in Africa nearly reaches the Equator, extending also in Asia to the
                    Himalaya; but both in the Ethiopian and Indian Regions its range inosculates
                    with that of several allied forms or species. <hi rend="italic">Pseudogyps</hi>
                    with two forms—one Indian, the other African—differs from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gyps</hi> by having 12 instead of 14 rectrices. Of the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otogyps</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lophogyps</hi> nothing here need be said;
                    and then we have <hi rend="italic">Vultur,</hi> with, as mentioned before, its
                    sole representative, <hi rend="italic">V. monachus,</hi> commonly known as the
                    Cinereous Vulture, a bird which is found from the Straits of Gibraltar to the
                    sea-coast of China.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    geographical range of the various species of Vultures has been exhaustively
                    treated by Mr Sharpe (<hi rend="italic">Journ. Linn. Society,</hi> Zoology,
                    xiii. pp. 1-26, pls. i.-ix.).</p></note> Almost all these birds inhabit rocky
                    cliffs, on the ledges of which they build their nests.</p>
                <p>The question whether Vultures in their search for food are guided by sight of the
                    object or by its scent has long excited much interest, and the advocates of
                    either opinion have warmly contended in its behalf. Without denying to them the
                    olfactory faculty, it seems to be now generally admitted, notwithstanding the
                    assertions to the contrary of Waterton and a few more, that the sense of sight
                    is in almost every case sufficient to account for the observed facts. It is
                    known that, directly a camel or other beast of burden drops dead, as the caravan
                    to which it belonged is making its way across the desert, Vultures of one sort
                    or another appear, often in considerable numbers, though none had before been
                    observed by the ordinary traveller, and speedily devour the carcase over which
                    they are gathered together. The mode in which communication is effected between
                    the birds, which are soaring at an immense height, seems at first inexplicable,
                    but Canon Tristram has suggested (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 280) the
                    following simple solution of the supposed mystery :—</p>
                <p>“The Griffon who first descries his quarry descends from his elevation at once.
                    Another, sweeping the horizon at a still greater distance, observes his
                    neighbour’s movements and follows his course. A third, still further removed,
                    follows the flight of the second; he is traced by another; and so a perpetual
                    succession is kept up so long as a morsel of flesh remains over which to
                    consort. I can conceive no other mode of accounting for the number of Vultures
                    which in the course of a few hours will gather over a carcase, when previously
                    the horizon might have been scanned in vain for more than one, or at the most
                    two, in sight.”</p>
                <p>The Canon goes on to suppose that in this way may be explained the enormous
                    congregation of Vultures in the Crimea during the siege of Sevastopol, where
                    they had before been scarce :—“the habit of watching the movements of their
                    neighbours” may “have collected the whole race from the Caucasus and Asia Minor
                    ”—he might have added the Balkans—“to enjoy so unwonted an abundance.” Doubt may
                    be entertained whether the last supposition be correct, but none as to the
                    accuracy of the first. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
