                    Calvinist, the strict Lutherans of the Palatinate caused him once more to become
                    a wanderer. In 1578 he settled at Leyden as student of theology in the
                    university, and finally as pastor at Dort, where he died in 1586, leaving Gerard
                    an orphan. Here the boy received his education, until he entered the theological
                    college and then the university of Leyden. He there became the lifelong bosom
                    friend of Hugo Grotius, and pursued with great zest the study of the classics,
                    Hebrew, ecclesiastical history, and theology. In 1600 he was made rector of the
                    high school at Dort, where he devoted himself to philology and historical
                    theology. From 1614 to 1619 he filled the office of director of the theological
                    college at Leyden. The moderation of his theological views and his abstention
                    from controversy brought him under the suspicion of heresy, in consequence of
                    which he escaped expulsion from his office only by resignation (1619). The year
                    before he had published his valuable work the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Pelagiana,</hi> which his enemies considered favoured the views of the Arminians
                    or Remonstrants. But in the year 1622 he <pb break="no"

                    and chronology, and subsequently of Greek, in the university. In 1624 the
                    university of Cambridge offered him a professorship, which he declined. Two
                    years afterwards another unsuccessful effort was made to induce him to settle in
                    England, but he accepted from Archbishop Laud a prebend in Canterbury cathedral
                    of the value of £100 per annum, without residence, coming over to England to be
                    installed in 1629, when he was made LL.D, at Oxford. In 1632 he left Leyden to
                    take the post of professor of history in the newly founded Athenaeum at
                    Amsterdam, which he held till his death, March 17, 1649.</p>
                <p>He was one of the great scholars of the world, and his character added lustre to
                    his learning. His works, of which a complete edition appeared at Amsterdam,
                    1695-1701, in 6 vols, fol., are philological, historical, and theological. He
                    made invaluable contributions to the correct study of Latin grammar and of the
                    Greek and Latin historians. He was amongst the first to treat theological dogmas
                    and the heathen religions from the historical point of view. His principal works
