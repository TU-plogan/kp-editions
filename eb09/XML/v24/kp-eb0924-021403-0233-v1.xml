                <p><label type="entry">VICTOR EMMANUEL</label> (1820-1878), king of Italy, born at
                    Turin on 14th March 1820, was the son of Charles Albert, prince of Carignano,
                    who in 1831 became king of Sardinia. He was brought up with some severity and as
                    a strict Catholic; but it was not found possible to interest him in study or
                    intellectual pursuits. In 1842 he was married to Adelaide, daughter of the
                    Austrian grand-duke Rainer, his father at that time desiring to improve his
                    relations with Austria. The young man took no part in politics, but showed from
                    the first the characteristics of an energetic soldier. After the Austrian
                    occupation of Ferrara in 1847 he was among those who pressed for an immediate
                    declaration of war; and, when a year later hostilities broke out, he threw
                    himself into the struggle heart and soul. At Goito, where he was wounded, his
                    reckless bravery turned the tide of battle; and in every encounter he was to be
                    seen in the thickest of the fight. During the armistice that followed the defeat
                    of Custozza (25th July) he was engaged in the reorganization of the Sardinian
                    army. The abdication of his father on the evening of the battle of Novara (23d
                    March 1849) made him king of a ruined state. From Radetzky he obtained some
                    mitigation of the hard terms at first demanded by the conqueror, especially in
                    the withdrawal of the Austrian claim that the Sardinian constitution should be
                    abolished. It was the maintenance of this constitution, at a time when reaction
                    swept away every other vestige of representative government in Italy, that
                    gained for Victor Emmanuel the title of the honest king <hi rend="italic">(re
                        galantuomo)</hi> and won for him the confidence of the Italian nation, and
                    ultimately the Italian crown. In the bitter days that followed Novara, the king,
                    calumniated, misunderstood, and charged like his father with treachery, showed a
                    noble forbearance and a self-mastery that could hardly have been expected from
                    his passionate uncultured nature. Though in D’Azeglio and Balbo he had excellent
                    friends and advisers, it was not till 1852 that the accession of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Cavour</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> to power gave him
                    a man of great political genius for his guide. From that time the career of
                    Victor Emmanuel became what Cavour made it. While ecclesiastical reforms, which
                    brought upon the king and minister the execration of the church, laid the
                    foundation for all future social and economical advance, the alliance of
                    Sardinia with England and France in the Crimean War secured for Italy the
                    interest of the Western powers, which Austria by its inaction and its
                    half-measures had forfeited. Meanwhile his mother, his wife, and his brother
                    died within four weeks of each other; and the clericals exulted in this
                    manifestation of an offended Providence. At the end of 1855, while the allied
                    troops were still in the East, Victor Emmanuel visited Paris and London. In 1859
                    Cavour’s object was attained and France united with Sardinia against Austria,
                    the king, sorely against his will, giving his daughter Clotilda in marriage to
                    Jerome Napoleon. Victor Emmanuel met Napoleon III. at Genoa on 13th May, and on
                    the 30th fought at the head of a body of Sardinians and Zouaves at the battle of
                    Palestro. After the victory of Magenta (4th June) the allied monarchs entered
                    Milan, where Victor Emmanuel for the first time saw Garibaldi. In the crowning
                    victory of 24th June, while the French were engaged at Solferino, the king with
                    his Italians carried the village of San Martino. The peace of Villafranca left
                    Venetia and the Quadrilateral to Austria. The extraordinary events of the next
                    year united all Italy, with the exception of Rome and of what still remained to
                    Austria, under the patriot king, who was now excommunicated by the pope (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Italy,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 490). A scene of great violence
                    had passed between the king and Cavour when the peace of Villafranca was
                    accepted by the former; but their old friendship was soon restored, and the
                    death of Cavour in 1861 plunged Victor Emmanuel in the deepest grief. The
                    Prussian alliance of 1866 incorporated Venetia with Italy. The personal desire
                    of the king to assist Napoleon III. in the war of 1870 gave way before the wiser
                    counsels of his ministers; and the entry of his troops into Rome after the
                    disasters of the French army and the withdrawal of the French garrison completed
                    Victor Emmanuel’s task and the union of Italy. He lived <pb break="no"
