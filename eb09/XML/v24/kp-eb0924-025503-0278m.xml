                <p><label type="entry">VIRGINIA</label>, one of the original thirteen States of the
                    North American Union, extends from 36° 31' to 39° 27' N. lat., and from 75° 13'
                    to 83° 37' W. long. It is rudely triangular in form,—its southern boundary, the
                    base of the triangle, a nearly east to west line, being 440 miles long, the
                    north-western 565, the northern and north-eastern 230 and the eastern 125 miles.
                    On the S. it is bounded by North Carolina and Tennessee, on the W. and N.W. by

                    the Atlantic Ocean. Its greatest length from east to west is 476 miles, its
                    greatest breadth from north to south 192 miles. It is subdivided into 100
                    counties. The area is variously stated at about 44,500 and 42,450 square miles;
                    the latter extent is that given at the census of 1880. Of the 1,512,565
                    inhabitants of Virginia (1,059,034 of them over ten years of age) in 1880,
                    494,240 were engaged in gainful occupations,—254,099, or over 50 per cent., in
                    agriculture, 30,418 in trade and transportation, and 63,059 in manufactures and
                    mining and mechanical industries; but now (in 1888) a very much larger
                    proportion of the industrial population is engaged in mining, manufacturing,
                    trade, and transportation, in consequence of the opening of mines, the erection
                    of blast-furnaces, coke ovens, and various manufacturing establishments since
                    1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> Speaking broadly, Virginia may be
                    divided into a lowland and a highland country. Its south eastern part—over
                    23,000 square miles, or more than half of the whole—has the aspect of a broadly
                    undulating plain, that, with but few marked variations of relief, rises from the
                    sea-level to from 400 to 800 feet above it. The north-western portion is a
                    region composed of approximately parallel mountain ranges, running entirely
                    across the State from north-east to south-west, separated by nearly parallel
                    valleys,—the whole presenting all the varieties of relief peculiar to the
                    Appalachian country between the levels of 800 and 5700 feet. To speak more
                    accurately, the State is naturally divided into seven grand divisions or belts,
                    each with marked characteristics of relief and geological structure, and each
                    succeeding the other, somewhat as a more or less ascending stairway, from the
                    sea to the north-west.</p>
                <p>1. Tidewater Virginia is the marine plain, of Quaternary and Tertiary structure,
                    10,850 square miles in area, that extends westward, for nearly 100 miles, from
                    the Atlantic border to “The Ridge,” the granitic escarpment which by its rise
                    determines the tidal limit in the great rivers of the State. This Tidewater
                    plain, rectangular in form, is divided by Chesapeake Bay and the great estuaries
                    of the Potomac, the Rappahannock, the York, and the James rivers, into five
                    large peninsulas, which are subdivided by arms of the bay and tidal branches of
                    the rivers into hundreds of smaller peninsulas, thus giving to the region great
                    wealth of tidal shore outline—fully 2000 miles—so that nearly every square mile
                    of its surface can be reached by tide-borne vessels. The nearly level surface of
                    its north to south trending peninsulas, those of the eastern marine plain, the
                    Quaternary ones, averages about 12 feet above sea-level; their low-lying
                    semi-insular position and their warm finely comminuted soils make these the
                    highly favoured great market-garden or “trucking” portions of Tidewater. The
                    north-west to south-east trending peninsulas, those of the western marine plain,
                    the Tertiary ones, have more broken surfaces that vary in altitude from sealevel
                    to about 100 feet, and are disposed in flat watershed ridges and slopes,
                    terraces, and swamps, all deeply trenched by the secondary drainage.</p>
                <p>2. Midland Virginia is the triangular area (12,470 square miles) which, 25 miles
                    wide along the Potomac and 100 wide along the North Carolina line, extends from
                    the Tidewater escarpment westward to the eastern base of the Atlantic coast
                    range, the broken eastern range of the Appalachian Mountains. The elevation here
                    varies from 100 to 200 feet above sea-level in the east to from 700 to 800 in
                    the west; once a gently eastwardly sloping plain, mostly underlaid by steeply
                    dipping granitic and other Archaean rocks—with included areas of Jura-Trias—
                    striking north-east to south-west, the rivers have deeply trenched into this,
                    and so given it a greatly broken and varied relief through a moderate range of
                    altitude; it abounds in stream-valleys. This, with Piedmont and the Blue Ridge,
                    was the first dry land, the oldest portion of Virginia.</p>
                <p>3. Piedmont Virginia is the area (6680 square miles) of greatly diversified
                    country, some 250 miles in length and 20 to 30 miles in width, that stretches
                    between the Blue Ridge and the Coast Range mountains, including all of the
                    latter and the eastward spurs and slopes of the former; its valleys, coves, and
                    plains vary in altitude from 300 to 700 feet in the north-east to from 500 to
                    1000 in the south-west, while its included and bordering mountains range through
                    all gradations from above 4000 feet down to the levels of its valleys. It is
                    charmingly varied and picturesque, and adapted to a great variety of
                    productions.</p>
                <p>4. Blue Ridge Virginia is the Virginian portion (300 miles in length) of the
                    great mountain chain of that name, with its numerous tablelands—especially the
                    Floyd-Carroll-Grayson plateau (1230 square miles) in the south-west, having an
                    altitude of from 916 to 5700 feet. It is, for most of its length, a chain of two
                    ranges: the eastern, the chief, in which numerous rivers have their origin, is a
                    grand mountain mass, carved from the Archaean and eruptive rocks, forming the
                    most striking feature of thousands of square miles of Virginia landscape; the
                    western is mainly composed of short ridges, formed from the easterly outcrops of
                    the Palaeozoic rocks, flanking the western slopes of the main range.</p>
                <p>5. The Valley of Virginia is the Virginian portion (300 miles) of the length of
                    the great limestone or Appalachian valley of the Atlantic highlands, one that,
                    made up of numerous subordinate valleys, extends with unbroken continuity from
                    Canada to Alabama, and has for its whole length, with varying local names, the
                    Blue Ridge on its eastern and the Kittatinny or Great North Mountain on its
                    western border. In Virginia this is a plateau-valley,— embracing 7550 square
                    miles,—its greatly varied tillable surface ranging in altitude from about 500 to
                    over 2500 feet and averaging fully 1000. Carved from the limestones and limy
                    shales and slates of the Cambrian group into an almost endless variety of valley
                    and upland forms, the higher ones in gracefully rounded outline, all blending
                    into one or more broad valleys, and bounded by grand mountain chains, this is
                    indisputably one of the most desirable regions in the United States.</p>
                <p>6. Appalachia (4500 square miles), a region of alternating “rich” and “poor”
                    valleys (according as they are carved from the lime-abounding or from the slaty
                    sandstone rocks of the Silurian or the Devonian groups), is Virginia’s portion
                    of the Appalachian Mountains region proper, the one that lies between the Great
                    Valley on the east and the great Carboniferous escarpment of the
                    Trans-Appalachia plateau. Its general features are repetitions of long,
                    parallel, straight, and level-crested mountain ranges— many of them over 4000
                    feet—succeeding one another in echelon, with narrow, trough-like
                    valleys,—ranging from 800 to 2700 feet,—but these are diversified by the
                    occasional dying out of some mountain ranges and the consequent widening of
                    valleys, and by the widening of ranges into plateaus or their opening into
                    double crests or lovely mountain “coves” and “gardens.” It is a noted grazing
                    and timber region.</p>
                <p>7. Trans-Appalachia (mainly the 1200 square miles in Buchanan, Dickenson, and
                    Wise counties) is the Virginian portion of the tableland that extends westward
                    from the great Carboniferous escarpment or Alleghany “backbone.” It is eroded
                    from the Carboniferous rocks, and so is the great coal-bearing portion of the
                    State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate. —</hi> The State lies in the middle latitudes. It is
                    open to the sea on the east; its great mountain chains guard it on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"

                    a climate of means as any of the Atlantic-bordering States can have. Its
                    position and physical structure also give great variety to its climate: that of
                    its bordering sea islands and large peninsulas is insular; that of its great
                    Tidewater and Midland plains is warm temperate; that of Piedmont and the Great
                    Valley is typically mild temperate; and that of the Blue Ridge plateau and of
                    the high valleys and tablelands of Appalachia is more uniformly cool temperate
                    than in higher latitudes. Its climatic range, in the average latitude of 38° N.,
                    is from the sea-coast to 500 miles inland, and from the sea-level to 5700 feet,
                    a range that is equivalent to 19° of latitude, and that gives to Virginia all
                    the adaptations for production embraced between 36° 30' and 59° N. lat. This
                    wide range finds expression in the market-gardens and temperate fruits and trees
                    and the extensive sweet potato, cotton, and peanut fields of Tidewater; in the
                    large plantations of tobacco, hard-grained winter wheat, and the dented-seed
                    (the large variety) Indian corn, and in great forests of pitch-pines, oaks,
                    &amp;c., in Midland and Piedmont, and in the lower portions of the Valley and
                    Appalachia; in the productive vineyards and orchards of Piedmont and the
                    adjacent slopes of the Blue Ridge; in the perennial pasture-lands—the native
                    homes of the rich blue grass—of the higher levels of Piedmont, of the crests and
                    plateaus of the eastern Blue Ridge, of the Great Valley, and of the extensive
                    limestone valleys and ridges of Appalachia; in the large cereal crops and dairy
                    products of the Valley; in the big cattle farms and ranges of Appalachia, the
                    Blue Ridge, and the more elevated parts of the Valley; in the flax, buckwheat,
                    Irish potato, cabbage, and other north-country crops that flourish in the Blue
                    Ridge, the higher parts of the Valley, and Appalachia; and in the north-land
                    balsams and other cold climate trees and vegetation that clothe the higher
                    levels of the Blue Ridge and of Appalachia.</p>
                <p>The mean annual temperature zones of Virginia are—60° to 65° in eastern
                    Tidewater; 55° to 60° in western Tidewater, and most of Midland; 50° to 55° in
                    the higher parts of Midland, in most of Piedmont, and in the lower parts of the
                    Valley and Appalachia; 45° to 50° in north-east Piedmont, in most of the Valley,
                    and in the lower valleys of Appalachia; and 40° to 45° on the Blue Ridge, on and
                    near the high levels of the Valley, and in most of Appalachia. The average for
                    the State is near 56°, ranging from 48° in the highlands to 64° in the
                    lowlands—from the mean adapted to grass to that suitable for cotton. The changes
                    of temperature are great, but not so sudden or so extreme as they are in the
                    regions to the north-east and north-west.</p>
                <p>The prevailing winds are from the south quadrants, generally shifting between
                    south and west; next in frequency are those between north and west; high winds
                    are rare, except along the coast. The rainfall is abundant and well distributed
                    throughout the seasons in every part, there being two sources of supply, one
                    from the Gulf by the south-west and one from the Atlantic by the south-east
                    winds; the average annual precipitation is from 32 to 44 inches, except in a
                    belt extending north-west from the mouth of Chesapeake Bay towards Staunton, in
                    which it is from 44 to 56 inches; there is a gradual decrease in the rainfall
                    from the coast westward. The snowfall is generally light, some winters
                    insignificant; and the snow soon melts, save in the elevated regions.</p>
                <p>Virginia is noted for the clearness of its skies, the purity of its air, and its
                    freedom from great storms. Its climate is moist without being damp, and so mild
                    as to invite to living much in the open air; its winters are short, its periods
                    of seedtime and harvest long; and its healthfulness is attested by the vigour
                    and longevity of its people.</p>

                    equivalent formations as numbered and used by the Rogers Brothers in the

                <p>As the accompanying geological map shows, Midland, Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge
                    grand divisions, over 20,000 square miles, or about half the land area of the
                    State, are underlain by the Archaean or old Primary and metamorphic rocks;
                    within this Archaean area are a dozen or more patches, large and small, of the
                    Jura-Trias (formations 16, 17, and 18) or Mesozoic rocks, some of them with
                    valuable coal-beds, that in later times were deposited in depressions, lake-like
                    basins, in the Archaean rocks. The Cambrian (Lower Silurian) areas, the Virginia
                    formations i., ii., and iii., include all the Great Valley (limestone) and
                    numerous limestone valleys of Appalachia, some of them, like that of Clinch
                    river, quite large—in all some 10,000 square miles of surface—having within them
                    detached mountain ranges of more recent formations. The Silurian (Upper
                    Silurian) areas, those where the Virginia formations iv., v., vi., and vii.
                    outcrop, are mountain ranges, detached once in the Great Valley, and ranges and
                    chains of them in Appalachia, for these formations, made up largely of massive
                    sand-rocks, are mountain-builders. The Devonian areas, Virginia formations viii.
                    and ix., are principally those of the slaty or “poor” valleys of Appalachia, No.
                    viii. being a formation from which stream-valleys are liberally carved, though
                    ix., chiefly sand-rocks, often holds it up to included or bordering ridges. The
                    Lower and the Middle Carboniferous rocks, Virginia formations x. and xi.,
                    outcrop in long and narrow belts or strips of Greenbrier shales and limestones
                    (xi.), and adjacent narrow and long mountain ranges of Montgomery grits and
                    coal-measures (x.), in soutli-west portions of the Valley and of Appalachia, and
                    in small mountain areas elsewhere in Appalachia. The Upper Carboniferous,
                    Virginia formations xii. and xiii., the Lower (xii.) and the Middle (xiii.) Coal
                    groups, underlie all the thousand square miles of Trans-Appalachia, where the
                    semi-bituminous coking coals of the Lower Coal group are exposed, above
                    water-level, in their best conditions of purity (high in carbon, low in volatile
                    matter, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"

                    metallurgical purposes, and in beds of remarkable thickness, and where the
                    bituminous coals of the Middle Coal group also have a maximum of development
                    combined with remarkable purity of composition, adapting them to gas and
                    domestic uses. Tertiary rocks (19α, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> c) underlie all
                    Tidewater (the new Virginia of geology, though the old one of colonial
                    history),—the Lower or Eocene outcropping, approximately, in a line a little
                    west of 77° W. long., the Middle or Miocene between that and a little east of
                    76° 30' W., and the Upper or Pliocene in the remaining east part, except where
                    covered by recent or Quaternary (20) deposits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The varied and abundant mineral resources of
                    the State are as yet but imperfectly developed. Her medicinal mineral springs
                    are numerous, and many of them well known. Tidewater abounds in fertilizing
                    marls, and in choice brick-clays, sands, and shell-limestones for building.
                    Lime-burning, from oyster shells, is an important industry. Midland abounds in
                    superior granites, which are extensively quarried near Richmond and Petersburg;
                    in the best of slates for roofing and other purposes, especially in Albemarle
                    and Buckingham counties; in Jura-Trias brownstones and sandstones; in trap for
                    Belgian blocks; in soapstones (steatites), limestones, and in brick-, plastic-,
                    and fire-clays. Thick beds of excellent bituminous coal and of natural coke are
                    found in the Jura-Trias of Chesterfield and adjacent counties, which have long
                    been mined; ochre beds are worked in Chesterfield county; thick beds of
                    magnetic, specular, and limonite iron-ores, and of gold, silver, and
                    copper-bearing rocks, traverse its whole length from north-east to south-west.
                    Its gold belt, from 15 to 20 miles wide, rich in free, quartz, and pyritous-rock
                    gold, traverses the whole western tier of Midland counties, for more than 200
                    miles, from the Potomac to the Dan; in this belt, in Louisa county, at the
                    Arminius copper mines, veins of white pyrites, 42 feet, bearing 46 per cent, of
                    sulphur and considerable yellow copper, have been opened and reduction works
                    erected for a 300 tons daily output; 12,000 tons of pyrites were shipped in
                    1886. Manganese, mica, plumbago, titanium, cyanite, garnets, emeralds, quartz,
                    and other Archaean and Jura-Trias minerals are found at many points. The
                    minerals and metals now exploited are gold, iron and copper pyrites, manganese,
                    haematites, magnetites, and limonites, mica, slates, granites, brownstones, and
                    trap-rock. Piedmont has extensive beds of magnetic, specular, and limonite iron
                    ore throughout its length; chromic iron ore is found in the north-east; copper
                    ores abound especially along the west border in spurs of Blue Ridge; manganese
                    deposits have been worked at various points; the same Archaean and Jura-Trias
                    building stones and minerals are found here as in Midland, the marbles of
                    Bedford and Loudoun counties of fine quality. Iron ores, manganese, slates, and
                    marbles are now exploited. The Blue Ridge abounds in copper and iron ores for
                    its whole length in Virginia; these as well as pyritous silver, copper, and iron
                    ores, are especially abundant in the Floyd-Carroll-Grayson or south-west
                    plateau, where also auriferous quartz is milled; tin mines have been opened in
                    Rockbridge county; the great Potsdam or primordial iron belt, with its vast
                    deposits of ore, flanks the western base of the Blue Ridge in Virginia for
                    nearly 300 miles, and from the rich deposits of manganese in the same belt
                    two-thirds of the manganese output of the United States in 1886 was mined;
                    glass-sand of the best quality and fire and other clays are abundant, and so are
                    building sandstones in the western Blue Ridge. Mining operations are now
                    extensively conducted in iron and manganese ores. The Great Valley is all
                    underlain by limestones suitable for ornamental, building, and agricultural
                    purposes; its cement (hydraulic) and architectural, fluxing, and agricultural
                    limes are noted for their purity; extensive beds of iron-ore are found among its
                    hills; marbles, barytes, brick-and fire-clays, and travertine marls are
                    abundant; there are large deposits of lead and zinc ores, especially in the
                    southwest, in Pulaski and Wythe counties, where they accompany the great
                    iron-ore deposits of the Cripple Creek region; from the Vespertine (Nb. X.) beds
                    of the Lower Carboniferous, in Montgomery and Pulaski counties, from 15,000 to
                    20,000 tons of semi-anthracite coal are annually mined; ochres are mined in Page
                    and Augusta counties; iron, manganese, zinc, and lead ores are now mined on
                    quite an extensive scale, and lime-burning is an important industry. Appalachian
                    Virginia abounds in very remarkable beds of limonite iron ores, found (often,
                    under large areas, in a more or less stratified condition) in the Hudson river
                    (iii.), Clinton (v.), and Oriskany (vii.) formations of Cambrian and Silurian
                    age; there are also deposits of magnetic haematites in Craig and Giles counties;
                    limestones of the Valley (ii,), Trenton (iii.), and Lower Helderberg (vi.)
                    formations, underlying the “rich” valleys and ridges, abound, and furnish the
                    best of materials for building, lime-burning, and blast-furnace fluxing
                    purposes, as well as for beautiful encrinal and other fancy marbles; in its
                    Vespertine (x.) areas are numerous patches of anthracite and semi-anthracite
                    coals, worked and workable for local use; in the Appalachian portions of Smyth
                    and Washington counties are large deposits of rock-salt and gypsum; travertine
                    marls, caves abounding in nitrous earths, and chalybeate, sulphur, alum, hot,
                    warm, and other mineral springs are common; sandstones and slates for building
                    purposes are plentiful. The iron-ores of Alleghany county and those of the
                    Appalachian portions of Rockbridge and Botetourt counties are extensively mined
                    for local blast-furnaces; marbles and gypsum are quarried; considerable salt is
                    manufactured, and semianthracite coal in Pulaski for use in local zinc furnaces.
                    TransAppalachia is Virginia’s 1000 square miles of the Great Coal Basin of the
                    Ohio, or the Trans-Appalachian Coal Basin (the one usually, but improperly,
                    called the Great Appalachian Coal Basin); this is all underlain by thick and
                    easily accessible beds of the best of semi-bituminous and bituminous coals,
                    those of the Lower (xii.) and of the Middle (xiii.) Coal groups of the
                    Carboniferous. Only the semi-bituminous coking, steam, and domestic coal of this
                    region is now mined for exportation at Pocahontas, Tazewell county, from which
                    639,751 tons (93,550 of them converted into coke) were shipped in 1886, the
                    traffic having begun with the shipment of 105,805 tons in 1883. From the
                    Flat-top coalfield, including the Pocahontas and some adjacent mines in West
                    Virginia, 1,314,700 tons of coal were mined in 1887, part of which was made into
                    about 145,000 tons of coke, equal in quality to any made in the United States.
                    This fuel is remarkably high in fixed carbon and low in ash and sulphur, and
                    therefore admirably adapted for metallurgical purposes. Twenty mineral springs
                    of Virginia, used medicinally, were reported to the United States Geological
                    Survey in 1886 (Tidewater 1, Midland 4, Blue Ridge 2, Valley 5, Appalachia 8);
                    they were reported as chalybeate, alum, white sulphur, red sulphur, blue
                    sulphur, warm sulphur, cold sulphur, hot sulphur, lithia, healing, ague, and
                    sweet chalybeate. These and many others not reported are visited as health
                    resorts, and many of them ship to market large quantities of their waters.</p>
                <p>Virginia produced—of coal 300,000 tons in 1884, 1,000,000 in 1886, and about
                    1,250,000 in 1887; of coke 25,340 tons in 1884, about 122,352 tons in 1886; of
                    pig iron, 29,934 tons in 1880, 152,907 in 1883, 156,250 in 1886, and 156,698 in
                    1887; of rolled iron 40,581 tons, and of cut nails 212,552 kegs of 100 lb in
                    1886; of manganese 3661 tons in 1880and 20,567 tons in 1886; of pyrites 12,000
                    tons in 1886; of ochre 1750 tons in 1886; of salt, gypsum, lead, zinc, granite,
                    slates, lime, limestone for blast-furnace flux, cement, brownstone, mineral
                    waters, and iron-ore for export large quantities were produced in 1886, and
                    still larger in 1887, when the mining industries of this State were in a healthy
                    condition of development.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The variety of vegetation in Virginia is very
                    great, the range being from a profitable growth of semi-tropical cotton to
                    semi-arctic pines and balsams. From one-half to two-thirds of the State is now
                    covered by forests of native evergreen and deciduous trees. Hard and soft woods,
                    in nearly equal proportions, form the original forests of Tidewater and
                    Midland,—the plain regions; hard woods predominate in the high country
                    divisions; the park-like hardwood forests of the Great Valley have grown up
                    since its occupation by white men.</p>
                <p>The census report of 1880, in its natural divisions of North American forests,
                    assigns the east maritime plain of Tidewater to the coast-pine division; the
                    north-east portions of Blue Ridge, Valley, and Appalachia to the northern-pine
                    division; and the rest of the State to that of deciduous trees. The principal
                    timber trees, found in varying abundance in all parts, are white, Spanish,
                    black, chestnut, red, post, and swamp oaks; tulip-poplar and cucumber; white (or
                    shell), bark, and pignut hickories; yellow or pitch pine; red or Virginia cedar;
                    beech, elm, black and white walnuts, sycamore, mulberry, locust, sassafras, and
                    gum; sugar, red, and white maples; black, red, and yellow birches; wild cherry,
                    persimmon, dogwood, ironwood; white, red, black, and water ashes; chestnut, and
                    willows. Cypress, juniper, long-leaved pine, holly, sweet gum, and some live
                    oaks are confined mainly to Tidewater and east Midland; white pine, hemlock,
                    black sprace, rock chestnut oak, and balsams to the mountain regions; the oaks
                    of the Valley are of rare excellence, and the tulip-poplars and oaks of
                    Irans-Appalachia and its borders are of remarkable size; sumachs, millions of
                    pounds of the leaves of which are gathered for their tannin, are everywhere
                    plentiful. From the sugar-maple considerable quantities of sugar are made in the
                    Valley and the Appalachias; the forests of Tidewater, easily reached by vessels,
                    furnish large quantities of fuel and lumber to seaboard markets; railways reach
                    the other timber regions of the State; lumbering, charcoal-making, the cutting
                    of railway sleepers, and the collection of tan-bark are important industries.
                    Wild fruits and nuts, gooseberries, blackberries, whortleberries, cranberries,
                    strawberries, haws, serviceberries, persimmons, plums, crab and thorn apples,
                    cherries, various wild grapes, chestnuts, chinquapins, black and white walnuts,
                    hickory nuts, hazeland beech nuts, acorns, &amp;c., are nearly all found in all
                    parts. Medicinal roots (ginseng, sarsaparilla, snake-root, mandrake, &amp;c. )
                    are gathered in large quantities in the Appalachias; oil from sassafras roots is
                    made in quantities in Midland and Piedmont. All the cultivated fruits of
                    temperate climates flourish; apples, pears, peaches, grapes, plums, cherries,
                    currants, and other small fruits are everywhere plentifully grown; the peach,
                    pear, and apple orchards of Midland, Piedmont, Blue Ridge, and the Valley <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0282-0259"/> are noted; the vineyards of Midland, Piedmont,
                    and Blue Ridge are becoming well known for both grapes and wines in variety; in
                    Tidewater and eastern Midland figs, apricots, nectarines, and other warm-country
                    fruits flourish, and the scuppernong grapes and wines of Tidewater are also
                    worthy of mention. The flora of Virginia includes nearly every species of plant
                    found in the United States east of the Mississippi, excepting only the extreme
                    south. The cleared lands of the State, about two-sevenths of the whole, are
                    devoted to orchards, vineyards, meadows, and pastures, to market and other
                    gardens, and to crops of maize (Indian corn), wheat, oats, rye, buckwheat,
                    barley, pease, beans, peanuts, round (Irish) and long (sweet) potatoes, turnips,
                    cabbage, clover, flax, hemp, cotton, tobacco, &amp;c. Cereal and root crops are
                    abundantly grown in all parts, as also are tobacco, hay, clover and grass seeds,
                    flax and flaxseed, hops, hemp, and cotton. Nearly half the State, part of
                    Piedmont, and all Blue Ridge, the Valley, and the Appalachias is a natural grass
                    country—half of it the habitat of the famous blue grass—and well adapted to
                    grazing and dairy-farming; the special crops of Tidewater are those of
                    market-gardens, early vegetables, and round and sweet potatoes in the east, and
                    of peanuts and cotton in the west; tobacco is a specialty of southwest Midland
                    and Piedmont.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The buffalo and elk, common when white men first
                    settled here, are now extinct; deer, red and grey foxes, rabbits, hares,
                    ground-hogs or woodchucks, red, grey, and ground squirrels, opossums, polecats,
                    muskrats, martens, minks, weasels, bats, rats, and mice are found everywhere;
                    otters and beavers, once numerous in all parts, are again becoming common in
                    south Midland and elsewhere; black bears frequent the Appalachian and borders of
                    the adjacent Valley divisions; wild-cats, catamounts, and the small wolves are
                    occasionally met in unfrequented portions of the mountain regions. Of game or
                    food birds, partridges (quails), pigeons, wood doves, grouse (pheasants), larks,
                    thrushes, snipe, wild turkeys, and several kinds of wild ducks are found in
                    nearly all parts; the coasts, the inland bays, the great estuary rivers, and the
                    marshes of Tidewater fairly swarm, especially during the colder months, with
                    canvas-back, mallard, creek, redhead, bald-face, teal, and other wild ducks, and
                    with wild geese, swans, snipe, and other water and water-side fowl; gulls and
                    other sea birds frequent the coast. Song-birds, including mocking-birds,
                    orioles, bobolinks, robins, catbirds, bluebirds, wrens, tanagers, sparrows,
                    &amp;c., abound; the English sparrow is domiciled in all the cities and towns;
                    humming-birds are plentiful. The common birds of prey, eagles, hawks, owls, a
                    vulture (the turkey-buzzard); the wading birds (herons, grass snipes,
                    fly-up-the-creeks, &amp;c.) and the various swimming birds are abundant. The
                    common reptiles include land and water tortoises, or turtles and terrapins (some
                    highly prized for food), and harmless snakes, useful in the destruction of
                    vermin, frogs, toads, salamanders, &amp;c.; the poisonous rattlesnakes,
                    copperheads, and moccasins are sometimes encountered, but are not numerous; the
                    comparatively harmless black snakes are more common. Of edible saltwater fishes,
                    more than thirty kinds are taken in quantities in Chesapeake Bay waters,
                    including sturgeon, rock-fish, trout, chub, sheepshead, spot, sunfish, bluefish,
                    shad, herring, anchovy, Spanish mackerel, cod, bonito, drum, menhaden, bass,
                    sea-eels, and. hog-fish; while dozens of kinds not used for food are known. Tho
                    freshwater fishes are perch, pickerel, cat-fish, chub, bass, sucker, fall-fish,
                    salmon, hog-fish, red-horse, red-eye, carp, mullot, sun-fish, eels, and trout in
                    the mountain streams. Of the abounding crustaceans, edible crabs and lobsters
                    are caught in great numbers in the marine waters, and millions of bushels of
                    oysters, clams, and other shell-fish are annually sent to market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The government is entrusted to three
                    departments, each with distinct and separate powers. (1) The legislative
                    authority is vested in a general assembly, composed of a house of delegates of
                    100 and a senate of 40 members which meets biennially at Richmond; the members
                    of the house of delegates are elected for two years, those of the senate for
                    four,—half the latter being elected biennially. (2) The executive authority is
                    vested in a governor, elected by the people for four years. A
                    lieutenant-governor is elected at the same time, who is president of the senate,
                    and should a vacancy occur during the term of office becomes governor. The other
                    executive officers are a secretary of the commonwealth, a treasurer, first and
                    second auditors of public accounts, a superintendent of public printing, a
                    superintendent of the penitentiary, a railroad commissioner, a commissioner of
                    agriculture, a registrar of the land office, and a superintendent of public
                    instraction. (3) The judicial authority is vested—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in
                    justices of peace, three in each of the magisterial districts into which the
                    counties are subdivided; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) in judges of county courts;
                    (c) in judges of the seventeen circuit courts into which the State is divided,
                    and judges of city courts; and <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> in a supreme court of
                    appeals of five judges. The right of appeal, with specified limitations, is
                    provided for from each of the above courts to the other, in the order named; the
                    supreme court has only appellate jurisdiction save in cases of habeas corpus,
                    mandamus, and prohibition. The justices of the peace, a supervisor, a constable,
                    and an overseer of the poor are elected by the voters of each magisterial
                    district to serve two years; the general assembly elects the county judges for
                    terms of six years, the circuit judges for terms of eight years, and the judges
                    of the supreme court of appeals for terms of twelve years. An attorneygeneral
                    for the State is elected at and for the same time as the governor. In the
                    Congress of the United States, Virginia has two senators and ten
                    representatives. Aliens can acquire and hold any property in Virginia on the
                    same footing as citizens.</p>

                    common branches of education, including preparation for college, by graded
                    primary and high schools—the latter confined to cities, towns, and large
                    villages—free to all between the ages of five and twenty-one inclusive; (3)
                    advanced instruction and training in scientific and professional studies, by a
                    military institute, an agricultural and mechanical college, male and female
                    normal schools, and an institution for the deaf-mutes and the blind—all for
                    whites, and by a normal and agricultural institute and normal college for
                    coloured pupils,—tuition free to a selected number from all parts of the State;
                    and (4) higher instruction, in the complete academic, scientific, technical, and

                    tuition free to all young men of Virginia, over eighteen years of age, under
                    restrictions in regard to culture. The State schools confer no honorary degrees.
                    Equal provision, but in entirely separate schools, is made by law for white and
                    coloured.</p>
                <p>The public free school system is in charge of a board of education. In 1887 the

                    white and 265,249 coloured); 7140 schools (5047 white and 2093 coloured) were
                    open, including 458 graded schools; 7161 teachers (2416 white males, 2889 white
                    females, 1023 coloured males, and 833 coloured females) were employed; 325,184
                    pupils (209,638 white and 115,546 coloured) were enrolled, and 184,520 (121,571
                    white and 62,949 coloured) were in average daily attendance. The school
                    districts owned 4365 schoolhouses, and their school property was valued at
                    $1,907,775; the expense of the free school system in 1887 was $1,381,690,
                    besides $153,600 spent on permanent improvements. The State makes liberal grants
                    to the military institute, the agricultural and mechanical college, the normal

                <p>Private and corporate schools embrace academies and high schools for boys,
                    preparatory for college or university; female colleges, mainly under
                    denominational control; and the well-known colleges of St John’s in Tidewater;
                    Hampden-Sidney, Randolph-Macon, Richmond, and Virginia Medical in Midland; and
                    Roanoke, Emory and Henry, and Washington and Lee University in the Valley. The

                    males, 1240 females, 1719 white, and 692 coloured. Pauperism is not common in
                    Virginia; in 1870 there were only 3890 paupers, supported by public charity at a
                    cost of $303,081; in 1880 the total number was 3138, 2117 of these being in
                    almshouses, of whom 1027 were coloured. Deaf-mutes and blind are well cared for
                    in a noble institution at Staunton, which trained during 1885-86 78 deaf-mutes
                    and 44 blind, with an annual grant of $35,000. The disabled Confederate soldiers
                    of Virginia are aided by the State ($83,040 in 1885-86). There is also, near

                    were embraced in 118,517 farms, although only 8,510,113 acres of such area (only
                    two-sevenths of the whole) were under cultivation (leaving 57∙1 per cent. of
                    land in farms unimproved), yet the number of farms increased 60∙5 per cent. and
                    the acreage in farms 9∙3 per cent. from 1870. Seventh-tenths of its farms were
                    cultivated by owners; over half of the remainder were rented for a share of the
                    crop, and the other part for a fixed money rental. The average size of farms was
                    167 acres; but there were 53,101 containing from 100 to 500 acres, 5561 with
                    from 500 to 1000 acres, and 1563 containing over 1000 acres each,—so that more
                    than half the farms contained from 100 to over 1000 acres each, or a probable
                    average of 300 acres each, large farms being the rule. The farms and their

                    $45,726,221. The live stock comprised 218,838 horses, 33,598 mules and asses,

                    improved land, 1,152,083 were in permanent meadows, pastures, orchards, and
                    vineyards, and 7,358,030 were under tillage; of the 11,325,672 acres unimproved
                    in farms, 9,126,601 were in woodland and forest, and 2,199,071 in old fields,
                    &amp;c. Virginia was one of the twenty States that produced over 20,000,000
                    bushels of Indian corn each, ranking thirteenth; it stood second to Kentucky in
                    acreage and quantity of tobacco grown. The United States commissioner of
                    agriculture estimates that in 1884 Virginia had 4,071,401 acres in crops,
                    producing 44,000,000 bushels of cereals, 2,061,000 bushels of potatoes, 99,763
                    lb of tobacco, 366,389 tons of hay, and 13,500 bales of cotton, valued at
                    $39,050,052; and had on its farms 2,127,023 domestic animals, worth
                    $39,608,536.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Though Virginia has great natural
                    advantages for becoming a leading manufacturing State, in 1870 less than 12 per
                    cent. of its population was engaged in manufacturing industries. In 1880,
                    however, its 5710 establishments had invested $26,968,990, employed 40,184
                    persons (28,779 men), paid $7,425,261 for wages and $32,883,933 for materials,
                    and produced to the value of $51,780,992,—a gain of nearly 60 per cent. in ten
                    years. It is estimated<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>United States internal Commerce Report <hi rend="italic">for
                    1886.</hi></p></note> that the value of the products in 1885 was $75,000,000, —a
                    gain of over 44 per cent. in five years. The sales of products of the
                    manufacturing establishments of Richmond city alone amounted in 1887 to
                    $27,887,340. The pig-iron output in 1887 was worth over $3,000,000. The more
                    important manufactures are those of iron, tobacco, leather, coke, cotton,
                    manures, paper, agricultural implements and machinery, builders’ materials,
                    vehicles, lumber, lime, tanning extracts, railway cars and locomotives, flour
                    and mill products, spelter, salt, distilled spirits, canned fruits, vegetables,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The navigable tidal bays, creeks, rivers,
                    harbours, and roads of Tidewater Virginia furnish more than a thousand miles of
                    channels for commerce; Richmond, at the head of the tidal waters of the James,
                    117 miles from Chesapeake Bay, is reached by ocean ships drawing 15 feet of
                    water; West Point, at York Head, 41 miles from the bay, has 18 feet of depth;
                    Elizabeth river gives to the fine harbour of Norfolk a channel 25 feet deep;
                    while Hampton Roads, with its 400 square miles of area, is the largest as well
                    as the most central and commodious landlocked harbour on the Atlantic coast of
                    the United States. Ship canals connect the great waterways of Virginia with
                    those of North Carolina and beyond to the southward; and, similarly, northward
                    the head of Chesapeake Bay is connected with Delaware Bay. At the beginning of
                    1888 there were 35 railway companies working 2540 miles of road, all of standard
                    4 feet 9 inches gauge, except some 256 miles of narrow-gauge short lines. The
                    Virginia railways earned $13,825,909 in 1885 at an outlay of $8,999,853, the
                    work done being equivalent to 971,477,375 mile-tons. Virginia early took part in
                    the construction of railways, investing many millions in the stocks of the
                    various lines now reaching nearly every part of the State; beginning about 1830,
                    it had 147 miles of railway in 1840, 384 in 1850, 1350 in 1860, 1449 in 1870,
                    1893 in 1880, 2430 in 1885, and 2540, with some 200 miles more in course of
                    construction, at the beginning of 1888. Eight great through railway lines
                    connect its trade and manufacturing centres with those of other States.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Finance.—</hi> For the year ending September 30, 1886, the
                    assessed value of the real estate of Virginia was $257,607,935, and of personal
                    property $83,152,971, or $340,760,906 of taxable valuation; the taxes were
                    $1,029,936 on real estate, $336,366 on personal property, $39,112 on incomes,
                    $316,293 capitation, §141,755 from railways on a valuation of $34,614,427,
                    §299,343 from liquor and $400,325 from other licences. The receipts of the State
                    were $2,773,437, and its expenses of all kinds $2,755,036; of these $657,610
                    went to the support of the free public schools and $1,064,097 to the support of
                    the State Government. The rate of taxation is low, and on a low property
                    valuation. The State debt at January 1, 1885, was $28,961,829.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Militia.—</hi> In 1880 the natural militia (male persons from
                    eighteen to forty-four years of age inclusive) was 264,033 (102,426 of them
                    coloured) in a male population of 745,589. The organized militia force is small.
                    In 1885-86 there were 51 equipped volunteer companies of active militia under
                    the orders of the State,—mainly in its cities and larger towns,—43 of infantry
                    (18 of them coloured), 5 of artillery, and 3 cavalry,—mustering in all 2904 men.
                    The Virginia military fund is about $11,000 a year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The mound-builders of the Mississippi valley had
                    outposts, as evidenced by remains of their earth-works, in the mountain passes
                    of Appalachia. At the time of the arrival of the whites the Powhatans held most
                    of Tidewater, the Mannahoacks the northeast and the Monacans the south-west of
                    Midland and Piedmont; the Cherokees held the Tennessee basin parts of the Valley
                    and Appalachia, and Algonkin tribes—Shawnees, Delawares, &amp;c.—the rest of
                    those divisions. Many of the place names are still Indian. Cabot probably
                    entered Chesapeake Bay in 1498; when Raleigh’s ships, in 1584, brought to
                    England glowing accounts of the Albemarle Sound region, the whole country was
                    named Virginia in honour of Elizabeth, the virgin queen. The first permanent
                    English settlement in America was made at Jamestown, Virginia, May 13, 1607, by
                    one hundred settlers sent from England by Sir Thomas Gates and Company, who had
                    obtained in April 1606 a charter from James I. to plant two colonies in
                    Virginia,—a southern somewhere between 34° and 41°, and a northern between 38°
                    and 45° N. lat., but at places not less than 100 miles apart. In 1609 the London
                    Company superseded Gates’s, which had merely held its settlement and given to
                    the world the romantic adventures of Captain John <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Smith</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). King James gave the London Company,
                    by charter, a sea-front of 400 miles,—200 north and 200 south from Point
                    Comfort,—all islands within 100 miles of the coast, and all the country back
                    from this 400 miles of frontage “throughout from sea to sea,” and to its
                    colonists all the rights of natural-born Englishmen; under this charter Virginia
                    had jurisdiction over her imperial colonial territory, and under it holds the
                    fragment of that colony now called Virginia. The colony of the London Company
                    grew and prospered, and in 1619 Governor Yardley organized at James City, the
                    capital, a few miles inland from Jamestown, the first legislative body that met
                    in North America; in 1621 the London Company granted the colony a liberal
                    constitution, the general form of which Virginia has always preserved. In August
                    1619 a Dutch man-of-war sold at Jamestown twenty African negroes, and introduced
                    negro slavery. In 1624 James I. arbitrarily deprived the London Company of its
                    charter, and Virginia became a royal colony, which was, till the revolution, a
                    favourite and generally a loyal royal province governed <pb break="no"

                    the governor and council and the people electing the members of the house of
                    burgesses. In 1698 the capital was transferred to Williamsburg, where, under
                    royal patronage, William and Mary College had been established in 1693. The
                    colony soon occupied most of Tidewater and its Midland border; in 1716 Governor
                    Spotswood crossed the Blue Ridge, and was, so far as known, the first white man
                    to enter the Great Valley, which was soon thereafter occupied by large numbers
                    of Scottish and some German and English settlers. Indian wars followed as
                    settlers moved westward, but in 1744 Virginia purchased from the Indians the
                    right to make settlements to the Ohio, and built a fort where Pittsburgh now
                    stands; the French captured this in 1754, and the long French and Indian war
                    followed, until the 1763 treaty of Paris ended it and made the Mississippi the
                    western boundary of Virginia. During that war, in 1755, Braddock was defeated;
                    and in 1758 Fort Duquesne, which under the French had taken the place of
                    Pittsburgh, was captured and renamed Fort Pitt. In 1773 the general assembly of
                    Virginia resolved for an “inter-colonial committee of correspondence,” and was
                    dissolved by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor. In May 1774 it again met and
                    protested against the closing of the port of Boston; Dunmore again dissolved it,
                    but the burgesses, the members elected by the people, reassembled and passed
                    resolutions denouncing British taxation and recommending to the other colonies
                    an annual congress of delegates,—leading in this as it had in recommending
                    committees of correspondence. Virginia took a leading part in the subsequent war
                    of independence, but the various steps of her policy need not be detailed here
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">United States,</hi> and compare also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jefferson</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Washington).</hi></p>
                <p>The great territory of Virginia, reaching from the Atlantic to the Mississippi,
                    and now divided into five large States, made the other States of the Union
                    apprehensive of her future domination. In 1781, to promote harmony, she offered
                    to cede to the general Government all her territory beyond the Ohio, and in 1784
                    she made the cession, only stipulating that the territory thus voluntarily given
                    up should, when peopled, be divided into new States, in which slavery should be
                    for ever prohibited, and that the remainder of her territory—that from the
                    Atlantic to the Ohio— should remain inviolably hers. In 1787 the convention of
                    the States, at Philadelphia, presided over by Washington, adopted the present
                    constitution of the United States, and this Virginia, in convention, ratified in
                    1788. In the war of 1812-14 with England Virginia bore a conspicuous part, as
                    also in that of 1846-47 with Mexico. The civil war of 1861-65 was more
                    disastrous in its consequences to Virginia than to any other State of the Union;
                    from first to last its territory was overrun, hundreds of battles and minor
                    engagements took place within its borders, and all the destruction incident to
                    gigantic military operations fell upon it; tens of thousands of its best men
                    were killed in battle; its territory was dismembered, and a third part of it cut
                    off, while more than three hundred million dollars’ worth of property was
                    destroyed in what remained.</p>
                <p>For some time after 1865 Virginia was under Federal military control as “District
                    No. 1 but on December 3, 1867, a convention, elected by the people, under an Act
                    of the United States Congress, met and framed a new constitution, prohibiting
                    slavery and accepting the results of the war; this was ratified by a popular
                    vote, July 6, 1869, at which time members of a general assembly and State
                    officers were also elected. The chosen governor was inaugurated September 21,
                    1869; the general assembly met October 5, 1869, and ratified the fourteenth and
                    fifteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States; and on January
                    26, 1870, Virginia was readmitted to representation in Congress, and released
                    from military control. (J. H*.)</p>
