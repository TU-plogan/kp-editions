                    is, “Hunters,” a primitive people of Ceylon, probably representing the Yakkos of
                    Sanskrit writers, who appear to have been the true aborigines and the sole
                    inhabitants of the island prior to the Hindu conquest. During the Dutch
                    occupation (1644- 1796) they were met in scattered groups as far north as
                    Jaffna, but are now confined to the south-eastern district, about the wooded
                    Bintenne, Badulla, and Nilgala Hills, and thence to the coast near Batticaloa.
                    They constitute three distinct social groups—the <hi rend="italic">coast
                    people,</hi> who are settled and partly civilized, freely intermingling with
                    their Singhalese neighbours; the <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">rock people,</hi> who keep entirely aloof, living exclusively on
                    the produce of the chase; and the <hi rend="italic">village people,</hi>
                    semi-nomad agriculturists, intermediate in every respect between the other two.
                    The Veddahs are thus in a state of transition from the lowest to a relatively
                    high degree of culture; and their physical appearance gives evidence of their
                    intermediate position between the aboriginal and the intruding races of Ceylon.

                    Singhalese have much in common, which is probably due to the intermingling of
                    the aborigines with the Hindu immigrants, as is also suggested by historic and
                    anthropological considerations; (2) that both differ very decidedly from the
                    Tamils of north Ceylon and south India; (3) that the Veddahs show certain
                    analogies with the small dark pre-Dravidian element in this region, which De
                    Quatrefages calls “Negrito,” and which Huxley groups with his “Australoid”
                    division of mankind. The true Veddahs of Bintenne are almost a dwarfish race,
                    averaging about 5 feet (men, <hi rend="italic">5 feet 2</hi> inches; women, 4
                    feet 10 inches), with correspondingly low cranial capacity, narrow high skull
                    like the Papuan (index 70), mesognathous jaw, slightly prominent cheekbones,
                    straight, but shaggy rather than lank, black hair, and features altogether more
                    Hindu than Negroid, although of somewhat darker complexion than the ordinary
                    olivebrown Singhalese. They wander about in small family groups, which have not
                    reached the tribal state, being absolutely destitute of any political or
                    communal organization whatsoever. Their dwellings are the caves of the rocks or
                    the forest trees; they clothe themselves with foliage; and they devour uncooked
                    vermin, reptiles, and whatever other quarry they are able to capture with their
                    rude weapons. It is stated that they can neither count, mark the succession of
                    time, nor distinguish colours; but what is more certain is that they never
                    laugh, in this respect differing from nearly all other races. They also <pb

                    Aryan language, for their present speech at least seems to be a degraded form of
                    Singhalese, consisting mainly of Sanskrit intermingled with Dravidian elements.
                    This circumstance has given rise to the theory that the Veddahs are a degraded
                    group of Hindu outcastes, whereas they call themselves the “sons of kings,” and
                    claim to belong to a superior caste, a claim which, strange to say, appears to
                    be admitted by their neighbours. Their religion has been described as a kind of
                    demon-worship, consisting of rude dances and shouts raised to scare away the
                    evil spirits, whom they confound with their ancestors. But these “demons” and "
                    spirits” are purely anthropomorphic beings; of a supernatural order as
                    understood by more cultured peoples they have no idea. Owing to an increasingly
                    low birth-rate, the Veddahs are disappearing as a distinct ethnical group; even
                    including the Rhodiyas of the western uplands they numbered only 2284 in 1886
                    (Ferguson’s <hi rend="italic">Directory).</hi> But they should not be confounded
                    with these Rhodiyas, who, although true outcastes, are nevertheless a much finer
                    race, tall, well-proportioned, with regular features, and speak a language said
                    to be radically distinct from all the Aryan and Dravidian dialects current in
                    Ceylon. There is, however, in Travancore, on the mainland, a low-caste “Veda”
                    tribe, nearly black, with wavy or frizzly hair, and now speaking a Malayâlim
                    (Dravidian) dialect (Jagor), who probably approach nearer than the insular
                    Veddahs to the aboriginal pre-Dravidian “Negrito” element of southern India and
                    Malaysia.</p>
