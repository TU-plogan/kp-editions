                    Trent in 1563. But it bears very slight resemblance to that assembly in the
                    circumstances of its origin, objects, and proceedings. The Council of Trent was
                    all but forced upon the Papacy by the demands of the principal Catholic states
                    of Europe, and by the religious and political necessities of the time. It was
                    convened for the purposes of endeavouring to secure the return of the Lutherans,
                    Calvinists, and other revolted bodies to the Roman Church, and of applying
                    stringent measures of reform to amend the numerous practical abuses and scandals
                    which had mainly caused the revolt. And, while it failed conspicuously in the
                    former of these objects, it did achieve a certain degree of success in the
                    latter, by a variety of disciplinary enactments covering a large range of
                    subjects, and was followed, in point of fact, by a marked improvement in
                    clerical morals and diligence. The Vatican Council, contrariwise, originated
                    with the Papacy alone, and was neither demanded nor desired by Roman Catholic
                    Christendom. Its object was confined to securing the triumph of the
                    hyper-Ultramontane school within the Roman obedience by establishing papal
                    autocracy as divine and infallible; and it made no attempt whatever beyond a
                    sterile discussion, not published in its Acts, to deal with any of the abuses
                    and scandals which had either survived the Tridentine reforms or had sprung up
                    since. While the Council of Trent did much to repair the damage done to the
                    personal authority of the popes by the incidents of the “great schism” and the
                    character of the pontiffs who sat during the close of the 15th and the beginning
                    of the 16th century, it left several questions concerning the source and extent
                    of papal authority undecided, which proved a fruitful cause of debate between
                    the Gallican and Ultramontane schools of theology, the former minimizing the
                    papal claims as far as is compatible with acceptance of the tenet of the Petrine
                    privilege, and viewing the Papacy as a constitutional monarchy under strict
                    limitations, the latter holding it to be an autocracy resting on a divine
                    charter, and incapable of restraint on the part of its subjects. But the French
                    Revolution, by breaking up the old Gallican Church, led to the substitution of a
                    largely Ultramontane episcopate in France under the concordat between Pius VII.
                    and Napoleon I., and thereby to the permanent declension of the moderate school,
                    while, on the other hand, a variety of causes brought the Jesuits, recalled into
                    corporate existence by the same Pius VII. in 1814, after forty years’
                    suppression, again into the same position of chief influence in the Latin Church
                    which they had occupied in the heyday of the Counter-Reformation. They have
                    always held steadily to the military ideas of their founder, and have therefore
                    unceasingly striven to centralize and concentrate ecclesiastical authority, to
                    remove constitutional limitations upon its exercise, and to make it prompt,
                    unfaltering, and trenchant in action. Clearly, if the Papacy could be converted
                    into an absolute monarchy, this end would be attained at a single stroke,
                    because the mere fiat of the supreme pontiff would thenceforward suffice as
                    warrant for all ecclesiastical action, thus dispensing with cumbrous and
                    dilatory machinery of every kind; and his delegated authority would enable any
                    person wielding it to act with similar efficacy and despatch.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Pius IX. to the papal chair in 1846 a favourable
                    opportunity for carrying out this programme presented itself, for, weak in
                    character and wholly unversed in theological learning, while strongly holding
                    the very highest views of his own prerogatives and eagerly receptive of
                    everything which tended to exalt them further, he was exactly the instrument
                    suited for its execution. Two experiments, to test at once how far he was
                    prepared to go, and how far Latin Christendom was prepared to submit in the
                    matter of decrees on faith and morals issuing from himself singly, with no
                    previous conciliar examination or decision, were tried in 1854 by the
                    promulgation of the tenet of the Immaculate Conception and in 1864 by that of
                    the Syllabus of Errors. The former of these met with little resistance, the
                    latter with none, and it was therefore judged safe to proceed with the bolder
                    and more far-reaching scheme which they but foreshadowed. Its success appeared
                    to be almost a foregone conclusion; for, not only could a compact and docile
                    Italian majority be as surely reckoned on as it was at Trent, but the far larger
                    number of Roman Catholic bishops all over the world had been virtually appointed
                    by Pius IX. during his long pontificate, and that exclusively from the
                    Ultramontane school. Nevertheless there was still a minority important enough to
                    make some caution desirable in the earlier stages of the preliminaries, and the
                    proposal to hold an oecumenical council was first laid privately before the
                    congregation of rites by the pope himself in December 1864, contemporaneously
                    with the issue of the Syllabus, and immediately afterwards before all the
                    cardinals then at Rome, who were desired to give their opinions as to the
                    opportuneness of convoking the council at all and as to the subjects it should
                    discuss if convoked. Nineteen cardinals approved the proposal; two opposed it;
                    and one remained neutral. In March 1865 a congregation of direction was formed
                    to take further steps towards the desired end, and private communications were
                    made to various bishops and to the nuncios at the different courts, who were
                    asked to send competent theologians to take part in the preliminary
                    congregations. Some communications were also made privately in 1866 to bishops
                    of the Oriental rite. The first directly public intimation of the approaching
                    council was made in June 1867, through a circular letter of Cardinal Caterini to
                    the 500 bishops present in Rome at the 18th centenary festival of the martyrdom
                    of St Peter and St Paul, inviting their reply to a schedule of inquiries. In
                    September 1868 an invitation to attend was despatched to the Oriental bishops
                    not in communion with Rome, and also to “Protestants and non-Catholics.” But, as
                    it was intended that no Oriental prelate should be admitted to a seat in the
                    council till he had first made profession of the Roman Catholic system in its
                    entirety, and as Protestants were merely to be referred to “experienced men”</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n126/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0126-0111"/>
                <p>to convince them of their errors, the insincere invitation met with no acceptance
                    whatever. The bull of convocation was promulged on 29th June 1869, appointing
                    8th December 1869 as the day of meeting. A few days before this latter date,
                    27th November, Pius IX. issued the brief <hi rend="italic">Multiplices
                    inter,</hi> prescribing the mode of conciliar procedure and effectually
                    fettering the council from the outset, so that it had never even the shadow of
                    freedom which ostensibly was allowed to the Tridentine synod. This brief
                    consists of a preamble and ten chapters, containing, amongst much else, the
                    following provisions. Any member desiring to bring forward a proposal had to
                    deliver it privately in writing to a special committee named by the pope (of
                    which there were six for various departments), and it should contain nothing
                    foreign to the traditions of the Roman Church. Unless the committee passed it,
                    no further action could be taken upon it. Strict secrecy as to the proceedings
                    of the council, and even as to the opinions of particular members, was to be
                    observed towards all outsiders. All new decrees and canons were to be discussed
                    in preliminary congregations before the public sessions, drafts being supplied
                    some days previously, and those who desired to speak to the questions were
                    obliged to give notice at least a day beforehand. Priority of speech was secured
                    for these; if others desired to speak afterwards they had to obtain the
                    permission of the presidents, all of whom were cardinals of the court party. If
                    little or no debate arose, the draft decrees were to be officially formulated;
                    if there were division of opinion, the question should be referred to the
                    sub-committee <hi rend="italic">(deputatio)</hi> corresponding to each
                    congregation’s subject of discussion, which should decide the matter if no
                    further difficulty were raised. All the officers of the council were named
                    directly by the pope, and in no case elected by the council itself, which was
                    thus deprived of several conciliar rights held previously to be inherent and
                    indefeasible, and which had been exercised even at Trent.</p>
                <p>The assemblage of the council was looked on with little favour by a large part of
                    the Roman Catholic world, and in particular two German documents attested the
                    alarm it aroused. In April 1869 Prince Hohenlohe, Bavarian foreign minister,
                    sent a circular letter to the European courts, warning them of the political
                    dangers likely to ensue; and most of the German bishops, assembled at Fulda in
                    September of that year, sent an address to the pope, anxiously deprecating the
                    definition of papal infallibility which had been recommended in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Civiltà Cattolica</hi> of 6th February 1869, to be made by the
                    summary process of acclamation. This proposal drew forth two able books in
                    opposition to the dogma,—one which appeared anonymously (Janus) in Germany, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Du Concile Général et de la Paix Religieuse,</hi> by Maret,
                    bishop of Sura and dean of theology at the Sorbonne, published in France; but
                    they did not delay the measures being taken for its declaration.</p>
                <p>The council assembled punctually on the appointed day, 8th December 1869, and
                    owing to the modern facilities of intercommunication it was by far the largest
                    gathering of the kind in history, no fewer than 749 bishops, cardinals, abbots,
                    and generals of orders being present,—a number afterwards increased to 764,—and
                    including nearly three-fourths of the whole Roman Catholic episcopate. Of these
                    it has been estimated that the minority opposed to the infallibility dogma
                    amounted to at least 160, while in the majority were reckoned 53 bishops <hi
                    rend="italic">in partibus,</hi> who, as having no real dioceses, and being thus
                    unable to attest the historical belief of their flocks, had properly no right of
                    suffrage upon dogmatic questions in a council, such attestation being the one
                    function dischargeable by bishops assembled in synod when considering articles
                    of belief. To these are to be added about 125 bishops of sees too modern to have
                    any ancient tradition to attest, such as those in North and South America,
                    Australasia, and Oceania, who were thus for conciliar purposes on the same
                    footing of incompetence to speak for any one save themselves. And, besides these
                    two large groups, there was a third, consisting of about 90 missionary bishops
                    entirely under the control of the Propaganda, and thus not free agents, while
                    their sees were in most cases of very recent origin, so that they also could
                    allege only their personal opinion, having no ancient records to attest. By far
                    the larger number in these groups were on the side of the court majority. The
                    Italian bishops, numbering about 170, and the Spanish, 40 in number, were also
                    infallibilists almost to a man, but included scarcely one theologian in their
                    ranks. And no fewer than 300 of this majority were the personal guests of Pius
                    IX., lodged, boarded, and maintained at his cost, and thus openly retained to do
                    his bidding. The minority consisted chiefly of the German and Austrian bishops,
                    a considerable section of Hungarian, French, and North-American prelates, and
                    many of those Orientals of the Latin Church who occupied dioceses other than
                    mere titular and paper ones. But this minority, though composed mainly of
                    natives of the most highly educated and intellectual countries, and containing
                    almost every bishop of note for ability and theological learning, was by no
                    means so compact and united as were the bishops of the majority; and there was
                    not even full agreement amongst its members as to the grounds for opposing the
                    new dogma, many going no further than its inopportuneness, but not entertaining
                    deeper objections to it. Thus, even apart from its numerical inferiority, the
                    opposition was at a disadvantage in face of the curialists, and lost not a few
                    members to them during the progress of the council. Not only were the efforts to
                    obtain freedom from the fetters of the brief <hi rend="italic">Multiplices
                    inter</hi> vain, but no member of the opposition could secure a place on any of
                    the commissions or sub-committees, which consisted exclusively of
                    infallibilists.</p>
                <p>The matter of most importance in the first congregation, which was held on 10th
                    December 1869, was the publication of a bull, decreeing that, if the pope should
                    die during the council, it should at once be prorogued and take no part in the
                    election of a pontiff, which was to be restricted to the college of cardinals.
                    The session which followed was little more than formal; but two steps towards
                    bringing about the intended result were taken before the next time of
                    assembling. The “theologians” were forbidden to attend any meetings of the
                    bishops, or even to meet among themselves to discuss any conciliar matters,
                    being restricted each to private conference with the particular bishop to whose
                    person he was attached; and various petitions for the definition of the new
                    dogma were drawn up and signed, one being the result of a letter to the bishops
                    of the council, issued by Archbishop Manning and the conductors of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Civiltà Cattolica,</hi> and signed by some hundreds, another from
                    the Italian prelates, a third from those of the Franciscan order, and a fourth
                    from the Uniat Armenians, besides several of less note. The opposition issued a
                    counter-memorial with 135 signatures; but, as it is therein admitted that papal
                    decrees <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra</hi> on faith and morals are irreversible,
                    even without the consent of the church being known in any way, and that true
                    obedience to every decree of the see of Rome is due by all Christians, no weight
                    could attach to it as a serious plea for rejecting, or even delaying, the
                    definition. The second session (6th January 1870) was also formal only, so far
                    as the direct transaction of business was concerned; but by the adoption of a
                    measure causing all the members present to recite the creed of Pius IV., <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n127/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0127-0112"/> containing a clause professing obedience to the
                    pope (this clause being omitted by the pope himself), and then to renew the
                    episcopal oath of feudal submission to the Papacy, powerful pressure was brought
                    to bear upon the weaker of the opposition, who were thus reminded how far they
                    had pledged themselves already, and how unreasonable it therefore was to haggle
                    about taking but one step in advance on the self-same road. The time between the
                    second and third sessions was mainly occupied in preparing the drafts <hi
                    rend="italic">(schemata)</hi> of constitutions on the faith and on the church,
                    and also with discussions of sundry disciplinary measures (notably as regards
                    clerical immorality) and the preparation of a new catechism; but none of these
                    last were proceeded with. By the pope’s direct command the cardinal-presidents
                    of the congregations issued, on 20th February 1870, rules to check long debates,
                    which drew yet tighter than before the cords that deprived the council of all
                    freedom. Speakers were confined to touching upon such clauses only of any
                    amendment as they had given previous notice of meaning to discuss, and were not
                    allowed to take part otherwise in a debate, while the closure could be applied
                    by the presidents at the demand of any ten members. This latter drastic measure
                    drew out a protest from more than one hundred bishops, who urged that it was
                    destructive of conciliar liberty (already much hampered by the noisy attempts of
                    the infallibilists to stifle free discussion), and that the steps being taken
                    disregarded the note of moral unanimity which should mark the decisions of a
                    general council, thereby exposing the council itself to hostile criticism and
                    even rejection. They pointed out several other serious faults in the new rules,
                    but could obtain no modification of them. The constitution on the faith (usually
                    cited now as <hi rend="italic">Dei Filius),</hi> however,—a long and far from
                    clearly worded document,— directed chiefly against modern rationalism, and
                    enforced by 18 canons of anathema, was completed; it passed the congregation
                    without difficulty, was signed by all the 667 members present, and was published
                    in the third session, 24th April 1870, with papal confirmation, or rather in the
                    unprecedented form of a proclamation by the pope singly, “the sacred council
                    approving,”—an innovation which was intended to mark it as solely his act, and
                    to settle in this summary manner the long-standing controversy as to the
                    relative superiority of popes and councils. There were few, however, even of the
                    opposition, who cared to contest such a point, and there was nothing of a
                    contentious nature, as regards the two parties in the council, in the
                    constitution itself, so that no debate was raised upon it.</p>
                <p>The real struggle was yet to come, namely, over the constitution on the church,
                    into which the new dogma was to be introduced. This constitution (now usually
                    cited as <hi rend="italic">Pastor Aeternus)</hi> asserted the following
                    propositions :—(1) that a proper primacy of jurisdiction over the whole church
                    was conferred upon St Peter directly and singly, and not mediately through any
                    delegation to him, as chief minister in the church, of a primacy held by the
                    church corporately; (2) that this Petrine primacy vests by divine institution
                    and right in the line of Roman pontiffs; (3) that the pope’s jurisdiction is
                    immediate in all churches— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he is the universal
                    ordinary, the actual bishop of every see (all other bishops being merely his
                    curates and deputies), and is not a remote or merely appellate authority—so that
                    in questions not of faith and morals alone, but of discipline and government
                    also, all the faithful, of whatever rite or dignity, both pastors and laity, are
                    bound, individually and collectively, to submit themselves thereto; (4) that it
                    is unlawful to appeal from the judgments of the Roman pontiffs to an oecumenical
                    council, as though to a higher authority; and (5) that the Roman pontiff, when
                    he speaks <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra,</hi> and defines a doctrine of faith or
                    morals to be held by the universal church, is infallible, and such definitions
                    are accordingly irreformable of themselves, and not from the consent of the
                    church. This document was voted upon in the congregation of 13th July 1870,
                    consisting of 671 members. Of these 451 voted in the affirmative; 88 voted
                    against it; 62 voted <hi rend="italic">placet juxta modum,</hi> meaning that
                    they would accept it if it were seriously modified; and 70 did not vote at all.
                    By the canonical theory of councils such a division of opinion as this voided
                    the decision of the majority, and made it null. For, while a bare majority in a
                    council suffices to pass a mere disciplinary canon, being a variable matter,
                    contrariwise, to enact a dogmatic decree requires practical unanimity, since
                    nothing can be imposed as of faith for which the two attesting notes of
                    universal prevalence and historical continuity cannot be adduced. And, as the
                    dissent of any appreciable number of members denotes that they do not know it as
                    the local tradition of their several dioceses, it thereby destroys the claim to
                    these notes. Not only so; but in view of the character in which bishops appear
                    at councils, as representing their laity, it is clear that the size and
                    population of their several dioceses have to be taken into account when
                    estimating the weight attaching to their individual testimony as to the
                    reception of any dogma within their jurisdictions. Tried by this standard, the
                    opposition was very much more important than its muster-roll seems to indicate,
                    for it included the bishops from many of the most populous Roman Catholic
                    dioceses, such as the archbishops of Paris, with 2,000,000 Catholics, Breslau
                    with 1,700,000, Cologne with 1,400,000, Vienna with about the same number, and
                    Cambrai with 1,300,000; whereas 62 bishops of the Papal States, for example,
                    represented no more than 700,000 altogether, apart from the hundred and more
                    titulars, who had no flocks at all. This matter may be summed up thus: every
                    vote cast for the new dogma stood for 142,570 lay folks; but every vote cast
                    against it stood for 492,520. Nor is this all: a council claiming to be
                    oecumenical must speak with the consent of both East and West. But, even if the
                    very large concession be made that the Uniat churches in communion with Rome are
                    in truth the lawful representatives of the ancient Oriental Church, the fact
                    remains that the number and rank of the Orientals in the minority was such as to
                    make the vote at best only a Latin one. The Melchite and Syrian patriarchs of
                    Antioch, the Chaldee patriarch of Babylon, the Melchite archbishop of Tyre, the
                    Maronite archbishops of Tyre and Sidon, of Beyrout, and of Aleppo, with several
                    others, were in one or other of the three groups of dissentients, and thus
                    nullified the Eastern suffrages in the majority. Immediately after this
                    preliminary voting nearly all the bishops of the minority abruptly quitted Rome,
                    after previously lodging a protest against the proceedings. Their flight was
                    prompted by fears for their personal safety. They were given to understand that
                    each of them would have two papers tendered to him for his signature in the
                    ensuing session, one being a profession of adhesion to the infallibility dogma,
                    the other a resignation of his diocese in case he refused such adhesion. And
                    they had good reason to think that the pope, who had declared that he meant to
                    be proclaimed infallible “without limitation” <hi rend="italic">(senza
                    condizione),</hi> and had shown open enmity to more than one of their number,
                    would employ direct coercion in the event of continued resistance, bringing his
                    temporal power as sovereign of Rome to bear on the rebels within his territory.
                    Accordingly, when the public session was held on 18th July 1870, while 535
                    bishops voted for the constitution <hi rend="italic">Pastor Aeternus,</hi> only
                    two, those of Ajaccio and of Little Rock, remained to utter their “non-placet.”
                    The pope thereupon confirmed the decree, and the proceedings virtually
                    ended.</p>
                <p>By one of the most singular of historical coincidences, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0128-0113"/> on that very day Napoleon III. proclaimed war
                    against Prussia, and entered on that great conflict amongst the immediate
                    results of which were the overthrow of the temporal power of the Papacy and the
                    occupation of Rome by the troops of the king of Italy in two months’ time from
                    the last meeting of the council. It was formally prorogued by Pius IX. on 20th
                    October, and is thus technically still in existence; but the prorogation is a
                    virtual dissolution.</p>
                <p>The opposition collapsed everywhere after the promulgation of the decree, as even
                    the German bishops, who had been the mainstay of the minority, consented to
                    publish it in their dioceses. This led to the genesis of the Old Catholic
                    communion (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Old Catholics)</hi> as a refuge for such as
                    were conscientiously unable to accept the new dogma, but equally unwilling to
                    join any of the Protestant societies. But submission to the dogma is not
                    identical with belief in it, at any rate in the sense wherein Pius IX.
                    understood it and meant it to be received. The majority had, indeed, achieved
                    their “triumph over history they had done what warning voices had declared
                    beforehand to be their purpose—annihilated the independence of the episcopate,
                    abrogated the teaching and attesting functions of the dispersive church, and
                    contracted the Roman Catholic creed into the single article of belief in the
                    pope. But they had failed in three matters essential to the ultimate success of
                    their plans. They had not even seemed to make any reply, save that of their
                    superior voting strength in the council, to the destructive criticism which had
                    established the falsehood and novelty of the infallibility dogma; they were not
                    able to pass it so as to be canonically or theologically binding; and they could
                    not secure its unqualified acceptance in its original form. Instead of
                    terminating all controversy, the new dogma (as might have been anticipated by
                    any one familiar either with the laws of the human intellect or the facts of
                    ecclesiastical history) at once became itself a topic of debate, receiving
                    contradictory interpretations, partly due to its vague and clumsy wording, and
                    partly the expression of competing opinions, ranging from the widest to the
                    narrowest view of its scope and force. The “senza condizione” of Pius IX. proved
                    hopelessly unworkable, and it was soon found necessary to modify the decree so
                    as to make it a not intolerable burden for intelligent consciences. Accordingly,
                    Bishop Fessler of St Pölten, secretarygeneral of the council, published in 1871,
                    with a brief of approbation from the pope, his treatise <hi rend="italic">Die
                    wahre und falsche Unfehlbarkeit der Päpste,</hi> soon reproduced in French and
                    English, which provides that “juxta modum” limitation vainly sought from the
                    tyrannical majority in the council itself. Ostensibly a reply to an
                    anti-infalli-bilist work by the learned canonist Von Schulte, it is in fact a
                    studious minimizing of the incidence of the dogma, arguing that the occasions
                    when the attribute of papal infallibility has been actually exercised and
                    formulated in <hi rend="italic">ex cathedra</hi> decrees have been, and must
                    continue to be, of extremely rare occurrence, and further attenuating the dogma
                    itself, so as to approach in some measure the old Gallican view of the pope’s
                    constitutional and limited authority as official spokesman of the church. In
                    England, where the evidence collected by Pitt in the 18th century, and by the
                    earl of Liverpool in the 19th, when aiming at the abolition of the penal laws,
                    on the opinions held by Roman Catholic theologians as to the prerogatives and
                    attributes of the popes, made their general repudiation of papal infallibility
                    familiarly known, the question was even more trenchantly dealt with. For Dr
                    Newman, who had anxiously deprecated the coming definition, speaking of it in a
                    letter to Bishop Ullathorne as a “great calamity,” wantonly forced on by “an
                    aggressive, insolent faction,” explained the manner of his own belief and
                    acceptance of it in a letter to the duke of Norfolk, and that in terms which to
                    less subtle (and, it may be, more practical) intellects are indistinguishable
                    from disbelief and rejection. Not only does he limit the attribute itself, and
                    the occasions of its exercise, within much straiter bounds than those set by
                    Fessler, but he specifies a number of cases wherein he would disobey a papal
                    mandate, and, after saying that each such mandate must be decided on its own
                    merits, adds: “I should look to see what theologians could do for me, what the
                    bishops and clergy around me, what my confessor, what friends whom I revered;
                    aud if, after all, I could not take their view of the matter, then I must rule
                    myself by my own judgment and my own conscience.” That this deliverance is in
                    effect a complete evacuation of the dogma will appear at once by supposing
                    cognate language to be used in the civil sphere by the subject of an absolute
                    temporal sovereign when defining the limits of his allegiance. But the
                    subsequent elevation of its author to the cardinalate proves that his view is
                    regarded as fairly tenable in the Roman Church, and the infallibility dogma is
                    thus, for the present at least, dismissed from the domain of practical action to
                    that of speculative theory.</p>
