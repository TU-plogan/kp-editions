                    fortifications of the 14th, 15th, and 17th centuries, pierced by four gates and
                    flanked by nine towers and five bastions, connected by battlements. Some of the
                    remains are Roman, and in the Constable’s Tower Olivier de Clisson was confined
                    in 1387. The modern suburbs, with public buildings, barracks, convents, squares,
                    walks, and the port surround the old town. The archaeological museum contains
                    one of the richest collections of prehistoric remains in Europe. There are also
                    a museum of natural history and a library (10,000 volumes). The cathedral of St
                    Peter overlooks the old town; burnt by the Normans in the 10th century, it was
                    rebuilt in the 13th, 15th, and 18th centuries. It has no architectural interest,
                    but contains the relics and tomb of St <hi rend="smallcaps">Vincent Ferrer</hi>
                    (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). The curious round Chapelle du Pardon was built in
                    1557 in the Italian style. Some interesting old houses, including that of St
                    Vincent Ferrer and that of the parlement of Brittany, the rich private
                    collections of Μ. de Limur, the huge barracks, and three large hospitals should
                    also be mentioned. In 1882 thirty-five vessels (3480 tons) entered and
                    seventy-four (7225 tons) left the port of Vannes, which is accessible to vessels
                    of 150 tons; those of 800 tons can come to within 2 miles. The population in
                    1881 was 16,667 (commune 19,284), and had increased by 1886 to 18,127 (commune
                    20,036).</p>
                <p>Vannes (<hi rend="italic">Dariorigιιm),</hi> the capital of the Veneti, was at
                    the head of the Armorican league against Julius Caesar, who in 56 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> overcame their fleet and opened up their country by
                    six roads. St Paternus, the first bishop, was consecrated in 465. In the 5th
                    century Vannes was ruled for a time by independent counts, but soon came under
                    the yoke of the Franks. Nominoe, the lieutenant of Louis the Pious in Brittany,
                    assumed the title of king in 843, and one of his brothers was the founder of a
                    line of counts who distinguished themselves against the Normans in the 9th and
                    10th centuries. Vannes became part of the duchy of Brittany under Geoffrey, who
                    died in 1008, and the estates of Brittany met there for the first time after the
                    death of Arthur of Brittany. In the course of the War of Succession the town was
                    besieged four times in 1342. Duke John IV. built here the castle of L’Hermine
                    and made it his habitual residence. In 1487 the town was for a year in the hands
                    of Charles VIII. of France. In 1532 Brittany was definitively united to France.
                    The estates met at Vannes several times in the 17th and 18th centuries. During
                    the Revolution this town was the scene of highly dramatic episodes, including
                    the execution of some of the prisoners of Quiberon.</p>
