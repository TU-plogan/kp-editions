                    rises from the eastern margin of the Bay of Naples in Italy, in the midst of a
                    region which has been densely populated by a civilized community for more than
                    twenty centuries. Hence it has served as a type for the general popular
                    conception of a volcano, and its history has supplied a large part of the
                    information on which geological theories of volcanic action have been based. The
                    height of the mountain varies from time to time within limits of several hundred
                    feet, according to the effects of successive eruptions, but averages somewhere
                    about 4000 feet above the sea. Vesuvius consists of two distinct portions. On
                    the northern side a lofty semicircular cliff, reaching a height of 3747 feet,
                    half encircles the present active cone, and descends in long slopes towards the
                    plains below. This precipice, known as Monte Somma, forms the wall of an ancient
                    prehistoric crater of vastly greater size than that of the present volcano. The
                    continuation of the same wall round its southern half has been in great measure
                    obliterated by the operations of the modern vent, which has built a younger cone
                    upon it, and is gradually filling up the hollow of the prehistoric crater. At
                    the time of its greatest dimensions the volcano was perhaps twice as high as it
                    is now. By a colossal eruption, of which no historical record remains, the upper
                    half of the cone was blown <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0215-0196"/> away. It was around this truncated cone that the
                    early Greek settlers founded their little colonies.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the Christian era, and for many previous centuries, no
                    eruption had been known to take place from the mountain, and the volcanic nature
                    of the locality was perhaps not even suspected by the inhabitants who planted
                    their vineyards along its fertile slopes, and built their numerous villages and
                    towns around its base. The sagacious and observant geographer Strabo, however,
                    detected the probable volcanic origin of the cone and drew attention to its
                    cindery and evidently fire-eaten rocks. From his account and other references in
                    classical authors we gather that in the first century of the Christian era, and
                    probably for hundreds of years before that time, the sides of the mountain were
                    richly cultivated, but towards the top the upward growth of vegetation had not
                    concealed the loose ashes which still remained as evidence of the volcanic
                    nature of the place. On this barren summit lay a wide flat depression,
                    surrounded with rugged walls of rock, which were festooned with wild vines. The
                    present crater-wall of Somma is doubtless a relic of that time. It was in this
                    lofty rock-girt hollow that the gladiator Spartacus was besieged by the praetor
                    Claudius Pulcher, and from which he escaped by twisting ropes of vinebranches
                    and descending through an unguarded notch in the crater-rim.</p>
                <p>After centuries of quiescence the volcanic energy began again to manifest itself
                    in a succession of earthquakes, which spread alarm far and wide through
                    Campania. For some sixteen years after 63 these convulsions continued, doing
                    much damage to the surrounding towns. At Pompeii, for example, among other
                    devastation, the temple of Isis was shaken into ruins, and, as an inscription
                    records, it was rebuilt from the foundations by the munificence of a private
                    citizen. This preliminary earthquake phase of volcanic excitement was succeeded
                    by a catastrophe which stands out prominently as one of the great calamities of
                    human history. On 24th August 79 the earthquakes, which had been growing more
                    violent, culminated in a tremendous explosion of Vesuvius. A contemporary
                    account of this event has been preserved in two letters of the younger Pliny to
                    the historian Tacitus. From this narrative we can gather a tolerably clear
                    conception of the general characteristics of the eruption :—abundant and
                    increasingly violent earthquakes, followed by an extraordinary commotion that
                    accompanied the outburst of the volcano, when chariots would not remain still
                    even on level ground, when houses were shaken so as to threaten destruction to
                    their inhabitants, and when the unsteadiness of the land gave rise to great
                    disturbance of the sea, which in its agitation retreated from the shores and
                    left numerous marine animals uncovered; the well-known pine-tree-shaped cloud of
                    steam, dust, and stones towering above Vesuvius and spreading out far and wide
                    over the surrounding country; the constant flashes of lightning marking the
                    highly electrical condition of the column of erupted material; the showers of
                    light cinders and ashes that fell at a distance from the mountain and the rain
                    of hot pumice and pieces of black or glowing lava around the centre of eruption;
                    the total darkness for three days produced by the diffusion of the finer
                    volcanic dust through the atmosphere; the fiery glare that overspread the
                    cloud-canopy as each explosion uncovered the glowing surface of the lava column
                    in the chimney of the volcano; and the wide covering of ashes, which like a
                    mantle of snow was found to have been spread over the surrounding country when
                    the darkness cleared away and the catastrophe came to an end. This eruption was
                    attended with great destruction of life and property. Three towns are known to
                    have been destroyed—Herculaneum at the western base of the volcano, Pompeii on
                    the south-east side, and Stabiae, still farther south on the site of the modern
                    Castellamare. The exhumation of Herculaneum and Pompeii in modern times has
                    thrown much light upon the life of Roman citizens in the first century. There is
                    no evidence that any lava was emitted during this eruption. But the abundant
                    steam given off by the volcano seems to have condensed into copious rain, which,
                    mixing with the light volcanic dust, gave rise to torrents of pasty mud, that
                    flowed down the slopes and overwhelmed houses and villages. Herculaneum is
                    believed to have been destroyed by these “water lavas,” and there is reason to
                    suppose that similar materials filled the cellars and lower parts of Pompeii.
                    Comparing the statements of Pliny with the facts still observable in the
                    district, we perceive that this first recorded eruption of Vesuvius belongs to
                    that phase of volcanic action known as the <hi rend="italic">paroxysmal,</hi>
                    when, after a longer or shorter period of comparative tranquillity, a volcano
                    rapidly resumes its energy and the partially filled-up crater is cleared out by
                    a succession of tremendous explosions. The great eruption of Krakatoa in the
                    Sunda Strait in 1883 is a recent example of the same stage in the history of a
                    volcano.</p>
                <p>For nearly fifteen hundred years after the catastrophe of 79 Vesuvius remained in
                    a condition of feeble activity. Occasional eruptions are mentioned, but none
                    that was of importance, and their details are given with great vagueness by the
                    authors who allude to them. By the end of the 17th century the mountain had
                    resumed much the same general aspect as it presented before the eruption
                    described by Pliny. Its crater-walls, some 5 miles in circumference, were hung
                    with trees and brushwood, and at their base stretched a wide grassy plain, on
                    which cattle grazed and where the wild boar lurked in the thickets. The central
                    tract was a lower plain, covered with loose ashes and marked by a few pools of
                    hot and saline water. At length, after a series of earthquakes lasting for six
                    months and gradually increasing in violence, the volcano burst into renewed
                    paroxysmal activity on 16th December 1631. Vast clouds of dust and stones, blown
                    out of the crater and funnel of the volcano, were hurled into the air and
                    carried for hundreds of miles, the finer particles falling to the earth even in
                    the Adriatic and at Constantinople. The clouds of steam condensed into copious
                    torrents, which, mingling with the fine ashes, produced muddy streams that swept
                    far and wide over the plains, reaching even to the foot of the Apennines.
                    Issuing from the flanks of the mountain, several streams of lava flowed down
                    towards the west and south, and reached the sea at twelve or thirteen different
                    points. Though the inhabitants had been warned by the earlier convulsions of the
                    mountain, so swiftly did destruction come upon them that 18,000 are said to have
                    lost their lives.</p>
                <p>Since this great convulsion, which emptied the crater, Vesuvius has never again
                    relapsed into a condition of total quiescence. At intervals, varying from a few
                    weeks or months to a few years, it has broken out into eruption, sometimes
                    emitting only steam, dust, and scoriae, but frequently also streams of lava. The
                    years 1766-67, 1779, 1794, and 1822 were marked by special activity, and the
                    phenomena observed on each of these occasions have been fully described.</p>
                <p>The modern cone of the mountain has been built up by successive discharges of
                    lava and fragmentary materials round a vent of eruption, which lies a little
                    south of the centre of the prehistoric crater. The southern segment of the
                    ancient cone, answering to the semicircular wall of Somma on the north side, has
                    been almost concealed, but is still traceable among the younger accumulations.
                    The numerous deep ravines that indented the sides of the prehistoric<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0216-0197"/> volcano, and which still form so marked a feature
                    on the outer slopes of Somma, have on the south side served as channels to guide
                    the currents of lava from the younger cone. But they are gradually being filled
                    up there and will before long disappear under the sheets of molten rock that
                    from time to time rush into them from above. On one of the ridges between these
                    radiating valleys an observatory for watching the progress of the volcano was
                    established many years ago by the Neapolitan Government, and is still supported
                    as a national institution. A continuous record of each phase in the volcanic
                    changes has been taken, and some progress has been made in the study of the
                    phenomena of Vesuvius, and in prognosticating the occurrence and probable
                    intensity of eruptions. A wirerope railway (opened in the year 1880) carries
                    visitors from the foot of the cone up to within 150 yards of the mouth of the
                    crater.</p>
