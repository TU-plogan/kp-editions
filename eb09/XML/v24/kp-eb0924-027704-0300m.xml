                <p><label type="entry">VOLE</label> (Germ. <hi rend="italic">Wühlmaus,</hi> Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">Campagnol).</hi> This word, little known as it is to the majority
                    of English people, is the proper name for a genus containing three of the
                    commonest of our English mammals, namely, the water, bank, and field
                    voles,—animals generally called “water-rat,” “red field-mouse,” and
                    “short-tailed field-mouse” respectively. The scientific name for the group is
                    <hi rend="italic">Arvicola,</hi> a genus which, with the lemmings and two or
                    three other genera, forms the subfamily <hi rend="italic">Arvicolinae</hi> of
                    the great Rodent family <hi rend="italic">Muridae,</hi> whose proper place in
                    the general system is shown under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. xv.
                    p. 419).</p>
                <p>The voles, as a whole, are distinguished by their squat and heavy shape, their
                    slower and less graceful movements, very small eyes, blunt snout, inconspicuous
                    ears, and shortened limbs and tail, in all of which points they are markedly
                    contrasted with the true rats and mice of the genus <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>
                    the only animals with which they can be confounded. But by far the most
                    important characteristic of the voles lies in their molar teeth, which have been
                    said to form “the perfection of Rodent dentition” from their wonderful
                    specialization and adaptation to the purpose of grinding vegetable substances.
                    These teeth, three in number on each side of each jaw, are rootless, that is to
                    say, they go on growing during the whole life of the animal at the same rate <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n301/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0301-0278"/> that they are worn down by use, just as is the
                    case with the incisors, whose rootless condition is a characteristic of the
                    whole Rodent order. Each tooth consists of a variable number of prismatic
                    pillars formed externally of enamel and internally of the softer dentine, their
                    section, as produced naturally by wear, being as is shown in the woodcut, a
                    figure which may be compared with that given of the true murine dentition under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mouse</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 5). The general prismatic
                    appearance of the teeth, however, is only due to the bending in at regular
                    distances of the external enamel walls of the tooth, to such an extent that the
                    enamel touches that at the opposite side of the tooth and thus shuts off a
                    greater or less number of dentinal spaces, triangular in section. Owing to the
                    manner of growth of the teeth their general pattern of spaces and angles is but
                    little affected by age and wear, remaining practically the same throughout the
                    life of the animal. On this account the variations in the pattern have been very
                    generally used as a means of characterizing the different genera, subgenera, and
                    species of the group, although their value for this purpose has of late been
                    questioned, and a new classification proposed, entirely ignoring the
                    toothcharacters, and based more upon external peculiarities.</p>
                <p>Without entering into the characters of the different sub-groups of the voles, it
                    may suffice to say that each of the three species found in Great Britain belongs
                    to a distinct subgenus of <hi rend="italic">Arvicola,</hi> and therefore the
                    three together give a fair idea of the extent to which the subgenera differ from
                    one another. These three species are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. The common Water-Vole (<hi rend="italic">Arvicola amphibius)</hi> is as large
                    as the house-rat, with which it is so often confused, but possesses of course
                    the bluff-headed appearance and short tail characteristic of the voles. Its fur
                    is long, soft, and thick, of a uniform grizzled brown all over, except when, as
                    is not uncommon, it is wholly black. Its tail is about half the length of its
                    head and body, and its hind feet are unusually long and powerful, although not
                    webbed, and have five rounded pads on their lower surfaces. Its molar teeth (see
                    woodcut) present the following number of prismatic spaces:—in the upper jaw the
                    first, or anterior, has 5, the second 4, and the third 4, of which the last is
                    very irregular in shape, and is sometimes itself divided into two, making 5 in
                    all; in the lower jaw the first has 7 spaces, of which the 3 anterior are
                    generally not fully separated from one another, the second has 5, and the third
                    3. These numbers for the different teeth are taken as the characters of the
                    subgenus <hi rend="italic">Paludicola</hi> of Dr Blasius, by whom this method of
                    subdividing the group was first introduced. The water-vole is one of the
                    commonest English mammals, and is perhaps the most often actually seen of all,
                    owing to its diurnal instead of nocturnal habits. It frequents rivers and
                    streams, burrowing deeply into their banks, and in this way often causing
                    considerable damage. Its food consists almost wholly of waterweeds, rushes, and
                    other vegetable substances, but, like so many other rodents, it will also eat
                    animal food on occasion, in the shape of insects, mice, or young birds. The
                    female has during the warm season of the year three or four litters, each of
                    from two to seven young. The range of the water-rat extends over the whole of
                    Europe and North Asia, from England to China, but is not found in Ireland,
                    where, curiously, no species of <hi rend="italic">Arvicola</hi> is
                    indigenous.</p>
                <p>2. The next British species, representing the subgenus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agricola</hi> of Dr Blasius, is the common Field-Vole, or short-tailed
                    field-mouse (<hi rend="italic">Arvicola agrestis),</hi> about the size of a
                    house-mouse, but with a short stumpy body, and a tail only about one-third the
                    length of the head and body combined. Its hind feet have six pads on their
                    inferior surfaces. Its colour is dull grizzled brown above, and greyish-white
                    below. Its molar teeth have respectively 5, 5, and 6 prismatic spaces above, and
                    9, 5, and 3 below. The field-vole is one of the commonest of our smaller
                    mammals, and frequents fields, woods, and gardens in enormous numbers, often
                    doing very considerable damage in the latter owing to its fondness for garden
                    produce of all kinds. It is spread over the whole of Great Britain from the
                    Hebrides southwards. Abroad its range extends from Finland to North Italy and
                    from France and Spain to Russia.</p>
                <p>3. The Bank-Vole (<hi rend="italic">Arvicola glareolus)</hi> is of much the size
                    and general appearance of the common field-vole, but may be distinguished by its
                    more or less rusty or rufous-coloured back, its larger ears, and its
                    comparatively longer tail, which attains to about half the length of the head
                    and body. Its molar teeth present characters so different from those of all
                    other voles as to have caused it to be often looked upon as belonging to an
                    entirely distinct genus, for which the name of <hi rend="italic">Evotomys</hi>
                    is used. Their chief distinction lies in the fact that, unlike those of all
                    other voles, their pulp-cavities close up in adult life, and they form distinct
                    roots, more resembling those of the ordinary rats and mice. The enamel spaces of
                    these teeth number respectively 5, 4, and 5 above, and 7, 3, and 3 below. The
                    habits of this species are in every way similar to those of the field-vole. Its
                    range in Great Britain extends northwards to Morayshire, beyond which it has not
                    yet been observed. Abroad it is found all along the north temperate zone from
                    France to China, and is replaced in North America by a closely allied animal
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Arvicola gapperi.</hi> It is probable, however, that
                    both these forms, <hi rend="italic">A. gapperi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.
                    glareolus,</hi> are only southern climatic offshoots of a still more northern
                    species, the <hi rend="italic">Arvicola rutilus</hi> of northern Europe,
                    Siberia, and Arctic America.</p>
                <p>The foreign species of vole number about 40, of which about 10 are European, 20
                    Asiatic, and 10 North American, none being found either in Africa, India (except
                    in the extreme north), Australia, or South America. The group is therefore one
                    peculiarly characteristic of the temperate parts of the northern hemisphere. (o.
