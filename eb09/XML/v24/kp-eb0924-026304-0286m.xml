                <p><label type="entry">VITRIFIED FORTS</label> is the name given to certain rude
                    stone enclosures whose walls bear ' traces of having been subjected to the
                    action of fire. They are generally situated on elevated hills, which occupy
                    strong and easily defended positions. Their form is irregular, and seems to have
                    been determined rather by the contour of the flat summits which they enclose
                    than by any definite architectural plan. The walls vary in size, some being
                    comparatively small, while a few are upwards of 12 feet high, and are so broad
                    that they present the appearance of huge embankments. Weak and exposed parts in
                    the defence are strengthened by double or triple walls, and occasionally vast
                    lines of ramparts, composed of large blocks of unhewn and unvitrified stones,
                    are drawn around the fortified hills at some distance from the vitrified centre.
                    No lime or cement has been found in any of these structures, but all of them
                    present the peculiarity of being more or less consolidated<pb break="no"

                    built. This fusion, which has been caused by the application of intense heat, is
                    not equally complete and regular in the various forts, or even in the walls of
                    the same fort. In some cases the stones are only partially melted and calcined;
                    in others their adjoining edges are fused so that they are firmly cemented
                    together; in many instances pieces of rock are enveloped in a glassy enamel-like
                    coating which binds them into a uniform whole; and at times, though rarely, the
                    entire length of the wall presents one solid mass of vitreous substance.</p>
                <p>Since John Williams—one of the earliest of British geologists, and author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Mineral Kingdom—</hi> first described, in 1777, these singular
                    ruins, about fifty examples have been discovered in different parts of Scotland.
                    The most remarkable are Dun Mac Uisneachain, the ancient Beregonium, north of
                    Oban; Tap o’ Noth, in Aberdeenshire; Craig Phadraic and Dun Dhardhail, in
                    Inverness; Knockfarrail, near Strathpeffer; Dun Creich, in Sutherland;
                    Findhaven, near Aberlemno; Barryhill, in Perthshire; Laws, near Dundee; Dun Gall
                    and Burnt Island, in Buteshire; Anwoth, in Kirkcudbright; and Cowdenknowes, in
                    Berwickshire. Dun Mac Uisneachain is the largest in area, being 250 yards long
                    by 50 yards broad. The strongest and most cyclopean is the Tap o’ Noth: here the
                    walls are about 8 feet high, and between 20 and 30 feet thick. In Dun Mac
                    Uisneachain, Barryhill, and Laws the remains of small rectangular huts or
                    dwellings have been found.</p>
                <p>For a long time it was supposed that these forts were limited in their range to
                    Scotland; but they are now known to exist in Londonderry and Cavan, in Ireland;
                    in Upper Lusatia, Bohemia, Silesia, Saxony, and Thuringia; in the provinces on
                    the upper banks of the Rhine, especially in the neighbourhood of the Nahe; in
                    the Ucker Lake, in Brandenburg, where the walls are formed of burnt and smelted
                    bricks; and in several places in France, such as Châteauvieux, Peran, La Courbe,
                    Saint Suzanne, Puy de Gaudy, and Thauron. They have not been found in England or
                    Wales; and Worsaae, Herbst, Rygh, Hildebrand, and Stephens assert that they do
                    not exist in Denmark or in Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>All the examples yet described present a general similarity in form and
                    structure. In some of the Continental forts the vitrified walls are supported by
                    masses of unvitrified stone built up on each side. This, in all probability,
                    constituted an essential feature in the Scottish forts. Except on the hypothesis
                    of buttresses of a similar kind, it is impossible to explain the vast quantities
                    of loose stones which are found both inside and outside many of the vitrified
                    walls.</p>
                <p>The method by which the fusion of such extensive fortifications was produced has
                    always excited much interest and conjecture. Williams, when he first directed
                    attention to the subject, maintained that the builders of the forts, whoever
                    they were, found out, either during the process of smelting bog-ore, or whilst
                    offering sacrifices, the power of fire in vitrifying stone, and that they
                    improved upon this discovery by using it for the purpose of cementing and
                    strengthening their strongholds. This view has been keenly controverted, and
                    other theories have been suggested. It has been held that the vitrified summits
                    were not forts at all, but the craters of extinct volcanoes (West, Pennant, and
                    Cordiner), an hypothesis long since abandoned as unscientific; that the
                    vitrified summits are not so much vitrified forts as vitrified sites, and that
                    the vitrescence was produced by beacon fires lighted during times of invasion,
                    or by bonfires kindled on hill tops in religious celebrations (Sir George
                    Mackenzie, Dr S. Hibbert, and Principal Daniel Wilson); and, lastly, that if
                    they were forts they must have originally been built of wood and stone, and that
                    their present vitrified appearance is not due to design, but to their being set
                    on fire by a besieging enemy (A. Fraser Tytler, Forbes Leslie, Von Cohausen, and
                    Dr Joseph Anderson). The theory of Williams—which has, with modifications, been
                    accepted by all the principal British and Continental authorities, such as
                    MacCulloch, Hugh Miller, Virchow, Schaaffhausen, Thuot, and Montaiglon—is likely
                    to hold the field. It is supported by the following facts :—</p>
                <p>(1) The idea of strengthening walls by means of fire is not singular, or confined
                    to a distinct race or area, as is proved by the burnt-earth enclosure of
                    Aztalan, in Wisconsin, and the vitrified stone monuments of the Mississippi
                    valley. (2) Many of the Primary rocks, particularly the schists, gneisses, and
                    traps, which contain large quantities of potash and soda, can be readily fused
                    in the open air by means of wood fires,—the alkali of the wood serving in some
                    measure as a flux. (3) The walls are chiefly vitrified at the weakest points,
                    the naturally inaccessible parts being unvitrified. (4) When the forts have been
                    placed on materials practically infusible, as on the quartzose conglomerates of
                    the Old Red Sandstone, as at Craig Phadraic, and on the limestones of Dun Mac
                    Uisneachain, pieces of fusible rocks have been selected and carried from a
                    considerable distance to the top. (5) The vitrified walls of the Scottish forts
                    are invariably formed of small stones which could be easily acted upon by fire,
                    whereas the outer ramparts, which are not vitrified, are built of large blocks.
                    (6) Many of the Continental forts are so constructed that the fire must have
                    been applied internally, and at the time when the structure was being erected.
                    (7) Daubrée, in an analysis which he made on vitrified materials taken from four
                    French forts, and which he submitted to the Academy of Paris in February 1881,
                    found the presence of natron in such great abundance that he inferred that
                    sea-salt was used to facilitate the original fusion. (8) In Scandinavia, where
                    there are hundreds of ordinary forts, and where for centuries a system of signal
                    fires was enforced by law, no trace of vitrifaction has yet been detected.</p>
                <p>A great antiquity has been assigned to vitrified forts, but without sufficient
                    proof. Articles of bronze and iron have been found in the Scottish forts, while
                    in Puy de Gaudy a Roman tile has been discovered soldered to a piece of
                    vitrified rock. In a few of the German forts Prof. Virchow found some of the
                    short logs of oak used as fuel in vitrifying the walls, and he concluded from
                    the evenness of their cut surfaces that iron and not stone implements must have
                    been used. These results indicate that these structures are the products of a
                    high civilization, and were possibly in use as late as the early centuries of
                    our era. It has been suggested that they were built as temporary refuges against
                    the invasions of the Norsemen in Europe. There is much in the situation and
                    character of the forts which favours this supposition. This is especially the
                    case with reference to the Scottish forts. Here the vitrified summits are
                    invariably so selected that they not only command what were, as we learn from
                    the sagas, the favourite landing places of the vikings, but are the best natural
                    defences against attacks made from the direction of the sea-coast. In Saxony and
                    Lusatia the forts are known as <hi rend="italic">Schwedenburgen,</hi> and in the
                    Highlands of Scotland as the fortresses of the <hi rend="italic">Feinne—</hi>
                    designations which also seem to point to an origin dating back to the times of
                    the vikings.</p>
                <p>It may be interesting, as throwing light on the influence of high temperature on
                    rocks, to notice some of the forms exhibited by the fused substances. Schistose
                    gneiss is resolved into a kind of green glass; mica is converted into a grey
                    glassy stone of great hardness; quartz is reduced to the condition of pumice;
                    trap rock becomes glazed like bottle glass; sandstone is transformed into a
                    compact quartzite; and the felspar of granite is changed into coarse porcelain.
                    Some of the materials have assumed, probably during the process of cooling, the
                    prismatic structure, with four or six sides; while others, owing to the iron
                    peroxide being reduced, have become distinctly magnetic.</p>
