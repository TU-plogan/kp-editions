                    native of eastern Mexico, but now largely cultivated in several tropical
                    countries, especially in Réunion, the Seychelles, and Java. The plant has a long
                    fleshy stem and attaches itself by its aerial rootlets to trees, and appears to
                    be little dependent on the soil for nourishment. The leaves are alternate,
                    oval-lanceolate, and fleshy; and the greenish white flowers form axillary
                    spikes. The fruit is a pod from 6 to 12 inches long, and when mature about half
                    an inch in diameter. The wild plant yields a smaller and less aromatic fruit,

                    cultivated vanilla being known as <hi rend="italic">B. corriente.</hi> Mexican
                    vanilla is regarded as the best. It is principally consumed in the United
                    States, which import about 100,000 lb of it annually. Réunion produces about the
                    same quantity, which is sent to Bordeaux, the chief centre of the trade in
                    France. Its odour is said to differ from the Mexican variety in having a
                    suggestion of tonqua bean. Guadaloupe produces about 5000 lb per annum, which is
                    likewise shipped to Bordeaux. Mauritius exported 20,481 lb in 1877. The
                    Seychelles have lately produced large quantities of exceedingly fine quality;
                    the produce of these islands goes chiefly to the London market. The Java
                    vanilla, grown chiefly in Krawang and the Preanger Regencies, is shipped to
                    Holland. The amount exported from the East Indian Archipelago to Holland in 1876
                    amounted to about 5000 lb. The best varieties of vanilla pods are of a dark
                    chocolate brown or nearly black colour, and are covered with a crystalline
                    efflorescence technically known as <hi rend="italic">givre,</hi> the presence of
                    which is taken as a criterion of quality. The peculiar fragrance of vanilla is
                    due to vanillin, C <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which forms this efflorescence. Chemically
                    speaking, it is the aldehyde of methyl-protocatechuic acid. It is not naturally
                    present in the fleshy exterior of the pod, but is secreted by hairlike papillae
                    lining its three internal angles, and ultimately becomes diffused through the
                    viscid oily liquid surrounding the seeds. The amount of vanillin varies
                    according to the kind: Mexican vanilla yields 1∙69, Bourbon or Réunion 19 to
                    2∙48, and Java 2∙75 per cent. Besides vanillin, the pods contain vanillic acid
                    (which is odourless), about 11 per cent. of fixed oil, 2 3 per cent. of soft
                    resin, sugar, gum, and oxalate of lime.</p>
                <p>Vanillin forms crystalline needles, fusible at 81° C., and soluble in alcohol and
                    ether, hardly soluble in cold, but more so in boiling water. Like other
                    aldehydes, it forms a compound with the alkaline bisulphites, and can by this
                    means be extracted from bodies containing it. Vanillin has been found in Siam
                    benzoin and in raw sugar, and has been prepared artificially from coniferin, a
                    substance found in the sapwood of fir-trees, from asafoetida, and from a
                    constituent of oil of cloves named eugenol. It is from the last-named that
                    vanillin is now prepared on a commercial scale, chiefly in Germany. Vanillin

                    as much as 10 to 15 grains having been administered without noxious results. On
                    small animals, however, such as frogs, it appears to act as a convulsive. It has
                    been suggested as a stimulant of an excito-motor character in atonic dyspepsia.
                    The poisonous effects that have on several occasions followed from eating ices
                    flavoured with vanilla are not to be attributed to the vanilla, but probably to
                    the presence of <hi rend="italic">tyrotoxicon (Pharm. Journ.</hi> [3], xvii. p.
                    150), a poison found in milk which has undergone certain putrefactive changes,
                    and producing choleraic effects, or perhaps to the presence of microscopic fungi
                    in the vanilla, the plantations being liable to the attack of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bacterium putredinis.</hi> Workmen handling the beans in the Bordeaux factories
                    are subject to itching of the hands and face; but this is caused by an <hi
                    rend="italic">Acarus</hi> which occupies the end of the pod. In some cases,
                    however, symptoms of dizziness, weariness, and malaise, with muscular pains,
                    have been felt, due probably to the absorption of the oily juice by the hands of
                    the workmen. These symptoms have been attributed to the variety of vanilla known
                    as vanillon, but it seems equally probable that they are due to
                    idiosyncrasy.</p>
                <p>The method of cultivation and preparation of vanilla for the market varies
                    somewhat in different countries. In Mexico a clearing is made in the forest,
                    where a few young trees, 12 or 15 feet apart, are left to serve as a support for
                    the climbing stems of the vanilla plant. Close to each tree two cuttings, 3 to 5
                    feet in length, are inserted in the soil to the depth of about a foot, the upper
                    part being tied to the tree. The cuttings become rooted in about a month, but do
                    not bear fruit until the third year. They continue to bear for about thirty
                    years. In Réunion, Mauritius, and the Seychelles the young plants are supported
                    by a rude trellis made between the trunks of trees. Although the plants are
                    probably fertilized by insects in their native country, in Réunion and elsewhere
                    fertilization has to be promoted by hand. Only the finest flowers of each spike
                    are fertilized, or the plants would die of exhaustion. The pods are cut off
                    separately as they ripen, since, if over-ripe, they are apt to split in drying,
                    and if unripe the product will be of inferior colour and fragrance. The pods
                    take a month to arrive at full size and six months longer to ripen. The exact
                    time for collecting is judged by the crackling of the pod when pinched between
                    the fingers. The aroma of vanilla is developed by fermentation, and is said not
                    to pre-exist in the ripe fruit.</p>
                <p>In Mexico the pods, after they are gathered, are placed in heaps under a shed
                    until they begin to shrivel, and are then submitted to a sweating process. They
                    are next wrapped in a woollen cloth and exposed to the sun during the day, or
                    heated in an oven to 140° Fahr. if the weather is cloudy, and then enclosed in
                    air-tight boxes at night to sweat. In twenty-four to thirty-six hours, according
                    to size, the pods have acquired a fine chestnut-brown colour. They are then
                    spread in the sun for about two months to dry, and are subsequently tied up into
                    small packets of uniform length. In Réunion the pods are sorted into lengths and
                    scalded in boiling water, the long pods being immersed ten seconds, those of a
                    medium size fifteen seconds, and the short ones for fully one minute. They are
                    next exposed to the sun between woollen blankets for about a week, until they
                    assume the characteristic brown colour. They are then spread out under
                    zinc-roofed sheds and turned frequently to ensure equal drying. When the beans
                    can be twisted round the finger without cracking, the “smoothing process” is
                    commenced. This consists in passing the beans between the fingers frequently,
                    apparently to distribute equally the unctuous liquid which exudes as the
                    fermentation proceeds, and to which the lustre and suppleness of the bean are
                    due. When dry they are tied up in bundles of uniform length. These are divided
                    into three commercial sorts,—(1) those which are nearly black and glossy and
                    which soon become frosted; (2) those which are lighter in colour, more or less
                    spotted with grey, and not so glossy; (3) those which are gathered in an unripe
                    condition and become little, if at all, frosted over with crystals. In Guiana,
                    where an inferior quality is prepared, the beans are placed on ashes and left
                    until they begin to shrivel; they are then wiped, rubbed over with oil, and, the
                    lower end of the pod having been tied, are hung up in the air to dry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Other Varieties.—</hi> In Brazil, Peru, and other parts of
                    South America a broad and fleshy vanilla is prepared, which has an inferior
                    odour. It is believed to be obtained from <hi rend="italic">V. pompona,</hi>
                    Schiede, which has been found to contain, besides from ∙4 to ∙7 per cent. of
                    vanillin, another ingredient, benzaldehyde, by which the odour of vanilla is
                    modified. This variety is often distinguished as vanillon in commerce. It is
                    destitute of <hi rend="italic">givre.</hi> Rio vanilla is collected on the banks
                    of the Parahyba river in the province of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and is obtained
                    from <hi rend="italic">V. palmarum,</hi> Lindl. It has been found to yield l∙03
                    per cent. of vanillin. It is of inferior quality, but might be improved if more
                    attention were paid to the curing process. Guiana vanilla is a coarse variety
                    obtained from <hi rend="italic">V. guianensis,</hi> Splitberger. The pods are
                    short, thick, and frequently split open, and of inferior fragrance. None of the
                    South-American vanillas appear to be used in Great Britain for flavouring
                    purposes, but solely for perfumery. (E. Μ. H. )</p>
