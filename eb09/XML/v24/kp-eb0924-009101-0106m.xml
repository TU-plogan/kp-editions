                    where he carried on his studies. In 1812 he joined the Prussian civil service at
                    Berlin, but in the following year resumed his military career, this time as a
                    captain in the Russian army. He accompanied Tettenborn to Hamburg and Paris, and
                    his experiences were recorded in his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Hamburger
                    Ereignisse</hi> (1813) and his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Kriegszüge
                    Tettenborn’s</hi> (1814). At Paris he entered the diplomatic service of Prussia,
                    and in 1814 acted under Hardenberg at the congress of Vienna. He also
                    accompanied Hardenberg to Paris in 1815. He was resident minister for some time
                    at Carlsruhe, but was recalled in 1819, after which he lived chiefly at Berlin
                    as a privy councillor of legation <hi rend="italic">(Geheimer
                    Legationsrath).</hi> He had no fixed official appointment, but was often
                    employed in important political business.</p>
                <p>In 1814 he married Rahel Antonie Friederike, originally called Levin, afterwards
                    Robert. She was born in 1771 at Berlin, where she died in 1833. By birth she was
                    a Jewess; but before her marriage she made profession of Christianity. Although
                    she never wrote anything for publication, she was a woman of remarkable
                    intellectual qualities, and exercised a powerful influence on many men of high
                    ability. Her husband, who was devotedly attached to her, found in her sympathy
                    and encouragement one of the chief sources of his inspiration as a writer. After
                    her death he published a selection from her papers, and afterwards much of her
                    correspondence was printed. Varnhagen von Ense never fully recovered from the
                    shock caused by her death. He himself died suddenly in Berlin on 10th October
                    1858.</p>
                <p>He made some reputation as an imaginative and critical writer, but he is famous
                    chiefly as a biographer. He possessed a remarkable power of grouping facts so as
                    to bring out their essential significance, and his style is distinguished for
                    its strength, grace, and purity. Among his principal works are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Goethe in den Zeugnissen der Mitlebenden</hi> (1824); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographische Denkmale</hi> (five vols., 1824-30); and “Lives” of General von
                    Seydlitz (1834), Sophia Charlotte, queen of Prussia (1837), Field-Marshal
                    Schwerin (1841), Field-Marshal Keith (1844), and General Bülow von Dennewitz
                    (1853). His <hi rend="italic">Denkwürdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften</hi>
                    appeared in seven volumes in 1837-46. After his death were published two
                    additional volumes of <hi rend="italic">Denkwürdigkeiten,</hi> some volumes of
                    his correspondence with eminent men, his <hi rend="italic">Tagebücher</hi> (14
                    vols. ), <hi rend="italic">Blätter aus der preussischen Geschichte</hi> (5 vols.
                    ), and <hi rend="italic">Biographische Porträts.</hi> His selected writings
                    appeared in nineteen volumes in 1871-76.</p>
