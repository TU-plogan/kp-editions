                    museum, 1464. He worked in company with a certain “Joannes de Alemania.” By some
                    writers Joannes has been regarded as himself a Vivarini, but this appears
                    improbable: no trace of him exists of a date later than 1447. After 1447 Antonio
                    painted either alone or in combination with his younger brother Bartolommeo. The
                    works of Antonio are well drawn for their epoch, with a certain noticeable
                    degree of softness, and with good flesh and other tints. Three of his principal
                    paintings are the Virgin Enthroned with the Four Doctors of the Church, the
                    Coronation of the Virgin, and Sts Peter and Jerome. The first two (in which
                    Joannes co-operated) are in the Venetian academy, the third in the London
                    National Gallery.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bartolommeo Vivarini</hi> is known to have worked from 1450
                    to 1499. He learned oil-painting from Antonello da Messina, and is said to have
                    produced, in 1473, the first oil picture done in Venice. This is in the church
                    of Sts John and Paul,—a large altar-piece in nine divisions, representing
                    Augustine and other saints. Most of his works, however, including one in the
                    National Gallery, are in tempera. His outline is always hard, and his colour
                    good; the figures have much dignified and devout expression. As “vivarino” means
                    in Italian a goldfinch, he sometimes drew a goldfinch as the signature of his
                    pictures.</p>

                    painted in 1490 and on to 1505. It has sometimes been supposed that, besides the
                    Luigi who was the latest of this pictorial family, there had also been another
                    Luigi who was the earliest, this supposition being founded on the fact that one
                    picture is signed with the name, along with the date 1414. There is good ground,
                    however, for considering this date to be a forgery of a later time. The works of
                    Luigi show an advance on those of his predecessors, his best work being one
                    which he executed for the Scuola di S. Girolamo in Venice, representing the
                    saint caressing his lion, and some monks decamping in terror. The architecture
                    and perspective in this work are superior. Other works by Luigi are in Treviso
                    and in Milan.</p>
