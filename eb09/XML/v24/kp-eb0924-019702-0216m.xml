                <p><label type="entry">VETERINARY SCIENCE</label></p>
                <p>THIS science comprises a knowledge of the conformation and structure of all the
                    domesticated animals, especially the horse; their physiology and special racial
                    and individual characteristics; their humane management and utilization; their
                    protection from, and medical and surgical treatment in, the diseases and
                    injuries to which they are exposed; their amelioration and improvement; their
                    relations to the human family with regard to communicable disorders; and the
                    supply of food and other products, more particularly those derived from them for
                    the use of mankind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi></p>
                <p>There is evidence that the Egyptians practised veterinary medicine and surgery in
                    very remote times; but it is not until we turn to the Greeks that we obtain any
                    very definite information with regard to the state of veterinary as well as
                    human medicine in antiquity. The writings of Hippocrates (460-356 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> afford evidence of excellent investigations in
                    comparative pathology. Diodes of Car-istus, who was nearly a contemporary, was
                    one of the first to occupy himself with anatomy, which he studied in animals.
                    Aristotle, too, wrote on physiology and comparative anatomy, and on the maladies
                    of animals, while many other Greek writers on veterinary medicine are cited or
                    copied from by Varro, Columella, and Galen. And we must not overlook Mago of
                    Carthage (200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> whose work in twenty-eight books
                    was translated into Greek and was largely used by Varro and Columella.</p>
                <p>Until after the conquest of Greece the Romans do not appear to have known much of
                    veterinary medicine. Varro (116-28 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> may be
                    considered the first Roman writer who deals with animal medicine in a scientific
                    spirit, in his <hi rend="italic">De Re Rustica,</hi> in three books, which is
                    largely derived from Greek writers. Celsus is supposed to have written on animal
                    medicine; and Columella (1st century) is credited with having utilized those
                    relating to veterinary science in the sixth and seventh parts of his <hi
                    rend="italic">De Re Rustica,</hi> one of the best works of its class of ancient
                    times: it treats, not only of medicine and surgery, but also of sanitary
                    measures for the suppression of contagious diseases. From the 3d century onwards
                    veterinary science had a literature of its own and regular practitioners,
                    especially in the service of the Roman armies <hi rend="italic">(mulomedici,
                    veterinarii).</hi> Perhaps the most renowned veterinarian of the Roman empire
                    was Apsyrtus of Bithynia, who in 322 accompanied the expedition of Constantine
                    against the Sarmatians in his professional capacity, and seems to have enjoyed a
                    high and well-deserved reputation in his time. He was a keen observer; he
                    distinguished and described a number of diseases which were badly defined by his
                    predecessors, recognized the contagious nature of several maladies, and
                    prescribed isolation for their suppression; he also made interesting
                    observations on accidents and diseases of horses’ limbs, and waged war against
                    certain absurd empirical practices then prevailing in the treatment of disease,
                    indicating rational methods, some of which are still successfully employed in
                    veterinary therapeutics, such as splints for fractures, sutures for wounds, cold
                    water for the reduction of prolapsed vagina, hot baths for tetanus, &amp;c. Not
                    less eminent was Hierocles, the successor of Apsyrtus, whose writings he largely
                    copied, but with improvements and valuable additions, especially in the hygiene
                    and training of horses. Pelagonius again was a writer of empirical tendency, and
                    his treatment of disease in general was most irrational. Publius Vegetius (not
                    to be confounded with Flavius Vegetius Renatus, who wrote on the military art)
                    was a popular author of the end of the 5th century, though less distinguished
                    than Apsyrtus, to whom and to Pelagonius he was to a great extent indebted in
                    the preparation of his <hi rend="italic">Mulomedicina sive Ars Veterinaria.</hi>
                    He appears to have been more of a horse-dealer than a veterinary practitioner,
                    and knew next to nothing of anatomy, which seems to have been but little
                    cultivated at that period. He was very superstitious and a believer in the
                    influence of demons and sorcerers; nevertheless he gives some interesting
                    observations derived from his travels. He had also a good idea of aerial
                    infection, recognized the utility of disinfectants, and describes some
                    operations not referred to by previous writers, such as removal of calculi from
                    the bladder through the rectum, couching for cataract, the extirpation of
                    certain glands, and several serious operations on the horse’s foot. Though
                    inferior to several works written by his predecessors, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mulomedicina</hi> of Vegetius maintained its popularity through many centuries.
                    Of most of the ancient veterinary writers we know little beyond what can be
                    gathered from the citations and extracts in the two great collections of <hi
                    rend="italic">Hippiatrica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Geoponica</hi> compiled by
                    order of Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the 10th century.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to dwell here on the progress of the veterinary art during the
                    Middle Ages. Towards the close of the mediaeval period the subject was much
                    cultivated<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n217/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0217-0198"/> in the cavalry schools of Italy; and Spain also
                    had an organized system of good practitioners in the 15th century, who have left
                    many books still extant. Germany was far behind, and literature on the subject
                    did not exist until the end of the 15th century, when in 1492 there was
                    published anonymously at Augsburg a <hi rend="italic">Pferdearzneibüchlein.</hi>
                    In the following century the influence of the Italian writers was becoming
                    manifest, and the works of Fugger and Fayser mark the commencement of a new era.
                    Fayser’s treatises, <hi rend="italic">Von der Gestüterei</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Von der Zucht der Kriegsund Bürger-Pferde</hi> (1529-1597), are
                    remarkable for originality and good sense. In Great Britain animal medicine was
                    perhaps in a more advanced condition than in Germany, if we accept the evidence
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales</hi> (London,
                    1841); yet it was largely made up of the grossest superstitions.<note

                    shoer were held in high esteem, as among the more civilized nations of Europe,
                    and the court farrier enjoyed special privileges.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Fleming, <hi rend="italic">Horse-Shoes
                    and Horse-Shoeing,</hi> London, 1869.</p></note> The earliest known works in
                    English appeared anonymously towards the commencement of the 16th century,
                    namely, <hi rend="italic">Propertees and Medcynes for a Horse</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mascal of Oxen, Horses, Sheepes, Hogges, Dogges.</hi> The word
                    “mascal” shows that the latter work was in its origin Italian. There is no doubt
                    that in the 15th century the increasing taste for horses and horsemanship
                    brought Italian riding-masters and farriers into England; and it is recorded
                    that Henry VIII. brought over two of these men who had been trained by Grisone
                    in the famous Neapolitan school. The knowledge so introduced became popularized,
                    and assumed a concrete form in Blundeville’s <hi rend="italic">Foure Chiefest
                    Offices belonging to Horsemanship</hi> (1566), which contains many references to
                    horse diseases, and, though mainly a compilation, is yet enriched with original
                    observations. In the 15th century the anatomy of the domesticated animals,
                    formerly almost entirely neglected, began to receive attention. A work on
                    comparative anatomy by Volcher Koyter was issued at Nuremberg in 1573; about the
                    same time a writer in Germany named Copho or Cophon published a book on the
                    anatomy of the pig, in which were many original remarks on the lymphatic
                    vessels; and Jehan Hervard in France produced in 1594 his rather incomplete <hi
                    rend="italic">Hippo-Ostéologie.</hi> But by far the most notable work, and one
                    which maintained its popularity for a century and a half, was that of Carlo
                    Ruini, a senator of Bologna, published in 1598 in that city, and entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Dell' Anatomia e dell' Infirmità del Cavallo, e suoi Remedii.</hi>
                    Passing through many editions, and translated into French and German, this book
                    was for the most part original, and a remarkable one for the time in which it
                    was composed, the anatomical portion being especially praiseworthy. English
                    books of the 17th century exhibit a strong tendency towards the improvement of
                    veterinary medicine and surgery, especially as regards the horse. This is even
                    more notable in the writings of the 18th century, among which may be
                    particularized Gibson’s <hi rend="italic">Farrier's New Guide</hi> (1719), <hi
                    rend="italic">Method of Dieting Horses</hi> (1721), and (best of all) his <hi
                    rend="italic">New Treatise on the Diseases of Horses,</hi> besides Braken’s,
                    Burdon’s, Bridge’s, and Bartlet’s treatises. Veterinary anatomy was greatly
                    advanced by the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of an Horse</hi> (1683) of Snape,
                    farrier to Charles II., illustrated with copperplates, and by the still more
                    complete and original work of Stubbs, the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of the
                    Horse</hi> (1766), which decidedly marked a new era in this line of study. Of
                    foreign works it may suffice to mention that of Solleysel, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Veritable Parfait Maréschal</hi> (1664), which passed through many editions,
                    was translated into several languages, and was borrowed from for more than a
                    century by different writers. Sir W. Hope’s <hi rend="italic">Compleat
                    Horseman</hi> (1696) is a translation from Solleysel by a pupil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modern Schools and Colleges.</hi></p>
                <p>The most important era in the history of modern veterinary science commenced with
                    the institution of veterinary schools. France was the first to take the great
                    initiative step in this direction. Buffon had recommended the formation of
                    veterinary schools, but his recommendations were not attended to. Bourgelat, an
                    advocate at Lyons and a talented hippologist, through his influence with Bertin,
                    prime minister under Louis XV., was the first to induce the Government to
                    establish a veterinary school and school of equitation at Lyons, in 1761. This
                    school he himself directed for only a few years, during which the great benefits
                    that had resulted from it justified an extension of its teaching to other parts
                    of France. Bourgelat, therefore, founded (1766) at Alfort, near Paris, a second
                    veterinary school, which soon became, and has remained to this day, one of the
                    finest and most advanced veterinary schools in the world. At Lyons he was
                    replaced by the Abbé Rozier, a learned agriculturist, who was killed at the
                    siege of Lyons after a very successful period of school management, during which
                    he had added largely to agricultural and physical knowledge by the publication
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Journal de Physique</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cours
                    d'Agriculture.</hi> Twenty years later the Alfort school added to its teaching
                    staff several distinguished professors whose names still adorn the annals of
                    science, such as Daubenton, who taught rural economy; Vic d’Azyr, who lectured
                    on comparative anatomy; Fourcroy, who undertook instruction in chemistry; and
                    Gilbert, one of its most brilliant pupils, who had veterinary medicine and
                    surgery for his department. The last-named was also a distinguished
                    agriculturist and published many important treatises on agricultural as well as
                    veterinary subjects. The position he had acquired, added to his profound and
                    varied knowledge, made him most useful to France during the period of the
                    Revolution. It is chiefly to him that it is indebted for the celebrated
                    Rambouillet flock of Merino sheep, for the conservation of the Tuileries and
                    Versailles parks, and for the creation of the fine experimental agricultural
                    establishment organized in the ancient domain of Sceaux. The Alfort school
                    speedily became the nursery of veterinary science, and the source whence all
                    similar institutions obtained their first teachers and their guidance. A third
                    Government school was at a later period founded at Toulouse; and these three
                    schools have produced thousands of thoroughly educated veterinary surgeons and
                    many professors of high scientific repute, among whom may be named Bouley,
                    Chauveau, Colin, Toussaint, St Cyr, Goubaux, Arloing, and Galtier.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Alfort school was commenced a national school for Austria was
                    established at Vienna by order of Maria Theresa; and this, remodelled and
                    reorganized by Joseph II., is now the largest in the country. Prussia quickly
                    followed suit; and soon Government veterinary schools were founded in almost
                    every other European country, except Great Britain, mostly on a munificent
                    scale. Probably all, but especially those of France and Germany, were
                    established as much with a view to training veterinary surgeons for the army as
                    for the requirements of civil life.</p>
                <p>In 1790 St Bel (whose real name was Vial, St Bel being a village near Lyons,
                    where was his paternal estate), after studying at the Lyons school and teaching
                    both at Alfort and Lyons, came to England and published proposals for founding a
                    school in which to instruct pupils in veterinary medicine and surgery. The
                    Agricultural Society of Odiham, which had been meditating sending two young men
                    to the Alfort school, elected him an honorary member, and delegated a committee
                    to consult with him respecting his scheme. Some time afterwards this committee
                    detached themselves from the Odiham Society and formed an institution styled the
                    Veterinary College of London, of which St Bel was appointed professor. The
                    school was to be commenced and maintained by private subscription. In March 1792
                    arrangements were made for building temporary stabling for fifty horses and a
                    forge for shoeing at St Pancras. The college made rapid progress in public
                    estimation, notwithstanding considerable pecuniary embarrassments. As soon as
                    the building was ready for the reception of animal patients, pupils began to be
                    enrolled; and among the earliest were some who afterwards gained celebrity as
                    veterinarians, as Bloxam, Blaine, R. Lawrence, Field, and Bracy Clark. On the
                    death of St Bel in August 1793 there appears to have been some difficulty in
                    procuring a suitable successor; but at length, on the recommendation of John
                    Hunter and Cline, two medical men were appointed, Coleman and Moorcroft, the
                    latter then practising as a veterinary surgeon in London. The first taught
                    anatomy and physiology, and Moorcroft, after visiting the French schools,
                    directed the practical portion of the teaching. Unfortunately, neither of these
                    teachers had much experience among animals, nor were they well acquainted with
                    their diseases; but Coleman had as a student, in conjunction with a
                    fellow-student (afterwards Sir Astley Cooper), performed many experiments on <pb

                    who remained only a short time at the college, afterwards went to India and
                    during a journey in 1819 was murdered in Tibet.<note anchored="true"

                    researches and energetic management, in a few years raised the college to a high
                    standard of usefulness; under his care the progress of the veterinary art was
                    such as to qualify its practitioners to hold commissions in the army; and he
                    himself was appointed veterinary surgeon-general to the British cavalry. Owing
                    to the lack of funds, the teaching at the college must have been very meagre,
                    and, had it not been for the liberality of several medical men in throwing open
                    the doors of their theatres to its pupils for instruction without fee or reward,
                    their professional knowledge would have been sadly deficient. The board of
                    examiners was for many years chiefly composed of eminent members of the medical
                    profession. Coleman died in 1839, and with him disappeared much of the interest
                    the medical profession of London took in the progress of veterinary medicine.
                    Yet the Royal Veterinary College (first styled “Royal” during the presidentship
                    of the duke of Kent) continued to do good work in a purely veterinary direction,
                    and received such public financial support that it was soon able to dispense
                    with the small annual grant given to it by the Government. In the early years of
                    the institution the horse was the only animal to which much attention was given.
                    But at the instigation of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, which gave
                    £200 per annum for the purpose, an additional professor was appointed to
                    investigate and teach the treatment of the diseases of cattle, sheep, and other
                    animals; outbreaks of disease among these were also to be inquired into by the
                    officers of the college. This help to the institution was withdrawn in 1875, but
                    renewed in 1886.</p>
                <p>This veterinary school has been the parent of other schools in Great Britain, one
                    of which, the first in Scotland, was founded by Prof. Dick, a student of
                    Coleman’s and a man of great perseverance and ability. Commencing at Edinburgh
                    in 1819-20 with only one student, in three years he gained the patronage of the
                    Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, which placed a small sum of money
                    at the disposal of a committee appointed by itself to take charge of a
                    department of veterinary surgery it had formed. This patronage, and very much in
                    the way of material assistance and encouragement, were continued to the time of
                    Dick’s death in 1866. During the long period in which he presided over the
                    school, considerable progress was made in diffusing a sound knowledge of
                    veterinary medicine in Scotland and beyond it. For many years his examining
                    board, which gave certificates of proficiency under the auspices of the Highland
                    and Agricultural Society, was composed of the most distinguished medical men in
                    Scotland, such as Goodsir, Syme, Lizars, Ballingall, Simpson, and Knox. By his
                    will Dick vested the college in the lord provost and town council of Edinburgh
                    as trustees, and left a large portion of the fortune he had made to maintain it
                    for the purposes for which it was founded. In recent years another veterinary
                    school has been established in Edinburgh, and one in Glasgow, both of which are
                    doing good service.</p>
                <p>In 1844 the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (to be carefully distinguished
                    from the Royal Veterinary College) obtained its charter of incorporation. The
                    functions of this body were, until a recent date, limited almost entirely to
                    examining students taught in the veterinary schools, and bestowing diplomas of
                    membership on those who successfully passed the examinations conducted by the
                    boards which sat in London and Edinburgh. Soon after the Royal College of
                    Veterinary Surgeons obtained its charter of incorporation a difference arose
                    between it and Dick, which resulted in the latter seceding altogether from the
                    union that had been established and forming an independent examining board, the
                    Highland and Agricultural Society granting certificates of proficiency to those
                    students who were deemed competent. This schism operated very injuriously on the
                    progress of veterinary education and on professional advancement, as the
                    competition engendered was of a rather deteriorating nature. After the death of
                    Dick the dualism in veterinary licensing was suppressed: the Highland Society
                    ceased to give certificates and the only mode of admission to the profession was
                    through the Royal College. Since then the subjects taught have been increased in
                    number; conformably with the requirements of ever-extending science, the period
                    of study has been enlarged so as to be nearly as long as that imposed upon
                    medical students; the teaching is more thorough and practical; and the
                    examinations are more frequent and searching. Candidates for admission to the
                    schools must also give evidence of having received a good general education.
                    Also since the suppression of the dual system an Act of Parliament has been
                    obtained protecting the title of the graduates of the Royal College of
                    Veterinary Surgeons, and conferring other advantages, not the least of which is
                    the power granted to the college to remove the names of unworthy members from
                    its register. In some respects the Veterinary Surgeons Act is superior to the
                    Medical Act, while it places the profession on the same level as other learned
                    bodies, and prevents the public being imposed upon by empirics and impostors.
                    The college has instituted a higher degree, that of fellow, which can only be
                    obtained after the graduate has been five years in practice and by passing a
                    severe examination. Fellows only can be members of council or members of the
                    examining boards. The graduates of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons who
                    have been registered since its foundation in 1844 probably number 4000. In the
                    British army there is a smaller mortality among the animals employed, and less
                    loss from contagious diseases than in any other in Europe; this result, as well
                    as the high efficiency of the horses, is largely due to the zeal, intelligence,
                    and natural aptitude of the veterinary officers for their special duties. In no
                    other army are they so severely tested, physically and professionally,—more than
                    one-half of their service being foreign; and in India their skill has to be
                    exercised on elephants, camels, bullocks, cattle, and sheep, in addition to
                    horses. During war the strain on army veterinary surgeons is very heavy; and,
                    while surgeons are protected in the field by the Geneva Red Cross, being
                    considered as non-belligerents, veterinary officers are regarded as combatants,
                    and therefore run the risk of capture, imprisonment, or death at the hands of
                    the enemy.</p>
                <p>In India there are one or more veterinary schools in each presidency, in which
                    natives are trained as veterinary surgeons. The need for this will be perceived
                    when it is stated that the loss in India from preventible animal diseases alone
                    amounts to at least £6,000,000 annually.</p>
                <p>In the United States of America veterinary science has been an exotic of very
                    slow growth. There are veterinary schools in New York, Minneapolis, and
                    elsewhere, but these, like those in Great Britain, are private institutions. To
                    the Cornell, Pennsylvania, and Harvard universities veterinary schools or chairs
                    have been attached with competent teachers. Events are at present rapidly
                    compelling the people of the United States to realize the true value and
                    importance of veterinary science. For many years the “lung plague” has been
                    gradually extending itself westward, and it is now causing heavy losses. Long
                    exempted from the more serious of the contagious diseases of animals which have
                    scourged Europe, the United States are now invaded by all of them except
                    two—cattle plague and the foot-and-mouth disease; and an exotic disorder of
                    pigs, the swine plague or fever, is threatening to exterminate these
                    animals.</p>
                <p>The veterinary literature of this period affords striking evidence of the
                    progress made by the science: excellent text-books, manuals, and treatises on
                    every subject belonging to it are very numerous, and are published in every
                    European language, while there is an abundance of periodical literature. The
                    education—general and technical—of practitioners of veterinary medicine has, of
                    course, been improving to a corresponding extent. The matriculation test for
                    admission to the best veterinary schools and the fixed period for instruction in
                    them vary but little from those of the medical schools. In Germany the
                    veterinary schools at Berlin and Hanover have been raised to the position of
                    universities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Objects of the Science.</hi></p>
                <p>One of the chief objects of the science is the treatment of disease in animals.
                    Veterinary medicine has been far less exposed to the vagaries of theoretical
                    doctrines and systems than human medicine. The explanation may perhaps be that
                    the successful practice of this branch of medicine more clearly than in any
                    other depends upon the careful observation of facts and the rational deductions
                    to be made therefrom. No special doctrines seem, in later times at least, to
                    have been adopted, and the dominating sentiment in regard to disease and its
                    treatment has been a medical eclecticism, based on practical experience and
                    anatomico-pathological investigation, rarely indeed on philosophical or abstract
                    theories. In this way veterinary science has become pre-eminently a science of
                    observation. At times indeed it has to some extent been influenced by the
                    doctrines which have controlled the practice of human medicine—such as those of
                    Broussais, Hahnemann, Brown, Rasori, Rademacher, and others— yet this has not
                    been for long: experience of them when tested upon dumb unimaginative animals
                    soon exposed their fallacies and compelled their discontinuance.</p>
                <p>Of more moment than the cure of disease is its prevention, and this is now
                    considered the most important object in connexion with veterinary science. More
                    especially is this the case with those serious disorders which depend for their
                    existence and extension upon the presence of an infecting agent, and whose
                    ravages for so many centuries <pb break="no"

                    civilization. Every advance made in medicine affects the progress of veterinary
                    science, and the recent remarkable discoveries, some of which have been
                    initiated by members of the veterinary profession, or developed by them, must in
                    the end create as great a revolution in veterinary practice as in the medicine
                    of man. In “preventive medicine” the benefits to be derived from the application
                    of the germ theory will be immense; the sanitary police measures based on this
                    knowledge are easily framed, and, if carried rigorously into operation, must
                    eventually lead to the extinction of these disastrous disorders.<note

                    no particular so much, perhaps, as in the application it makes of utilitarian
                    principles. The life of man is sacred; but in the case of animals, when there
                    are doubts as to complete restoration to health and soundness, monetary
                    considerations generally decide against the adoption of remedial measures. This
                    feature in the medicine of the domesticated animals brings very prominently
                    before us the value of the old adage that “prevention is better than cure.” In
                    Great Britain the value of comparative pathology in the relations it bears to
                    human medicine, to the public health and wealth, as well as to agriculture, has
                    been strangely overlooked or ignored; and in consequence but little allowance
                    has been made for the difficulties the practitioner of animal medicine has to
                    contend with. The rare instances in which animals can be seen by the veterinary
                    surgeon in the earliest stages of disease, and when this would prove most
                    amenable to medical treatment; delay, generally due to the inability of those
                    who have the care of animals to perceive these early stages; the fact that
                    animals cannot, except in a negative manner, tell their woes, describe their
                    sensations, or indicate what and where they suffer; the absence of those
                    comforts and conveniences of the sick room which cannot be called in to
                    ameliorate their condition; the violence or stupor, as well as the structural
                    arrangements and attitude of the sick creatures, which only too frequently
                    render favourable positions for cure impossible; the slender means generally
                    afforded for carrying out recommendations, together with the oftentimes
                    intractable nature of these diseases; and the utilitarian influences alluded to
                    above,—all these considerations, in the great majority of instances, militate
                    against the adoption of curative treatment, or at least greatly increase its
                    difficulties.</p>
                <p>For more than forty years most destructive plagues of animals have prevailed
                    almost continuously in the British islands without any attempt, worthy of the
                    name, having been made to check or extirpate them until within a very recent
                    period. Two exotic bovine diseases alone (contagious pleuro-pneumonia or lung
                    plague and foot-and-mouth disease) are estimated to have caused the death,
                    during the first thirty years of their prevalence in the United Kingdom, of
                    5,549,780 cattle, roughly valued at £83,616,854; while the invasion of cattle
                    plague in 1865-66 was calculated to have caused a money loss of from £5,000,000
                    to £8,000,000. The depredations made in South Africa and Australia by the lung
                    plague alone are quite appalling; and in India the loss brought about by
                    contagious diseases among animals has been stated at not less than £6,000,000
                    annually. The damage done by tuberculosis—a contagious disease of cattle,
                    transmissible to several kinds of animals, and possibly also to man, by means of
                    the flesh and milk of diseased beasts—cannot be even guessed at; but it must be
                    enormous, when we learn how widely the malady is diffused. But that terrible
                    pest of all ages, the cattle plague, has in its two recent invasions of England
                    been promptly suppressed with comparatively trifling loss. The foot-and-mouth
                    disease, which proved such a heavy infliction to British agriculture from its
                    introduction in 1838, has been completely extirpated. Glanders, which annually
                    caused the destruction of large numbers of cavalry horses, is now unknown in the
                    army, and is rapidly disappearing from civilian stables. Rabies would soon be
                    included in the category of extinct diseases if the indications of veterinary
                    science were followed; and so with the other contagious maladies of animals. As
                    for such diseases as depend for their development upon germs derived from the
                    soil or herbage upon which animals live, and which cannot be directly controlled
                    by veterinary sanitary measures, the system of protective inoculation with
                    cultivated virus introduced by Pasteur will probably bring about their
                    extinction, or at any rate greatly mitigate their effects.</p>
                <p>Veterinary science can also offer much assistance in the study and prevention of
                    the diseases to which mankind are liable. Some grave maladies of the human
                    species are certainly derived from animals, and others may yet be added to the
                    list. In the training of the physician great benefit would be derived from the
                    study of disease in animals,—a fact which has been strangely overlooked in
                    England, as those can testify who understand how closely the health of man may
                    depend upon the health of the creatures he has domesticated and derives
                    subsistence from, and how much more advantageously morbid processes can be
                    studied in animals than in our own species. Although as yet no chair of
                    comparative pathology has been established in any British university, on the
                    Continent such chairs are now looked upon as an almost indispensable item of
                    every university. Bourgelat, towards the middle of the 18th century, in speaking
                    of the veterinary schools he had been instrumental in forming, urged that “leurs
                    portes soient sans cesse ouvertes à ceux qui, chargés par l’état de la
                    conservation des hommes, auront acquis par le nom qu’ils se seront fait le droit
                    d’interroger la nature, chercher des analogies, et vérifier des idées dont la
                    conformation ne peut être qu’utile à l’espèce humaine.” And the benefits to be
                    mutually derived from this association of the two branches of medicine inspired
                    Vicq d’Azyr to elaborate his <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Plan de la Constitution
                    de la Médecine en France,</hi> which he presented to the National Assembly in
                    1790. His fundamental idea was to make veterinary teaching a preliminary <hi
                    rend="italic">(le premier degré)</hi> and, as it were, the principle of
                    instruction in human medicine. His proposal went so far as to insist upon a
                    veterinary school being annexed to every medical college established in France.
                    This idea was reproduced in the <hi rend="italic">Rapport sur l'Instruction
                    Publique</hi> which Talleyrand read before the National Assembly in 1790. In
                    this project veterinary teaching was to form part of the National Institution at
                    Paris. The idea was to initiate students of medicine into a knowledge of
                    diseases by observing those of animals. The suffering animal always appears
                    exactly as it is and feels, without the intervention of mind obscuring the
                    symptomatology, the symptoms being really and truly the rigorous expression of
                    its diseased condition. From this point of view, the dumb animal, when it is
                    ill, offers the same difficulties in diagnosis as does the ailing infant or the
                    comatose adult.</p>
                <p>Of the other objects of veterinary science there is only one to which allusion
                    need here be made: that is the perfectioning of the domestic animals in
                    everything that is likely to make them more valuable to man. This is in an
                    especial manner the province of this science, the knowledge of the anatomy,
                    physiology, and other matters connected with these animals by its students being
                    essential for such improvement.</p>

                    This is to be found in the current veterinary text-books. Reference will be made
                    here only to the more important disorders of animals which are of a communicable
                    nature, and which were not included in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Murrain
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi><hi rend="italic">Diseases of the
                    Horse.</hi></p>
                <p>Every horseman should know something of the injuries, lamenesses, and diseases to
                    which the horse is liable. Unfortunately not very much can be done in this
                    direction by book instruction; indeed, there is generally too much doctoring and
                    too little nursing of sick animals. Even in slight and favourable cases of
                    illness recovery is often retarded by too zealous and injudicious medication;
                    the object to be always kept in view in the treatment of animal patients is to
                    place them in those conditions which allow nature to operate most freely in
                    restoring health. This can best be rendered in the form of nursing, which sick
                    animals greatly appreciate. However indifferent a horse may be to caressing or
                    kind attention during health, when ill he certainly appreciates both, and when
                    in pain will often apparently endeavour to attract notice and seek relief from
                    those with whom he is familiar. Fresh air and cleanliness, quiet and comfort,
                    should always be secured, if possible. The stable or loose box should be warm,
                    without being close, and free from draughts. If the weather is cold, and
                    especially if the horse is suffering from inflammation of the air-passages, it
                    may be necessary to keep up the temperature by artificial means; but great care
                    should be taken that this does not render the air too dry to breathe. The
                    surface of the body can be kept warm by rugs, and the legs by woollen bandages.
                    Yet a sick horse is easily fatigued and annoyed by too much clothing, and
                    therefore it is better to resort to artificial heating of the stable than to
                    overload the body or impede movement by heavy wrappings. If blankets are used,
                    it is well to place a cotton or linen sheet under them, should the horse have an
                    irritable skin. For bedding, long straw should be employed as little as
                    possible, since it hampers movement. Clean old litter, sawdust, or peat-moss
                    litter is the best. If the hoofs are strong, and the horse likely to be confined
                    for some weeks, it affords relief to take off the shoes. Tying up should be
                    avoided, if possible, unless it is urgently required, the horse being allowed to
                    move about or lie down as he may prefer.</p>
                <p>When a sick horse has lost his appetite, he should be tempted to eat by offering
                    him such food as will be enticing to him. It should be given frequently and in
                    small quantities, but should not be forced on him; food will often be taken if
                    offered from the hand, when it will not be eaten out of the manger. Whether the
                    animal be fed from a bucket or from a manger, any food that is left should be
                    thrown away, and the receptacle well cleaned out after each meal. As a rule,
                    during sickness a horse requires laxative food, in order to allay fever or
                    inflammatory symptoms, while supporting the strength. The following list
                    comprises the usual laxative food employed :—green grass, green wheat, oats, and
                    barley, lucerne, carrots, parsnips, gruel, bran mash, linseed and bran mash,
                    boiled barley, linseed tea, hay tea, and linseed oil. Green grass, lucerne, and
                    similar articles of food, if cut when in a wet state, should be dried before
                    being given. Boiled grain should be cooked with very little water, so that it
                    may be floury and comparatively dry when ready; a little salt should be mixed
                    with it. One gallon of good gruel may be made with a pound of meal and cold
                    water, which should be stirred till it boils, and afterwards permitted to simmer
                    over a gentle fire till the fluid is quite thick. To make a bran mash, scald a
                    stable bucket, throw out the water, put in three pounds of bran and one ounce of
                    salt, add two and a half pints of boiling water, stir up well, cover over, and
                    allow the mash to stand for fifteen or twenty minutes until it is well cooked.
                    For a bran and linseed mash, boil slowly for two or three hours one pound of
                    linseed, so as to have about a couple of quarts of thick fluid, to which two
                    pounds of bran and one ounce of salt may be added. The whole should be stirred
                    up, covered over, and allowed to steam as before described. The thicker the mash
                    the more readily will the horse eat it. Linseed tea is made by boiling one pound
                    of linseed in a couple of gallons of water until the grains are quite soft. It
                    may be economically made by using less water to cook the linseed, and afterwards
                    making up the quantity of water to about a gallon and a half. Hay tea may be
                    prepared by filling a bucket, after scalding it, with good sweet hay, pouring in
                    as much boiling water as the bucket will hold, covering it over, and allowing it
                    to stand until cold, when the fluid may be strained off and given to the horse.
                    This forms a refreshing drink. Linseed oil, in quantities of from one quarter to
                    half a pint daily, may be mixed with the food; it keeps the bowels in a lax
                    condition, has a good effect on the skin and air-passages, and is useful as an
                    article of diet. When debility has to be combated, as in low fever or other
                    weakening diseases, strengthening and other easily digested food must be
                    administered, though some of the foods already mentioned, such as boiled grain,
                    answer this purpose to a certain extent. Milk, eggs, bread and biscuits, malt
                    liquor, corn, &amp;c., are often prescribed with this object. Milk may be given
                    skimmed or unskimmed; a little sugar may be mixed with it; and one or two
                    gallons may be given daily, according to circumstances. One or two eggs may be
                    given beaten up with a little sugar and mixed with milk, three or four times a
                    day, or more frequently; or they may be boiled hard and powdered, and mixed in
                    the milk. A quart of stout, ale, or porter may be given two or three times a
                    day, or a half to one bottle of port wine daily. Scalded oats, with a little
                    salt added, are very useful when convalescence is nearly completed. As a rule, a
                    sick horse should have as much water as he likes to drink, though it may be
                    necessary in certain cases to restrict the quantity, and to have the chill taken
                    off; but it should never be warmer than 75° to 80°.</p>
                <p>As little grooming as possible should be allowed when a horse is very weak; it
                    should be limited to sponging about the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and forehead with
                    clean water, to which a little vinegar may be added. Rub the legs and ears with
                    the hand, take off the clothing, and shake or change it once a day, and if
                    agreeable rub over the body with a soft cloth. Exercise is of course not
                    required during sickness or injury, and the period at which it is allowed will
                    depend upon circumstances. Care must be taken that it is not ordered too early,
                    or carried too far at first.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration of Medicine.—</hi> Much care is required in
                    administering medicines in the form of ball or bolus; and practice, as well as
                    courage and tact, is needed in order to give it without danger to the
                    administrator or the animal. The ball should be held between the fingers of the
                    right hand, the tips of the first and fourth being brought together below the
                    second and third, which are placed on the upper side of the ball; the right hand
                    is thus made as small as possible, so as to admit of ready insertion into the
                    mouth. The left hand grasps the horse’s tongue, gently pulls it out, and places
                    it on that part of the right side of the lower jaw which is bare of teeth. With
                    the right hand the ball is placed at the root of the tongue. The moment the
                    right hand is withdrawn, the tongue should be released. This causes the ball to
                    be carried still farther back. The operator then closes the mouth and watches
                    the left side of the neck, to note the passage of the ball down the gullet. Many
                    horses keep a ball in the mouth a considerable time before they will allow it to
                    go down. A mouthful of water or a handful of food will generally make them
                    swallow it readily. If this does not succeed, the nostrils should be grasped by
                    the hand and held a few moments. A running halter should be used, so that the
                    mouth may be quickly and securely closed. If the operator has not had much
                    experience in giving balls, he should station an assistant on the near side, to
                    aid in opening and steadying the mouth, by placing the fingers of his left hand
                    on the lower jaw and the thumb of the right on the upper jaw. Holding the mouth
                    in this manner facilitates the giving of the ball, and saves the operator’s
                    right hand, to a great extent, from being scratched by the horse’s back teeth.
                    It is most essential to have the ball moderately soft; nothing can be more
                    dangerous than a hard one.</p>
                <p>To administer a drink or drench requires as much care as giving a ball, in order
                    to avoid choking the horse, though it is unattended with risk to the
                    administrator. An ordinary glass or stone bottle may be used, provided there are
                    no sharp points around the mouth; but either the usual drenching horn or a tin
                    vessel with a narrow mouth or spout is safer. It is necessary to raise the
                    horse’s head, so that the nose may be a little higher than the horizontal line.
                    If the horse is restless, his head must be elevated by a loop of cord inserted
                    into the mouth over the upper jaw, the prong of a stable fork being passed
                    through it, and the handle held steady by an assistant. The drink must be given
                    by a person standing on the right side (the assistant being in front or on the
                    left side of the horse), the side of the mouth being pulled out a little, to
                    form a sack or funnel, iuto which the medicine is poured, a little at a time,
                    allowing an interval now and again for the horse to swallow. If any of the fluid
                    gets into the windpipe (which it is liable to do if the head is held too high),
                    it will cause coughing, whereupon the head should be instantly lowered. Neither
                    the tongue nor the nostrils should be interfered with. Powders may be given in a
                    little mash or gruel, well stirred up.</p>
                <p>If a wide surface is to be fomented (as the chest, abdomen, or loins), a blanket
                    or other large woollen cloth should be dipped in water as hot as the hand can
                    comfortably bear it, moderately wrung out, and applied to the part, the heat and
                    moisture being retained by covering it with a waterproof sheet or dry rug. When
                    it has lost some of its heat, it should be removed, dipped in warm water, and
                    again applied. In cases of acute inflammation, it may be necessary to have the
                    water a little hotter; and, to avoid the inconvenience of removing the blanket,
                    or the danger of chill when it is removed, it may be secured round the body by
                    skewers or twine, the hot water being poured on the outside of the top part of
                    the blanket by any convenient vessel. To foment the feet, they should be placed
                    in a bucket or tub (the latter with the bottom resting wholly on the ground)
                    containing warm water; a quantity of moss litter put in the tub or bucket
                    prevents splashing and retains the heat longer.</p>

                <p>Poultices are used for allaying pain, promoting suppuration, softening horn or
                    other tissues, and bringing on a healthy action in wounds. To be beneficial,
                    they should be large and always kept moist. For applying poultices to the feet,
                    a poultice-shoe, constructed as follows, may be used with advantage. Take a
                    circular piece of hard wood, a little longer and broader than a horseshoe, and
                    about one and a half inches thick. Get one surface of it rounded in a lathe, so
                    that there may be a rise of about three-quarters of an inch in the centre, while
                    the other surface remains flat. Round the circumference of the board nail
                    leather, so as to form a convenient boot for retaining the poultice, similar to
                    the one in ordinary use, except that the part which comes on the ground is
                    rounded. The fact of its being round will enable the horse to whose foot it is
                    applied to ease the affected spot by throwing his weight on the toe, the heel,
                    or on either quarter, as he chooses. Poultices are usually made with bran,
                    though this has the disadvantage of drying very quickly, to remedy which it may
                    be mixed with linseed meal or a little linseed oil. Boiled carrots or turnips
                    mashed make a good poultice, as does linseed meal, when mixed with boiling water
                    (with a little olive oil added) by stirring. A charcoal poultice is sometimes
                    used when there is a bad smell to be got rid of. It is made by mixing linseed
                    meal with boiling water and stirring until a soft mass is produced; with this
                    some wood charcoal in powder is mixed, and when ready to be applied some more
                    powder is sprinkled on the surface. It may be noted that, in lieu of these
                    materials for poultices, what is known as spongio-piline can be usefully
                    employed. A piece of sufficient size is steeped in hot water, applied to the
                    part, covered with a large piece of oiled silk or waterproof stuff, and secured
                    there. Even an ordinary sponge, steeped in hot water and covered with any
                    waterproof material, makes a good poulticing medium; it is well adapted for the
                    throat, near the head, as well as for the space between the branches of the
                    lower jaw.</p>
                <p>Enemata or clysters are given in fevers, inflammation, constipation, &amp;c., to
                    empty the posterior part of the bowels. They are administered by a large syringe
                    capable of containing a quart or more of water, with a nozzle about twelve
                    inches in length, with an ox’s bladder tied to a pipe, or a large funnel with a
                    long nozzle at a right angle; but the syringe is best. Water alone is usually
                    applied for enemata; it should be about the temperature of the body, not less,
                    but perhaps a degree or two more. To administer an enema, one of the horse’s
                    fore-feet should be held up, while the operator pushes the end of the nozzle,
                    smeared with a little lard or oil, very gently and steadily for a few inches
                    into the intestine, and then presses out the water. The amount injected will
                    depend upon the size of the animal; two or three quarts would suffice for an
                    ordinary-sized horse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Epizootic and Contagious Diseases.—</hi> The epizootic diseases
                    affecting the horse are not numerous, and may generally be considered as
                    specific, or infectious and contagious, in their nature, circumstances of a
                    favourable kind leading to their extension by propagation of the agent upon
                    which their existence depends. This agent, in some of the maladies, has been
                    proved to be a micro-organism, and there can be little doubt that it is so for
                    all of them.</p>
                <p>Glanders is one of the most serious diseases affecting horses, not only because
                    it is incurable, but because it is very contagious. It is known in nearly every
                    part of the world, except in Australasia. The virulent principle of glanders
                    establishes itself most easily among horses kept in foul, badly-ventilated
                    stables, or among such as are overworked, badly fed, or debilitated in any way.
                    Glanders, however, has this in common with other contagious diseases, that it is
                    never spontaneously developed, in the absence of the virulent agent. Carnivorous
                    animals—as lions, tigers, dogs, and cats—have become infected through eating the
                    flesh of glandered horses; and goats, sheep, swine, and rabbits have been
                    successfully inoculated with the virus. Men who attend on diseased horses are
                    liable to be infected, especially if they have any sores on the exposed parts of
                    their bodies (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Glanders).</hi> Though infection through
                    wounds is the readiest way of receiving the disease, the germ or bacillus may
                    also obtain access through the lungs, stomach, and thin mucous membranes, such
                    as that of the eyes, nose, and lips. Glanders is presented in two forms,—one
                    affecting the mucous membranes of the body, more particularly those of the
                    air-passages (glanders proper), and the other attacking the skin and the
                    superficial lymphatic vessels (farcy). Both forms are due to the same virus, and
                    both may be acute or chronic. The acute form is the more contagious and
                    virulent, and either destroys life quickly or becomes chronic.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of acute glanders are marked by fever and its accompaniments—loss of
                    appetite, hurried pulse and respiration, languor, and disinclination to move.
                    Sometimes the legs or joints are swollen; but the characteristic symptoms, the
                    classical signs, are a yellow adhesive discharge from one or both nostrils;
                    there is also a peculiar enlarged nodulated condition of one or both lymphatic
                    glands between the branches of the lower jaw, which, though they may be painful,
                    very rarely suppurate; and on the mucous membrane covering the septum of the
                    nose are little yellow pimples or pustules, running into deep ragged-edged
                    ulcers. The discharge from the nostril adheres to its margin, because of its
                    glutinous nature, and straw and other matters also stick to it, while the
                    obstruction to the respiration causes the animal to snort frequently —a cause of
                    danger to men and animals, as this nasal discharge is virulent. In addition, the
                    lymphatic vessels of the face are often involved and appear as corded lines
                    passing up the cheeks; they are painful on pressure. In some cases there is a
                    cough. As the disease progresses, the ulcers in the nostrils extend in size and
                    depth and increase in number, often completely perforating the septum, and being
                    sometimes covered with black crusts; the nasal discharge becomes more abundant
                    and tenacious, streaked with blood, and foul smelling, and causes the animal the
                    greatest difficulty in breathing, so that it appears to be on the point of
                    suffocation. Death is due either to this cause or to exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Chronic glanders generally presents the same symptoms; but the animal is not so
                    seriously ill, and may indeed appear to be in good health and be able to perform
                    a certain amount of work. In some cases the ulceration may not be perceptible,
                    and only the peculiar knotty enlarged gland and slight discharge from one
                    nostril be evident. There may be uncertainty in such cases as to whether the
                    disease is glanders, owing to the absence of ulceration; and, to prove whether
                    it is that disease, recourse has to be had to inoculation of another animal,
                    generally a worthless horse or ass, the latter being the best, as it develops
                    the characteristic symptoms more rapidly and certainly.</p>
                <p>In farcy, instead of the symptoms being manifested in the interior of the body or
                    head, they show themselves on the skin, where the lymphatic vessels become
                    inflamed and ulcerate. These vessels appear as prominent lines or “cords,” hard
                    and painful on manipulation, and along their course arise little tumours (the
                    so-called “farcy buds ”). These tumours ulcerate, forming sores, from which is
                    discharged a thin glutinous pus. When the skin of the limbs is affected, these
                    are much swollen and the animal moves with pain and difficulty. Rarely large
                    abscesses containing thin pus form on the body. Farcy may appear during glanders
                    or precede it, but it generally terminates in it, though the limbs and body may
                    be covered with ulcers before this occurs.</p>
                <p>Medical treatment of glanders, chronic and acute, and of acute farcy should not
                    be attempted, as the malady is incurable, while the danger of infection being
                    transmitted to other animals or men is always real and imminent. Horses which
                    present suspicious symptoms, or those which have been in contact or have stood
                    in the same stable with diseased horses, should be kept apart from others, and
                    their harness, clothing, &amp;c., left with them. Animals which are found to be
                    affected should be immediately destroyed and buried with proper precautions,
                    their harness, clothing, and the utensils employed with them being either
                    destroyed also or thoroughly cleansed, while stables and places which they have
                    frequented should be completely disinfected. Forage and litter used by glandered
                    horses ought to be burned or buried.</p>
                <p>The venereal or coitus disease is a malady which occurs in Arabia and continental
                    Europe, and has recently been carried from France to the United States of
                    America (Montana and Illinois). In some of its features it resembles human
                    syphilis, and it is propagated in the same manner. From one to ten days after
                    coitus, or in the stallion not unfrequently after some weeks, there is
                    irritation, swelling, and a livid redness of the external organs of generation
                    (in stallions the penis may shrink), followed by unhealthy ulcers, which appear
                    in successive crops, often at considerable intervals. In mares these are near
                    the clitoris, which is frequently erected, and the animals rub and switch the
                    tail about, betraying uneasiness. In horses the eruption is on the penis and
                    sheath. In the milder forms there is little constitutional disturbance, and the
                    patients may recover in a period varying from two weeks to two months. In the
                    severe forms the local swelling increases by intermittent steps. In the mare the
                    vulva is the seat of a deep violet congestion and extensive ulceration; pustules
                    appear on the perinaeum, tail, and between the thighs; the lips of the vulva are
                    parted, exposing the irregular, nodular, puckered, ulcerated, and
                    lardaceous-looking mucous membrane. If the mare happens to be pregnant, abortion
                    occurs. In all cases emaciation sets in; lameness of one or more limbs occurs;
                    great debility is manifested, and this runs on to paralysis, when death ensues
                    after a miserable existence of from four or five months to two years. In horses
                    swelling of the sheath may be the only symptom for a long time, even for a year.
                    Then there may follow dark patches of extravasated blood on or swellings of the
                    penis; the testicles may become tumefied; a dropsical engorgement extends
                    forward beneath the abdomen and chest; the lymphatic glands in different parts
                    of the body may be enlarged; pustules and ulcers appear on the skin; there is a
                    discharge from the eyes and nose; emaciation becomes extreme; a weak and
                    vacillating movement of the posterior limbs gradually increases, as in the mare,
                    to paralysis; and after from three months to three years death puts an end to
                    loathsomeness and great suffering. This malady appears to be spread only by the
                    act of coition. It is a purely contagious disorder, and cannot be generated by
                    any known agency or <pb break="no"

                    extinction are therefore obvious. They are (1) to prevent diseased animals
                    coming into actual contact, especially <hi rend="italic">per coitum,</hi> with
                    healthy ones, (2) to destroy the infected, and (3), as an additional
                    precautionary measure, to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect the stables,
                    clothing, utensils, and implements used for the sick horse.</p>
                <p>Under influenza several diseases are sometimes included, and in different
                    invasions it may (and doubtless does) assume varying forms. It may be said to be
                    a specific fever of a low or asthenic type, associated with inflammation of the
                    mucous membrane lining the air-passages, and also sometimes with that of other
                    organs. At various times it has prevailed extensively over different parts of
                    the world, more especially during the 18th and 19th centuries. Perhaps one of
                    the most wide-spread outbreaks recorded was that of 1872, on the American
                    continent. It usually radiates from the district in which it first appears. The
                    symptoms have been enumerated as follows :—sudden attack, marked by extreme
                    debility and stupor, with increased body-temperature, quick weak pulse, rigors,
                    and cold extremities. The head is pendent, the eyelids swollen and half closed,
                    eyes lustreless, and tears often flowing down the face. There is great
                    disinclination to move; the body sways on the animal attempting to walk; and the
                    limb-joints crack. The appetite is lost and the mouth is hot and dry; the bowels
                    are constipated and the urine scanty and high-coloured; there is nearly always a
                    deep, painful, and harassing cough; on auscultation of the chest crepitation or
                    harsh blowing sounds are audible; and the membrane lining the eyelids and nose
                    assumes either a bright pink colour or a dull leaden hue. A white, yellowish, or
                    greenish-coloured discharge flows from the nostrils. In a few days the fever and
                    other symptoms subside, and convalescence rapidly sets in. In unfavourable cases
                    the fever increases, as well as the prostration, the breathing becomes laboured,
                    the cough more painful and deep, and auscultation and percussion indicate that
                    the lungs are seriously involved, with perhaps the pleura or the heart. Clots
                    sometimes form in the latter organ, and quickly bring about a fatal termination.
                    When the lungs do not suffer, the bowels may, and with this complication there
                    are, in addition to the stupor and torpor, tension and tenderness of the
                    abdominal walls when pressed upon, manifestations of colic, great thirst, a
                    coated tongue, yellowness of the membranes of nose and eyes, high-coloured
                    urine, constipation, and dry faeces covered with mucus. Sometimes rheumatic
                    swelling and tenderness take place in the muscles and joints of the limbs, which
                    may persist for a long time, often shifting from leg to leg, and involving the
                    sheaths of tendons. At other times acute inflammation of the eyes supervenes, or
                    even paralysis.</p>
                <p>In this disease good nursing is the chief factor in the treatment. Comfortable,
                    clean, and airy stables or loose-boxes should be provided, and the warmth of the
                    body and limbs maintained. Cold and damp, foul air and uncleanliness, are as
                    inimical to health and as antagonistic to recovery as in the case of mankind. In
                    influenza it has been generally found that the less medicine the sick animal
                    receives the more likely it is to recover. Nevertheless it may be necessary to
                    adopt such medical measures as the following. For constipation administer
                    enemata of warm water or give a dose of linseed oil or aloes. For fever give
                    mild febrifuge diuretics (as liquor of acetate of ammonia or spirit of nitrous
                    ether), and, if there is cough or nervous excitement, anodynes (such as extract
                    of belladonna). When the fever subsides and the prostration is great, it may be
                    necessary to give stimulants (carbonate of ammonia, nitrous ether, aromatic
                    ammonia) and tonics, both vegetable (gentian, quassia, calumba) and mineral
                    (iron, copper, arsenic). Some veterinary surgeons administer large and frequent
                    doses of quinine from the onset of the disease, and, it is asserted, with
                    excellent effect. If the abdominal organs are chiefly involved, demulcents may
                    supplement the above (linseed boiled to a jelly, to which salt is added, is the
                    most convenient and best), and drugs to allay pain (as opium and hydrocyanic
                    acid). Olive oil is a safe laxative in such cases. When nervous symptoms are
                    manifested, it may be necessary to apply wet cloths and vinegar to the head and
                    neck; even blisters to the neck have been recommended. Bromide of potassium has
                    been beneficially employed. To combat inflammation of the throat, chest, or
                    abdomen, counter-irritants may be resorted to, such as mustard, soap liniment,
                    or the ordinary white liniment composed of equal parts of oil of turpentine,
                    liquor ammoniae, and olive oil. The food should be soft mashes and gruel of
                    oatmeal, with carrots aud green food, and small and frequent quantities of
                    scalded oats in addition when convalescence is established.</p>
                <p>Typhoid, gastric, or bilious fever is often confounded with influenza, and
                    sometimes occurs at the same time in a locality. It also appears independently
                    in horses when shedding their coat in the autumn, in those kept in a hot, close,
                    and impure atmosphere, and in those fed insufficiently or on badly-preserved,
                    musty, or otherwise improper food, or supplied with water containing an excess
                    of decomposing organic matter. Overwork or hardship predisposes to an attack.
                    This fever seems to become contagious under certain conditions, especially in
                    badly-ventilated insalubrious stables. Wholesome and well-aired stables are not
                    indeed always exempt; but in them the disease is less serious and does not
                    spread so rapidly. It is presumed that this fever is caused by some virulent
                    principle. As “premonitory” indications of the malady, the horse appears dull
                    and listless, and careless of food. Then signs of fever appear, in the form of
                    staring coat, shivering, alternate heat and coldness of the surface,
                    restlessness, a hot dry mouth, and elevation of the internal temperature of the
                    body. The visible mucous membranes have a yellow tinge; constipation is present,
                    and with it indications of colicky pain; the abdomen is distended, tense, and
                    sensitive on pressure; faeces are passed in the shape of a few hard, dark -
                    coloured pellets covered with mucus; the urine is scanty, red in colour, and
                    after standing a short time deposits a heavy sediment. Sometimes there is sore
                    throat, with increased respiration and a nasal discharge. In mild attacks
                    convalescence may occur in from a week to ten days. In serious cases the pulse
                    is small, feeble, and quick; the mouth is very hot and dry, and exhibits yellow,
                    brown, or greenish patches; the abdomen is more tender and the bowels very
                    irritable, diarrhoea of a foetid character often ensuing. Prostration to an
                    extreme degree is a very marked feature in these cases. The head is maintained
                    in a pendent position; the eyes become sunken; the expression is haggard and
                    listless; while the stupor may be so advanced that pinching or pricking the skin
                    will elicit no indication of sensibility. A fatal termination usually occurs in
                    from ten to twenty days.</p>
                <p>The diet must be carefully attended to, and should be soft and easily digested,
                    such as mashes of bran, sliced carrots or turnips, boiled oats or barley,
                    freshly cut grass, and oatmeal gruel. The stable should be kept clean and sweet,
                    fresh air being an important factor in treatment; the body of the patient must
                    also be made comfortable by clothing. Quiet is necessary. Quinine has been found
                    useful in large and repeated doses; and calomel has been recommended. A daily
                    dose of Glauber’s salt may be given if there is constipation; and, if this is
                    obstinate, enemata of warm water should be administered in addition. A drachm
                    each of chlorate or nitrate of potash and muriate of ammonia may be given three
                    or four times daily with the water drunk; or in cases of great prostration an
                    ounce of oil of turpentine, sulphuric ether, sweet spirits of nitre, or
                    carbonate of ammonia may be given as well. If there is much tenderness of the
                    abdomen, hot fomentations continued for a long time, or mustard poultices, or
                    the application of extract of mustard should be resorted to. When convalescence
                    sets in, three or four ounces of tincture of gentian or cinchona may be given
                    twice daily, with muriate of iron and stimulants.</p>
                <p>Strangles is a specific contagious and infectious fever peculiar to ungulates,
                    and is more especially incidental to young animals. It is particularly
                    characterized by the formation of abscesses in the lymphatic glands, chiefly
                    those between the branches of the lower jaw (submaxillary). Various causes are
                    ascribed for its production, such as change of young horses from field to
                    stable, from grass to dry feeding, from idleness to hard work, irritation of
                    teething, and change of locality and climate. It is asserted that repeated
                    attacks will occur in the same horse under the influence of the last-named
                    cause. But the chief, if not the sole, cause is infection,—the malady, in some
                    of its features, closely resembling the “mumps” of the human species. Languor
                    and feverishness, diminution of appetite, cough, redness of the nasal membrane,
                    with discharge from the ey.es and nose, and thirst are among the earliest
                    symptoms. Then there is difficulty in swallowing, coincident with the
                    development of swelling between the branches of the lower jaw, which often
                    causes the water in drinking to be returned through the nose and the masticated
                    food to be dropped from the mouth. The swelling is hot and tender, diffused, and
                    uniformly rounded and smooth; at first it is hard, with soft, doughy margins;
                    but later it becomes soft in the centre, where an abscess is forming, and soon
                    “points” and bursts, giving exit to a quantity of pus. Relief is now experienced
                    by the animal; the symptoms subside; and recovery takes place. In some cases the
                    swelling is so great or occurs so close to the larynx that the breathing is
                    interfered with, and even rendered so difficult that suffocation is threatened.
                    In other cases the disease assumes an irregular form, and the swelling, instead
                    of softening in the centre, remains hard for an indefinite time, or it may
                    subside and abscesses form in various parts of the body, sometimes in vital
                    organs, as the brains, lungs, liver, kidneys, &amp;c., or in the bronchial or
                    mesenteric glands, where they generally produce serious consequences. Not
                    unfrequently a pustular eruption accompanies the other symptoms. The malady may
                    terminate in ten days or be protracted for months, often terminating fatally,
                    especially when the animal is not well nursed and is kept in an unhealthy
                    stable.</p>
                <p>Good nursing is the chief part of the treatment. The strength should be
                    maintained by soft nutritious food, and the body kept warm and comfortable; the
                    stable or loose-box must have plenty of fresh air and be kept clean. The
                    swelling may be fomented with warm water and poulticed. The poultice may be a
                    little bag containing bran and linseed meal mixed with hot water, and applied
                    warm to the tumefaction, being retained there by a square piece of calico, with
                    holes for the ears and eyes, tied down the middle of the face and behind the
                    ears. If the breathing is disturbed and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0223-0204"/> noisy, the animal may be made to inhale steam
                    from hot water in a bucket or from bran mash. If the breathing becomes very
                    difficult, the windpipe must be opened and a tube inserted. Instead of the
                    swelling being poulticed, a little blistering ointment is sometimes rubbed over
                    it, which promotes suppuration. When the abscess points, it may be lanced,
                    though it is generally better to allow it to open spontaneously.</p>
                <p>It is very important to distinguish strangles from glanders; the character of the
                    nasal discharge, the absence of ulcers from the nostrils, and the diffused soft
                    swelling between the branches of the lower jaw establish the distinction between
                    them.</p>
                <p>Horsepox, which is somewhat rare, is almost, if not quite, identical with cowpox,
                    being undistinguishable when inoculated on men and cattle. It most frequently
                    attacks the limbs, though it may appear on the face and other parts of the body.
                    There is usually slight fever; then swelling, heat, and tenderness are manifest
                    in the part which is to be the seat of eruption, usually the heels; firm nodules
                    form, increasing to one-third or one-half an inch in diameter; the hair becomes
                    erect; and the skin, if light-coloured, changes to an intense red. On the ninth
                    to the twelfth day a limpid fluid oozes from the surface and mats the hairs
                    together in yellowish scabs; when one of these is removed, there is seen a red,
                    raw depression, whereon the scab was fixed. In three or four days the crusts
                    fall off, and the sores heal spontaneously. No medical treatment is needed,
                    cleanliness being requisite to prevent the pocks becoming sloughs. If the
                    inflammation runs high, a weak solution of carbolic acid may be employed.</p>

                    >Diseases of Cattle.</hi></p>
                <p>The diseases of the bovine species are not so numerous as those of the horse, and
                    some of the more serious have been already alluded to (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Murrain).</hi> We will notice a few which have not been included among
                    these.</p>
                <p>Tuberculosis is a most formidable and widespread disorder of cattle; it is
                    assuming greater proportions every year in those countries in which it is
                    prevalent, in consequence of no steps being taken to check or suppress it. It is
                    infectious and contagious, can be conveyed to other species of animals by
                    ingestion of the flesh and milk, as well as of the tuberculous material, and by
                    inoculation of these, or inhalation of dried discharges from the lungs; it can
                    also be transmitted from the affected animal to the foetus in utero. Its
                    infectious properties and ready communicability to other species render it a
                    serious danger to mankind, through consumption as food of the flesh and milk of
                    tuberculous cows. The disease owes its origin to a bacillus. The structures
                    chiefly involved are the lymphatic glands and tissues,—the characteristic
                    tubercles or “grapes” varying in size from that of a millet seed to immense
                    masses weighing many pounds; they are found in all parts of the body, but
                    generally in the chest and on its lining membrane, as well as in the abdominal
                    cavity. The symptoms resemble somewhat the contagious pleuro-pneumonia of cattle
                    in its chronic form (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Murrain),</hi> though tubercles,
                    sometimes in large numbers, are often found after death in the bodies of cattle
                    which exhibited no sign of illness during life, and which when killed were in
                    excellent condition. When the lungs are involved, there are a peculiar
                    phthisical cough, low fever, wasting and debility, and often enlarged throat
                    glands, less frequently enlarged joints. If the animal is not killed, it
                    perishes in a state of marasmus, from the difficulty experienced in breathing,
                    or the profuse foetid diarrhoea which ensues. Medical treatment is of little if
                    any avail. Preventive measures are of the utmost importance. Animals free from
                    the tuberculous taint should alone be bred from, and those discovered to be
                    affected should be at once completely segregated, and if convenient destroyed.
                    The milk of tuberculous cows should not be given to any animal as food, not at
                    least unless well boiled. Neither should the flesh be eaten unless well cooked
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>Milk or parturient fever is a specific malady which appears after parturition,
                    due to the absorption of septic matter from the interior of the uterus or
                    vagina, producing what is known as “blood-poisoning” or septicaemia. The
                    symptoms may be briefly summarized as follows :—high fever, restlessness,
                    intense injection of the visible mucous membranes, tympanitis, foetid breath,
                    stupor, swollen limbs, sanguinolent and perhaps purulent discharges from the
                    vagina, foulsmelling diarrhoea, coma, and death. In the early stage treatment is
                    generally successful. The uterine cavity should be thoroughly cleaned out by
                    injections of warm water, and any adherent portions of placenta removed by hand.
                    Then a weak solution of Condy’s fluid (permanganate of potash) must be injected.
                    Cleanliness is all-important. Diffusible stimulants in large quantity should be
                    given, with doses of solution of sulphate of quinine, perchloride of iron, oil
                    of turpentine, or carbolic acid.</p>
                <p>There is now strong evidence that one form of abortion in cows is due to
                    infection. Whenever a case of abortion occurs in a shed, either the cow should
                    be at once removed from the others, if they are pregnant, and cleaning and
                    disinfection immediately resorted to; or, better still, the pregnant cows should
                    be quickly moved out of the shed, and every care taken to keep them away from
                    the sick cow and the discharges from it—these and the aborted foetus being
                    burned or otherwise completely destroyed.</p>
                <p>Cowpox is a contagious disease of much less frequent occurrence now than
                    formerly, probably owing to improved hygienic management. In many localities the
                    disease appears in all heifers which have recently calved on certain farms.
                    There is usually a slight premonitory fever, which is generally overlooked; this
                    is succeeded by some diminution in the quantity of the milk, with some increased
                    coagulability, and by the appearance of the eruption or “pox” on the udder and
                    teats. In well-observed cases the udder is hot and tender on manipulation for a
                    day or two previous to the development of small pale-red nodules about the size
                    of peas; these increase in dimensions to from three-fourths to one inch in
                    diameter by the eighth or tenth day, when their contents have become fluid and
                    they present a depressed centre. This fluid, at first clear and limpid, becomes
                    yellowish white as it changes to pus, and soon dries up, leaving a hard,
                    button-shaped black crust, which gradually becomes detached. On the teats, owing
                    to the handling of the milker or to the cow lying on the hard ground or on
                    straw, the vesicles are early ruptured and sores are formed, which often prove
                    troublesome and may cause inflammation of the udder.</p>
                <p>Actinomycosis, though affecting man (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> vol. xviii. p.
                    270), horses, pigs, and other creatures, is far more common in the bovine
                    species. The fungus (<hi rend="italic">Actinomyces)</hi> may be found in
                    characteristic nodules in various parts of the body, but it usually invades the
                    bones of the jaws, upper and lower, or the soft parts in the neighbourhood of
                    these, as the tongue, cheeks, face, throat, and glands in its vicinity. About
                    the head the disease appears to commence with slight sores on the gums or mucous
                    membrane of the mouth or with ulcers alongside decaying teeth, and these extend
                    slowly into the tissues. If the jaw is affected, a large rounded tumour grows
                    from it, the dense outer bone becoming absorbed before the increasing soft
                    growth within. Soon the whole becomes ulcerated and purulent discharges take
                    place, in which are found the minute, hard, yellow granules which contain the
                    fungus. When the tongue is affected, it becomes enlarged and rigid; hence the
                    designation of “wooden tongue” given to it by the Germans. In the course of time
                    the surface of the organ becomes ulcerated, and yellowish masses or nodules may
                    be seen on the surface. Sometimes the entire face is involved, the lips and
                    nostrils becoming swollen, hard, and immovable, often rendering respiration
                    difficult. Around the throat there are rounded dense swellings, implicating the
                    glands. When the disease is well-defined and of slight extent, the parts
                    involved may be removed by the knife, wholly or partially. If the latter only,
                    then the remaining affected tissues should be dressed with tincture of iodine or
                    iodized carbolic acid. Chromic acid has also been found useful.</p>

                <p>The contagious diseases of the sheep are comparatively few, and two of the more
                    serious have been described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Murrain.</hi></p>
                <p>The formidable disorder of sheep-pox is confined chiefly to the continent of
                    Europe. It is extremely contagious and fatal, and in these and some other
                    characteristics resembles human smallpox. From three to twelve days after being
                    exposed to infection the sheep appears dull and listless, and eats little if
                    anything; the temperature rises; there are frequent tremblings; tears flow from
                    the eyes; and there is a nasal discharge. Red patches appear inside the limbs
                    and under the abdomen; and on them, as well as on other parts where the skin is
                    thin, dark red spots show themselves, which soon become papules, with a deep
                    hard base. These are generally conical, and the apex quickly becomes white from
                    the formation of pus. This eruption is characteristic and unmistakable; and the
                    vesicles or pustules may remain isolated (discrete pox) or coalesce into large
                    patches (confluent pox). The latter form of the disease is serious. In bad cases
                    the eruption may develop on the eyes and in the respiratory and digestive
                    passages. The course of the disease lasts about three weeks or a month, and the
                    eruption passes through the same stages as that of cowpox. The mortality may
                    extend from 10 per cent. in mild outbreaks to 90 or 95 per cent. in very
                    virulent ones. Diseased animals should be sheltered, and fed on nourishing food,
                    especially gruels of oatmeal, flour, or linseed; acidulated water may be
                    allowed. If there is sloughing of the skin <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"

                    be applied. But treatment should not be adopted unless there is general
                    infection over a wide extent of country. All diseased animals should be
                    destroyed, as well as those which have been in contact with them, and thorough
                    disinfection resorted to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases of the Pig.</hi></p>
                <p>The pig may become affected with foot-and-mouth disease (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Murrain),</hi> and it also has its own particular variola. But the disease
                    special to it, and which causes enormous losses, is swine plague. This scourge,
                    known in America as hog cholera, is a specific contagious fever, or fevers, for
                    it is extremely probable that two diseases are included under this designation.
                    It is generally very rapid in its course, death ensuing in a very few days; and
                    when the animal survives recovery is protracted. After a period of three or four
                    days to a fortnight from exposure to infection, the animal exhibits signs of
                    illness by dulness, weakness, shiverings, burying itself under the litter,
                    disinclination to move, staggering gait, great thirst, hot dry snout, sunken
                    eyes, loss of appetite, and greatly increased pulse, respiration, and
                    temperature. Red and brown patches appear on the skin; there is a hacking cough;
                    nausea is followed by vomiting; pressure on the abdomen causes extreme pain;
                    diarrhoea ensues; the hind limbs become paralysed; stupor sets in; and the
                    animal perishes. Treatment should not be attempted when there is danger of the
                    infection extending to other pigs. If treatment be used, nursing ought to be the
                    chief element; sloppy food, in which small doses of carbolic acid and oil of
                    turpentine have been mixed, should be given, and these should be followed by
                    tonics when convalescence sets in. To suppress the disease, kill all affected

                    deeply the carcases and litter; and disinfect everything likely to have been
                    contaminated by the virus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases of the Dog.</hi></p>
                <p>The contagious diseases of the dog are likewise very few, but the one which
                    attracts most attention is common and generally serious. This is what is
                    popularly known as distemper. It is peculiar to the canine species, for there is
                    no evidence that it can be conveyed to other animals, though the different
                    families of <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> appear each to be liable to a
                    similar disease. Distemper is a specific fever which most frequently attacks
                    young dogs, its effects being primarily developed in the respiratory passages,
                    though the brain, spinal cord, and abdominal organs may subsequently be
                    involved. Highly bred and pet dogs suffer more severely than the commoner and
                    hardier kinds. It is a most infectious disease, and there is much evidence to
                    prove that it owes its existence and prevalence solely to its virulence. One
                    attack confers immunity from another. The symptoms are rigors, sneezing,
                    dulness, loss of appetite, desire for warmth, and increased temperature,
                    respiration, and pulse. The eyes are red, and the nose, at first dry and harsh,
                    becomes smeared with the discharge which soon begins to flow from the nostrils.
                    Suppuration also begins at the eyes; vision is more or less impaired by the
                    mucus and pus, and often the cornea becomes ulcerated, and even perforated.
                    There is a cough, which in some cases is so violent as to induce vomiting.
                    Debility rapidly ensues, and emaciation is soon apparent; diarrhoea in the
                    majority of cases sets in; the body emits an unpleasant odour; ulceration of the
                    mouth is noticed; the nostrils become obstructed by the discharge from them;
                    convulsions generally come on; signs of bronchitis, pneumonia, jaundice, or
                    other complications manifest themselves; and in some instances there is a
                    pustular or vesicular eruption on the skin. In fatal cases the animal dies in a
                    state of marasmus. Many which recover are affected with chorea for a long time
                    afterwards. Here, again, good nursing is all-important. Comfort and cleanliness,
                    with plenty of fresh air, must be ensured. Debility being the most serious
                    feature of the disease, the strength should be maintained or restored until the
                    fever has run its course. Light broth, beef tea, or bread and milk, or these
                    alternately, may be allowed as diet. Preparations of quinine, given from the
                    commencement of the attack in a little wine, such as sherry, have proved very
                    beneficial. Often a mild laxative is required. Complications should be treated
                    as they arise. The disease being extremely infectious, precautions should be
                    adopted with regard to other dogs.</p>

                    Animals.</hi></p>
                <p>Perhaps the commonest worm infesting the horse is <hi rend="italic">Ascaris
                    megalocephala</hi> or common lumbricoid. The males are from 6 to 8 inches long,
                    females 7 to 17 inches. It is found in almost every part of the intestinal
                    canal, but generally in the small intestines. The symptoms produced in the horse
                    by this worm are colicky pains, which occur intermittently, an unhealthy
                    condition of the skin, and staring coat. Although the animal feeds well, it does
                    not improve in condition, but is very “tucked up,” and the visible mucous
                    membranes are very pale. In some instances pouches are formed in the coats of
                    the intestines. There are many recipes for the expulsion of lumbricoid; among
                    the principal remedies is a mixture of emetic tartar, oil of turpentine, and
                    linseed oil; others are santonine, sulphate of iron, male fern, &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">Strongylus armatus</hi> or palisade worm was at first supposed to
                    consist of two varieties, but it has been proved that these are simply different
                    stages of growth of one parasite. It is a moderate-sized Nematoid worm, having a
                    straight body, with a globular and somewhat flattened head,—males 1 to 1½ inches
                    long, females 1½ to 2 inches. It is found in the intestines, especially the
                    double colon and caecum. The embryo is developed in the interior of the egg
                    after its expulsion from the host, and is lodged in moist mud, where, according
                    to Cobbold, it changes its first skin in about three weeks, after which it
                    probably enters the body of an intermediate bearer, whence it is conveyed to the
                    alimentary canal of the horse, its ultimate host, in food or water. From the
                    stomach it bores its way into the blood-vessels, where it again changes its skin
                    and gives rise to aneurisms. After a time it recommences its wanderings, and
                    passes into the large intestines, where it rapidly acquires sexual maturity. It
                    is a dungfeeder. Sometimes it passes into other tissues of the body (kidney,
                    liver, &amp;c. ), and occasionally produces fatal results. This parasite is most
                    dangerous to its equine host when it is migrating from one organ to another. It
                    is principally found at the root of the anterior mesenteric artery, but it also
                    gives rise to aneurism in the coeliac axis, the post-mesenteric and splenic
                    arteries, and even the aorta. The common lumbricoid, the palisade worm, and the
                    four-spined strongyle (<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >tetracanthus)</hi> are principally productive of colic. The last-mentioned
                    worm, of which the male and female are about the same size, ½ to ¾ inch long, is
                    found in the caecum, colon, and duodenum. It is a true blood-sucker, and its
                    development is very similar to that of <hi rend="italic">S. armatus,</hi> except
                    that, when in the intestines in the trichonemous stage, it pierces the inner
                    coats, encapsules itself, and forms little pill-like masses, and then again
                    enters the tissues of the intestines before becoming mature. The symptoms of its
                    presence are loss of condition, more or less constant colicky pains, unhealthy
                    coat, flabby muscles, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, foetid and watery faeces,
                    pale mucous membranes, great weakness, more or less frequent cough, and
                    sometimes partial or complete paralysis, due to the formation of a clot of blood
                    causing thrombosis of one of the principal vessels of the posterior extremities,
                    thus interfering with the circulation of blood in the part supplied by the
                    particular vessel. The treatment by which the common lumbricoid is expelled will
                    suflice to expel these strongyles, but care must be exercised in administering
                    oil of turpentine, as it very often irritates the wounds caused by <hi
                    rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi rend="italic">tetracanthus</hi> in the coats of the
                    intestines. Of course this treatment applies to the mature stage of these
                    worms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oxyuris curvula</hi> or pin worm is fusiform in shape, with
                    smooth gently curved body (males 1½ to 1¾ inches, females 3½ to 4¾ inches long).
                    It is seated in the caecum and colon; and, although not found in the rectum, it
                    causes great irritation at the anus by the clusters of eggs which are deposited
                    around that part in the form of yellowish crasts. This parasite is best treated
                    by means of a cathartic, followed by sulphate of iron, also carbolic acid in 2½
                    per cent. solution.</p>
                <p>The Cestodes of the horse are very insignificant, both as regards their size and
                    the symptoms they create, the two principal being <hi rend="italic">Taenia
                    perfoliata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. plicata.</hi> The former is the more
                    common, but is only from 1 to 5 inches in length; it is found in the caecum and
                    colon, and is distinguished from <hi rend="italic">T. plicata,</hi> not only by
                    its length, but also by its rounder head. This last, which has a nearly square
                    head, and is from 6 inches to 3 feet in length, occurs in the small intestines
                    and stomach. Generally a horse may be proved to be infested with tape-worm by
                    finding some of the proglottides in the faeces. The best remedy for the removal
                    of <hi rend="italic">Taenia</hi> is extract of male fern, with oil of turpentine
                    and linseed oil, given three days in succession.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gastrus equi</hi> or the common bot, though not a true helminth
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Insects,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 150), is classed with the
                    parasites on account of its larval form living as a parasite. The bot-fly
                    deposits its eggs on the hair of horses in such a position as to enable that
                    animal, when licking itself, to take them into its mouth; there the warmth and
                    moisture of the tongue, combined with the pressure of licking, cause them to
                    burst, and from each <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> a small grub escapes, which
                    sticks to the tongue, and then passes down into the stomach, where it fixes
                    itself to the cuticular lining of the organ by a hook which it has on each side
                    of its mouth. There it undergoes no change (except that of growth, being at this
                    time about 1 inch long) for about nine months, when it detaches itself, passes
                    into the food, and is discharged with the faeces.</p>
                <p>Of the parasites which infest cattle and sheep mention will only be made of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasciola hepatica</hi> or common fluke, which gives rise to the
                    disease called rot, and is more frequently met with in sheep <pb break="no"

                    anatomy and development, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trematoda,</hi> vol. xxiii. p.
                    535.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Strongylus micrurus</hi> is the husk-producing worm of cattle.
                    The common earthworm is the intermediate bearer. <hi rend="italic">S.
                    filaria,</hi> or the common lung strongyle of sheep, is distinguished from <hi
                    rend="italic">S. micrurus</hi> by having no papillae on its head. The males are
                    1 inch to 1 inch 2 lines long and the females nearly 3 inches. The development
                    is unknown; but Cobbold thought that in its larval form the creature infested
                    snails, &amp;c. The symptoms of its presence in the sheep are a dull expression,
                    quickened breathing, foetid breath, foaming at the mouth and nostrils, violent
                    and spasmodic cough, loss of appetite, and emaciation. Of various specific
                    remedies the most successful is a mixture of oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and
                    sulphuric ether, administered two mornings in succession, followed by a third
                    dose on the fourth morning. This causes coughing, and consequent freeing of the
                    tubes of the larvae and mucus. Good results have been derived from inhalation of
                    chlorine gas, &amp;c., which acts in the same way. The intratracheal injection
                    of oil of turpentine is said to be followed by favourable results. The system
                    should be supported with as much good nourishing food as possible. <hi
                    rend="italic">S. rufescens,</hi> or gordian strongyle (males 5 to 6 inches long,
                    females 6 to 7 inches), is very often associated with <hi rend="italic">S.
                    filaria.</hi></p>
                <p>The principal Cestode of ruminants is <hi rend="italic">Taenia expansa,</hi>
                    which, when fully mature, is more frequently found in sheep than in cattle. Its
                    body consists of about one thousand segments, each more broad than long. It is
                    the longest of all tape - worms, being (according to Cobbold) in sheep from 8 to
                    30 feet and in oxen from 40 to 100 feet in length. Its maximum width is ¾ inch;
                    it is found in the large and small intestines. Cobbold thought its larval form
                    was developed in the louse of the ox. The symptoms are emaciation, with
                    dysentery, and loss of appetite. Male fera ought to be given in doses according
                    to the size of the animal. For a full account of the development of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cysticercus bovis,</hi> the beef measle, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tape-worms,</hi> vol. xxiii. pp. 50-52. <hi rend="italic">C. ovis</hi> is
                    supposed by Cobbold to be the larval form of his so-called <hi rend="italic">T.
                    tenella</hi> of the human subject. Another bladder worm, found only in the
                    mesentery of the sheep, is <hi rend="italic">C. tenuicollis,</hi> the larval
                    form of <hi rend="italic">T. marginata</hi> of the dog. Another important
                    hydatid of ruminants is <hi rend="italic">Coenurus cerebralis,</hi> which gives
                    rise to gid; it is generally found in the brain of sheep, cattle, goats, deer,
                    &amp;c., and also in the soft structures of rabbits. It is the larval form of
                    <hi rend="italic">T. coenurus</hi> of the dog. The symptoms of gid are these.
                    The animal has a rotatory motion; it does not graze freely; there is paralysis
                    on the opposite side to the vesicle; the head is elevated or depressed if the
                    hydatid is situated in the centre; and the animal is easily frightened. Medical
                    treatment is of no avail; but the hydatid may be removed by a surgical
                    operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trichocephalus affinis,</hi> the common whip-worm, sometimes
                    gives rise to severe symptoms in ruminants, particularly in sheep. The males and
                    females are each about 2 inches long.</p>
                <p>The helminths of the pig, although not very detrimental to the animal itself, are
                    nevertheless of great importance in respect to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entozoa</hi> of the human subject, being the intermediary bearers of some
                    dangerous human parasites in their immature state. Allusion must be made to <hi
                    rend="italic">Trichina spiralis</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Parasitism,</hi>
                    vol. xviii. p. 270). The development of this parasite requires about three weeks
                    after being taken into the stomach, where the capsule is digested; it then
                    passes into the intestines of the pig, principally the duodenum, where it takes
                    two days to become mature; then after about a week the embryos leave the body of
                    the female worm, and immediately commence penetrating the walls of the
                    intestines in order to pass into some voluntary muscles. About fourteen days
                    elapse from the time they begin their wandering. Each is generally enveloped in
                    a capsule, but two or even four have been found in one capsule. The male is <hi

                    >Tape-worms,</hi> vol. xxiii. p. 52). “Measly pork” is caused by the presence in
                    the tissues of the pig of this entozoon, which is bladder-like in form. It has
                    also been discovered in the dog, ape, bear, rat, and deer. Other important
                    parasites of the pig are <hi rend="italic">Stephanurus dentatus,</hi> or
                    crown-tailed strongyle, and <hi rend="italic">Echinorhynchus gigas.</hi> This

                <p>The commonest of all parasites infesting the dog is <hi rend="italic">Ascaris
                    mystax</hi> (males 2 to 3½ inches, females 3 to 8 inches long). It is also found
                    in the cat and larger canines. The symptoms are wasting, voracity, irregularity
                    of bowels, short cough, and irritation at anus; in the cat, more particularly,
                    large quantities of mucus, with numerous parasites, are vomited. The treatment
                    consists of the administration of castor oil, with santonine, according to the
                    size of the animal. <hi rend="italic">Filaria immitis,</hi> another Nematode,
                    infests the heart of the dog, and its larvae circulate in the blood, giving rise
                    to fits, which often end in death.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taenia serrata</hi> is a moderate-sized Cestode, from 2 to 3
                    feet in length; it is found in about 10 per cent. of all English dogs, most
                    frequently in sporting dogs, especially greyhounds and harriers, owing to their
                    eating the intestines of rabbits, &amp;c., in which the larval form <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cysticercus pisiformis)</hi> of this parasite dwells. It takes
                    two months to pass through the first stage and one month to pass through the
                    second when it is artificially produced, but much longer when produced naturally
                    (Cobbold). <hi rend="italic">T. coenurus</hi> gives rise to gid in sheep, as
                    previously stated. It is 18 to 24 inches long, and is principally seen in the
                    small intestines. <hi rend="italic">T. marginata</hi> is the largest Cestode
                    infesting the dog. It varies in length from 5 to 8 feet, and is found in the
                    small intestines of about 30 per cent. of dogs in Great Britain; its larval
                    form, <hi rend="italic">C. tenuicollis,</hi> is found in the mesentery, &amp;c.,
                    of sheep. In the treatment of Cestodes extract of male fern has been found the
                    most effectual remedy; areca nut and a pill consisting of colocynth and jalap,
                    varying according to the size, age, and condition of the dog, have also proved
                    efficacious. Comparatively small doses of any vermifuge have often been found to
                    give rise to violent symptoms, and all vermifuges if taken in large doses
                    produce death; too much care cannot, therefore, be exercised in administering
                    vermifuges to young animals.</p>
                <p>Another order of parasites which cause numerous diseases of the skin in the
                    domesticated animals may be classed under two heads, viz., animal parasites or
                    <hi rend="italic">Dermatozoa</hi> and vegetable parasites or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dermatophyta.</hi> The animal parasites are those which produce scab, itch,
                    mange, &amp;c., in all animals. This class may be again divided into three
                    varieties, viz., <hi rend="italic">Sarcoptes,</hi> which burrow in the skin; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dermatodectes,</hi> which bite the skin; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Symbiotes,</hi> which simply pierce the epidermis (Gerlach). All these
                    parasites live on serous fluids, produced by the irritation which they excite.
                    Either one or more of these varieties infest all our domesticated animals: all
                    three varieties have been found on the horse and sheep, the last two on the ox,
                    and one in the pig, dog, and cat respectively. The sarcoptic variety of the
                    horse and dog is easily transmitted to man. To distinguish between the different
                    varieties, it is only necessary to place a few fresh scales in the sun; if <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarcoptes</hi> are present, they will soon be found on the under
                    surface, whereas <hi rend="italic">Dermatodectes</hi> are on the upper surface.
                    Again, the <hi rend="italic">Sarcoptes</hi> are isolated, whereas the <hi
                    rend="italic">Symbiotes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dermatodectes</hi> live in
                    clusters or colonies. Thirdly, the <hi rend="italic">Symbiotes</hi> do not
                    burrow, but merely bite the skin, and principally invade the limbs. An effectual
                    cure for those which infest the horse is a mixture of sulphur, hellebore, oil of
                    turpentine, whale oil, and carbolic acid, applied for three successive days,
                    then washed off and applied again. For the dog a very useful remedy is made from
                    creosote, olive oil, solution of potassium, and sulphur, also train oil and
                    spirits of tar. The first is an almost sure cure for cats. A good remedy for
                    destroying lice may be compounded from <hi rend="italic">staphysagria</hi>
                    powder, soft soap, and hot water, applied warm to the skin.</p>
                <p>Vegetable parasites are of two kinds, namely, <hi rend="italic">Tinea
                    tonsurans,</hi> or the common ringworm, seen in most of our domesticated
                    animals, and <hi rend="italic">Favus,</hi> or honeycomb ringworm. The latter is
                    seldom seen. <hi rend="italic">T. tonsurans</hi> is due to a cryptogamic
                    parasite, <hi rend="italic">Tricophyton,</hi> and is lodged in the interior of
                    the roots of the hairs, which after a time lose their elasticity and break off,
                    leaving the fungi in the form of a greyish white bran-like incrustation. In this
                    they differ from <hi rend="italic">Favus,</hi> which is yellow and covers the
                    epidermis. It may affect any part of the body, but occurs principally on the
                    head, face, neck, and hindquarters; it is very prevalent amongst young cattle.
                    Ringworm is very contagious, and may be communicated from one animal to another,
                    and from animals to man. It mostly attacks badly-fed and ill-cared-for animals.
                    The affected parts should be well washed with soft soap and warm water, removing
                    as much as possible of the bran-like scales, and then with Stockholm tar
                    ointment, and finally with either iodine (in tincture or ointment) or carbolic
                    acid (in solution or ointment). (G. FL.)</p>
