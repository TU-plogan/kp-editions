                    of about 550 feet above the level of the sea. It lies at the base of the last
                    outlying spurs of the eastern Alps (the Wiener Wald), at the beginning of a
                    plain which stretches eastwards to the Carpathians. The main channel of the
                    Danube passes to the north of Vienna; but an arm of the river, the Danube Canal,
                    passes through the city, dividing it into two unequal parts. Into this arm, on
                    the east side of Vienna, flows the dirty and generally insignificant stream
                    called the Wien, which gives its name to the city.<note anchored="true"

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Austria).</hi> Vienna is now officially divided into the
                    following ten municipal districts,—the inner town (Innere Stadt) or old city of
                    Vienna, Leopoldstadt, Landstrasse, Wieden, Margarethen, Mariahilf, Neubau,
                    Josefstadt, Alsergrund, and Favoriten. The inner town, which lies almost exactly
                    in the centre of the others, is, unlike the older parts of most European towns,
                    still the most aristocratic quarter, containing the palaces of the emperor and
                    of many of the nobility, the Government offices, many of the embassies and
                    legations, the opera house, and the principal hotels. Leopoldstadt, which is the
                    only district on the left bank of the Danube Canal, is the chief commercial
                    quarter, and is inhabited to a great extent by Jews. Mariahilf, Neubau, and
                    Margarethen are the chief seats of manufacturing industry. Landstrasse may be
                    described as the district of officialism; there too are the British and German
                    embassies. Alsergrund, with the enormous general hospital, the military
                    hospital, and the municipal asylum for the insane, is the medical quarter. The
                    inner city, or Vienna proper, was formerly separated from the other districts by
                    a circle of fortifications, consisting of a rampart, fosse, and glacis. These,
                    however, were removed in 1858- 1860, and the place of the glacis has been taken
                    by a handsome boulevard (Ring-Strasse), 2 miles in length and about 150 feet in
                    average width. A series of external <pb break="no"

                    constructed in 1704 to surround the whole city at that time, including its
                    suburbs; and these are still maintained as the boundary-line for the city
                    imposts, and separate the above-named districts from the as yet unincorporated
                    suburbs. This second girdle of fortifications is known as the Lines (Linien),
                    and a second wide boulevard (Gürtel-Strasse) follows their course round the
                    city.</p>
                <p>Near the centre of the inner city, most of the streets in which are narrow and
                    irregular, is the cathedral of St Stephen, the most important mediaeval building
                    in Vienna, dating in its present form mainly from the 14th and 15th centuries,
                    but incorporating a few fragments oi the original 12th-century edifice. Among
                    its most striking features are the fine and lofty tower (450 feet), rebuilt in
                    1860-64; the extensive catacombs, in which the emperors were formerly interred;
                    the sarcophagus (1513) of Frederick III.; the tomb of Prince Eugene of Savoy;
                    thirty-eight marble altars; and the fine groined ceiling. A little to the
                    south-west of the cathedral is the Hofburg, or imperial palace, a huge complex
                    of buildings of various epochs and in various styles, enclosing several
                    courtyards. The oldest part of the present edifice dates from the 13th century,
                    and extensive additions are now being made according to the plans of the
                    architect Fischer von Erlach (1656-1723). In addition to private rooms and state
                    apartments, the Hofburg contains a library of 400,000 volumes and 20,000 MSS.;
                    the imperial treasury, a storehouse of objects of the greatest historical
                    interest and intrinsic value; a cabinet of coins and antiquities; and other
                    important collections. In the old town are the two largest of the Höfe,
                    extensive blocks of buildings belonging to the great abbeys of Austria, which
                    are common throughout Vienna. These are the Schottenhof (once belonging to the
                    “Scoti,” or Irish Benedictines) and the Mölkerhof, adjoining the open space
                    called the Freiung, each forming a little town of itself. As in most Continental
                    towns, the custom of living in flats is prevalent in Vienna, where few except
                    the richer nobles occupy an entire house. Of late the so-called “Zinspaläste”
                    (“tenement palaces ”) have been built on a large and magnificent scale, often
                    profusely adorned without and within with painting and sculpture. Some of the
                    finest of these, a characteristic feature of Vienna architecture, are also to be
                    seen in the old town. Other notable buildings within the line of the old
                    fortifications are the Gothic Augustine church, containing a fine monument by
                    Canova; the Capuchin church, with the burial vault of the Hapsburgs; the church
                    of Maria-Stiegen, an interesting Gothic building of the 14th century; the
                    handsome Greek church, by Hansen; and the old rathhaus. At the corner of the
                    Graben is the “Stock im Eisen,” the stump of a tree, said to be the last
                    survivor of a holy grove round which the original settlement of Vindomina sprang
                    up (see p. 222 below). It is full of nails driven into it by travelling
                    journeymen.</p>
                <p>In the number of its large and handsome modern buildings Vienna can hold its own
                    with any European capital. Most of these are found in or adjoining the
                    Ring-Strasse, which certainly ranks as one of the most imposing achievements of
                    recent street architecture. Opposite the Hofburg<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n242/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0242-0221"/>, the main body of which is separated from the
                    Ring-Strasse by the Hofgarten and Volksgarten, rise the handsome monument of the
                    empress Maria Theresa and the imperial museums of art and natural history, two
                    extensive Renaissance edifices with domes, matching each other in every
                    particular and grouping finely with the new part of the palace. Hans Makart’s
                    painted dome in the natural history museum is the largest pictorial canvas in
                    the world. Adjoining the museums to the west is the palace of justice (1881),
                    and this is closely followed by the houses of parliament (1883), in which the
                    Grecian style has been successfully adapted to modern requirements. Beyond the
                    houses of parliament stands the new rathhaus, an immense and lavishly-decorated
                    Gothic building, erected in 1873-83. It was designed by Friedrich Schmidt, who
                    may be described as the chief exponent of the modern Gothic tendency, as Hansen
                    and Semper, the creators respectively of the parliament house and the museums,
                    are the leaders of the Classical and Renaissance styles which are so strongly
                    represented in Viennese architecture. The central tower and the tapering steeple
                    of the rathhaus are surmounted by a colossal bronze figure of a knight. Opposite
                    the rathhaus, on the inner side of the Ring, is the new court theatre, another
                    specimen of Semper’s Renaissance work. To the north stands the new building of
                    the university, a Renaissance structure by Ferstel, rivalling the rathhaus in
                    extent. Near the university, and separated from the Ring by a garden, stands the
                    votive church in Alsergrund, erected to commemorate the emperor’s escape from
                    assassination in 1853, one of the most elaborate and successful of modern Gothic
                    churches, in which the efforts of the architect (Ferstel) are supported by a
                    profusion of sculpture and stained glass windows. The other important buildings
                    of the Ring-Strasse include the magnificent opera house, the sumptuous interior
                    of which vies with that of Paris, the Academy of Art, the industrial museum, and
                    the exchange. On the north side the Ring-Strasse gives place to the spacious
                    Franz Joseph’s quay, flanking the Danube Canal. The municipal districts outside
                    the Ring also contain numerous handsome modern buildings. Among the churches may
                    be instanced those of Wieden (St Carlo Borromeo) and Lerchenfeld, the former an
                    18th-century imitation of St Peter’s at Rome, the latter a plain but graceful
                    building in an early mediaeval Italian style. The secular buildings include
                    several large barracks and hospitals, various institutions connected with the
                    university, the arsenal (with a collection of weapons), the Belvedere (see
                    below), and the polytechnic institute, markethalls, &amp;c. In the outlying
                    districts are numerous villas of great taste and elegance.</p>
                <p>Vienna is the intellectual as well as the material capital of
                    Austria,—emphatically so in regard to the German part of the empire. Its
                    university, established in 1365, is now attended by nearly 6000 students, and
                    the medical faculty enjoys a world-wide reputation. Besides an adequate supply
                    of elementary and secondary schools, the other educational institutions include
                    a large polytechnic, an agricultural academy, a military school, Roman Catholic
                    and Protestant theological seminaries, a conservatorium of music, a training
                    school for aspirants to a diplomatic career, a commercial college, and numerous
                    technical and special schools. Its scientific institutions are headed by the
                    Academy of Science. The Academy of Art was founded in 1707. Few European
                    capitals possess more valuable art collections than Vienna. The picture gallery
                    in the Belvedere Palace, formerly the residence of Prince Eugene, is unsurpassed
                    for its specimens of Rubens, Dürer, and the Venetian masters. The Lower
                    Belvedere, at the other end of the garden, contains the famous Ambras collection
                    of armour, curiosities, and antiquities. The private picture galleries of Prince
                    Liechtenstein, Count Harrach, and Count Czernin are of great extent and
                    importance; and the collection of drawings and engravings known as the
                    “Albertina,” in the palace of the archduke Albert, is familiar to all
                    connoisseurs. The collections of the various museums, &amp;c., which are not
                    unworthy of the handsome buildings in which they are exhibited, and the
                    extensive military collections of the arsenal must also be mentioned.</p>
                <p>In 1880 the population of Vienna proper, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the ten
                    municipal districts, amounted to 705,402, a number which gave it the fourth
                    place among the cities of Europe. . Including the suburbs, the total population
                    rose to 1,082,812. The above figures are exclusive of the garrison of 20,700
                    men. The overwhelming majority of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics; the Jews
                    number about 75,000, and the Protestants 26,500.</p>
                <p>Owing to the peculiarities of its situation, the population of Vienna is of a
                    very cosmopolitan and heterogeneous character. The German element is, of course,
                    largely in the ascendant; but there are also large numbers of Czechs,
                    Hungarians, and Slavs. As a general rule the Viennese are gay, pleasure-loving,
                    and genial, and they possess a <hi rend="italic">bonhomie</hi> which
                    differentiates them markedly from the inhabitants of the other great German
                    capital. The Viennese women are often distinguished by beauty and elegance; and
                    dressing as a fine art is cultivated here with almost as great success as in
                    Paris. As a rule the Viennese are passionately fond of dancing; and the city of
                    Strauss, Lanner, and Gungl provides the civilized terpsichorean world with
                    waltzes and polkas. Opera, especially in its lighter form, flourishes, and the
                    actors of Vienna maintain with success a traditional reputation of no mean
                    order. The above description must not be understood to convey a negation of more
                    solid qualities, especially industry, frugality, and sobriety. Its chief place
                    in the history of art Vienna owes to its musicians, among whom are counted
                    Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert. The Viennese school of painting is of
                    modern origin; but some of its members, for instance, Hans Makart, have acquired
                    a European reputation.</p>
                <p>The Prater, a vast expanse (2000 acres) of wood and park on the east side of the
                    city, between the Danube and the Danube Canal, is greatly frequented by all
                    classes; and here all phases of Viennese life may be studied, from the
                    fashionable corso in the Haupt-Allee in May down to the boisterous and
                    Derby-day-like jollity of a Sunday in the Wurstel Prater or people’s Prater. The
                    great exhibition of 1873 was held in this park, and several of its buildings,
                    including the large rotunda, have been left standing. Smaller parks are the
                    Hofgarten, the Volks-garten, and the Town Park, all adjoining the Ring-Strasse.
                    The environs of the city of Vienna contain many points of beauty and interest.
                    Among the most popular resorts are the parks and gardens belonging to the
                    imperial châteaux of Schönbrunn and Laxenburg.</p>
                <p>The position of the city on the chief European waterway running from west to east
                    early marked out Vienna as one of the great commercial emporia of eastern
                    Europe. The valley of the March, which river here joins the Danube, forms the
                    natural line of communication with the Oder and the Vistula. But the Austrian
                    Government and the corporation of Vienna, by failing to keep the Danube in a
                    proper state for navigation, have let slip the opportunity of making the city
                    the great Danubian metropolis which its geographical position entitles it to be.
                    An extensive trade is nevertheless carried on from Vienna in grain, partly as a
                    direct importation from Hungary and partly in transit between Russia and
                    southern Germany. Other important articles are wine, cattle, colonial wares, and
                    manufactured goods of the most varied description. Though not conspicuous among
                    cities of its own rank as an industrial centre, Vienna nevertheless carries on a
                    considerable number of manufactures; and some of its products, such as its
                    bent-wood furniture and meerschaum pipes, are exported to all parts of Europe.

                    it rivals Paris; and among manufactures of a more solid character may be
                    instanced machinery, ironwares, carriages, cotton and silk goods, &amp;c. The
                    beer of Vienna is also famous. The municipal government of Vienna is entrusted
                    to a gemeinderath of 120 elected members, with an executive and police
                    magistracy. The annual income of this body amounts to about one and a half
                    millions sterling. In the national parliament the city is represented by 10
                    members. The climate of Vienna is changeable, and rapid falls of temperature are
                    not uncommon. The range between January and June is about 40° Fahr. Violent
                    storms often occur in spring and autumn; and the heat of summer is accompanied
                    by a plague of dust. Good water is brought by an aqueduct from the Schneeberg,
                    50 miles to the south-west. The annual death-rate is about twenty-six per
                    thousand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> For several centuries Vienna filled an important
                    rôle as the most advanced bulwark of Western civilization and Christianity
                    against the Turks, for during the whole of the Middle Ages Hungary practically
                    retained its Asiatic character. The story of Vienna begins in the earliest years
                    of the Christian era, with the seizure of the Celtic settlement of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vindomina</hi> by the Romans, who changed its name to <hi
                    rend="italic">Vindobona,</hi> and established a fortified camp here to command
                    the Danube and protect the northern frontier of the empire. The fortress grew in
                    importance, and was afterwards made a municipium; and here Marcus Aurelius died
                    in 180. On the decline of the Roman empire Vindobona became the prey of
                    successive barbarian invaders. Attila and his Huns were among the temporary
                    occupants of the place (5th century), and in the following century it came into
                    the possession of the Avars, after which its name disappears from history until
                    towards the close of the 8th century, when Charlemagne expelled the Avars and
                    made the district between the Enns and the Wiener Wald the boundary of his
                    empire. In the time of Otho II. (976) this “East Mark” (Ostmark, Oesterreich,
                    Austria) was granted in fief to the Babenbergers, and in the reign of Frederick
                    Barbarossa (1156) it was advanced to the rank of a duchy. There is no certain
                    record that the site of Vindobona was occupied at the time of the formation of
                    the Ostmark, though many considerations make it probable. It is not likely that
                    the Avars, living in their “ring” encampments, destroyed the Roman municipium;
                    and Becs, the Hungarian name for Vienna to this day, is susceptible of a
                    Slavonic interpretation only, and would seem to indicate that the site had been
                    occupied in Slavonic times. The frequent mention of “Wiene” in the oldest extant
                    version of the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> points in the same
                    direction. Passing over a doubtful mention of “Vwienni” in the annals of 1030,
                    we find the “civitas” of Vienna mentioned in a document of 1130, and in 1156 it
                    became the capital and residence of Duke Heinrich Jasomirgott. In 1237 Vienna
                    received a charter of freedom from Frederick II., confirmed in 1247. In the time
                    of the crusades Vienna increased so rapidly, in consequence of the traffic that
                    flowed through it, that in the days of Ottocar II. of Bohemia (1251-76), the
                    successor of the Babenbergers, it had attained the dimensions of the present
                    inner town. A new era of power and splendour begins in 1276, when it became the
                    capital of the Hapsburg dynasty, after the defeat of Ottocar by Rudolph of
                    Hapsburg. From this time on it has shared the fortunes of the house of Austria.
                    In 1477 Vienna was besieged unsuccessfully by the Hungarians, and in 1485 it was
                    taken by Matthew Corvinus. Of more importance were the two sieges by the Turks
                    (1529 and 1683), when the city was saved on the first occasion by the gallant
                    defence of Nicholas von Salm, and on the second by Rüdiger von Starhem-berg, who
                    held out until the arrival of the Poles and Germans under John Sobieski of
                    Poland. The suburbs, however, were destroyed on both occasions. In 1805, and
                    again in 1809, Vienna was for a short time occupied by the French. In 1814-15 it
                    was the meetingplace of the congress which settled the political affairs of
                    Europe after the overthrow of Napoleon. In 1848 the city was for a time in the
                    hands of the revolutionary party; but it was bombarded by the imperial forces
                    and compelled to surrender on 30th October of the same year. Vienna was not
                    occupied by the Prussians in the war of 1866, but the invaders marched to within
                    sight of its towers. Since then the most important event in its history has been
                    the exhibition of 1873.</p>
