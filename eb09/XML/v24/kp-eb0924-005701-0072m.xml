                    of British Columbia, lies in a north-west and south-east direction parallel with

                    de Fuca Strait, which leads into the Gulf of Georgia and Johnstone’s Strait on
                    the east of the island, Queen Charlotte Sound entering this last from the
                    north-west. These channels vary from 5 to 80 miles in width. The island extends
                    from 48° 20' to 51° N. lat. and from 123° to 128° 30' W. long. Its length is
                    about 250 miles and its breadth varies from 10 to 70. The area is estimated at
                    from 12,000 to 16,000 square miles: but the island has never been completely
                    surveyed. The coast-line generally is precipitous. The west coast is much broken
                    by bays and fringed with numerous reefs and islands, which render navigation
                    somewhat dangerous. Barclay Sound on the south-west, Nootka Sound behind Nootka
                    Island on the west, and Quatseenough Sound on the north-west send branches into
                    the heart of the island. The east coast is much less broken, though the channel
                    separating it from the mainland is studded with islands. Vancouver generally is
                    mountainous, with peaks rising from 6000 to 9000 feet. There are some level
                    areas on the south-east coast, while in the interior a few narrow well-watered
                    valleys are suitable for agriculture. Short streams run down both coasts, and
                    the island is dotted with lakes,—Buttle and Dickson in the centre, Cowichan in
                    the south, and Niin-kish in the north. The mountains, much broken, run generally
                    along the length of the island, the highest peaks (estimated at 9000 feet) being
                    south-east of Nootka Sound, while farther to the north are Victoria Peak (7484
                    feet) and Mount Alston (6500 feet). To the south of Buttle Lake, Mount Albert
                    Edward rises to 6968 feet. The mountains in the south of the island are
                    generally lower.</p>
                <p>The island is essentially a mountain range composed of metamorphic and trappean
                    rocks, fringed by a belt of Carboniferous limestones and other sedimentary
                    deposits. Among the metamorphic and erupted rocks are gneiss and killas or
                    clayslate, permeated by quartz veins, quartz and hornblende rocks, compact
                    bituminous slate, highly crystalline felspathic traps, and semi-crystalline
                    concretionary limestone. Among the sedimentary rocks are sandstones and
                    stratified limestones, fine and coarse grits, conglomerates, and fossiliferous
                    limestones, shales, &amp;c., associated with seams of coal. The country is
                    strewn with erratic boulders and other marks of Glacial action. So far as is
                    known at present the chief mineral resource is coal, which is worked in large
                    quantities at Nanaimo on the east coast, and in quality is reputed the best on
                    the whole Pacific coast. While limited areas in the south-east of the island and
                    in the inland valleys are well adapted to agriculture (about 300,000 acres in
                    all), and while farming is carried on to some extent, the country is too
                    mountainous ever to develop agriculture on any large scale. The mountains are,
                    however, covered with forests, mainly the Douglas pine, yielding splendid
                    supplies of timber. These forests, with its coal and its fisheries, may be
                    regarded as the chief resources of the island. The climate of Vancouver,
                    especially in the south, is wonderfully mild for the latitude, as mild as that
                    of Great Britain, with drier summers. The mean temperature of December at
                    Victoria, in the south of the island, is about 38° Fahr., while that of July is
                    53°. A rainfall of 35∙87 inches in the year has been recorded at Esquimault. In
                    the northern parts and in the west the climate gets much more severe, and there
                    the rainfall is greater than on the south and east coasts. Cereals of all kinds,
                    all fruits of the temperate zone, pulse, and vegetables flourish on the patches
                    suited to agriculture, while cattle and sheep can be easily reared in small
                    numbers. The population of the island in 1881 was 9991, of whom 5925 lived in
                    the city of Victoria. In 1887 the population was estimated at 25,000 (19,000
                    whites and Chinese, and 6000 Indians).</p>
                <p>The capital of the island is <hi rend="smallcaps">Victoria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.υ.).</hi> Three and a half miles to the west of Victoria is the town of
                    Esquimault at the head of Parry Bay. There has been a British Admiralty station
                    here for many years, the harbour having an average depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms.
                    There are Government offices, two churches, a public school, and various other
                    buildings. The Canadian Government has constructed a dry dock, 450 feet long, 26
                    feet deep, and 65 feet wide at the entrance. The completion of the Canadian
                    Pacific Railway renders Esquimault of increasing importance. Seventy-three miles
                    north of Victoria and connected with it by railway is the town <pb break="no"

                    industry; the average output of coal in the five years ending 1887 was 250,000
                    tons per annum. The mines employ about 1100 men. There are a good harbour and
                    wharves. The population in 1887 was estimated at 4000. There are smaller
                    communities in the island, mainly in the south corner. Sixty miles north-west of
                    Nanaimo is Comox, the chief centre of the lumber industry. On the mainland,
                    opposite Nanaimo, on a peninsula to the south of Burrard’s Inlet, a city named
                    Vancouver has recently been formed (incorporated 1886) at the terminus of the
                    Canadian Pacific Railway.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Vancouver Island was discovered by Juan de Fuca
                    in 1592. In 1778 Captain Cook roughly surveyed the coast, this work being
                    extended by Captain Vancouver, who surveyed the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the
                    Gulf of Georgia. The first settlement on the island was made by the Hudson’s Bay
                    Company on the site of Victoria in 1843. Six years later Vancouver Island was
                    constituted a colony. Its union with British Columbia was effected in 1866∙.</p>
