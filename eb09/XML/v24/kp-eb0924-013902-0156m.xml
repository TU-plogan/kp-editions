                    Maracaibo, which was called by him the Gulf of Venecia.</p></note> a federal
                    republic in South America, lying between about 57° and 73° 30' W. long. and 1°
                    40' and 12° 26' N. lat. The republic claims that the area of its territory is
                    632,807 square miles; but the boundaries are not yet definitely fixed, and its
                    area is consequently uncertain. In the south-west it claims large tracts
                    extending to the south of the equator, which are also claimed by Colombia and
                    Ecuador; and in the east it claims from British Guiana the upper valley of the
                    Essequibo, together with all the territory on the left bank of that river below
                    the influx of the Rupununi. Of the total area claimed only about 439,000 square
                    miles are actually under Venezuelan administration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> A branch of the eastern chain of the
                    Andes enters Venezuela in the west about 7° N. lat., and under the name of the
                    Sierra Nevada de Merida proceeds north-eastwards towards Triste Gulf. This
                    branch consists of parallel chains enclosing elevated valleys, in one of which
                    lies the town of Merida at the height of 5400 feet, overlooked by the highest
                    summit of the chain (Picacho de la Sierra, 15,000 feet). The sierra contains the
                    water-parting between the basin of the Orinoco and those of the small rivers on
                    the north-west. Hence it may be considered to terminate where the Rio Claro, the
                    stream on which Barquisimeto stands, after rising on its western slopes flows
                    eastwards into the basin of the Orinoco. Beyond the Claro begin two parallel
                    ranges known as the Maritime Andes of Venezuela, which stretch east and west
                    along the coast. The valley between these two ranges is the most densely peopled
                    part of Venezuela. Within it lie the town of Valencia (1800 feet), the Lake of
                    Valencia (1400 feet), and the town of Carácas (3000 feet). Above Carácas the
                    highest peak of the system, Pico de la Silla, rises to 8740 feet. Behind the
                    wide bay between Cape Codera and Cumana there is an interruption in the Maritime
                    Andes; but both ranges reappear between Cumana and the Gulf of Paria. West of
                    the Maritime Andes low ranges (3500- 5000 feet) trend northwards from the end of
                    the Sierra de Merida towards the coast, on the east side of the Lake of
                    Maracaibo, while the region on the west of that lake consists of lagoon-studded
                    lowlands. East and south of the Sierra de Merida and the Maritime Andes the
                    Venezuelan territory consists mainly of the basin of the Orinoco. This region is
                    for the greater part of its extent thinly populated and little known. It
                    consists of two portions,—a vast hilly or mountainous area, densely-wooded, in
                    the south-east and south, and level plains in the north-west between the Orinoco
                    and the Apure and the mountains. The latter is known as the llanos of the
                    Orinoco, a region described by Humboldt as a vast “sea of grass,” with islands
                    of wood scattered here and there. Since the time of Humboldt, however, the
                    aspect of these plains would seem to have changed very considerably. On the
                    occasion of Appun’s visit in 1850 trees seem still to have been comparatively
                    rare; but a different aspect was presented when Dr P. Jonas visited the llanos
                    in 1878. From the Galera, the southernmost range of hills north of the Orinoco
                    basin, the traveller saw a vast plain thickly grown with low trees, among which
                    the chaparro was chiefly represented. Few places were quite destitute of trees,
                    and these of small extent. As far as Calabozo (about one-third of the dis tance
                    between the hills and the Apure) it was now chaparros (evergreen oaks), now
                    mimosas, which were the prevailing feature of the landscape, though other trees
                    were not rare. But towards the south the open grass-covered spaces increased in
                    number and area. To the south of Calabozo woods of considerable extent were
                    seen. This change in the character of the landscape is due to the decline of
                    horse and cattle rearing in the llanos, partly in consequence of political
                    disturbances and partly of a murrain which broke out in 1843 among horses,
                    mules, and asses, and in that and several subsequent years reduced their numbers
                    by several thousands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Geologically the chief mountain ranges of
                    Venezuela are all similar in structure. The nucleus of the Sierra Nevada de
                    Merida is formed of plutonic or metamorphic rocks (granite, syenite, gneiss,
                    crystalline schists, &amp;c.), and this series is continued throughout the
                    northern chain of the Maritime Andes. Stratified rocks belonging to the
                    Cretaceous system are found on both sides of the plutonic nucleus of the former
                    range, and are those chiefly seen in the southern chains of the Maritime Andes.
                    Most of these deposits belong to the upper members of the Cretaceous system; but
                    the lower members come to the surface in considerable patches west of the Sierra
                    Nevada de Merida, and in the chains just referred to. Tertiary and Quaternary
                    deposits (generally as compact marl, sand, shingle, and conglomerate) are spread
                    over nearly all the llanos, as well as round the Gulf of Maracaibo, and in the
                    plains drained to the north by the Unare, between the two sections of the
                    Maritime Andes. The hills and mountains east of the Orinoco, according to
                    Humboldt, Schomburgk, and Codazzi, seem to be mainly composed of granite,
                    syenite, and other crystalline rocks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate and vegetation are such as might be
                    expected from the tropical situation of the country. But Venezuela, as well as
                    the rest of tropical South America east of the Andes, is directly exposed to the
                    trade-winds. The temperature is thereby considerably moderated, and no such
                    extremes of heat are to be met with as are experienced in the corresponding
                    latitudes of northern Africa. The more populous parts of Venezuela are, however,
                    hotter than the maritime districts of Guiana, being less directly exposed to the
                    Atlantic breezes. At La Guaira the mean temperature of the year is 85° Fahr.; at
                    Caracas, only 10 miles distant but 3000 feet higher, it is 71° ∙2 Fahr.; and the
                    greatest extremes that have been observed at the latter station since 1868 are
                    83° ∙4 and 48° Fahr. At both stations the hottest periods are the middle of
                    April and the end of August, when the sun is in the zenith. Everywhere there is
                    a well-marked distinction between a dry and a rainy season, the latter occurring
                    in the English summer months, when the sun is in the northern hemisphere and the
                    force of the trade-wind on the north coast of South America is considerably
                    slackened. At La Guaira the rainy season proper lasts only three months (May to
                    August); but this season lasts longer in the mountains and in the llanos.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The fauna includes among the mammals the rodents
                    and carnivores common to the rest of tropical South America. The manatee is met
                    with nearly everywhere on the coast. In all the rivers are to be found caymans,
                    electric eels, rays, and caribs, the last <hi rend="italic">(Pygocentrus piraya,
                    P. nigricans, P. niger,</hi> Müll. ) consisting of several species of savage and
                    voracious fishes armed with two rows of very sharp teeth. Among the venomous
                    serpents are the striped rattlesnake <hi rend="italic">(Crotalus durissus),
                    Lachesis mutus,</hi> an ally of the rattlesnakes, and a rather rare species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cophias.</hi> Among the non-venomous sorts the commonest are
                    the boa constrictor, the anaconda <hi rend="italic">(Eunectes murinus),</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Coluber variabilis.</hi> Among birds is a singular form
                    known from its note as the bell-bird <hi rend="italic">(Chasmorhynchus
                    carunculatus).</hi> Coral banks abound on the coast; like the waters which
                    surround the roots of the mangroves, these teem with marine life, and are
                    peculiarly rich in beautifully coloured crustaceans. Swarms of locusts sometimes
                    commit great ravages among the fields and plantations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> The lower slopes of all the mountains are clad
                    with the richest tropical vegetation. Amidst an endless variety of
                    dicotyledonous foliage trees, interlaced by numerous twiners and climbers aud
                    adorned with epiphytic orchids, <hi rend="italic">Tillandsiae,</hi> aroids, and
                    <hi rend="italic">Loranthaceae,</hi> grow numerous palms aud tree-ferns, up to
                    the height of about 3500 feet. From among the forest trees may be singled out
                    for mention the silk-cotton tree <hi rend="italic">(Bombax Ceiba),</hi> the
                    mango <hi rend="italic">(Mangifera indica),</hi> the saman <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Inga saman),—</hi> remarkable, like the last-mentioned, less for its height
                    than for the extent and density of the shade which it casts,—the cow-tree <hi
                    rend="italic">(Brosimum Galactodendron),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Attalea
                    speciosa,—</hi> this last being one of the finest ornaments of the palm tribe, a
                    tree whose stem, 40 feet in height, carries erect on its crown leaves which also
                    grow to a height of 40 feet, with a breadth of 8 feet. The mouths of the Orinoco
                    and many parts of the coast are rendered unhealthy by mangrove swamps, which are
                    no doubt partly to blame for the yearly recurrence of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n157/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0157-0140"/> yellow fever in many of the coast towns. From
                    these swamps, however, La Guaira is free, and. there the yellow fever is not a
                    regular visitant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Products.—</hi> The two chief crops grown for food
                    are manioc and maize, the latter being generally ground coarse and baked into a
                    kind of cakes called <hi rend="italic">arepas,</hi> which are eaten hot like the
                    Mexican tortillas. Among other vegetable products which take an important place
                    in the Venezuelan dietary are all kinds of tropical fruits, including several
                    kinds of melons and pumpkins, the sugarcane (the sugar in a little refined
                    condition, known as <hi rend="italic">papelon,</hi> being a favourite article of
                    food), the taro, sweet potatoes, various beans (including two species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaseolus,</hi> which grow only high up in the mountains, but are
                    highly prized everywhere), and a species of hemlock (<hi rend="italic">Conium
                    moschatum),</hi> which is eaten like celery. Of plantation products grown for
                    export by far the most important are coffee and cocoa, next after which come
                    tobacco and cotton. The following table (I.) shows (in thousands of lb) the
                    variations in the export of these products in several years since 1830-31 :—</p>

                <p>This table clearly shows that coffee is rapidly taking a more and more important
                    place as the leading staple of Venezuela. The only date at which the export of
                    coffee shows a decline as compared with the previous date mentioned is 1864-65,
                    when, it is clear, from a comparison of this column with that under cotton, that
                    a considerable area must have been temporarily given up to the cultivation of
                    cotton in consequence of the Civil War in the United States. As regards
                    quantity, Venezuela held the fifth place among the coffeeexporting countries of
                    the world on an average of the ten years 1872-82.<note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Live-Stock. —</hi> The number of live-stock was officially
                    returned in 1883 as follows:—cattle 2,926,733; sheep and goats 3,490,563; horses
                    291,603; mules 247,703; asses 658,764; pigs 976,500.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> The principal minerals of Venezuela are gold,
                    copper, phosphates, and coal. The rich auriferous deposits on the banks of the
                    Yuruari lie 100 miles south-west of the principal mouth of the Orinoco. At Aroa
                    in the north-west, about 75 miles west of Puerto Cabello, are rich deposits of
                    copper ore. Phosphates are obtained from the islands of Orchilla and Aves, which
                    lie to the east of the Leeward Islands of the Dutch. A large deposit of
                    bituminous coal, said to be of very good quality, exists about 6 miles south of
                    Barcelona, and a concession for a railway from this port to the coalbed has been
                    obtained from the Government. Another extensive deposit of bituminous coal has
                    been found on the banks of the Utare, a small stream which empties itself into
                    the sea about 40 miles east of La Guaira. Good petroleum is refined from
                    deposits worked near Belijoque in the state of Los Andes. Both gold and copper
                    ore are important exports, gold ranking in this respect next after coffee. The
                    total amount of gold exported from Ciudad Bolivar from 1866 to 31st December
                    1886, so far as the export was controlled by the state, was 1,946,383 oz.; but
                    it is estimated that within that time about half a million oz. were smuggled
                    away. During the five years 1882-86 the average annual yield was about £740,000.
                    The field from which this yield is derived is at present one of the most
                    promising in the world, but the frontier disputes between Great Britain and
                    Venezuela interfere with the investment of capital for the development of some
                    portions of it to which both Governments lay claim. Silver and tin are also met
                    with, but neither has yet attained any commercial importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industry.—</hi> Manufacturing industries are in general
                    undeveloped. Artisans from Europe and North America are now settled in all the
                    chief towns, and cotton weaving factories have been established.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing industries most extensively pursued are the making of shoes and
                    hats. The latter industry is chiefly in the hands of Germans. A material called
                    jipijapa is very largely used for the making of a kind of hats in imitation of
                    Panama straw hats.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The total value of the imports amounted in the
                    year 1885-86 to £2,498,135, and that of the exports to £3,292,171. The principal
                    exports, besides the plantation products and minerals already mentioned, are
                    hides and skins, coir, and animals; those of minor importance are starch,
                    indigo, sugar, tonqua beans, cinchona, caoutchouc, divi-divi, cocoa-nuts,
                    copaiba balsam, plants, and timber. The principal imports are manufactured
                    articles, drugs, and wine, the last from Spain. Petroleum is imported from the
                    United States, though it is expected that the native supplies will soon meet the
                    home demand. Foreign commerce is chiefly carried on with the United States,
                    Germany, France, and England. There is also a coasting trade of considerable
                    magnitude (value £2,382,719 in 1883). The chief seaports are La Guaira (14,000
                    inhabitants) and Puerto Cabello (10,145), which has the finest natural harbour
                    in Venezuela, enclosed by a ring of coral reefs; the next in importance are
                    Maracaibo (31,921), Ciudad Bolivar (10,861), Carupano (12,389), Puerto Sucre,
                    Puerto Guzman Blanco, La Vela (the port of Coro, opposite the island of
                    Curaçao), and Guiria (on the Gulf of Paria). Ciudad Bolivar is 236 miles up the
                    river Orinoco, the navigation of which by any mouth has been free to all nations
                    since the 25th of October 1886.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> The total length of railways open at the
                    end of 1886 was 144 miles, and 263 miles were then in construction. The length
                    of telegraph lines at the same date was 2595 miles. The railways already in
                    existence or in construction are all short lines connecting the chief seaports
                    with the nearest important inland towns or seats of mineral production, or lines
                    radiating to the more important towns round Caracas. The principal inland towns,

                    legislative enactment goes, elementary education is now well provided for; but
                    in the year ending 30th June 1886 the total number of common, municipal, and
                    private schools was 1957, and the number of pupils 99,466. There are also two
                    universities (Caracas and Merida), 19 federal colleges, and various other public
                    and private institutions for higher education. The standing army consists of
                    about 2800 men, but every male subject between eighteen and forty-five has to be
                    enrolled in the national militia. The monetary system of Venezuela is that of
                    the Latin convention, the franc being represented by the <hi rend="italic"

                    £1,239,400. The public debt, of which the external portion alone amounted in
                    1878 to nearly £11,000,000, including arrears of interest, was reduced in 1881
                    to a total of £4,000,000 by the issue of new bonds in place of all the old ones,
                    both external and internal. At the end of 1886 the external debt amounted to
                    £2,680,850, bearing interest at 4 per cent.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> The constitution is modelled to some extent
                    on that of the United States. At the head of the executive is a president, who
                    is assisted by eight ministers and a federal council. The legislative authority
                    is vested in a congress of two houses,— a senate (24 members) and a chamber of
                    deputies (52 members). The members of the chamber of deputies (one for every
                    35,000 inhabitants, and one more for an excess of 15,000) are elected every four
                    years directly by the electors of the states and the federal district, those of
                    the senate by the legislative bodies of the different states (three for each).
                    The congress elects the members of the federal council, in which there is one
                    senator and one deputy for each of the political divisions of the republic, and
                    one deputy for the federal district. The federal council elects the president.
                    The federal council and the president remain in office for two years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The coast of Venezuela was the first part of
                    the American mainland sighted by Columbus, who, during his third voyage in 1498,
                    entered the Gulf of Paria and sailed along the coast of the delta of the
                    Orinoco. In the following year a much greater extent of coast was traced out by
                    Alonzo de Ojeda, who was accompanied by the more celebrated Amerigo Vespucci. In
                    1550 the territory was erected into the captain-generalcy of Caracas, and it
                    remained under Spanish rule till the early part of the 19th century. During this
                    period Negro slaves were introduced; but less attention was given by the
                    Spaniards to this region than to other parts of Spanish America, which were
                    known to be rich in the precious metals.</p>
                <p>In 1810 Venezuela rose against the Spanish yoke, and on 14th July in the
                    following year the independence of the territory was proclaimed. A war ensued
                    which lasted for upwards of ten years, and the principal events of which are
                    described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Bolivar</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>
                    a native of Caracas and the leading spirit of the revolt. It was not till 30th
                    March 1845 that the independence of the republic was recognized by Spain in the
                    treaty of Madrid. At the date of the battle of Carabobo (1821), by which the
                    power of Spain in this part of the world was broken, Venezuela formed part of
                    the federal state of Colombia, which embraced also the present Colombia and
                    Ecuador; but a meeting of Venezuelan notables on 26th November 1829 declared for
                    the separation of their country from the confederacy. Venezuela passed through
                    the first years of its independent existence with more quietness than the other
                    members of the confederacy. In 1846 there began a series of civil wars and
                    revolutions, which continued, with but short periods of rest, down to the close
                    of 1870. The chief rival parties in these internal dissensions were the
                    Unionists and the Federalists; the former aimed at securing a strong central
                    Government, while the latter, who were ultimately victorious, desired to obtain
                    a large measure of independence for separate states. It was during these
                    troubles that the emancipation of the slaves took place, under a law of 24th
                    March 1854. On 28th March 1864 a federal constitution was drawn up for the
                    republic. Three years later, however, the civil war broke out again, and matters
                    continued in an unsettled state, till in December 1870 Don Guzman Blanco, who
                    had taken the leading part on the side of the Federalists, was declared
                    provisional president. From that date Blanco acted as dictator till 20th
                    February 1873, when he was elected constitutional president for four years, and
                    it has been chiefly owing to his energy and ability that the confederacy has
                    since proceeded on a course of orderly development. The two flourishing
                    agricultural colonies already mentioned were founded during his first tenure of
                    office, in 1874. The chief event in recent years has been the re-division of the
                    territory in 1881 into the states and territories whose names are given in the
                    table above.</p>
