                    the first the characteristics of an energetic soldier. After the Austrian
                    occupation of Ferrara in 1847 he was among those who pressed for an immediate
                    declaration of war; and, when a year later hostilities broke out, he threw
                    himself into the struggle heart and soul. At Goito, where he was wounded, his
                    reckless bravery turned the tide of battle; and in every encounter he was to be
                    seen in the thickest of the fight. During the armistice that followed the defeat
                    of Custozza (25th July) he was engaged in the reorganization of the Sardinian
                    army. The abdication of his father on the evening of the battle of Novara (23d
                    March 1849) made him king of a ruined state. From Radetzky he obtained some
                    mitigation of the hard terms at first demanded by the conqueror, especially in
                    the withdrawal of the Austrian claim that the Sardinian constitution should be
                    abolished. It was the maintenance of this constitution, at a time when reaction
                    swept away every other vestige of representative government in Italy, that
                    gained for Victor Emmanuel the title of the honest king <hi rend="italic">(re
                    galantuomo)</hi> and won for him the confidence of the Italian nation, and
                    ultimately the Italian crown. In the bitter days that followed Novara, the king,
                    calumniated, misunderstood, and charged like his father with treachery, showed a
                    noble forbearance and a self-mastery that could hardly have been expected from
                    his passionate uncultured nature. Though in D’Azeglio and Balbo he had excellent
                    friends and advisers, it was not till 1852 that the accession of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cavour</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> to power gave him a
                    man of great political genius for his guide. From that time the career of Victor
                    Emmanuel became what Cavour made it. While ecclesiastical reforms, which brought
                    upon the king and minister the execration of the church, laid the foundation for
                    all future social and economical advance, the alliance of Sardinia with England
                    and France in the Crimean War secured for Italy the interest of the Western
                    powers, which Austria by its inaction and its half-measures had forfeited.
                    Meanwhile his mother, his wife, and his brother died within four weeks of each
                    other; and the clericals exulted in this manifestation of an offended
                    Providence. At the end of 1855, while the allied troops were still in the East,
                    Victor Emmanuel visited Paris and London. In 1859 Cavour’s object was attained
                    and France united with Sardinia against Austria, the king, sorely against his
                    will, giving his daughter Clotilda in marriage to Jerome Napoleon. Victor
                    Emmanuel met Napoleon III. at Genoa on 13th May, and on the 30th fought at the
                    head of a body of Sardinians and Zouaves at the battle of Palestro. After the
                    victory of Magenta (4th June) the allied monarchs entered Milan, where Victor
                    Emmanuel for the first time saw Garibaldi. In the crowning victory of 24th June,
                    while the French were engaged at Solferino, the king with his Italians carried
                    the village of San Martino. The peace of Villafranca left Venetia and the
                    Quadrilateral to Austria. The extraordinary events of the next year united all
                    Italy, with the exception of Rome and of what still remained to Austria, under
                    the patriot king, who was now excommunicated by the pope (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Italy,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 490). A scene of great violence had
                    passed between the king and Cavour when the peace of Villafranca was accepted by
                    the former; but their old friendship was soon restored, and the death of Cavour
                    in 1861 plunged Victor Emmanuel in the deepest grief. The Prussian alliance of
                    1866 incorporated Venetia with Italy. The personal desire of the king to assist
                    Napoleon III. in the war of 1870 gave way before the wiser counsels of his
                    ministers; and the entry of his troops into Rome after the disasters of the
                    French army and the withdrawal of the French garrison completed Victor
                    Emmanuel’s task and the union of Italy. He lived <pb break="no"
