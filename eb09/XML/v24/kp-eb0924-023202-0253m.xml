                    documents, are the only trustworthy information that we have, the legends and
                    anecdotes which are told respecting him being for the most part of the most
                    dubious, if not the most certainly apocryphal, character. It appears that he was
                    born of poor folk, that his father died in his youth, but that his mother was
                    alive when her son was thirty years old. The very name Villon was stated, and
                    that by no mean authority, the president Claude Fauchet, to be merely a common
                    and not a proper noun, signifying “cheat” or “rascal”; but this seems to be a
                    mistake. It is, however, certain that Villon was a person of loose life, and
                    that he continued, long after there was any excuse for it in his years, the
                    reckless way of living common among the wilder youth of the university of Paris.
                    He appears to have derived his surname from a friend and benefactor named
                    Guillaume de Villon, an ecclesiastic and a person of some property and position.
                    The poet, either by his assistance or in some other way, became a student, and
                    took the degree of bachelor in 1450 and that of master in 1452. Between this
                    year and 1455 nothing positive is known of him, except that nothing was known
                    against him.</p>
                <p>On 4th June 1455 the first important incident of his life that is known occurred.
                    Being in the company of a priest named Giles and a girl named Isabeau, he met a
                    certain Breton, a master of arts, who was also in the company of a priest,
                    Philippe Chermoye or Sermoise or Sermaise. A scuffle ensued; daggers were drawn;
                    and Sermaise, who is accused of having attacked Villon and drawn the first
                    blood, not only received a dagger thrust in return, but a blow from a stone
                    which struck him down. Sermaise died of his wounds. Villon fled, and was
                    sentenced to banishment,—a sentence which was remitted in January 1456, the
                    formal pardon being extant strangely enough in two different documents, in one
                    of which the culprit is described as “François des Loges, autrement dit Villon,”
                    in the other as “François de Montcorbier.” That he is also said to have
                    described himself to the barber-surgeon who dressed his own wounds as Michael
                    Piton is less surprising, and hardly needs an addition to the list of his
                    aliases. It should, however, be said that the documents relative to this affair
                    confirm the date of his birth, by representing him as twenty-six years old or
                    thereabouts. A year later he was again in trouble. In his first broil “la femme
                    Isabeau” is only generally named, and it is impossible to say whether she had
                    anything to do with the quarrel. In the second, Catherine de Vaucelles, of whom
                    we hear not a little in the poems, is the declared cause of a scuffle in which
                    Villon was so severely beaten that to escape ridicule he fled to Angers, where
                    he had an uncle who was a monk. It was before leaving Paris that he composed
                    what is now known as the <hi rend="italic">Petit Testament,</hi> of which we
                    shall speak presently, with the rest of his poems, and which, it should be said,
                    shows little or no such mark of profound bitterness and regret for wasted life
                    as its in every sense greater successor the <hi rend="italic">Grand
                    Testament.</hi> Indeed Villon’s serious troubles were only beginning, for
                    hitherto he had been rather injured than guilty. He left Paris for Angers in the
                    very early spring of 1456-57, and shortly afterwards (in March) the chapel of
                    the College of Navarre was broken open and five hundred gold crowns stolen. The
                    inquiries set on foot discovered a gang of student robbers, one of whom, Guy
                    Tabarie, turned king’s evidence and accused Villon, who was then absent, of
                    being the ringleader, and of having gone to Angers, partly at least, to arrange
                    for similar burglaries there. Other crimes were confessed by the accomplice, and
                    Villon was arrested, put to the torture, and condemned to be hanged,—a penalty
                    which was actually inflicted later on two of his gang, and which he commemorated
                    by anticipation in one of the most famous and remarkable of his poems, the
                    sombre “Ballade des Pendus.” He escaped Montfaucon, however, by appealing from
                    the bishop’s court, where as a clerk he had been tried, to the parlement of
                    Paris, by which body his sentence was commuted to banishment—that is, of course,
                    banishment from the capital. Where he went and what he did for the next four
                    years we do not know. It is certain that at one time, and probable that at more
                    times than one, he was in correspondence with Charles d’Orléans, and it is
                    likely that he resided, at any rate for some period, at that prince’s court at
                    Blois. He had also something to do with another prince of the blood, Jean of
                    Bourbon, and traces are found of him in Poitou, in Dauphiné, &amp;c. But at his
                    next certain appearance he is again in trouble. He tells us that he had spent
                    the summer of 1461 in the bishop’s prison (bishops were fatal to Villon) of
                    Meung. His crime is not known; but his enemy, or at least judge, was Thibault
                    d’Aussigny, who held the see of Orleans. Villon owed his release to a general
                    jail delivery at the accession of Louis XI., and became a free man again on 2d
                    October.</p>
                <p>It was now that he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Grand Testament,</hi> and this,
                    the work which has immortalized him, is the last certain fact which is known of
                    his life. If one could judge from a vague kind of internal evidence, it would
                    seem likely that it is really a testament, and that the poet died soon
                    afterwards. Although he was only thirty at the date of this composition (which
                    is unmistakable, because given in the book itself), there seems to be no kind of
                    aspiration towards a new life, nor even any hankering after the old. Nothing
                    appears to be left him but regret; his very spirit has been worn out by excesses
                    or sufferings or both. But, however this may be, he disappears from history.
                    Rabelais indeed tells two stories about him which have almost necessarily been
                    dated later. One is a countryside anecdote of a trick supposed to have been
                    played by the poet in his old age at Saint Maixent in Poitou, whither he had
                    retired. The other, a coarse but pointed jest at the expense of England, is told
                    as having been addressed by Villon to King Edward V. during an exile in that
                    country. Now, even if King Edward V. were not evidently out of the question, a
                    passage of the story refers to the well-known scholar and man of science, Thomas
                    Linacre, as court physician to the king, and makes Villon mention him, whereas
                    Linacre was only a young scholar, not merely at the time of Edward V.’s supposed
                    murder, but at the extreme date (1489) which can be assigned to Villon’s life.
                    For in this year the first edition of the poet’s work appeared, obviously not
                    published by himself, and with no sign in it of his having lived later than the
                    date (1461) of the <hi rend="italic">Grand Testament.</hi> It would be easy to
                    dismiss these Rabelaisian mentions of Villon as mere humorous inventions, if it
                    were not that the author of <hi rend="italic">Pantagruel</hi> was born quite
                    soon enough to have actually seen Villon if he had lived to anything that could
                    be called old age, that he almost certainly must have known men who had known
                    Villon, and that the poet undoubtedly spent much time in Rabelais’s own country
                    on the banks of the lower Loire.</p>
                <p>The obscurity, the unhappiness, and the evil repute of Villon’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0254-0233"/> life would not be in themselves a reason for the
                    minute investigation to which the events of that life have been subjected, and
                    the result of which has been summed up here. But his poetical work, scanty as
                    the certainly genuine part of it is, is of such extraordinary interest, and
                    marks such an epoch in the history of European literature, that he has been at
                    all times an interesting figure, and, like all very interesting figures, has
                    been often praised for qualities quite other than those which he really
                    possessed. Boileau’s famous verses, in which Villon is extolled for having first
                    known how to smooth out the confused art of the old romancers, are indeed a
                    prodigy of blundering or ignorance or both. As far as art, or the technical part
                    of poetry goes, Villon made not the slightest advance on his predecessors, nor
                    stood in any way in front of such contemporaries as his patron Charles
                    d’Orléans. His two <hi rend="italic">Testaments</hi> (so called by the
                    application to them of a regular class-name of mediaeval poetry) consist of
                    eight-line stanzas of eight-syllabled verses, varied in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grand Testament</hi> by the insertion of ballades and rondeaux of
                    very great beauty and interest, but not formally different in any way from poems
                    of the same kind for more than a century past. What really distinguishes Villon
                    is the intenser quality of his poetical feeling and expression, and what is
                    perhaps arrogantly called the modern character of his subjects and thought.
                    Mediaeval poetry, with rare exceptions, and, with exceptions not quite so rare,
                    classical poetry, are distinguished by their lack of what is now called the
                    personal note. In Villon this note sounds, struck with singular force and skill.
                    Again, the simple joy of living which distinguishes both periods—the mediaeval,
                    despite a common opinion, scarcely less than the ancient—has disappeared. Even
                    the riot and rollicking of his earlier days are mentioned with far less relish
                    of remembrance than sense of their vanity. This sense of vanity, indeed, not of
                    the merely religious, but of the purely mundane and even half pagan kind, is
                    Villon’s most prominent characteristic. It tinges his narrative, despite its
                    burlesque bequests, all through; it is the very keynote of his most famous and
                    beautiful piece, the “Ballade des Dames du Temps Jadis,” with its refrain “Mais
                    où sont les neiges d’antan ?” as well as of his most daring piece of realism,
                    the other ballade of “La Grosse Margot,” with its burden of hopeless
                    entanglement in shameless vice. It is nowhere more clearly sounded than in the
                    piece which ranks with these two at the head of his work, the “Regrets de la
                    Belle Heaulmière,” in which a woman, once young and beautiful, now old and
                    withered, laments her lost charms. So it is almost throughout his poems,
                    including the grim “Ballade des Pendus,” and hardly excluding the very beautiful
                    “Ballade pour sa Mère,” with its description of sincere and humble piety. It is
                    in the profound melancholy which the dominance of this note has thrown over
                    Villon’s work, and in the suitableness of that melancholy to the temper of all
                    generations since, that his charm and power have consisted, though it is
                    difficult to conceive any time at which his poetical merit could be ignored.</p>
                <p>His certainly genuine poems consist of the two <hi rend="italic">Testaments</hi>
                    with their codicil (the latter containing the “Ballade des Pendus,” or more
                    properly “Epitaphe en Forme de Ballade,” and some other pieces of a similarly
                    grim humour), a few miscellaneous poems, chiefly ballades, and an extraordinary
                    collection (called <hi rend="italic">Be Jargon)</hi> of poems in <hi
                    rend="italic">argot,</hi> the greater part of which is now totally
                    unintelligible, if, which may perhaps be doubted, it ever was otherwise. Besides
                    these, certain poems of no inconsiderable interest are usually printed with
                    Villon’s works, though they are certainly, or almost certainly, not his. The
                    chief are “Les Repues Franches,” a curious series of verse stories of cheating
                    tavern-keepers, &amp;c., having some resemblance to those told of George Peele,
                    but of a broader and coarser humour. These are beyond doubt, if not the poet’s
                    work, nearly contemporary with him, and may have some foundation in fact.
                    Another of these spurious pieces is the extremely amusing monologue of the
                    “Franc Archier de Bagnolet,” in which one of the newly constituted archers or
                    regularly trained and paid soldiery, who were extremely unpopular in France, is
                    made to expose his own poltroonery. The third most important piece of this kind
                    is the “Dialogue de Mallepaye et de Baillevent,” a dramatic conversation between
                    two penniless spendthrifts, which is not without merit. These poems, however,
                    were never attributed to Villon or printed with his works till far into the 16th
                    century.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the first dated edition of Villon is of 1489, though some
                    have held one or more than one undated copy to be still earlier. Between the
                    first, whenever it was, and 1542 there were no less than twenty seven editions,
                    the most famous being that of Clement Marot in 1533, one of whose most
                    honourable distinctions is the care he took of his poetical predecessors. The
                    Pléiade movement and the classicizing of the <hi rend="italic">grand siècle</hi>
                    put Villon rather out of favour, and he was not again reprinted till early in
                    the 18th century, when he attracted the attention of students of old French like
                    Duchat, La Monnoye, and Prosper Marchand. The first critical edition in the
                    modern sense—that is to say, an edition founded on MSS. (of which there are in
                    Villon’s case several, chiefly at Paris and Stockholm)—was that of the Abbé
                    Prompsault in 1832. The next and on the whole the most important was that of the
                    bibliophile Jacob (P. Lacroix) in the Bibliothèque Elzevirienne</p>
                <p>(Paris, 1854). Since then Villon has been frequently reprinted, Very great
                    interest having been shown in him; but not much has been done to the text till
                    the recent and uncompleted labours of a Dutch scholar, Dr Bijvanck, who is
                    occupied especially on the Stockholm MS. On the other hand, from the literary
                    and biographical view, Villon has been exhaustively studied of late, especially
                    by MM. Campaux, Vitu, and Longnon, the researches of the last-named (Paris,
                    1877) having probably ascertained everything that there is to know. In England,
                    too, attempts have been made to translate his work, especially by the late D. G.
                    Rossetti, by Mr Swinburne, and by Mr Andrew Lang, while a complete translation
                    has been produced by Mr John Payne. (G. SA.)</p>
