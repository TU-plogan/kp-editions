                    (1513-1574), a painter and architect, whose main distinction rests on his
                    valuable history of Italian art,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati. He
                            was related to the painter Luca Signorelli.</p></note> was born at
                    Arezzo in 1513. At a very early age he became a pupil of Guglielmo da Marsiglia,
                    a very skilful painter of stained glass. At the age of sixteen he went to
                    Florence, where he studied under Michelangelo and Andrea del Sarto, aided by the
                    patronage of the Medici princes. In 1529 he visited Rome and studied the works
                    of Raphael and others of his school.. The paintings of Vasari were much admired
                    by the rapidly degenerating taste of the 16th century; but they possess the
                    smallest amount of merit, being in the main feeble parodies of the powerful
                    works of Michelangelo. Vasari was largely employed in Florence, Rome, Naples,
                    Arezzo, and other places. Many of his pictures still exist, the most important
                    being the wall and ceiling paintings in the great hall of the Palazzo Vecchio in
                    Florence, and his frescos on the cupola of the cathedral, which, however, were
                    not completed at the time of his death. As an architect he was perhaps more
                    successful: the loggia of the Uffizi by the Arno, and the long passage
                    connecting it with the Pitti Palace, are his chief works. Unhappily he did much
                    to injure the fine mediaeval churches of S. Maria Novella and Santa Croce, from
                    both of which he removed the original rood-screen and loft, and remodelled the
                    retro-choir in the degraded taste of his time. Vasari enjoyed a very high repute
                    during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. He built himself in 1547
                    a fine house in Arezzo, and spent much labour in decorating its walls and vaults
                    with paintings. He was elected one of the municipal council or priori of his
                    native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of gonfaloniere. He died at
                    Florence on 27th June 1574.</p>
                <p>Personally Vasari was a man of upright character, free from vanity, and always
                    ready to appreciate the works of others: in spite of the narrow and meretricious
                    taste of his time, he expresses a warm admiration of the works of such men as
                    Cimabue and Giotto, which is very remarkable. As an art historian of his country
                    he must always occupy the highest rank. His great work was first published in
                    1550, and afterwards partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, bearing the title
                        <hi rend="italic">Delle Vite de’ piu Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori, ed
                        Architettori.</hi> It was dedicated to Cosimo de’ Medici, and was printed at
                    Florence by the Giunti; it is a small quarto illustrated with many good woodcut
                    portraits. This <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the complete work is
                    usually bound in three volumes, and also contains a very valuable treatise on
                    the technical methods employed in all branches of the arts, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Le Tre Arti del Disegno, cioè Architettura, Pittura, e
                        Scoltura.</hi></p>
                <p>The best edition of Vasari’s works is that published at Florence by Milanesi,
                    1878-82, which embodies the valuable notes in the earlier edition by Le Monnier.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> has been translated into French, German, and
                    English (by Mrs Foster, London, 1850). They are written in a very pleasant
                    style, interspersed with amusing stories, and are in the main trustworthy,
                    except some of the biographies of early artists.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As in most other kindred subjects the
                            tendency of modem criticism is to underestimate the historical accuracy
                            of Vasari’s work.</p></note> With a few exceptions Vasari’s judgment is
                    acute and unbiassed.</p>
