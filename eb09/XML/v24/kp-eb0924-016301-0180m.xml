                    interested parties—by those established in the port, who do not wish competition
                    on the part of intending settlers, and by those interested in the trade from
                    Vera Cruz to El Paso in the north of the republic” (H. Baker, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cons. Rep.,</hi> 1886, p. 2).</p></note> The town, which in 1884 had a
                    population of 16,840, is distant 263 miles by rail from Mexico and 60 from
                    Jalapa, the summer residence of the upper classes. It has few buildings of
                    interest, except a superb cathedral decorated in the Moorish style. Most of the
                    streets, which are laid out at right angles, are paved with cobble-stones and
                    have a kennel or open gutter in the middle. A characteristic feature of the
                    place are the turkey-buzzards, who do the scavangering, and are consequently
                    protected by law. The open roadstead, although partly protected by the
                    neighbouring islets of Los Sacrificios and San Juan de Ulloa, is greatly exposed
                    to the fierce “nortes” (northers), which sweep over the Gulf at intervals from
                    October to March. A French company, which contracted with the Mexican Government
                    to form a harbour by constructing a breakwater between the islands, has lately
                    suspended operations. Vera Cruz is, however, the largest seaport in the
                    republic. In 1886 over one-half of the exports of Mexico (£3,002,000 altogether)
                    were shipped from this place (£1,625,000 to Great Britain). Of these exports
                    £2,180,000 represented the precious metals, the other chief items being coflee
                    (£207,000), hides and skins (£99,000), mineral ores (£84,000), tobacco
                    (£68,000), broom root (£25,000), and sugar (£12,000). In the same year the
                    imports amounted to £1,941,000 (£498,000 from Great Britain), and 487 vessels of
                    295,000 tons cleared from Vera Cruz. In 1887 the exports from Vera Cruz amounted
                    to £1,047,000 (coffee £407,000 and minerals £208,000), and the imports to
                    £2,159,000.</p>
                <p>The present town of Villa Rica de Vera Cruz (“Rich City of the True Cross ”),
                    which lies several miles south of the original town founded by Cortes in 1520,
                    was built by the viceroy Monterey at the end of the 16th century, and received
                    the title and privileges of a city from Philip III. in 1615.</p>
                <p>The state of Vera Cruz has a seaboard of 450 miles on the Gulf of Mexico, with a
                    mean breadth of 55 miles. Its area is 24,700 square miles, and its total
                    population was 640,000 in 1887, nearly all native Mexicans.</p>
