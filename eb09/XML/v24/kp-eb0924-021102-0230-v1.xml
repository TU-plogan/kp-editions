                    (1668-1744), Italian jurist and philosopher, was the son of Antonio Vico, a
                    small bookseller, and was born at Naples on 23rd June 1668. At the age of seven
                    he had a serious fall and severely injured his head, which produced in him “the
                    melancholy and sour temper suited to men of talent.” Afterwards he applied
                    himself to the study of scholastic philosophy. At an early age he entered the
                    university, and made such rapid progress, especially in jurisprudence, that he
                    is said to have won a suit for his father at the age of sixteen. Nevertheless he
                    preferred the study of history, literature, juridical science, and philosophy.
                    Being appointed teacher of jurisprudence to the nephews of the bishop of Ischia,
                    G. B. Rocca, he accompanied them to the castle of Vatolla, near Cilento, in the
                    province of Salerno. There he passed nine studious years, chiefly devoted to
                    classical reading, Plato and Tacitus being his favourite authors, because “the
                    former described the ideal man and the latter man as he really is.” On his
                    return to Naples he found Cartesianism in the ascendant, and this he disliked.
                    Belonging to no particular school or literary sect, he languished in neglect and
                    obscurity, until in 1697 he gained the professorship of rhetoric at the
                    university, with a scanty stipend of 100 ducats. On this he supported not only
                    himself but his rapidly increasing family; for he had married a poor and
                    illiterate girl, who was only able to put her mark to the nuptial contract.
                    Meanwhile his own studies were pursued with untiring zeal, and he began to write
                    and publish his works. Two modern authors exercised a weighty influence on his
                    mind—Francis Bacon and Grotius. He was no follower of their ideas, indeed often
                    opposed to them; but he derived from Bacon an increasing stimulus towards the
                    investigation of certain great problems of history and philosophy, while Grotius
                    proved valuable in his study of philosophic jurisprudence. In 1708 he published
                    his <hi rend="italic">De ratione studiorum,</hi> in 1710 <hi rend="italic">De
                        antiquissima Italorum sapientia,</hi> in 1720 <hi rend="italic">De universi
                        juris uno principio et fine uno,</hi> and in 1721 <hi rend="italic">De
                        constantia jurisprudentis.</hi> On the strength of these works he offered
                    himself as a candidate for the university chair of jurisprudence then vacant,
                    with a yearly stipend of 600 ducats. But he was rejected by the examiners,
                    although all his competitors have remained unknown to fame. Without any sense of
                    discouragement, he returned to his favourite studies, and in 1725 published the
                    first edition of the work that forms the basis of his renown, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Principii d'una Scienza Nuova.</hi> In 1730 he produced a second edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova,</hi> so much altered in style and with so
                    many substantial additions that it was practically a new work. In 1735 Charles
                    III. of Naples marked his recognition of Vico’s merits by appointing him
                    historiographerroyal, with a yearly stipend of 100 ducats. But the philosopher
                    derived little enjoyment from his new post. Attacked by a cruel malady, mind and
                    memory failed. But during frequent intervals of lucidity he resumed his pen and
                    made new corrections in his great work, of which a third edition appeared in
                    1744, prefaced by a letter of dedication to Cardinal Trojano Acquaviva. Vico
                    expired on 20th January of the same year. Fate seemed bent on persecuting him to
                    the last. A fierce quarrel arose over his burial between the brotherhood of St
                    Stephen, to which he had belonged, and the university professors, who desired to
                    escort his corpse to the grave. Finally the canons of the cathedral, together
                    with the professors, buried the body in the church of the Gerolimini.</p>
                <p>Vico has been generally described as a solitary soul, out of harmony with the
                    spirit of his time and often directly opposed to it. In fact, though living
                    during the later years of the 17th and the early part of the 18th century, when
                    Locke had already given to the world the germs of the ideas afterwards developed
                    in the philosophy of the Encyclopaedists, he followed an entirely opposite line
                    of thought. The writer who was the first to declare that great men are the
                    representatives and personifications of their times would thus seem to have been
                    the living contradiction of his own theory. Nevertheless a closer inquiry into
                    the social conditions of Vico’s time, and of the studies then flourishing, shows
                    him to have been thoroughly in touch with them.</p>
                <p>Owing to the historical past of Naples, and its social and economic condition at
                    the end of the 17th century, the only study that really flourished there was
                    that of law; and this soon penetrated from the courts to the university, and was
                    raised to the level of a science. A great school of jurisprudence was thus
                    formed, including many men of vast learning and great ability, although little
                    known to fame. This school stood apart, as it were, from the rest of the world;
                    the works of its representatives were inelegant, and often indeed exaggeratedly
                    legal and scholastic in style. Accordingly they attracted little notice in upper
                    Italy and were totally ignored beyond the Alps. But, while outside Naples
                    scarcely anything was known of Marcello Marciano the younger, Domenico Aulisio,
                    Duke Gaetano Argento, Niccolò Capasso, and many others, there were three men who
                    rose to great eminence and attained to an honourable rank in general literature
                    both in Italy and abroad. By an <pb break="no"

                    kingdom, based on a study of its laws and institutions and of the legal
                    conflicts between the state and the court of Rome, Pietro Giannone was the first
                    initiator of what has been since known as civil history. Giovan Vincenzo
                    Gravina, the patron and preceptor of Metastasio, and also noted as a literary
                    critic, wrote a history of Roman law, specially distinguished for its accuracy
                    and elegance. While Gravina studied the successive and varying forms of Roman
                    law and sought to give them an historical explanation, Vico raised the problem
                    to a higher plane, by tracing the origin of law in the human mind and explaining
                    the historical changes of the one by those of the other. Thus he made the
                    original discovery of certain ideas which constitute the modern historic method,
                    or rather the psychologico-historic method. This problem he proceeded to develop
                    in various works, until in his <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova</hi> he arrived
                    at a more complete solution, which may be formulated as follows. If the
                    principle of justice and law be one, eternal, and immutable, why should there be
                    so many different codes of legislation? These differences are not caused by
                    difference of nationality only, but are to be noted in the history of the same
                    people. The clearest, most precise, and most constant conception of law was
                    undoubtedly that of the Romans; nevertheless Roman jurisprudence underwent so
                    many transformations as apparently to constitute almost different codes. How was
                    so strange a fact to be explained? This question iβ touched upon in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Orations or Inaugural Addresses (Orazioni o Prolusioni)</hi>
                    and in his <hi rend="italic">Minor Works (Scritti Minori).</hi> Finally he
                    applied himself to its solution in his <hi rend="italic">Universal Law (Diritto
                        Universale),</hi> which is divided into two books. The first of these, <hi
                        rend="italic">Be uno et universi juris principio et fine uno,</hi> was
                    subdivided into two parts; so likewise was the second, with the respective
                    titles of <hi rend="italic">Be constantia philologiae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Be constantia jurisprudentis.</hi></p>
                <p>The following is the general idea derived from these researches. Vico held God to
                    be the ruler of the world of nations, but ruling, not as the providence of the
                    Middle Ages by means of continued miracles, but as He rules nature, by means of
                    natural laws. If, therefore, the physicist seeks to discover the laws of nature
                    by study of natural phenomena, so the philosopher must seek the laws of
                    historical change by the investigation of human events and of the human mind.
                    According to Vico, law emanates from the conscience of mankind, in whom God has
                    infused a sentiment of justice, and is therefore in close and continual relation
                    with the human mind, and participates in its changes. This sentiment of justice
                    is at first confused, uncertain, and almost instinctive, is, as it were, a
                    divine and religious inspiration instilled by heaven into the primitive tribes
                    of the earth. It is an unconscious, universal sentiment, not the personal,
                    conscious, and rational sentiment of the superior few. Hence the law to which it
                    gives birth is enwrapped in religious forms which are likewise visible and
                    palpable, inasmuch as primitive man is incapable of abstract, philosophical
                    ideas. This law is not the individual work of any philosophical legislator, for
                    no man was, or could be, a philosopher at that time. It is first displayed in
                    the shape of natural and necessary usages consecrated by religion. The names of
                    leading legislators, which we so often find recorded in the history of primitive
                    peoples, are symbols and myths, merely serving to mark an historic period or
                    epoch by some definite and personal denomination. For nations, or rather tribes,
                    were then distinguished by personal names only. The first obscure and confused
                    conception of law gradually becomes clearer and better defined. Its visible and
                    religious forms then give way to abstract <hi rend="italic">formulae,</hi> which
                    in their turn are slowly replaced by the rational manifestation of the
                    philosophic principles of law that gains the victory in the final stage of
                    development, designated by Vico as that of civil and human law. This is the
                    period of individual and philosophic legislators. Thus Roman law has passed
                    through three great periods,—the divine, the heroic, and the human, —which are
                    likewise the three chief periods of the history of Rome, with which it is
                    intimately and intrinsically connected. Nevertheless, on careful examination of
                    these three successive stages, it will easily be seen that, in spite of the
                    apparent difference between them, all have a common foundation, source, and
                    purpose. The human and civil philosophic law of the third period is assuredly
                    very different in form from the primitive law; but in substance it is merely the
                    abstract, scientific, and philosophic manifestation of the same sentiment of
                    justice and the same principles which were vaguely felt in primitive times.
                    Hence one development of law may be easily translated into another. Thus in the
                    varied manifestations of law Vico was able to discover a single and enduring
                    principle (<hi rend="italic">De universi juris uno principio et fine uno).</hi>
                    On these grounds it has been sought to establish a close relation between Vico
                    and Grotius. The latter clearly distinguished between a positive law differing
                    in different nations and a natural law based on a general and unchanging
                    principle of human nature, and therefore obligatory upon all. But Vico was
                    opposed to Grotius, especially as regards his conception of the origin of
                    society, and therefore of law. Grotius holds that its origin was not divine, but
                    human, and neither collective, spontaneous, nor unconscious, but personal,
                    rational, and conscious. He believed moreover that natural law and positive law
                    moved on almost constant and immutable parallel lines. But Vico maintained that
                    the one was continually progressing towards the other, positive law showing an
                    increasing tendency to draw nearer to natural and rational law. Hence the
                    conception that law is of necessity a spontaneous birth, not the creation of any
                    individual legislator; and hence the idea that it necessarily proceeds by a
                    natural and logical process of evolution constituting its history. Vico may have
                    derived from Grotius the idea of natural law; but his discovery of the historic
                    evolution of law was first suggested to him by his study of Roman law. He saw
                    that the history of Roman jurisprudence was a continuous progress of the narrow,
                    rigorous, primitive, and almost iron law of the XII. Tables towards the wider,
                    more general, and more humane <hi rend="italic">jus gentium.</hi> Having once
                    derived this conception from Roman history, he was easily and indeed necessarily
                    carried on to the next,—that the positive law of all nations, throughout
                    history, is a continual advance, keeping pace with the progress of civilization,
                    towards the philosophic and natural law founded on the principles of human
                    nature aud human reason.</p>
                <p>As already stated, the <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova</hi> appeared in three
                    different editions. The divergences between the second and third are of too
                    little moment to be recorded here. But the first and second editions are almost
                    distinct works. In the former the author sets forth the analytical process by
                    which the laws he discovered were deduced from facts. In the second he not only
                    enlarges his matter and gives multiplied applications of his ideas, but also
                    follows the synthetic method, first expounding the laws he had discovered and
                    then proving them by the facts to which they are applied. In this edition the
                    fragmentary and jerky arrangement, the intricate style, and a peculiar and often
                    purely conventional terminology seriously checked the diffusion of the work,
                    which accordingly was little studied in Italy and remained almost unknown to the
                    rest of Europe. Its fundamental idea consists in that which Vico, in his
                    peculiar terminology, styles “poetical wisdom” (<hi rend="italic">sapienza
                        poetica)</hi> and “occult wisdom” <hi rend="italic">(sapienza riposta),</hi>
                    and in the historical process by which the one is merged in the other. He
                    frequently declares that this discovery was the result of the literary labours
                    of his whole life.</p>
                <p>Vico was the first thinker who asked, Why have we a science of nature, but no
                    science of history? Because our glance can easily be turned outwards and survey
                    the exterior world; but it is far harder to turn the mind’s eye inwards and
                    contemplate the world of the spirit. All our errors in explaining the origin of
                    human society arise from our obstinacy in believing that primitive man was
                    entirely similar to ourselves, who are civilized, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    developed by the results of a lengthy process of anterior historic evolution. We
                    must learn to issue from ourselves, transport ourselves back to other times, and
                    become children again in order to comprehend the infancy of the human race. As
                    in children, imagination and the senses prevailed in those men of the past. They
                    had no abstract ideas; in their minds all was concrete, visible, and tangible.
                    All the phenomena, forces, and laws of nature, together with mental conceptions,
                    were alike personified. To suppose that all mythical stories are fables invented
                    by the philosophers is to write history backwards and confound the instinctive,
                    impersonal, poetic wisdom of the earliest times with the civilized, rational,
                    and abstract occult wisdom of our own day. But how can we explain the formation
                    of this poetic wisdom, which, albeit the work of ignorant men, has so deep and
                    intrinsic a philosophic value? The only possible reply is that already given
                    when treating of the origin of law. Providence has instilled into the heart of
                    man a sentiment of justice and goodness, of beauty, and of truth, that is
                    manifested differently at different times. The ideal truth within us,
                    constituting the inner life that is studied by philosophers, becomes transmuted
                    by the facts of history into assured reality. For Vico psychology and history
                    were the two poles of the new world he discovered. After having extolled the
                    work of God and proclaimed Him the source of all knowledge, he adds that a great
                    truth is continually flashed on us and proved to us by history, namely, " that
                    this world of nations is the work of man, and its explanation therefore only to
                    be found in the mind of man.” Thus poetical wisdom, appearing as a spontaneous
                    emanation of the human conscience, is almost the product of divine inspiration.
                    From this, by the aid of civilization, reason, and philosophy, there is
                    gradually developed the civil, occult wisdom. The continual, slow, and laborious
                    progress from the one to the other is that which really constitutes history, and
                    man becomes civilized by rendering himself the conscious and independent
                    possessor of all that in poetical wisdom remained impersonal, unconscious, came
                    as it were from without by divine <hi rend="italic">afflatus.</hi></p>
                <p>Vico gives many applications of this fundamental idea. The religion of primitive
                    peoples is no less mythical than their history, since they could only conceive
                    of it by means of myths. On these lines he interprets the whole history of
                    primitive Rome. One book of the second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Scienza
                        Nuova</hi> is devoted to “The Discovery of the True Homer.” Why all the
                    cities of Greece dispute the honour of being his birthplace is because the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> are not the
                    work of one, but of many popular poets, and a true creation of the Greek people
                    which is in every city of Greece.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0232-0213"/>
                <p>And because the primitive peoples are unconscious and self-ignorant Homer is
                    represented as being blind. In all parts of history in which he was best versed
                    Vico pursues a stricter and more scientific method, and arrives at safer
                    conclusions. This is the case in Roman history, especially in such portions as
                    related to the history of law. Here he sometimes attains, even in details, to
                    divinations of the truth afterwards confirmed by new documents and later
                    research. The aristocratic origin of Rome, the struggle between the patricians
                    and the plebeians, the laws of the XII. Tables, not, as tradition would have it,
                    imported from Greece (but the natural and spontaneous product of ancient Roman
                    customs), and many other similar theories were discovered by Vico, and expounded
                    with his usual originality, though not always without his usual blunders and
                    exaggerations.</p>
                <p>Vico may be said to base his considerations on the history of two nations. The
                    greater part of his ideas on poetical wisdom were derived from Greece. Nearly
                    all the rest, more especially the transition from poetical to occult wisdom, was
                    derived from Rome. Having once formulated his idea, he made it more general in
                    order to apply it to the history of all nations. From the savage state, through
                    the terror that gives birth to religions, through the creation of families by
                    marriage, through burial rites and piety towards the dead, men approach
                    civilization with the aid of poetic wisdom, and pass through three periods,—the
                    divine, heroic, and human,— in which they have three forms of government,
                    language, literature, jurisprudence, and civilization. The primary government is
                    aristocratic. Patrician tyranny rouses the populace to revolt, and then
                    democratic equality is established under a republic. Democratic excesses cause
                    the rise of an empire, which, becoming corrupt, declines into barbarism, and,
                    again emerging from it, retraces the same course. This is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >law of cycles,</hi> constituting that which is designated by Vico as the "
                    eternal ideal history, or rather course of humanity, invariably followed by all
                    nations.” It must not be held to imply that one nation imitates the course
                    pursued by another, nor that the points of resemblance between them are
                    transmitted by tradition from one to the other, but merely that all are subject
                    to one law, inasmuch as this is based on the human nature common to all alike.
                    Thus, while on the one hand the various cycles traced and retraced by all
                    nations are similar and yet independent, on the other hand, being actually
                    derived from Roman history, they become converted in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scienza Nuova</hi> into a bed of Procrustes, to which the history of all
                    nations has to be fitted by force. And wherever Vico’s historical knowledge
                    failed he was led into increased error by this artificial and arbitrary
                    effort.</p>
                <p>It has been justly observed by many that this continuous cyclical movement
                    entirely excludes the progress of humanity towards a better future. It has been
                    replied that these cycles are similar without being identical, and that, if one
                    might differ from another, the idea of progress was not necessarily excluded by
                    the law of cycles. Vico undoubtedly considered the poetic wisdom of the Middle
                    Ages to be different from that of the Greeks and Romans, and Christianity to be
                    very superior to the pagan religion. But he never investigated the question
                    whether, since there is a law of progressive evolution in the history of
                    different nations, separately examined, there may not likewise be another law
                    ruling the general history of these nations, every one of which must have
                    represented a new period, as it were, in the history of humanity at large.
                    Therefore, although the <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova</hi> cannot be said
                    absolutely to deny the law of progress, it must be allowed that Vico not only
                    failed to solve the problem but even shrank from attacking it.</p>
                <p>He had no followers or admirers even in Naples, where the ideas of Tanucci,
                    Filangieri, Genovesi, and Galiani prevailed, men who sometimes appear to be more
                    French than Italian. When at last, with the German reaction initiated by Kant
                    against the sense philosophy of the French, an entirely new philosophy arose,
                    and many ideas started by Vico were revived on a more rigorous method, supported
                    by more accurate research and with a wider and firmer grasp of knowledge, the
                    name of the Neapolitan philosopher was forgotten, and no one recognized how much
                    was owed to him. Nevertheless it may be asserted that between the close of the
                    17th and the early part of the 18th century, when the thought of the world was
                    bent in a totally different direction, Vico was the first to discern and
                    proclaim the course by which, in the present age, historical, moral, and
                    political science was destined to make such great and assured progress.</p>
