                    process, and of discerning if possible such order as may lie under the apparent
                    flux of change. Yet a brief retrospect of the essential views of successive
                    evolutionists is still necessary, but only in so far as these have been
                    concerned, not simply with the empirical evidence for descent with modification,
                    but with the deeper attempt to explain the rationale of this process, to show
                    how it is that modifications come to arise, persist, and increase at all. In
                    other words, just as there are these two essential aspects of the doctrine of
                    evolution, which must on pain of immediate confusion be clearly kept apart, so
                    it is necessary to distinguish between the corresponding sides of its historical
                    development, and, passing beyond the simple hypothesis and evidences of descent,
                    consider the attempts to explain the actual process of modification.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Theories of Variation.</hi></p>
                <p>If we pass over the speculations of the earliest evolutionists—De Maillet,
                    Maupertuis, Robinet, Bonnet, &amp;c.— as too vague for rapid summary, and note
                    that Linnaeus was not quite a consistent creationist, since he admitted that
                    many species may be simply fertile hybrids, the history of definite speculation
                    as to the factors of variation may be fairly said to begin with Buffon, whose
                    distinct though covert suggestion of the doctrine of descent with modification
                    was supported by emphatic insistence upon the importance of external conditions.
                    He endeavoured to show how “natures, instincts, and most inward qualities” are
                    modified through bodily habits, how new functions seem to arise in response to
                    new conditions, and how changes in climate, food, and other conditions of life
                    bring about direct modifications in organisms exposed to them. Kant, on the
                    other hand, viewed the evolution of species as related essentially to the
                    mechanical laws of the organism itself, although in his latest writings he
                    allowed for the influence of geographical distribution, food, &amp;c., noted the
                    importance of selection in artificial breeding, and even hinted at the notion of
                    struggle for existence, which was soon afterwards more clearly emphasized by
                    Herder (<hi rend="italic">Ideen z. Phil. d. Geschichte,</hi> 1790) in a striking
                    passage, which may be briefly quoted in free translation: “All is in struggle,
                    each one for himself. . . . Space is too small for the number. . . . Each genus
                    looks after itself as if it were the only one. . . . In this way the whole was
                    preserved. . . . Thus were forces cradled, and limbs counted, and tendencies
                    determined, and the earth came to bear what it could.”</p>
                <p>Erasmus Darwin <hi rend="italic">{Zoonomia,</hi> 1794) believed that the organism
                    has the faculty of improving by its own inherent activity, that it has the power
                    of attaining new parts attended with new propensities. Yet the strongest and
                    most active animals are those which propagate and hand on improvements.
                    Transformations, too, may be produced in part by the exertions of the organism
                    in consequence of its desires for food, security, and reproduction. Changed
                    conditions, such as climate, have an indirect influence in changing desires, and
                    thus actions, and so finally structure; and they may also operate directly.
                    Treviranus (1802-1831) assumed an indefinite variability of the organism, with
                    considerable power of adaptation to surroundings, and even anticipated much
                    recent speculation in his suggestion of a possible factor of modification in the
                    union of sexual elements. The well-known theory of Lamarck (1801-1809) laid
                    special emphasis on function and environment; for, though the sense of need in
                    association with suitable environment calls out a succession of efforts, and so
                    originates incipient structural modifications, it is to increased functioning
                    that the increase of these modifications must be ascribed, while similarly
                    disuse explains degeneration. Changed conditions produce new wants, nutritive
                    and reproductive; hence changes in climate, or the like, change the organism by
                    changing its habits. Rapid increase is checked by other organisms: the strongest
                    and best-armed for attack devour the weaker, and the less <pb break="no"

                    The less definite view of Goethe included, besides recognition of the
                    conservative or centripetal force of heredity, that of a progressive or
                    centrifugal tendency to adaptation to environment. Oken (1809) similarly
                    regarded all progress from his primeval “Urschleim” as having been in terms of
                    its interaction with the external conditions of life. In 1813 Wells made his now
                    well-known suggestion of the importance of natural selection in determining the
                    varieties of the human species; and in 1831 Patrick Matthew published his much
                    more developed, yet equally disregarded, statement of the same doctrine in its
                    more general applications. In 1828-30 Geoffroy St-Hilaire, afterwards ably
                    succeeded by his son Isidore, denied indefinite variation, regarding function as
                    of secondary importance, and laying special stress on the direct influence of
                    the environment: for instance, it was not so much the effort to fly as the
                    (supposed) diminished proportion of carbonic acid in the atmosphere which
                    determined the evolution of birds from saurians. The veteran geographer Von Buch
                    naturally inclined to emphasize the influence of geographical isolation
                    (locality, climate, soil, food, &amp;c.), and laid stress on the restriction of
                    the area of possible sexual union as bearing upon the origin of varieties. The
                    embryologist Von Baer (1834) dwelt especially upon the organismal nature of
                    variation, on the unfolding, as it were, of new structures; and Schleiden (1838)
                    and other naturalists more or less distinctly advanced similar opinions. In 1844
                    appeared the <hi rend="italic">Vestiges of Creation,</hi> which in its later
                    editions (1853) formulated an hypothesis of progress</p>
                <p>(1) by rhythmic impulse through grades of organization,</p>
                <p>(2) by another impulse tending to modify organic structures in accordance with
                    external circumstances. In 1852 Naudin argued for the formation of new species
                    in nature in a similar way to that of varieties under cultivation, further
                    attaching great importance to an assumed “principle of finality,” apparently a
                    kind of organismal fate. Herbert Spencer, whose weighty arguments for evolution
                    date from 1852, laid special stress upon the modifying influences of
                    environment, this involving changes of function, and so ultimately of structure.
                    Finally, in 1853 Victor Carus argued for a progressive adaptation to changing
                    external conditions. An undefined hypothesis of internal modifiability appears
                    also to have floated before the mind of Owen.</p>
                <p>In this succession of variational theories we recognize the repeated general
                    insistence upon every separate factor in the problem,—organism, function, and
                    environment,— the successive authors, in fact, almost falling into as many
                    schools. Yet these are singularly unprogressive: the same hypothesis is stated
                    again and again, but always fails to carry conviction; many employ the merest
                    abstractional explanations, in terms of what is simply the old pre-physiological
                    “vital force” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology),</hi> or attempt to cut the
                    knot by the more or less open introduction of a <hi rend="italic">deus ex
                    machina.</hi> Even the more definite and scientific theories of Erasmus Darwin,
                    Lamarck, Geoffroy, and Spencer fail adequately to establish in a sufficient
                    number of concrete cases the supposed potency of environment or function, much
                    less of internal or volitional moods, in determining extensive changes;
                    moreover, they are constantly confronted by cases in which any one set of
                    changes seems to take place independently of the other. Hence, despite the deep
                    and unanimous conviction of so many biological thinkers as to the origin of
                    species by evolution, the essential problem remained unsolved. For, until some
                    explanation, rational and concrete, detailed yet universal, of the origin of
                    species should be reached, the cautious naturalist could not feel justified in
                    accepting as a scientific certainty a doctrine which rested so largely upon
                    undemonstrable grounds. Any really new attempt at establishing the doctrine of
                    evolution had thus, not simply to reorganize and strengthen the empirical
                    evidence, by marshalling beside the generalizations of morphological unity of
                    type the facts of more strictly historic bearing,— distributional,
                    palaeontological, and embryological,—but also to meet this deeper theoretic want
                    by showing not only that evolution has taken place but how. Hence the importance
                    and rapid acceptance of the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> (1859), for
                    which the time was fully ripe. For it is evident from the preceding historical
                    outline that the view still frequently promulgated of the exclusive and, as it
                    were, catastrophic importance of this work in the establishment of the doctrine
                    of evolution must be replaced by a more uniformitarian and, so to speak, less
                    creationist view. It should not seriously be supposed that the theory of descent
                    which had been held in one form or another by the leading biological thinkers of
                    that and the two preceding generations, with almost the individual exception of
                    Cuvier, had been decisively abandoned by men of science, or that the public
                    which had purchased ten editions of the <hi rend="italic">Vestiges of
                    Creation</hi> in as many years, and which took up the first edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> on the day of publication, could be quite
                    unprepared for the acceptance of the major thesis of both works. Yet that a lull
                    had taken place is also unquestionable, for the failure of wave after wave of
                    speculative effort had produced a widespread feeling of discouragement, and a
                    tendency to concentration upon more concrete and smaller (for the most part
                    Linnaean or Cuvierean) problems alone, since of these the solution was
                    comparatively sure. The dramatic coincidence between Darwin’s and Wallace’s
                    conclusions<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Journ. and Proc. Linn. Soc.,</hi> 1858.</p></note> soon helped to
                    gain immediate attention to the new theory; and this was thoroughly developed
                    and retained by the prompt appearance of the first and second editions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species.</hi> Without entering upon a review of this
                    classic treatise, much less a retrospect of the controversy it provoked, it is
                    evident that it was upon almost all sides so much stronger than preceding
                    attempts, its central doctrine so lucid and obvious a statement of the everyday
                    facts of life, its mode of presentation so temperate yet so forcible, its
                    self-criticism so frank and unconcealed, that its marvellous success was owing
                    far more to intrinsic merit than favourable circumstances. The required
                    re-statement of the evidence for the historic fact of evolution was at last
                    learnedly and forcibly done, and the salient difficulties in its way, like that
                    of the imperfection of the geological record, admirably met; yet this portion of
                    the work sinks into comparative ineffectiveness beside the long-sought <hi
                    rend="italic">modal</hi> explanation of the process proffered in the theory of
                    natural selection, which was soon seen to throw a new and searching light upon
                    the smallest details of structure, function, and distribution,—in fact, to
                    afford the instrument of a new and systematic interpretation of organic nature.
                    Of this doctrine, then, a brief account is needed, and this may be best given by
                    following as closely as possible upon the lines of the <hi rend="italic">magnum
                    opus</hi> itself, although the full title of this— <hi rend="italic">The Origin
                    of Species by means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races
                    in the Struggle for Life—</hi> is its own best and briefest summary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theory of Natural Selection.</hi></p>
                <p>After mentioning that his first light upon the origin of species was derived from
                    his early distributional studies, Darwin points out that “a naturalist,
                    reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological
                    relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and such
                    other facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been
                    independently created, but had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0093-0078"/> descended like varieties from other species.
                    Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory
                    until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have
                    been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and co-adaptation
                    which justly excites our admiration.” Again, “It is therefore of the highest
                    importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and
                    co-adaptation. At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable
                    that a careful study of domesticated animals and cultivated plants would offer
                    the best chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been
                    disappointed: in this and all other perplexing cases I have invariably found
                    that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication
                    affords the best and safest clue.” Hence the first chapter is devoted to an
                    account of those extensive studies of variation under domestication which later
                    formed the subject of a separate work.</p>
                <p>A comparison between individuals of the same variety of cultivated plants or
                    animals shows a greater degree of variation than between individuals of any one
                    species or variety in nature. This higher variability of domestic productions is
                    to be ascribed to the less uniform conditions of their upbringing, perhaps in
                    part also to excess of food. Exposure to new conditions must be continued for
                    generations to set up any great variation; but this, once set up, continues
                    indefinitely. Changed conditions may directly influence the whole organization
                    or certain parts alone, or act indirectly through the reproductive system. With
                    respect to the direct action, the nature of the organization seems more
                    important than that of the conditions. The effect on offspring may be definite:
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> size may depend upon the amount of food, colour
                    upon quality of food, thickness of skin and hair upon climate, &amp;c. But
                    indefinite variability is a much commoner result of changed conditions, and has
                    probably played a much more important part in the formation of our domestic
                    races. The reproductive system is peculiarly sensitive to very slight external
                    changes. Many plants and animals will not reproduce in domestication, even
                    though individually vigorous; others, though weak and sickly, breed freely.
                    Hence we need not be surprised at the reproductive system acting irregularly and
                    producing variations. But that variation is not exclusively associated with
                    sexual reproduction is demonstrated by the case of plants “sporting” through
                    bud-variations. Such cases, moreover, prove the nature of the organism to be of
                    more importance than the conditions.</p>
                <p>Changed habits and use and disuse produce an inherited effect; witness the
                    lighter wing-and heavier leg-bones of the domestic duck, the enlarged udders of
                    milch-cows, or the drooping (unpricked) ears of domestic mammals. Variations are
                    often definitely correlated: short-beaked pigeons have small feet; hairless dogs
                    have imperfect teeth; and blue-eyed white tom-cats are deaf. Hence selection of
                    any one character will probably modify others indirectly. Although the laws
                    governing inheritance are mostly unknown, probably most, if not all, characters
                    tend to be inherited. The popular statement that domestic varieties, when they
                    run wild, revert to the primitive stock is unsupported by satisfactory evidence;
                    and, although reversions occasionally occur in domestication, there is no sign
                    of any general tendency to the loss of acquired characters. Except in being less
                    uniform than natural species, in often differing more widely in some single
                    part, and in being fertile when crossed, there are no well-marked distinctions
                    between our domestic races and the so-called true species of a genus. The many
                    breeds of dogs and cattle may arise from more than one species; but probably
                    those of horses and fowls, and clearly those of rabbits, ducks, and pigeons, are
                    each descended from a single species. In this respect the breeds of pigeons are
                    of peculiar importance, since not only carrier and tumbler, runt and barb,
                    pouter and fantail, but at least a score of varieties might be chosen which
                    differ so thoroughly, internally as well as externally, that an ornithologist,
                    treating them as wild birds, would be compelled to grant them specific, and even
                    distinct generic rank. Yet, since all these have indisputably arisen from the
                    wild rock-dove <hi rend="italic">(Columba liυia),</hi> it is clear that
                    naturalists who admit a unity to such domestic races, which professed breeders
                    have often laughed to scorn, should in turn be cautious before deriding the
                    unity of wild ones.</p>
                <p>How then have domestic races been produced? By external conditions or habits
                    alone? One of their most remarkable features is in exhibiting adaptation, not to
                    their own good, but to man’s use or fancy. We know that all the breeds were not
                    produced as perfect as we now see them, and the key is man’s power of
                    accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up,
                    making for himself useful breeds. Skilful breeders speak of the organization as
                    plastic and under control, and have effected extensive modifications within our
                    own generation. Unconscious selection, which results from every one trying to
                    possess and breed the best individuals, is even more important. This accumulated
                    change explains why we so often cannot recognize the wild parent stocks of our
                    cultivated plants, while its absence in countries inhabited by uncivilized man
                    explains why these never yield plants worth immediate culture. Man’s power of
                    selection is facilitated by keeping large numbers, in which variations are more
                    likely to occur. Facility in preventing crosses is also of importance, as of
                    pigeons as contrasted with cats; some species are, however, less variable than
                    others, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the goose.</p>
                <p>Individual differences arise even in the offspring of the same parents and tend
                    to be inherited; hence they afford material for natural selection to act on and
                    accumulate, precisely as they would for human selection. (Polymorphic genera—
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g., Rosa, Rubus, Hieracium,</hi> &amp;c.—may perhaps owe
                    their protean character to their variations being of no service or disservice,
                    and consequently not being acted on by natural selection. ) In determining
                    whether a form should be ranked as species or variety, the opinion of
                    naturalists of sound judgment and wide experience is the only guide, yet this
                    lacks unanimity (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Species)</hi>: for example, of the
                    polymorphic genera of the British flora alone Bentham reckons 112 species but
                    Babington 251. Wallace has shown that no certain criterion can possibly be given
                    by which to define his convenient working categories of Malayan <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi> &amp;c., viz., variable forms, local forms,
                    sub-species, and representative species. As De Candolle concluded from his
                    monograph on oaks (in which he shows at least two-thirds of his 300 species to
                    be provisional), “so long as a genus is imperfectly known and its species
                    founded upon a few specimens” they seem clearly limited; but, “just as we come
                    to know them better, intermediate forms flow in and doubts as to specific limits
                    augment.” The terms variety and species are thus arbitrarily applied to
                    indefinable groups of more or less closely similar individuals. Common species
                    that range wide and are much diffused are those which vary most. The species of
                    the larger genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the
                    smaller genera. The species of large genera present strong analogies with
                    varieties, which we can only understand if they originated as such.</p>
                <p>The term “struggle for existence” is used in a wide sense, including dependence
                    of one being upon another, and embracing (which is more important), not only the
                    life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. From the high
                    (geometrical) rate of increase of all organic beings (slow breeders only
                    requiring a few more years to people a whole district) struggle inevitably
                    follows, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the
                    individuals of a distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It
                    is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the entire animal and
                    vegetable kingdoms, for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food
                    and no prudential restraints from marriage. The checks to increase are most
                    obscure. Eggs or young animals generally suffer most, and plants, mostly as
                    seedlings, both from germinating on ground already occupied and from animals.
                    The amount of food, of course, gives the extreme limit of numbers, very
                    frequently, however, the attacks of enemies, as of game by vermin. Climate plays
                    an important part, and periodical seasons of extreme cold have destroyed as many
                    as four-fifths of the birds of an observed area. Epidemics, too, may occur. In
                    many a species a large stock of individuals is often essential to its
                    preservation. Complex and unexpected checks and relations exist between organic
                    beings which have to struggle together; witness the profound alteration of the
                    flora and fauna of a heath when planted with Scotch fir, these again being
                    wholly dependent upon the exclusion of cattle. But in several parts of the world
                    insects determine the existence of cattle. Again, red clover depends for
                    fertilization upon the humble-bees, these upon immunity from the attacks of
                    field-mice, and thus indirectly upon the numbers of cats; hence no bees, no
                    clover, and the more cats, the more clover! The struggle will almost invariably
                    be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent
                    the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers.
                    In the case of varieties of the same species the struggle will generally be
                    almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided (as in the
                    case of varieties of wheat or sweet pea, of the mountain-sheep or medicinal
                    leech). Similarly, the struggle between species of the same genus will generally
                    be more severe than between the species of distinct genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the replacement of the black rat by the brown or of the large
                    cockroach by the small. The structure of every being is related to that of all
                    the others with which it competes, from which it escapes, or on which it preys;
                    witness alike the teeth and talons of the tiger, or the legs and claws of the
                    parasite clinging to his hair. The albumen of a seedling favours its struggle
                    with plants already growing around it.</p>
                <p>How will this struggle for existence act in regard to variation? Can the
                    principle of selection, so potent in the hands of man, apply under nature? Most
                    efficiently; for, when we bear in mind the constant occurrence of variation,
                    with the strength of the hereditary tendency, also how infinitely close and
                    complex are the mutual relations of organic beings to each other and to their
                    physical conditions<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0094-0079"/> of life, and consequently what infinitely varied
                    diversities of structure might be of use to each being under changing conditions
                    of life, can it be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have
                    undoubtedly occurred, that other variations, useful in some way to each being in
                    the great and complex battle of life, should occur in the course of many
                    generations? And, if such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more
                    individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any
                    advantage, however slight, over others would have the best chance of surviving
                    and procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any
                    variation in the least degree injurious would be inevitably destroyed. This
                    preservation of favourable and this destruction of injurious variations are
                    called natural selection, or, less metaphorically, the survival of the fittest.
                    The probable course of natural selection may be understood from the case of a
                    country undergoing change of climate. The proportional numbers of its species
                    will be changed; some will probably become extinct; and these changes would
                    seriously affect the others. Immigration of new forms might occur, with further
                    serious disturbance, or, where this is impossible, we should have places in the
                    economy of nature which might be better filled up. In such cases slight
                    modifications which in any way favoured the individuals of any species, by
                    adapting them better to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved,
                    and natural selection would have free scope for the work of improvement.
                    Moreover, changed conditions increase variability. As man produces a great
                    result, what may not natural selection effect? The former acts only for his own
                    good, nature for that of the being itself; man on mere external characters,
                    nature on the whole machinery of life; man irregularly and imperfectly for a
                    short time, nature by accumulation during whole geological periods. Natural
                    selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, the slightest
                    variations, rejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are
                    good, silently and insensibly working, <hi rend="italic">whenever and wherever
                    opportunity offers,</hi> at the improvement of each organic being in relation to
                    its organic and inorganic conditions of life. It may operate on characters which
                    we are apt to consider of very trifling importance, and its accumulation of
                    small variations may set up unexpected correlative changes. It may modify the
                    <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> seed, or young as easily as the adult, the structure
                    of young to parent and of parent to young, and in social animals it will adapt

                    natural selection is next illustrated (1) by supposing the formation of swift
                    varieties of wolves, much as greyhounds have been developed by man; (2) by
                    reference to the excretion of nectar by flowers, its use to insects, the action
                    of these in carrying pollen, its advantage in intercrossing, and the resultant
                    modification and adaptation of flower and insect to each other through the
                    preservation of their advantageous variations. Circumstances favourable for the
                    production of new forms through natural selection are great variability, large
                    numbers of individuals, the complex effects of intercrossing, isolation in
                    confined areas (yet probably still more extension over continental ones,
                    especially if oscillating in level), and considerable lapse of time, although
                    this by itself must not be supposed to do anything (as if the forms of life were
                    undergoing change by some innate law), but merely to afford increased
                    opportunity for variation and environmental change. Extinction, to which rare
                    species are on the way, is caused by natural selection.</p>
                <p>The divergence of character brought about by artificial selection in domestic
                    breeds is efficiently paralleled in nature, since the more diversified the
                    offspring of each species, the more they will seize on diverse places in the
                    economy of nature, and so increase in numbers. The greatest amount of life can
                    be supported by great diversification of structure. This divergence of
                    character, with extinction of intermediate forms, explains the difficulties of
                    taxonomy, which are then discussed in detail with the aid of a diagram. This, of
                    course, takes the form of a genealogical tree, and suggests that of “the great
                    tree of life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the
                    earth and covers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful
                    ramifications.”</p>
                <p>The preceding summary of the classical statement of the doctrine of natural
                    selection should be supplemented by reference not only to the original work, to
                    the corroborative labours of its author, and to the able independent treatise
                    (<hi rend="italic">Natural Selection)</hi> of Wallace, but to the enormous mass
                    of exposition, argument, and illustration accumulated by subsequent writers,
                    commencing with Hooker and Asa Gray, Huxley and Haeckel, but soon becoming too
                    numerous even for mention. At the same time the history of the controversy which
                    has arisen out of that statement should also be treated, in so far as it has
                    kept within scientific bounds. The leading objections which have been brought
                    against natural selection, together with the replies to them, should all be
                    summarized, as, for instance, Fleeming Jenkin’s important criticism as to the

                    could not be done to the satisfaction of either party without far exceeding the

                    attempt up to 1872, the date of the final edition, with great candour and
                    fairness. The various constructive efforts to supplement the hypothesis of
                    natural selection by introducing additional factors of evolutionary change
                    should also be mentioned, headed of course by Darwin’s own accessory hypothesis
                    of sexual selection.</p>
                <p>We must not, however, leave natural selection without a fuller statement of its

                    Huxley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    grounds of his agnostic position (up to 1858) with respect to evolution as
                    promulgated by Lamarck, Chambers, and even Spencer: “Firstly, that up to that
                    time the evidence in favour of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and,
                    secondly, no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed,
                    which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena.” He then
                    goes on to say—</p>
                <p>“The suggestion that new species may result from the selective action of external
                    conditions upon the variations from their specific type which individuals
                    present—and which we call “spontaneous” because we are ignorant of their
                    causation—is as wholly unknown to the historian of scientific ideas as it was to
                    biological specialists before 1858. But that suggestion is the central idea of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species,</hi> and contains the quintessence of
                    Darwinism. . . . That which we were looking for, and could not find, was an
                    hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms which assumed the
                    operation of no causes but such as could be proved to be actually at work. We
                    wanted, not to pin our faith to that or any other speculation, but to get hold
                    of clear and definite conceptions which could be brought face to face with facts
                    and have their validity tested. The <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> provided us
                    with the working hypothesis we sought. . . . The facts of variability, of
                    struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions were notorious enough, but
                    none of us had suspected that the road to the heart of the species problem lay
                    through them till Darwin and Wallace dispelled the darkness, and the beacon-fire
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Origin</hi> guided the benighted. . . . The only
                    rational course for those who had no other object than the attainment of truth
                    was to accept “Darwinism” as a working hypothesis and see what could be made of
                    it. Either it would prove its capacity to elucidate the facts of organic life or
                    it would break down under the strain. . . . Whatever may be the ultimate fate of
                    the particular theory put forward by Darwin, I venture to affirm that, so far as
                    my knowledge goes, all the ingenuity and all the learning of hostile critics
                    have not enabled them to adduce a solitary fact of which it can be said, this is
                    irreconcilable with the Darwinian theory.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    struggle for existence and the certain geological fact that species do somehow
                    change; (2) from the analogy of change under domestication by man’s selection;
                    (3) and chiefly from this view connecting under an intelligible point of view a
                    host of facts.”</p>
                <p>Applying to natural selection the accepted tests of a good theory—(1) power of
                    explaining all phenomena and meeting all objections, (2) power of meeting new

                    for the most sceptical of critics to avoid ranking it very high, while to those
                    who regard it as triumphantly surviving this assay the “law of parsimony”
                    appears to preclude the necessity of seeking any further explanation of
                    evolution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Romanes, <hi

                <p>As no serious critic wholly denies the fact of a struggle for existence, nor even
                    a certain preponderance among the survivors in any given area of those best
                    fitted for the struggle, however much he may consider the importance of these
                    facts to have been overstrained in certain directions, we are fairly entitled at
                    the outset to regard natural selection, not only as provisionally superseding
                    earlier attempts at solving the problems of geological and geographical
                    distribution, but as adequately,—it might almost seem finally,—explaining them
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology, Distribution).</hi> This claim at any rate
                    must be allowed even by those who deny the importance of natural selection as a
                    substantial factor in evolution in the other sub-sciences of physiology and
                    morphology, and this not simply because it was as experts in distribution that
                    Darwin and Wallace themselves arrived at their hypothesis, nor because all
                    subsequent workers in that field of science have adopted it, but because no
                    valid objection, or even supplementary hypothesis, has ever, as regards this
                    important department of science, been so much as proposed. The survival of the
                    fittest, then, is unquestionably a <hi rend="italic">vera causa,</hi> and one of
                    no small importance in the study of nature (in fact, in undisputed possession of
                    at least one entire field), as also in the study of social life, from which both
                    Darwin and Wallace were directly inspired.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    selection is also undisputed; nor can some small scope for natural selection in
                    the formation of varieties of wild races be denied even by the most grudging of
                    critics who may be versed in the facts of natural history at all. But this
                    amounts to admitting that natural selection, already the undisputed explanation
                    of distributional changes, is at any rate a partial cause in structural and
                    functional ones; while older explanations of these facts, even if not melting
                    into merely abstractional ones, have not succeeded in gaining acceptance.</p>
                <p>At this point comes in with ponderous weight the conception by which Lyell had
                    for nearly thirty years been preparing the way for Darwin, that of
                    uniformitarianism in natural change. For, although it was perhaps almost as much
                    owing to the unfavourable opinion of Lyell as to the hostility of Cuvier that
                    the doctrine of Lamarck had fallen into such disesteem, and although Lyell
                    himself was accustomed “to keep the name of creation for a natural process which
                    he imagined to be incomprehensible,” he was, notwithstanding, as he claimed and
                    as Huxley frankly allows, “strongly disposed to account for the origination of
                    all past and present species of living things by natural causes,” and his
                    influence was, therefore, for Huxley, as no doubt for others, “perhaps more
                    potent than any other in keeping alive a sort of pious conviction that evolution
                    after all would turn out true.” For, given the principle of Lyell’s work,—“the
                    principle that the past must be explained by the present, unless good cause be
                    shown to the contrary, and the fact that, so far as our knowledge of the past
                    history of life on our globe goes, no other cause can be shown,”—it is evident
                    that “consistent uniformitarianism postulates evolution as much in the organic
                    as in the inorganic world. The origin of a new species by other than ordinary
                    agencies would be a vastly greater ‘ catastrophe ’ than any of those which Lyell
                    successfully eliminated from geological speculation.”</p>
                <p>Bearing in mind, then, the lesson of Lyell, that any efficient cause, even though
                    slow or at first sight trifling, can be shown, if acting steadily for vast
                    periods of time, to effect enormous results, the apparent difficulty of adding
                    up varietal differences to specific ones, these to generic, and these again to
                    still larger distinctions, becomes only the inevitable continuation of that
                    summation of individual into varietal differences which no one can deny to be
                    happening around us. Thus the <hi rend="italic">onus probandi</hi> that species
                    have not arisen in this way comes fairly to be thrown by the advocates of
                    natural selection upon its adversaries. And, as these come individually to
                    realize, through those concrete studies which necessarily underlie all active*
                    conviction on one side or the other, the importance of the masses of concrete
                    evidence which have been steadily accumulating, it is little wonder that their
                    majority should not only have so rapidly dwindled, but actually have changed
                    sides so generally as has been the case. Thus, to cite only a single case,—(1)
                    we are now in actual possession of an unbroken and geologically successive
                    series of fossil horses, perfectly gradated through some forty-five “species”
                    back to a five-toed ancestor; (2) we can trace the continued evolution of the
                    existing species in the bones, teeth, and finest peculiarities of the specimens
                    around us, as well as the increasing differentiation of well-marked varieties
                    through artificial selection; (3) we can see that such continuous improvement of
                    skeleton, teeth, &amp;c., as is now and has all along been in progress, must
                    have been profitable to the animals possessing them in the wild state, just as
                    they now are in the tame (since implying better locomotion, digestion, &amp;c.).
                    Hence we soon come to feel a real difficulty in understanding (1) how the
                    continuous summation of small individual advantages through varietal characters
                    into specific, and even generic ones, can be doubted, much less denied, and
                    consequently (2) how the general applicability of the theory of natural
                    selection to interpret the gradual process of historic change can any longer be
                    called in question.</p>
                <p>At this point it is right to notice that several evolutionists have suggested or
                    argued for the progress of variation along definite lines; but this return upon
                    preDarwinian standpoints has been energetically and, it must be admitted, on the
                    whole as yet successfully combated. Thus Asa Gray (1861-76) has argued for
                    variation along definite and useful lines. Nägeli (1865) regarded the
                    acquisition of certain characters which appear to be of no service to plants as
                    offering a difficulty to natural selection, and as affording a proof of some
                    innate tendency in plants towards perfection, corresponding to what Kölliker
                    entitles the “law of creation.” Mivart (1871) has maintained that variations are
                    definite, and frequently sudden and considerable. With such positions must also
                    be noticed the continuous and increasing insistence of Spencer (1852-86) upon
                    environmental action and functional change, although spontaneous variation is
                    not excluded nor considerable importance to natural selection denied. Butler in
                    England, and Cope, Hyatt, and other “Neo-Lamarckians” in America, have more
                    fully developed this reaction, for which experimental evidence has been
                    especially sought in Germany by Semper. And, while Darwin himself long continued
                    an uncompromising opponent of all such heresies, a distinct, though partial,
                    change of opinion was admitted by himself in later years, and has been fully
                    insisted upon both by Mivart and Spencer. While in the <hi rend="italic">Origin
                    of Species</hi> up to 1869 variations are spoken of as “accidental” (no doubt
                    only in that sense in which a scientific man may fairly use the word), and there
                    is ample proof of Darwin’s originally<pb break="no"

                    of his substantial rejection of the comparative importance of function or
                    environment in determining variations, these views are unquestionably modified
                    in the well-known peroration to the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species.</hi>
                    The further diminishing importance of natural selection is admitted in
                    subsequent editions, as Spencer has pointed out, in the preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Descent of Man,</hi> and indeed elsewhere; while a recent pungent
                    criticism<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Butler, <hi
                    rend="italic">Luck or Cunning,</hi> London, 1887, chap. xii.; see also his <hi

                    evidence of a certain measure of apparently contradictory and indefinite
                    fluctuation of opinion between increased insistence upon use and disuse on the
                    one hand and upon spontaneous variability on the other.</p>
                <p>Since, however, Darwin never developed the grounds of this diminishing reliance
                    upon natural selection, which still remains the central theme of his works, and
                    that upon which their originality, as well as their importance to the theory of
                    evolution, essentially depends (of course as distinguished from their services
                    in summing up the concrete evidence for the fact of evolution and their vast
                    utility in diffusing it), too much weight must not be attached to such isolated
                    expressions of opinion as those referred to above, the more so as these are
                    nowhere borne out by any general change in the tenor of his works. In the
                    absence of any theory of definite and progressive change, and in the presence of
                    multitudinous variations under domestication and in nature which we can neither
                    analyse, rationalize, nor hardly even classify, we are not only justified but
                    logically compelled to regard variation as spontaneous or indefinite, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> practically indeterminate in direction, and “therefore
                    Unimportant, except as the groundwork for selection to act on.” Conversely,
                    variation must be indefinite, else the paramount importance of natural selection
                    must be proportionally impaired as this becomes definite <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Evolution,</hi> vol. viii. p. 751); for we cannot
                    speak of selecting a course from one line of variation, nor even for that matter
                    in the old sense of “variation” at all. Thus, “if it should hereafter be shown
                    that variability is definite and determined in certain directions rather than
                    others” (in short “fated” rather than “spontaneous ”), “the importance of
                    natural selection would not be impaired,” since it would still have to be
                    regarded as a <hi rend="italic">vera causa</hi> in the history of species, yet
                    the function ascribed to it would be practically reversed. It would exchange its
                    former supremacy as the supposed determinant among the indefinite possibilities
                    of structure and function for that of simply accelerating, retarding, or
                    terminating the process of otherwise determined change. It would furnish the
                    brake rather than the steam or rails upon the journey of life; or, in other
                    words, instead of guiding the ramifications of the tree of life, it would, in
                    Mivart’s phrase, do little more than apply the pruning knife to them.<note

                    these two factors, there might not lie concealed in the organism some other
                    transforming power,” such as the “perfecting principle” of Nägeli or the like.
                    The results of these investigations have tended entirely to confirm the theory
                    of natural selection in its classic form; moreover, the same naturalist has

                    weakened the arguments of Spencer and others in favour of, the revival of the
                    Lamarckian factors of change. Variation seems therefore to be driven in more and
                    more upon the reproductive function, and thus an ultra-Darwinian insistence upon
                    the obscure and as yet wholly indefinite factor of variation is strongly forced
                    upon us, and natural selection seems more than ever to be our only possible
                    clue.</p>
                <p>Armed, however, with this, we have a consistent means of re-investigation of the
                    whole organic world, in the course of which, not only our existing
                    accumulations, as of taxonomy and of comparative anatomy, acquire a new
                    interest, and all existing lines of research receive a potent stimulus, but the
                    marvellous variety of adaptation comes into intelligibility and order,—a new
                    teleology thus replacing the old. Of this profound change in the standpoint and
                    interest of modern biology we can form an idea most simply, yet most
                    representatively, by glancing at Darwin’s own biological works. Before the <hi
                    rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> we have the slow and laborious production
                    of the substantial, yet conventional and comparatively arid, <hi rend="italic"

                    while afterwards the well-known and fascinating new series of zoological and
                    botanical discoveries and generalizations were poured out with remarkable
                    rapidity. The many bold and ingenious applications of the theory of natural
                    selection which we owe to Darwin and his school should here be reviewed

                <p>This passage from the inductive verification of the theory of natural selection
                    to its deductive application as an engine of research is conspicuously
                    associated with the labours of Haeckel, whose <hi rend="italic">Generelle

                    the first fruit and seed of the new movement in German biology, which was
                    henceforward almost completely Darwinian; and they have equally strong claims to
                    be considered as the starting-point of those logical and unflinching attempts to
                    view all problems in the light of natural selection which have since become more
                    common. By transcending the limits of ordinary biological specialism

                    primeval forms and with Wallace’s final <hi rend="italic">caveat</hi> as to the
                    origin of man, a thoroughly “monistic” view of biology and its kindred sciences
                    is obtained. The systematic exclusion of the traditional teleology and of that
                    operation of the consciousness of the organism assumed by Lamarck (since
                    indefinite structural variations cannot be associated with, much less developed
                    by, definite psychical ones, and still less by any permanent psychical bias or
                    character) also necessarily follows; and along with this goes the conception of
                    the operation of an extra-organismal mind. The struggle for existence is the
                    sole condition of human progress; and the conception of prevalent or predominant
                    altruism, as systematized by past philosophy and tradition, is thus an alloy of
                    sentimental illusion with baser elements. The doctrine of natural selection is
                    in this way fully developed into a substantially Neo-Lucretian philosophy, and,
                    in justice to the logical clearness of the author to whom we especially owe this
                    systematization, it must be admitted that those who grant his postulates,
                    without endorsing his conclusions, have in all cases either refrained from
                    continuing their development or fallen back upon the insertion of some <hi

                    arbitrary point.</p>
                <p>In the same way we have this view of all things in struggle applied to the
                    explanation of the internal structure and function of the organism itself. Once
                    more to quote Huxley,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    frank and uncompromising application of this doctrine to the interpretation of
                    nature and society will also be found in Huxley’s “Struggle for Existence,” in
                    <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century,</hi> February 1888.</p></note> “It is a
                    probable hypothesis that what the world is to organisms in general each organism
                    is to the molecules of which it is composed. Multitudes of these, having diverse
                    tendencies, are competing with one another for opportunity to exist and
                    multiply, and the organism as a whole is as much the product of the molecules
                    which are victorious as the fauna or flora of a country is the product of the
                    victorious organic beings in it.” This view has more recently been considerably
                    developed by Roux,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    and from its logical continuity with the major theory of which it is a corollary
                    is gaining widened acceptance.</p>
                <p>With regard to the destructive criticism of the old teleology, which has been led
                    by Haeckel, and aided or acquiesced in by other natural selectionists, it is
                    important to note that the obvious proposition has also repeatedly been urged
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> by Huxley and Weismann no less than by their
                    critics, such as Von Hartmann and Lotze), that, just in proportion as our
                    explanation of the origin of organic structures, functions, and adaptations
                    becomes increasingly mechanical, so does an increasingly rigorous teleological
                    view of this mechanism reappear. At most, therefore, we should have exchanged an
                    external and mechanical view of teleology for an (at least relatively) internal
                    and dynamical one.</p>
                <p>The later hypotheses accessory to natural selection can here be only very briefly
                    outlined. Partly in course of his inquiries into the descent of man, partly also
                    to account for many remarkable phenomena of sexual differentiation in animals
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sex),</hi> Darwin was led to develop the hypothesis of
                    sexual selection which he had already suggested in the <hi rend="italic">Origin
                    of Species.</hi> Not merely do individuals struggle for existence, but the males
                    struggle for the females; thus the more vigorous tend to obtain mates, and so
                    leave most progeny to repeat the struggle. Special weapons are used in the
                    struggle, both offensive, like the cock’s spurs or the stag’s horns, and
                    defensive, like the lion’s mane; and advantageous variations of these tend to be
                    accumulated. But, as the more beautiful or melodious males appear often to
                    obtain the preference of the females, there is also ground for the conception
                    that the aesthetic advantages frequent in the male sex have similarly been
                    acquired, the more so as we have common experience of how rapidly artificial
                    selection can accumulate superiorities of plumage or song. After the operation
                    of sexual selection has been traced as far as possible through the animal
                    kingdom, the doctrine is applied to man, with the conclusion “that of all the
                    causes which have led to the differences in external appearance between the
                    races of man, and to a certain extent between man and the lower animals, sexual
                    selection had been the most efficient.” Acceptance of this hypothesis has been
                    much less general than of natural selection. Criticism has been busy, and this
                    ranges from the serious yet partial dissent of Wallace to fundamental contrast,
                    such as is involved in the theory of the nature and origin of sex suggested in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Sex,</hi> which views the degree of development
                    of the external characters of sex as essentially the outward expression of a
                    proportional stage of the evolu tion of constitutional “maleness” or
                    “femaleness” (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> katabolic and anabolic diathesis
                    respectively).</p>
                <p>Under the title of “physiological selection” G. J. Romanes has lately proposed
                    “an additional suggestion as to the origin of species,” of which the more
                    critical than constructive essence may be briefly given in the author’s own
                    words: “As a theory of origin of species natural selection has in its way three
                    cardinal difficulties,—(1) the difference between species and varieties in
                    respect of mutual fertility, (2) the swamping effects of free intercrossing upon
                    an individual variation, (3) the inutility to species of so large a proportion
                    of specific distinctions. . . . Natural selection is not, properly speaking, a
                    theory of the origin of <hi rend="italic">species</hi>: it is a theory of the
                    origin— or rather of the cumulative development—of <hi rend="italic"
                    >adaptations.</hi> Whenever any variation in the highly variable reproductive
                    system occurs, tending to sterility with the parent form, without entailing
                    fertility with the varietal form, a physiological barrier must interpose,
                    dividing the species into two parts, free to develop distinct histories, without
                    mutual intercrossing, or by independent variation. By regarding mutually sterile
                    species as records of variation in reproductive systems, we are at work, so to
                    speak, on the foundation of the matter.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Even those who attach most importance to the doctrine of natural selection as
                    affording a rationale of the process of organic evolution will not seriously
                    dispute that, even were this explanation completely extended to all the details
                    of plant and animal life, another and deeper explanation would still be
                    necessary. That is, the theory of natural selection, being from the external
                    standpoint only —that of the adaptation of the organism to survive the pressures
                    of the environment—would all the more urgently stand in need of a complementary
                    internal explanation, which should elucidate the physiological process of change
                    through which the organism has actually been enabled to adapt itself. As a
                    recent writer tersely expresses it, “The survival of variations is a matter
                    secondary to their origin, and it is becoming realized more and more that this
                    is the point to be explained.” How, in short, do we get the variations without
                    which natural selection would have nothing on which to operate? Here we can no
                    longer remain satisfied with the merely general conception of variation as
                    essentially indefinite, with which we have become familiar as the postulate (p.
                    81) of the theory of natural selection,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi rend="italic">Variation under Domestication,</hi>
                    chap. xxi., conclusion.</p></note> but must add to it a retrospect of the
                    theories of earlier authors such as has been already outlined,—(<hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>) a summary and discussion of the extensive labours of
                    Darwin upon the problems of variation from which this conception of
                    indefiniteness was generalized, followed by (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) an
                    account of subsequent progress. Unfortunately the voluminousness of this
                    literature makes such a task practically impossible: instead of the enormous
                    wealth of concrete details accumulated with respect to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication,</hi> a reference to the
                    volumes under that title must almost suffice. Some acquaintance with this work
                    is, of course, necessary adequately to appreciate the force of its author’s
                    general conclusions; these may, however, be briefly outlined from the chapter of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species</hi> (chap. v.) devoted to the laws of
                    variation, and from those (xxii.-xxvi.) of the larger work which contain an
                    ample yet similar discussion.</p>
                <p>“Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out of a
                    hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part has varied.”
                    Changed conditions generally induce mere fluctuating variability in individuals,
                    yet sometimes <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0098-0083"/> direct and definite effects upon the mass. The
                    facts and considerations for and against the belief that the conditions of
                    existence act in a potent manner in causing definite modifications of structure
                    are confronted in detail. In some few instances a marked effect has been rapidly
                    produced, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on European men in the United States,
                    European dogs in India, horses in the Falkland Islands, oysters in the
                    Mediterranean, &amp;c. The chemical compounds of some plants and the state of
                    their tissues are readily affected by changed conditions. The production of
                    galls, &amp;c., shows how great changes in structure and colour may result from
                    chemical changes. We almost certainly know that organic beings in a state of
                    nature may be modified in various definite ways by the conditions to which they
                    have been long exposed; but it is difficult to distinguish between the definite
                    result of changed conditions and the accumulation through natural selection of
                    indefinite variations which have proved serviceable. But, even granting the
                    utmost weight to conditions, we can rarely see the precise relation between
                    cause and effect. Moreover, many animals and plants of wide range and great
                    diversity of experience yet remain uniform in character. Again, the degree to
                    which domesticated birds, &amp;c., have varied does not stand in any close
                    relation to the amount of change to which they have been subjected. In fact, we
                    may have similar modifications under different conditions, different
                    modifications under similar change of conditions, or no modifications at all.
                    Closely parallel varieties are often produced from distinct races or even
                    species without ascertainable unity of conditions. Bird-variations, too, seem
                    conspicuously independent of circumstances. All these considerations tend to
                    force on our minds the conviction that what we call the external conditions of
                    life are in many cases quite insignificant in comparison with the organization
                    or constitution of the being which varies. No doubt each variation may have its
                    efficient cause, but it is as hopeless to search for the cause of each as to say
                    why a chill or a poison affects one man differently from another. With respect
                    to acclimatization, although habit does something towards the success of the
                    process, yet the appearance of constitutionally different individuals is a far
                    more effective agent.</p>
                <p>Increased use adds to the size of muscles, together with the blood-vessels,
                    nerves, bony crests of origin, and even the whole bones; it also increases
                    glands and strengthens sense-organs. Increased and intermittent pressure
                    thickens the epidermis; change of food modifies the coats of the stomach and
                    alters the length of the intestine. Disuse weakens and diminishes all parts of
                    the organization,—lungs and chest, wings and their associated bones, &amp;c.
                    Although in domesticated animals this never goes so far that a mere rudiment is
                    left, it seems often to have occurred in nature, the effects of disuse being
                    aided by economy of growth with intercrossing. Changed habits may lead to use or
                    disuse of organs, and consequently to their modification; yet the effects of
                    habit, use, and disuse have often been largely combined with the natural
                    selection of innate variations and sometimes overmastered by it.</p>
                <p>Correlated variation means that the whole organization is so tied together during
                    its growth and development that, when slight variations in any part occur, and
                    are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified,
                    apparently irrespective of advantage in the change. Variations of structure in
                    the young often affect those of the mature animal; the influence of hard parts,
                    mechanical pressure, the relative position of parts, and the size of the whole
                    body all have important influences. Homologous tissues may exhibit associated
                    variations, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> hoofs, hair, and teeth. In most cases
                    the correlation is, however, quite obscure, and may seem to be of no utility to
                    the species, as with various monstrosities and diseases. Colour may be
                    associated with other constitutional peculiarities. Although correlation is of
                    much importance, we may also falsely attribute to it structures which are simply
                    due to inheritance or natural selection, or its effects may be inextricably
                    commingled with those of increased use and of accumulation by natural selection,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the gigantic horns of the Irish elk with the
                    changes necessarily associated with the acquirement of them.</p>
                <p>Homologous and multiple parts are peculiarly variable, and often tend to cohere.
                    Rudimentary and lowly organized structures are variable. The law of compensation
                    of Goethe and Geoffroy, “that in order to spend on one side nature is forced to
                    economize on the other,” holds true to a certain extent with domestic
                    production, but more doubtfully in nature.</p>
                <p>Mechanical pressure and relative position of parts seem to be of some importance
                    in determining variations; but such changes are often due to reversion to
                    long-lost characters, which may frequently occur. A part extraordinarily
                    developed in any species tends to be highly variable. Specific characters are
                    more variable than generic characters. Distinct species present analogous
                    variations; but this may arise either from analogous constitution or from
                    reversion. Secondary sexual characters are highly variable. “Whatever the cause
                    may be of each slight difference between the offspring and their parents—and a
                    cause for each must exist—we have reason to believe that it is the steady
                    accumulation of beneficial differences which has given rise to all the more
                    important modifications of structure in relation to the habits of each
                    species.”</p>
                <p>The preceding outline of Darwin’s main positions (which are in harmony with his
                    essential doctrine of indefinite variability) prepares us for the discussion of
                    more recent research and opinion. But for our present concrete knowledge of the
                    influence of environment, use and disuse, including all such researches as those

                    undigested, essays of Cope<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1887.</p></note> are especially prominent. The views of Nägeli, Mivart, and
                    other advocates of internal variation here present themselves anew, along with
                    the criticisms and replies to them, as also Weismann’s doctrine of variability
                    as being ultimately germinal. But space precludes the survey of this voluminous
                    and unfinished controversy, which, moreover, would not at present yield any
                    general result, since neither the various inductive and deductive arguments, nor
                    the organismal, functional, &amp;c., and environmental explanations which these
                    variously favour, have been as yet exhaustively stated, still less properly
                    confronted, and least of all reconciled, by any author.</p>
                <p>It may be more profitable to attempt, though necessarily in barest outline, a
                    fresh re-examination of the entire field. This may be most appropriately
                    introduced, and the initial conception of the present part of the discussion
                    re-stated, by a passage from Weismann, whose substantial acceptance of the
                    doctrine of natural selection has already been noticed (p. 81). “We certainly
                    cannot remain at the purely empirical conception of variability and heredity as
                    laid down by Darwin in his admirable work. If the theory of selection is to
                    furnish a method of mechanical explanation, it is essential that its factors
                    should be formulated in a precise mechanical sense. But, as soon as we attempt
                    to do this, it is seen that, in the first enthusiasm over the newly discovered
                    principle of selection, the one factor of transformation contained in this
                    principle has been unduly pushed into the background to make way for the other
                    more apparent and better known factors. The first indispensable factor, and
                    perhaps the most important in any case, in every transformation is the physical
                    nature of the organism itself.” Let us briefly summarize, therefore, the main
                    results of a fresh survey of the leading variations presented by plants and
                    animals, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> no longer commencing with the analogy of
                    human selection upon the smallest varietal and specific distinctions, and
                    arguing on Lyell’s principle for the cumulative origin of the characters of
                    larger groups, but considering these larger differences from the standpoint of
                    general physiology, without any hypothesis at all.</p>
                <p>The physiological principle invoked is simply that antithesis between
                    reproductive functions and individual ones which has been familiar since the
                    dawn of physiology, and which, when reduced to its physical terms, is obviously
                    deducible from the principle of conservation of energy. Instead of the generally
                    received doctrine, summarized above, that of indefinite variation, with progress
                    by means of struggle for existence among individuals, its systematic application
                    furnishes a detailed re-interpretation of the forms presented by plants and
                    animals comparable to that afforded by the received hypothesis, but with an
                    essentially altered view of the process and factors of organic evolution as a
                    whole. Briefly stated, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0099-0084"/> the view of evolution thus reached is that of
                    definite variation, with progress essentially through the subordination of
                    individual struggle and development to species-maintaining ends.</p>
                <p>Let us commence with the origin of the flower, which all botanists agree in
                    regarding as a shortened branch. The apparent explanation of natural selection
                    (from two other alternatives, one lengthened, the other unshortened), although
                    morphologically reasonable, is at once excluded by the physiological one of <hi
                    rend="italic">inevitable</hi> shortening, since the expense of the reproductive
                    functions necessarily checks the vegetative ones, and since we cannot speak of
                    <hi rend="italic">selection</hi> where the imaginable alternatives are
                    physically impossible. Similarly, the shortening of the inflorescence from
                    raceme to spike or flower-head, or its hollowing into a fig, with the
                    corresponding reduction in the size of the flowers, receives the same
                    explanation—growth of axis and of appendages checked by reproduction—superseding
                    that current, viz., by mere convenient adaptation to fertilization by insects.
                    The internal structure of the flower is similarly modified, as may be shown in
                    detail in the passage from hypogyny through perigyny to epigyny (these being
                    simply stages of the progressive arrest of the growth of the axis), in the
                    reduction of the floral envelopes and stamens and the number of carpels and
                    ovules, and even in the transition from perispermic to endospermic and finally
                    exalbuminous seeds. But these are the most important of floral variations, and
                    furnish the essentially distinguishing characters of the natural orders; hence,
                    when these are seen, instead of being indefinite, to be parallel and definite
                    (<hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> determined through the continuous checking of
                    vegetation by reproduction along what is thus a single and definite groove of
                    progressive change), the importance of natural selection changes wholly from
                    that of selecting and accumulating supposed indefinite variations to that of
                    retarding definite ones after the stage of maximum utility has been
                    independently reached. The same simple conception unlocks innumerable problems
                    of floral morphology, large and small alike: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> it
                    interprets with equal ease the inevitable development of gymnosperm into
                    angiosperm (by continuous subordination of the reproductive carpellary leaf) and
                    the origin of refined minor adaptations, like the splitting fruit of the
                    geranium or the cupped stigma of the pansy, not as achievements of natural
                    selection from among fortuitous variations, but as naturally traceable to the
                    checked vegetation of their respective types of leaf organ, just as in the
                    familiar case of the pinnately-lobed outer sepals of the rose bud. The origin of
                    floral colour as primarily an inevitable consequence of the same principle of
                    vegetative subordination through reproductive preponderance was long ago pointed
                    out by Spencer, who unfortunately, however, also accepted without scrutiny the
                    orthodox hypothesis that this incipient floral colour would revert to the
                    ordinary green vegetation but for the accident of its attractiveness to insects,
                    and consequently must have owed its accumulation simply to the repeated
                    preservation of the offspring of the accidentally brightest coloured; whereas we
                    now see that the arrest of vegetative greenness in the flower and the exclusive
                    appearance of those colouring matters associated with the imperfect vegetation
                    of spring and autumn are a continuous process of its subordination as a
                    vegetative, and its development as a reproductive, apparatus. Adaptation to
                    insects thus takes a quite secondary place; similarly with the leafy arrest and
                    floral coloration of bracts; while a detailed examination of thorny plants
                    practically excludes the hypothesis of mammalian selection altogether, and shows
                    spines to arise as an expression of the diminishing vegetativeness—in fact the
                    ebbing vitality—of a shoot or even of an entire species. Evergreens tend to
                    arise in all orders among the forms of more vegetative habit, and in such forms
                    the amount of flowering is usually diminished relatively to the deciduous
                    members of the same group, whilst such constitutional vegetativeness checks the
                    progress of floral evolution. Hence it is that evergreens, and even orders in
                    which they largely occur, are usually less differentiated than their deciduous
                    congeners. The apparently indefinite variations presented by domesticated
                    plants, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the cabbage tribe, are at once classified
                    and interpreted as so many stages along the same course (from leafy kale,
                    through Brussels sprouts with many leaf buds, to cabbage with apical flower bud,
                    and finally to cauliflower). The importance of this line of evidence for the
                    Darwinian view of variation and selection becomes still further reduced,
                    although also broadly settled, when we note that, since the subordination of
                    vegetative to reproductive preponderance gave us the origin of ordinal
                    characters, the converse improvement of individual characters at the expense of
                    reproductive ones (on which domestication usually insists and artificial
                    selection depends) can only give us minor ones, for the most part varietal or
                    specific, if so much. The Lyellian analogy for the ultimate accumulation of
                    varietal differences into ordinal characters has thus been misleading. The
                    preceding transition of both organography and physiology from empirical to
                    rational carries with it a similar transition from empirical to rational
                    taxonomy as well: the antagonism of vegetative and reproductive habit is seen to
                    be also general and constitutional. Just as the liliaceous type ranges on one
                    side towards the characteristically vegetative grass or reproductive orchid, so
                    is it with the main variations of every natural alliance, be this order, genus,
                    or even species. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Ranunculaceae</hi> have their grassy
                    and their orchid-like types in meadow-rue and larkspur, yet the species of these
                    very genera show examples of the opposite swing of variation; again, the two
                    species or varieties of British oak <hi rend="italic">{Q. pedunculata</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Q. sessiliflora)</hi> are thus, so to speak, the incipient
                    grass and orchid forms of their common ancestor <hi rend="italic">{Q.
                    Robur).</hi> What we call higher or lower species or orders are thus the leaders
                    or the laggards along one or other of these two lines of variation, the
                    representatives of some stage of the predominance on one side or other of that
                    oscillating balance between vegetative and reproductive processes which have
                    long been known as the essential functions of organic life.</p>
                <p>The results of a similar survey of the animal world, despite the greater
                    intricacy of the problem, are scarcely less definite or comprehensive, and at
                    once lead to a deeper interpretation of the whole. Commencing with an ascending
                    survey, we recognize such essential types of <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> as
                    the rhizopods, gregarines, and infusors, not as the empirically selected
                    products of spontaneous variation among indefinite possibilities, but simply as
                    the predominatingly amoeboid, encysted, and motile phases of the primeval
                    cell-cycle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Morphology),</hi> these three forms of
                    which are fixed by the properties of protoplasm itself (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sex,</hi> vol. xxi. pp. 720-724), each particular phase being fixed by the
                    constitutional bias (diathesis) of its type towards anabolism or katabolism (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology, Protoplasm).</hi> This rationale of variation
                    in ultimate terms, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> both cellular and protoplasmic,
                    both morphological and physiological, may be continued through all fields, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> embryological or pathological, for some diseases are
                    coming to be interpreted as the progressive variation of some function and organ
                    which only disturbs the general balance in its progress towards a new and higher
                    equilibrium.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Sutton, <hi rend="italic">General Pathology,</hi> London,
                    1886.</p></note> This conception of physiological as well as merely structural
                    life-history rationalizes both animal and vegetable taxonomy. Thus the greatest
                    of all steps in morphological progress, that from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protozoa</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Metazoa,</hi> is not due to the
                    selection of the more individuated and highly adapted forms, but to the union of
                    relatively unindividuated cells into an aggregate in which each becomes
                    diminishingly competitive and increasingly subordinated to the social whole.
                    Passing to trifling variations, such as the internal deposition of spicules, we
                    interpret these neither as mere accidents, nor as pure advantages for support or
                    defence, but as arising like plant-crystals or gouty deposits as unremoved waste
                    products, accumulating with local or constitutional passivity. How the
                    inevitable constitutional preponderance of anabolism or katabolism excludes
                    spontaneous variation and subordinates external selection in the formation of
                    types would become clear could we pass in review the animal kingdom, and note
                    how its various alliances all range from passive to more active forms. We should
                    compare the coral or sponge at one end of the scale with the similarly passive
                    (and consequently also skeletal) tortoise and glyptodon at the other. We should
                    read in their anabolic diathesis the secret of accumulating size and of
                    inevitable extinction (nay, even unravel the apparent contradictions with
                    respect to the influence of the environment, as being specially strong upon the
                    passive types, which hence are far richer in species than the corresponding less
                    readily influenced active forms).</p>
                <p>Finally, the preponderating importance of the species-maintaining over the
                    individual functions should again be noted in animals as in plants, since the
                    conviction thus becomes inevitable that, in stating the process of evolution
                    essentially in terms of the survival of the fittest in competition, the centre
                    of gravity of the subject has been misplaced. The constant primary insistence
                    upon individual competition for food, and the very subordinate recognition of
                    the importance of sexual and social co-operation for well-being, which are
                    characteristic of the prevalent theory (witness their proportion in the
                    preceding summary), are traceable at once to the confusion of putting the
                    nutritive factors “in the first place” because they precede the reproductive in
                    time; whereas the organism inevitably enters upon reproduction and so cedes the
                    preponderance—“the first place” —to the other-regarding functions. That increase
                    of reproductive sacrifice which at once makes the mammal and marks its essential
                    stages of further progress (monotreme, marsupial, placental), that increase of
                    parental care, that frequent appearance of sociality and co-operation which even
                    in its rudest forms so surely secures the success of the species attaining it,
                    be it mammal or bird, insect or even worm,—all these phenomena of survival of
                    the truly fittest, through love, sacrifice, and co-operation—need far other
                    prominence than they could possibly receive on the hypothesis of the essential
                    progress of the species through internecine struggle of its individuals at the
                    margin of subsistence. Yet these cases are only the supreme outcomes of that
                    continuous and definite process of variation through individual subordination
                    and species-maintaining preponderance which we have seen modelling even the

                <p>In short, while no more denying the existence of competition in nature than the
                    fact of organic progress, we deny the assumed relation of these as cause and
                    effect, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0100-0085"/> and propose an interpretation in essential
                    respects directly converse, without denying the minor agency of use and disuse,
                    environment, &amp;c. Each of the greater steps of progress is definitely
                    associated with an increased measure of subordination of individual competition
                    to reproductive or social ends, and of interspecific competition to co-operative
                    adaptation. The ideal of evolution is thus an Eden; and, although competition
                    can never be wholly eliminated, and progress must thus be asymptotic, it is much
                    for our pure natural history to see no longer struggle, but love, as “creation’s
                    final law.” While ceasing to speak of indefinite variation, we may of course
                    still conveniently retain the rest of the established phraseology, and continue
                    to speak of “natural selection” and of “survival of the fittest,” always
                    provided that, in passing from the explanation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >distributional</hi> survival of individuals or species in contest within a
                    given area to the interpretation of the main line of their morphological and
                    physiological progress, we make the transition from the self-regarding to the
                    other-regarding (in ethical language, from the egoistic to the altruistic) sense
                    of these terms which has above been outlined.<note anchored="true"

                <p>It would be premature to enter upon the extended or deductive application of
                    these considerations, since, pending their acceptance, the preceding statement
                    of the received doctrine of natural selection from spontaneous variations, with
                    all its logical consequences (pp. 81-82), remains valid. Conversely, it is of
                    course obvious that their adoption would involve the extensive modification of
                    the received doctrine, as well as the complementing of new constructive attempts
                    by a re-examination of earlier views of both the process and the philosophy of
                    evolution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geddes, “A
