                    He had been an officer of the guard under Julian and Jovian, and had risen high
                    in the imperial service. With a fine robust frame, he possessed great courage
                    and great military capacity. He was chosen emperor in his forty-third year by
                    the officers of the army at Nicaea in Bithynia early in 364, and shortly
                    afterwards named his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Valens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.υ.)</hi> colleague with him in the empire.</p>
                <p>The two brothers, after passing through the chief cities of the neighbouring
                    district, arranged the partition of the empire at Naissus (Nissa) in Upper
                    Moesia. As emperor of the West, Valentinian took Italy, Illyricum, Spain, the
                    Gauls, Britain, and Africa, leaving to Valens the eastern half of the Balkan
                    Peninsula, Greece, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor as far as Persia. During the
                    short reign of Valentinian there were wars in Africa, in Germany, and in
                    Britain, and Rome came into collision with barbarian peoples of whom we now hear
                    for the first time,—Burgundians, Saxons, Alemanni. The emperor’s chief work was
                    guarding the frontiers and establishing military positions. Milan was at first
                    his headquarters for settling the affairs of northern Italy; next year (365) he
                    was at Paris, and then at Rheims, to direct the operations of his generals
                    against the Alemanni. This people were driven back to the German bank of the
                    Rhine, and checked for a while by a chain of military posts and fortresses,
                    though at the close of 367 they swooped down on Moguntiacum (Mainz) and
                    plundered the city. In that same year Valentinian was at Amiens, and there,
                    before his assembled troops, he gave the title of Augustus to his son Gratian,
                    eight years of age. The next three years he spent at Treves, organizing the
                    defence of the Rhine frontier against the Alemanni and Saxons, and personally
                    superintending the construction of numerous forts. Treves was, in fact, his
                    headquarters during most of his reign. His general administration seems to have
                    been thoroughly honest and able, in some respects beneficent. If he was hard and
                    exacting in the matter of taxes, he spent them in the defence and improvement of
                    his dominions, not in idle show or luxury. Though himself a plain and almost
                    illiterate soldier, he was a founder of schools, and he also provided medical
                    attendance for the poor of Rome, by appointing a physician for each of the
                    fourteen districts of the city. He was a Christian, an orthodox Catholic, and in
                    his life perfectly pure; but he permitted absolute religious freedom to all his
                    subjects. Against all abuses, both civil and ecclesiastical, he steadily set his
                    face, even against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy.
                    Valentinian was in many ways a good and able ruler at a particularly difficult
                    time. The great blot on his memory is his cruelty, which at times was frightful,
                    and showed itself in its full fierceness in the punishment of persons accused of
                    witchcraft, soothsaying, or magical practices. In 374 the Quadi, a German tribe
                    in what is now Moravia and Hungary, resenting the erection of Roman forts to the
                    north of the Danube in what they considered to be their own territory, crossed
                    the river and laid waste the province of Pannonia, Valentinian’s native land.
                    The emperor in the April of the following year entered Illyricum with a powerful
                    army, and gave audience to an embassy from the Quadi at Bregetio on the Danube,
                    somewhere near Pressburg. Their defence threw him into a paroxysm of rage, in
                    which he suddenly fell down, apparently in a fit of apoplexy, and died in a few
                    hours. His two sons, Gratian and Valentinian II., were jointly his
                    successors.</p>
