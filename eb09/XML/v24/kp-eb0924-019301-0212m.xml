                    laborious process; thus it became the custom for each village to maintain a
                    constant fire for the general use of the community, in order to avoid the
                    troublesome necessity of obtaining a spark by friction in case of the accidental
                    extinction at one time of all the village fires.<note anchored="true"

                    races.</p></note> This fire, the central hearth or Ғ <hi rend="italic"
                    >εστία</hi> of the village (<hi rend="italic">focus publicus),</hi> became a
                    sacred symbol of home and family life, and by degrees grew into a religious cult
                    of great sanctity and importance. The form of the primitive house in which the
                    fire was preserved, probably a round hut made of wattled osiers daubed with
                    clay, appears to have survived both in the circular prytaneum of the Greeks and
                    in the Aedes Vestae in Rome. To watch this fire would naturally be the duty of
                    women, and especially of those who were not burdened with the cares of
                    maternity, and hence may have arisen the Roman order of virgin priestesses,
                    whose chief duty it was to tend the sacred fire. A survival of the prehistoric
                    method of getting a spark appears to have existed in the rule which enacted
                    that, if ever the sacred fire of Vesta did go out, the negligent vestal was to
                    be punished by scourging (Livy, xxviii. 11), and the fire rekindled either by
                    friction of dry sticks<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>An allusion to the earliest method of obtaining fire by rubbing two sticks
                    together is probably contained in the myth of Prometheus, who brought fire to

                    rays brought to a focus by a concave mirror (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Numa,</hi>
                    9). In the prytaneum, which existed in every Greek state, a different form of
                    cult was developed, though the essential point, the sacred fire, was kept up,
                    just as in the Latin worship of Vesta; and in both cases the fire was
                    extinguished annually at the beginning of the new year, and solemnly rekindled
                    by one of the primitive and hence sacred methods.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fire obtained in this way, that is “pure
                    elemental fire,” was commonly thought to possess a special sanctity. Even
                    throughout the Middle Ages in Catholic countries, at Easter, when the new year
                    began, the old pagan rite still survived. On Holy Saturday all lamps in each
                    church were extinguished, and the Paschal candlestick was lighted by the help of
                    flint and steel. From this sacred source the other lights in the church were
                    kindled, and the various households in the parish took a flame to relight their
                    fires and lamps, all of which had been carefully extinguished
                    beforehand.</p></note> In Rome this was done on the first day of March, the
                    Latin New Year’s Day (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> iii. 137-145). Both
                    among Greek and early Latin races, at the founding of a new colony fire was
                    solemnly sent from the prytaneum or Vesta temple of the mother colony to kindle
                    a similar sacred fire in the new settlement. Thus we find that, according to
                    tradition, the worship of Vesta in Rome was introduced from Alba Longa (Liv., i.
                    20, and Ov., <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> iii. 46), which appears to have been
                    the oldest of the Latin colonies in Latium. This intimate connexion between the
                    Greek prytaneum fire, sacred to Hestia, and that of Vesta in Rome has been ably
                    worked out by Mr J. G. Frazer in the paper quoted above. The most generally
                    received Latin legend attributes the founding of the Roman temple of Vesta to
                    Numa, who transferred the centre of the cult from Alba, together with the four
                    vestal virgins, its priestesses (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Numa,</hi> 10). One of
                    the later kings, either Tarquin I. or Servius Tullius, is said to have increased
                    the number to six (Dion. Hal., iii. 67, and Plut., <hi rend="italic">Numa,</hi>
                    10), and it is not till the last years of the pagan period that we hear of a
                    seventh vestal having been added (see Ambrose, <hi rend="italic">Epis.,</hi> ed.
                    Pareus, p. 477; also Plut., <hi rend="italic">Rom.</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The election <hi rend="italic">(captio)</hi> of the vestal during the early
                    period of Rome was in the hands of the king, and in those of the pontifex

                    i. 12);—(1) the candidate was to be more than six and less than ten years of

                    election were arranged subject to the provisions of the Lex Papia, now unknown.
                    The selected child had her hair cut off, and was solemnly admitted by the
                    pontifex maximus, who held her by the hand, and, addressing her by the name <hi
                    rend="italic">amata,</hi> pronounced an ancient formula of initiation, which is
                    given by A. Gellius in his interesting chapter on the subject (i. 12). In early
                    times there were certain rules by which girls could be excused from serving as
                    vestals, but the honour soon became so eagerly sought that these provisions were
                    practically useless. Vows were taken by the vestal for a limited period of
                    thirty years, after which she was free to return to private life and even to
                    marry— a thing very rarely done (Aul. Gell., vi. 7). This period of thirty years
                    was divided into three decades: during the first the vestal learnt her duties;
                    during the second she practised them; and during the third she instructed the
                    young vestals. The special dignity of chief of the vestals, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >virgo vestalis maxima,</hi> was reached in order of seniority. The inscriptions
                    on the pedestals of statues of various <hi rend="italic">vestales maximae</hi>
                    show that a number of different grades of honour were passed through before

                    The duties of the vestals, besides the chief one of tending the holy fire (Cic.,
                    <hi rend="italic">De Leg.,</hi> ii. 8), consisted in the daily bringing of water
                    from the sacred spring of Egeria, near the Porta Capena, to be used for the
                    ceremonial sweeping and sprinkling of the Aedes Vestae.<note anchored="true"

                    Other natural springs might be used for the daily sprinkling, but it was
                    forbidden to use water brought in a pipe or other artificial conduit (Tac., <hi

                    poured on the altar of sacred fire libations of wine and oil, as is represented
                    on the reverses of several first brasses and medallions of the empire (see fig.
                    1). The vestals were bound to offer daily prayers for the welfare of the Roman
                    state, and more especially in times of danger or calamity (Cic., <hi
                    rend="italic">Pro Font.,</hi> 21). They were also the guardians of the seven
                    sacred objects on which the stability of the Roman power was supposed to
                    depend:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Cancellieri,

                    Pallas, which was said to have been brought by Aeneas from the burning <pb

                    profane eyes, but it is represented on the reverse of a coin struck by Antoninus
                    Pius in honour of his deified wife Faustina</p>
                <p>(see fig. 1). Strict observance of the vow of chastity was one of the chief
                    obligations of the vestals, and its breach was horribly punished by burial alive
                    at a place near the Porta Collina known as the Campus Sceleratus (see Livy,
                    viii. 15 and 89; Plin., <hi rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> iv. 11; and Suet., <hi
                    rend="italic">Dom.,</hi> 8). Cases of unchastity and its punishment were rare;
                    and, as the evidence against the vestal was usually that of slaves, given under
                    torture, it is probable that in many instances an innocent vestal suffered this
                    cruel death. The case described by the younger Pliny (<hi rend="italic">sup.
                    cit.)</hi> is one of special pathos, as the vestal appears to have been
                    condemned without any sufficient evidence, simply at the wish of the emperor
                    Domitian. A fanciful reason for this fearful punishment is given by Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fast,</hi> vi. 459-460.</p>
                <p>The privileges of the vestals and their influential position were very
                    remarkable. They were exempt from any <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi>
                    except that of the pontifex maximus, their religious father; they could dispose
                    by will of their property, and were in most respects not subject to the Roman
                    laws (“legibus non tenetur,” Servius, on Virg., <hi rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> xi.
                    204; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Gaius, i. 130, and Dion Cass., lvi. 10). This
                    involved freedom from taxes, and the right to drive through the streets of Rome
                    in carriages <hi rend="italic">{plostrum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">currus
                    arcuatus).</hi> Some bronze plates have been found which were once attached to
                    the carriages of vestals; the inscription on one of them runs thus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Flaviae Publiciae v.v. maximae inmunis in jugo</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="italic">C. I. L.,</hi> vi. 2146-2148; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> also
                    Pruden., <hi rend="italic">Contr. Symm.,</hi> ii. 1088). They were preceded by a
                    lictor when appearing on state occasions, and enjoyed other semi-royal honours
                    (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Numa,</hi> 10, and Dion Cass., xlvii. 19). At theatres
                    and other places of amusement they enjoyed the best seats, except at some of the
                    nude athletic contests, from which they were excluded; they also took an
                    important part in all the grand religious and state ceremonies, such as when the
                    pontifex maximus offered sacrifice on the occasion of a triumph before the
                    temple of Capitoline Jupiter. They had power to pardon any criminal they met in
                    the street on his way to execution, provided that the meeting were accidental.
                    The vestals alone shared with the emperors the privilege of intramural burial
                    (Serv., <hi rend="italic">Ad Aen.,</hi> xi. 206). During life they were richly
                    dowered by the state (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi> 31) and had public
                    slaves appointed to serve them (see Tac., <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> i. 43).
                    They were also the guardians of the emperor’s will, and of other important
                    documents of state (Suet., <hi rend="italic">J. Caes.,</hi> 83, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aug.,</hi> 101; Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> i. 8; Plut.,

                    offices, both religious and secular, appears to have been very great. Many of
                    the statues to the chief vestals which were found in the Atrium Vestae in
                    1883-84 have pedestals inscribed with a dedication recording that benefits had
                    been conferred on the donor by the vestalis maxima. Lastly, they lived in a

                    the dedicatory inscriptions on the pedestals.</p></note> With one or two
                    exceptions the costume of these statues is much the same: they have a long

                    seem to have long hair, showing that the process of cutting off the hair at
                    initiation was not repeated. One figure (see fig. 2) wears the <hi rend="italic"
                    >suffibulum,</hi> a rectangular piece of white cloth bordered by a purple

                <p>When Augustus, after his election to the office of pontifex maximus in 12 B.c.,
                    moved his place of residence from the Regia to the Palatine, he built a new
                    Aedes Vestae near his palace, in the magnificent Area Apollinis. This appears to
                    have been a copy of the older temple of Vesta. No traces of it now exist; but
                    Pirro Ligorio, in the latter part of the 16th century, made some sketches of
                    what then existed of this second temple, to illustrate his great MS. on Roman
                    antiquities, which is now preserved in the royal library at Turin (see Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> iv. 949-954, and <hi rend="italic">Metam.,</hi> XV.
                    864). The original course of the Sacra Via was supposed to have passed close to
                    the temple of Vesta; but excavations made in 1886 have shown that this was not
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0214-0195"/> the case, the supposed line of the road being
                    really blocked by a very early structure. There is reason to believe that this
                    formed part of the original Regia, which was rebuilt during the reign of
                    Augustus in a more magnificent way by Domitius Calvinus, after his Spanish
                    triumph.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vestalia,</hi> or chief festival in honour of Vesta, was
                    held on 9th June (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> vi. 249), after which the
                    temple was closed for five days for a ceremonial cleansing.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The solemn decade of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vestalia</hi> began on 5th June and ended on the 15th, when the temple was
                    closed.</p></note> In private houses the feast was celebrated by a meal of fish,
                    bread, and herbs, eaten, not on the usual triclinium, but by the domestic
                    hearth, in front of the effigies of the Dii Penates (Ovid, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fast.,</hi> vi. 309-310). The feast inaugurated by Augustus in honour of Vesta
                    Palatina was held on 28th April, the anniversary of its consecration.</p>
                <p>With regard to statues of the goddess, though the Greek Hestia was frequently
                    represented in plastic art, yet among the Romans Vesta appears to have been
                    rarely so treated. The Athenian prytaneum contained a statue of Hestia. But
                    there was no effigy in the Roman temple of Vesta, although one is commonly shown
                    on reverses of coins which have a representation of the temple, and it appears
                    to have been commonly thought in Rome that a statue of Vesta did exist inside
                    her shrine,—a mistake which Ovid corrects <hi rend="italic">(Fast.,</hi> vi.
                    297-300). No Roman statue now known can be certainly considered to represent
                    Vesta, though a very beautiful standing figure of a female with veiled head (in
                    the Torlonia collection) has, with some probability, had this name given to
                    it.</p>
                <p>The worship of Vesta appears to have died out slowly in the 4th century, after
                    the adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Constantine. Zosimus (<hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Nov.,</hi> V. 38) tells an interesting story of a visit made
                    to the Atrium Vestae at the end of the 4th century by Serena, the wife of the
                    Vandal Stilicho, who took a valuable necklace from one of the statues, in spite
                    of the remonstrances of an aged woman, the last survivor of the vestal virgins.
                    Soon after that time the building appears to have fallen into decay, its
                    valuable marble linings and other ornaments having been stripped from its
                    walls.</p>
