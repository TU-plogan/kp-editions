                    a period when the principle of volunteer organization for national defence was
                    first adopted in England, it is certain that societies to promote this object
                    existed in various parts of the country in the reign of Henry VIII., who in fact
                    granted a charter in 1537 to the “Fraternity or Guylde of Saint George: Maisters
                    and Rulars of the said Science of Artillary as aforesaid rehearsed for
                    long-bowes Cros-bowes and Hand-Gonnes.” . This ancient volunteer corps is now
                    the Honourable Artillery Company of London, whose muster-rolls have borne the
                    names of many distinguished personages, including John Milton. Although the
                    Honourable Artillery Company has always been a distinct volunteer association,
                    it was at one time (notably during the wars of the Commonwealth) a centre of
                    instruction for the City trained bands, whose officers indeed were required by
                    statute to be members also of the company. It is an interesting fact in
                    connexion with this company that there exists at Boston, U.S., a volunteer corps
                    bearing the name of the “Antient and Honorable Artillery Company of
                    Massachusetts.” This legacy of the pilgrimfathers was formed in 1638 after its
                    London prototype, and its Puritan origin is still recognized in the “election
                    sermon” which celebrates the anniversary of its formation.</p>
                <p>It was not, however, until 1779 that volunteer organization<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0317-0294"/> became an integral part in national defence. In
                    that year, Ireland being threatened with invasion by France and Spain, a levy of
                    40,000 Protestants was made by the gentry in the north. The energy and
                    patriotism thus promptly manifested no doubt averted the impending danger, but
                    not without unexpected results, for the volunteers then enrolled availed
                    themselves of the opportunity to assert claims on their own account for the
                    extension of civil liberty. The close of the 18th and the early part of the
                    present century saw in Great Britain itself a more complete development of the
                    national instinct for self-defence, when the aggressive wars of France,
                    following upon the Revolution of 1789, threatened the safety of the United
                    Kingdom. Between 1794 and 1804 successive Acts of Parliament were passed
                    providing for the administration and discipline of the volunteer force, which,
                    in 1805, when invasion by the first Napoleon was imminent, amounted to 429,165
                    men (70,000 of whom were Irish). When peace, however, was restored, this force
                    was disbanded, with the exception of the yeomanry or volunteer cavalry, which
                    continues to this day.</p>
                <p>After an interval of nearly half a century the warlike attitude of France, under
                    Napoleon III., caused the British once more to arm for the protection of their
                    country. This long interval, however, had been used differently by the
                    respective nations. England, from a questionable economy, had allowed both army
                    and navy to decline in strength and efficiency; France on the other hand, by the
                    energetic development of her military anti naval power, and the early
                    application of steam to ships of war, brought the possibilities of the invasion
                    of England in 1846 within measurable distance, while a feeling of hostility was
                    fostered and inflamed by her political writers. England at this time was
                    awakened to the gravity of the situation by the publication of a well-known
                    letter from the duke of Wellington, then commander-in-chief, to Sir John
                    Burgoyne,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Letters of Field-Marshal Sir John
                    Burgoyne.</hi></p></note> followed by a well-timed pamphlet by General Sir
                    Charles Napier, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Defence of England by Volunteer
                    Corps and Militia.</hi> This characteristic sketch of the true principles of
                    defence for a free people became seven years later the basis of the volunteer
                    organization.</p>
                <p>In 1857 the French press became more and more menacing. The United States had
                    dismissed the resident British minister, and in consequence reinforcements had
                    to be sent to Canada and New Brunswick. The war going on in China required an
                    army and employed a fleet. The Indian Mutiny taxed the resources of England to
                    the uttermost, while at home (save the actual garrisons) an unsatisfactory
                    reserve of barely 36,000 militia was all that could be counted on. This
                    threatening condition of affairs tended to aggravate, if not to produce, a
                    serious commercial panic. It was then that the volunteer movement began, and by
                    a popular impulse.</p>
                <p>A circular letter, dated 12th May 1859, from the secretary for war to the
                    lord-lieutenants of counties in Great Britain, authorized the formation of
                    volunteer corps. The statute under which the general enrolment took place was
                    the same that had governed the organization of the volunteer force in the
                    beginning of the century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Geo. III. cap. 54.</p></note> The main provisions of that Act, however, were
                    found inapplicable to the altered conditions under which invasion was now
                    possible (through the application of steam); they failed also to meet the new
                    system entertained of maintaining the volunteer force on a permanent footing in
                    peace. A new Act was therefore passed, the most important provision of
                    which<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Volunteer Act,
                    1863, s. 17.</p></note> was that apprehended invasion should constitute a
                    sufficient reason for the sovereign to call out the volunteers for service, in
                    lieu of the old condition which required the actual appearance of the enemy upon
                    the coast. To carry this provision into effect, the apprehension has to be first
                    communicated to parliament, or if parliament is not sitting declared by the
                    queen in council and notified by proclamation. The volunteers are thereupon
                    bound to serve in Great Britain until released by a proclamation declaring the
                    occasion to have passed. When so called out, they receive pay on the army
                    scale.</p>
                <p>The force thus brought into existence is composed of corps of light horse,
                    artillery, engineers, mounted rifles, and rifle volunteers. There exist also in
                    connexion with the Admiralty special volunteer corps for the defence of the
                    coast-line, called “Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers.” The term “corps”
                    possesses no tactical signification. Any body of persons, great or small, whose
                    offer of service the queen has accepted constitutes a “corps.” The property
                    belonging to the corps is vested in the commanding officer, and is administered
                    by a committee of officers under the rules of the corps. These rules are in the
                    first instance agreed on at a general meeting of officers and men, and, having
                    received the queen’s approval, become legal, and may be enforced by a
                    magistrate’s order. The commanding officer has power to dismiss a man from the
                    corps, and a volunteer not on actual service may terminate his engagement on
                    giving fourteen days’ notice.</p>
                <p>Volunteers, when assembled under arms, whether for actual service or for
                    exercise, are under the command of the commander-in-chief or of general or other
                    fieldofficers of the regular army appointed to command them, who must be senior
                    in rank to every officer of the volunteers present. But it is a fundamental law
                    that volunteers are to be led by their own officers. For the purposes of
                    training, a permanent staff of adjutants and sergeant-instructors is provided
                    from the regular army.</p>
                <p>The formation of corps constituted as described was so rapid that in the course
                    of a few months in 1859-60 a force of 119,000 volunteers was created. For
                    administrative purposes, and for instruction, small corps were grouped in their
                    several counties into “administrative battalions.” This provisional arrangement
                    has since been abolished (a questionable measure), and the small “corps,”
                    deprived of much of the status necessary as nuclei of battalions in time of war,
                    are converted into constituent parts or companies of what had been their
                    administrative battalions. These latter are now not only constituted “corps” in
                    the meaning of the Act, but are called “consolidated corps,” though their
                    constituent parts are widely scattered. Though this arrangement is convenient
                    during peace, confusion would probably result under pressure of apprehended
                    invasion.</p>
                <p>On the 7th March 1860 the queen held a levee in London, at which 2500 officers of
                    volunteers were presented. On the 23d June a royal review was held in Hyde Park,
                    when 21,900 volunteers marched past; and at Edinburgh on the 7th August another
                    royal review took place, at which 22,000 volunteers from the northern corps were
                    under arms.</p>
                <p>Public confidence was thus restored, but yet more remained to be done. An end had
                    to be put to the ever-recurring panics that paralysed from time to time the
                    commercial system of the country. The Government, which in the beginning had
                    tolerated rather than encouraged the movement, now followed the lead of public
                    opinion, and decided on maintaining the volunteer force as a part of the regular
                    defensive system of the country. The <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the
                    volunteer corps (with a few essential exceptions) thereupon underwent a change.
                    The wealthy and professional classes, who had at first joined the ranks in
                    anticipation of war, cared no longer to bear arms. Their places were taken by
                    the artisan class, which added <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0318-0295"/> materially to the number and permanence of the
                    force. But, as contributions and subscriptions now flagged, it became evident
                    that public grants would have to be voted for its maintenance. A Royal
                    Commission was therefore appointed in 1862 to inquire into the requirements of
                    the volunteers, as well as to determine the conditions on which the public grant
                    should be given, and a scale of ordinary and special capitation allowances,
                    subject to regulation, was fixed on that commission’s recommendation.</p>
                <p>It was not to be expected that this so-called mushroom army should escape a
                    certain amount of professional ridicule, which the inefficiency of the old
                    volunteers associated with the name. Nor was this tendency unmixed with
                    apprehension in certain quarters that the public grants voted for the force
                    might in some way affect the interests of the regular army. But a generous
                    appreciation and sympathy took the place of adverse criticism, as the
                    earnestness of the volunteers and their devoted loyalty became apparent. Nor
                    were they unsuccessful in their own efforts to keep pace with modern military
                    training, and even to introduce improvements. Lord Elcho, a prominent leader of
                    the volunteer movement, revived in the National Rifle Association the ancient
                    English pastime of practising at the butts. The queen herself fired the first
                    shot (a bull’s-eye) at Wimbledon in 1860, and thus inaugurated those great
                    national meetings where many thousands compete annually for prizes, the
                    aggregate value of which has now reached £14,680, with 126,463 entries.</p>
                <p>Colonel Harcourt followed Lord Elcho in establishing the National Artillery
                    Association, whose meetings are held annually at the School of Gunnery at
                    Shoeburyness. The volunteers in this arm of the force are more than 40,000
                    strong, and belong chiefly to the mechanic class. Their aptitude to learn the
                    use of the great modern ordnance which their presence at the School of Gunnery
                    encourages, and their steady discipline when in garrison, have impressed the
                    officers of the Royal Artillery with their value as a reserve for manning the
                    coast defences, as well as for the equipment of field batteries. Special
                    provision has now been made for the latter, on the condition that the batteries
                    are fully horsed by the volunteers, and that three complete detachments of men
                    per gun are maintained in training.</p>
                <p>The regular attendance of detachments of colonial volunteers at these great
                    annual national competitions has exercised for some years past a silent and
                    beneficial influence, by fostering the military sympathy of the colonies with
                    the mother country as regards the interests of imperial defence. This feeling
                    found practical expression in the expedition to the Soudan in 1885.</p>
                <p>A novel and peculiarly national arm was also introduced in 1860 by Colonel Bower,
                    then master of the Hambledon hounds at Droxford, who trained members of the hunt
                    as a corps of mounted riflemen to occupy ground from point to point across
                    country.</p>
                <p>When the number of hunting men in Great Britain is considered, all of whom would
                    be ready to turn out, thus equipped, to harrass the flank of an invader, beyond
                    reach even of his cavalry, some estimate may be formed of the value of this
                    contribution to the plan of defence.</p>
                <p>The late Lord Ranelagh, another leader of mark among volunteers, initiated the
                    great Easter volunteer field-days at Brighton and elsewhere. His views, at first
                    opposed, are now officially acted on, and the annual Easter assemblies have
                    developed into manoeuvres, interesting as well as instructive to all engaged.
                    The Easter holidays afford also opportunity to artillery volunteers to go into
                    garrison in forts, as at Sheerness and other coast works, where means of
                    practising are available. Facilities in camp instruction are also extended to
                    volunteers in summer, an arrangement which enables the small scattered corps to
                    unite for drill. As many as 100,000 volunteers were in camp in 1887.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important organization of all, alike for the service of the army
                    and the auxiliary forces, is that known as the “Engineer and Railway Transport
                    Corps,” formed by the patriotic exertions of the late Charles Manby, civil
                    engineer, and a lieutenant-colonel in the corps. The term “corps” presents in
                    this case a council of officers composed of the following elements :—(1) eminent
                    civil engineers; (2) the general managers of the main lines of railway; (3) the
                    chief employers of labour. These officers have the rank of lieutenant-colonel.
                    There are also other officers of the same classes, subordinate to the above, and
                    not belonging to the council. The functions of the corps include (<hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>) the arrangement and the carrying into effect of any sudden
                    and general concentration of troops to oppose invasion, and (ό) the rapid
                    execution of works upon the railways and lines of defence by the means at the
                    disposal of the great contractors directed by the civil engineers. The ready
                    labour power of this useful corps is estimated at from 12,000 to 20,000 navvies,
                    with tools, barrows, and commissariat complete. It has already performed
                    important service in tabulating, and printing at great private cost, complete
                    time-tables and special reports for six general concentrations against possible
                    invasion. A special return was also prepared by the corps (the first of its
                    kind) of the entire rolling stock of all the railways in Great Britain. This
                    important work—which is corrected and republished annually—shows where the
                    requisite numbers of carriages of every description can be obtained for the
                    composition of troop trains.</p>
                <p>The opinion bf military judges has been that the main weakness of the whole
                    volunteer system rests with the officers. But this judgment has undoubtedly been
                    modified of late years by the eagerness displayed by the officers of all ranks
                    to become capable leaders of their men. While advantage is taken of the
                    facilities provided by the Government—such as schools of instruction, temporary
                    attachment to regular and militia regiments, and half-yearly examinations in
                    tactics—officers of volunteers are making progress among themselves by
                    initiating societies in various parts of the country for the study and
                    discussion of military subjects, war games, &amp;c. Individually, some officers
                    have already taken a prominent position as students in the art of war. One of
                    these, Colonel Macdonald, C.B., commanding the Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers, has
                    originated important improvements in the system of infantry drill, and his
                    modifications have been approved in principle by the adjutant-general. An
                    ambulance service has been organized, and a scheme for battalion transport
                    brought out.</p>
                <p>The foregoing organization has not exhausted the resources of volunteer national
                    defence. Science and commercial wealth combined are now creating an outer line,—
                    the former for the defence of the Humber, Tees, Tyne, Mersey, &amp;c., by means
                    of volunteer marine mining corps, and the latter by the institution of the Naval
                    Volunteer Defence Association, having for its object the protection of merchant
                    ships, by fitting out in British ports a number of merchant vessels to serve in
                    time of war as a cordon around the coasts of the kingdom, within which the
                    shipping may pass in security.</p>
                <p>There is yet another weak point, of equal importance, in the personal equipment
                    of the volunteers, which, as a rule, is deficient for field service. But now
                    that the jurisdiction has been transferred from the lord-lieutenants of counties
                    to the crown, the whole subject of equipment for the field is entrusted to
                    direct and responsible military authority.</p>
                <p>The still graver question arises as to the issue of warlike stores in general in
                    the time of national danger. Notwithstanding that such stores are already
                    partially in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0319-0296"/> possession of the services, the issue to the <hi
                    rend="italic">levée en masse</hi> (or augmentation of the volunteer force) alone
                    will be a matter of extreme difficulty for one arsenal to manage. This
                    difficulty will be best understood by the following statement. The volunteer
                    force in Great Britain at the beginning of the century numbered 359,165. Since
                    then, however, the population has nearly doubled. Therefore, supposing all other
                    conditions to be equal, the number that would now come forward to defend the
                    country would be about 700,000, or 481,800 more than the present peace footing
                    of the volunteer force. One arsenal is not sufficient to sustain the strain that
                    would then be put upon it. Strategically considered also, the situation of that
                    at Woolwich is not such as to justify the accumulation there of all the warlike
                    material the nation would have to depend on. A central arsenal, if not a
                    northern one as well, appears to be a national necessity.</p>
                <p>The existence of the volunteer force averts conscription for the country’s
                    defence, and it forms, as the first Lord Brougham characterized it, a “national
                    insurance.” The cost to the country is trifling compared with the magnitude of
                    the issues, being in 1885 £767,400 for 218,000 “efficient” volunteers entitled
                    to the public grant, that is £3, 8s. 6d. per volunteer, or barely 6d. per head
                    of the population to be defended. The value of the volunteer force is not,
                    however, to be estimated by the numbers actually enrolled. It is in fact, in its
                    present form, a great training school of citizen soldiers, through which
                    thousands pass annually into a reserve ready to join in case of need. And every
                    year of its valuable service confirms the wisdom of Sir Charles Napier’s last
                    words of advice to his countrymen, viz., “Militia and volunteers are the proper
                    forces to prepare for danger in time of peace.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ.
