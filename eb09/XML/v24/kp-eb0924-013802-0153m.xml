                <p><label type="entry">VENEERING</label> is the art of attaching thin sheets or
                    leaves of wood, ivory, &amp;c., to the surface of wood or other material of a
                    less costly or less ornamental description. It is thus in connexion with wood,
                    ivory, &amp;c., equivalent to plating in the working of metals. The art is
                    largely practised in cabinet-work. Veneers are either cut or sawn from solid
                    blocks or planks. The ordinary veneer saw is a circular instrument of large
                    diameter, made up of segments of thin steel bolted on a strong circular iron
                    frame, which gives the requisite stiffness and rigidity to the saw edge. The
                    teeth of the saw are minute and finely set, so as to waste as little as possible
                    of the valuable material as sawdust. With such a saw from 8 to 16 leaves per
                    inch may be cut out of a block of wood and as many as 30 leaves of ivory,
                    one-third of the solid being reduced to sawdust. Veneers are also made from
                    certain straightgrained and pliant woods with cutting tools, either by the
                    process of planing or of turning. For these methods of veneer-making, the wood
                    to be operated on is first reduced to blocks of a size equal to the cutting
                    edges by which they are to be made into veneer, and are then steamed in a closed
                    chamber to soften the fibre. In the plane veneercutting machines the block of
                    wood may be stationary and the cutter movable, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> and the cutting edge is applied obliquely to the block. Immediately
                    in front of the cutter pressure is applied to the block to keep the shaving from
                    splitting up. With the planing machine from 100 to 150 veneer leaves can be cut
                    from each inch of thickness. By the lathe-turning method continuous strips of
                    veneer are obtained from circular blocks the width of the cutter, and it is
                    possible to reduce the block till a core of about only 9 inches remains. In the
                    cutting, as opposed to the sawing, of veneers there is no waste whatever of the
                    solid material; but cut veneers are not so serviceable, and the most valuable
                    veneer woods, being hard, cross-fibred, and brittle, cannot be treated otherwise
                    than by sawing. In veneering, the surfaces to be united, after roughening, so as
                    to give grip, are coated with thin glue applied very hot, and then tightly
                    pressed together in a veneering press, with heated cauls or plates of zinc
                    applied to their surfaces, these cauls being contoured to the necessary outline
                    when bent veneers are being planted. Should the veneer show any blistering after
                    removal from the press, heat, damp, and local pressure are applied till veneer
