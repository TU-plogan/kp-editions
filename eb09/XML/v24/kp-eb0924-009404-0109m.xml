                    family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati. He was related to
                    the painter Luca Signorelli.</p></note> was born at Arezzo in 1513. At a very
                    early age he became a pupil of Guglielmo da Marsiglia, a very skilful painter of
                    stained glass. At the age of sixteen he went to Florence, where he studied under
                    Michelangelo and Andrea del Sarto, aided by the patronage of the Medici princes.
                    In 1529 he visited Rome and studied the works of Raphael and others of his
                    school.. The paintings of Vasari were much admired by the rapidly degenerating
                    taste of the 16th century; but they possess the smallest amount of merit, being
                    in the main feeble parodies of the powerful works of Michelangelo. Vasari was
                    largely employed in Florence, Rome, Naples, Arezzo, and other places. Many of
                    his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling
                    paintings in the great hall of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, and his frescos
                    on the cupola of the cathedral, which, however, were not completed at the time
                    of his death. As an architect he was perhaps more successful: the loggia of the
                    Uffizi by the Arno, and the long passage connecting it with the Pitti Palace,
                    are his chief works. Unhappily he did much to injure the fine mediaeval churches
                    of S. Maria Novella and Santa Croce, from both of which he removed the original
                    rood-screen and loft, and remodelled the retro-choir in the degraded taste of
                    his time. Vasari enjoyed a very high repute during his lifetime and amassed a
                    considerable fortune. He built himself in 1547 a fine house in Arezzo, and spent
                    much labour in decorating its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected
                    one of the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to
                    the supreme office of gonfaloniere. He died at Florence on 27th June 1574.</p>
                <p>Personally Vasari was a man of upright character, free from vanity, and always
                    ready to appreciate the works of others: in spite of the narrow and meretricious
                    taste of his time, he expresses a warm admiration of the works of such men as
                    Cimabue and Giotto, which is very remarkable. As an art historian of his country
                    he must always occupy the highest rank. His great work was first published in
                    1550, and afterwards partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, bearing the title
                    <hi rend="italic">Delle Vite de’ piu Eccellenti Pittori, Scultori, ed
                    Architettori.</hi> It was dedicated to Cosimo de’ Medici, and was printed at
                    Florence by the Giunti; it is a small quarto illustrated with many good woodcut
                    portraits. This <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of the complete work is
                    usually bound in three volumes, and also contains a very valuable treatise on
                    the technical methods employed in all branches of the arts, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Tre Arti del Disegno, cioè Architettura, Pittura, e
                    Scoltura.</hi></p>
                <p>The best edition of Vasari’s works is that published at Florence by Milanesi,
                    1878-82, which embodies the valuable notes in the earlier edition by Le Monnier.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> has been translated into French, German, and
                    English (by Mrs Foster, London, 1850). They are written in a very pleasant
                    style, interspersed with amusing stories, and are in the main trustworthy,
                    except some of the biographies of early artists.<note anchored="true"

                    tendency of modem criticism is to underestimate the historical accuracy of

                    unbiassed.</p>
