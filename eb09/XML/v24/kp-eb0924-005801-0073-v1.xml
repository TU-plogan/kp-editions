                <p><label type="entry">VANDALS</label>. The Vandals, one of the leading Teutonic
                    nations that overthrew the Roman empire, were of the Low German stock and
                    closely allied to the Goths. We first hear of them in the time of Pliny and
                    Tacitus as occupying a district nearly corresponding to Brandenburg and
                    Pomerania. From thence, in the 2d century, they pressed southwards to the
                    confines of Bohemia, where they gave their name to the mountains now called the
                    Riesengebirge. After a century of hostile and desultory operations against the
                    Roman empire, having been signally defeated by Aurelian (271), they made peace
                    with Rome, one of the conditions being that they should supply 2000 <hi
                        rend="italic">foederati</hi> to the imperial army. Sixty years later they
                    sustained a great defeat from the Goths under their king Geberich, after which
                    they humbly sought and obtained permission from Constantine to settle as Roman
                    subjects within the province of Pannonia. Here they remained seventy years, and
                    during this period they probably made some advances in civilization and became
                    Christians of the Arian type. In 406, when the empire under Honorius was falling
                    into ruin, they crossed the Rhine and entered Gaul. Stilicho, the chief adviser
                    of Honorius, who was a man of Vandal extraction, was accused by his enemies of
                    having invited them into the empire, but this is probably a groundless calumny.
                    In Gaul they fought a great battle with the Franks, in which they were defeated
                    with the loss of 2000 men, and their king Godigisclus was slain. In 409 his son
                    Gunderic led them across the Pyrenees. They appear to have settled in Spain in
                    two detachments. One, the Asdingian Vandals, occupied Galicia, the other, the
                    Sil-ingian, Andalusia. Twenty years of bloody and purposeless warfare with the
                    armies of the empire and with their fellow-barbarians, the Goths and the Suevi,
                    followed. The Silingian Vandals were well-nigh exterminated, but their Asdingian
                    brethren (with whom were now associated the remains of a Turanian people, the
                    Alans, who had been utterly defeated by the Goths) marched across Spain and took
                    possession of Andalusia.</p>
                <p>In 428 or 429 the whole nation set sail for Africa, upon an invitation received
                    by their king from Bonifacius, count of Africa, who had fallen into disgrace
                    with the court of Ravenna. Gunderic was now dead and supreme power was in the
                    hands of his bastard brother, who is generally known in history as Genseric,
                    though the more correct form of his name is Gaiseric. This man, short of stature
                    and with limping gait, but with a great natural capacity for war and dominion,
                    reckless of human life and unrestrained by conscience or pity, was for fifty
                    years the hero of the Vandal race and the terror of Constantinople and Rome. In
                    the month of May 428 (?) he assembled all his people on the shore of Andalusia,
                    and numbering the males among them from the graybeard down to the newborn infant
                    found them to amount to 80,000 souls. The passage was effected in the ships of
                    Bonifacius, who, however, soon returning to his old loyalty, besought his new
                    allies to depart from Africa. They, of course, refused, and Bonifacius turned
                    against them, too late, however, to repair the mischief which he had caused.
                    Notwithstanding his opposition the progress of the Vandals was rapid, and by May
                    430 only three cities of Roman Africa—Carthage, Hippo, and Cirta—remained
                    untaken. The long siege of <hi rend="underline">Hi</hi> ppo (May 430 to July
                    431), memorable for the last illness and death of St Augustine, which occurred
                    during its progress, ended unsuccessfully for the Vandals. At length (30th
                    January 435) peace was made between the emperor Valentinian III. and Genseric.
                    The emperor was to retain Carthage and the small but rich proconsular province
                    in which it was situated, while Hippo and the other six provinces of Africa were
                    abandoned to the Vandal. Genseric observed this treaty no longer than suited his
                    purpose. On the 19th of October 439, without any declaration of war, he suddenly
                    attacked Carthage and took it. The Vandal occupation of this great city, the
                    third among the cities of the Roman empire, lasted for ninety-four years.
                    Genseric seems to have counted the years of his sovereignty from the date of its
                    capture. Though most of the remaining years of Genseric’s life were passed in
                    war, plunder rather than territorial conquest seems to have been the object of
                    his expeditions. He made, in fact, of Carthage a pirate’s stronghold, from
                    whence he issued forth, like the Barbary pirates of a later day, to attack, as
                    he himself said, “the dwellings of the men with whom God is angry,” leaving the
                    question who those men might be to the decision of the elements. Almost alone
                    among the Teutonic invaders of the empire he set himself to form a powerful
                    fleet, and was probably for thirty years the leading maritime power in the
                    Mediterranean. Genseric’s celebrated expedition against Rome (455), undertaken
                    in response to the call of Eudoxia, widow of Valentinian, was only the greatest
                    of his marauding exploits. He took the city without difficulty, and for fourteen
                    days, in a calm and business-like manner, emptied it of all its movable wealth.
                    The sacred vessels of the Jewish temple, brought to Rome by Titus, are said to
                    have been among the spoils carried to Carthage by the conqueror. Eudoxia and her
                    two daughters were also carried into captivity. One of the princesses, Eudocia,
                    was married to Huneric, eldest son of Genseric; her mother and sister, after
                    long and tedious negotiations, were sent to Constantinople.</p>
                <p>There does not seem to be in the story of the capture of Rome by the Vandals any
                    justification for the charge of wilful and objectless destruction of public
                    buildings which is implied in the word “vandalism.” It is probable that this
                    charge grew out of the fierce persecution which was carried on by Genseric and
                    his son against the Catholic Christians, and which is the darkest stain on their
                    characters. This persecution is described with great vividness, and no doubt
                    with some exaggeration, by the nearly contemporary Victor Vitensis. Churches
                    were burned; bishops and priests were forced by cruel and revolting tortures to
                    reveal the hiding-places of the sacred vessels; the rich provincials who were
                    employed about the court, and who still adhered to the Catholic faith, were
                    racked and beaten, and put to death. The bishops were almost universally
                    banished, and the congregations were forbidden to elect their successors, so
                    that the greater part of the churches of Africa remained “widowed” for a whole
                    generation. In 475, at the very close of Genseric’s life, by a treaty concluded
                    with the Eastern emperor, the bishops were permitted to return. There was then a
                    short lull in the persecution; but on the death of Genseric (477) and the
                    accession of Huneric (a bitter Arian, made more rancorous by the orthodoxy of
                    his wife Eudocia) it broke out again with greater violence than ever, the
                    ferocity of Huneric being more thoroughly stupid and brutal than the calculating
                    cruelty of his father.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0074-0059"/>
                <p>On the death of Huneric (484) he was succeeded by his cousin Gunthamund, Genseric
                    having established seniority among his own descendants as the law of succession
                    to his throne. Gunthamund (484-496) and his brother Thrasa-mund (496-523),
                    though Arians, abated some of the rigour of the persecution, and maintained the
                    external credit of the monarchy. Internally, however, it was rapidly declining,
                    the once chaste and hardy Vandals being demoralized by the fervid climate of
                    Africa and the sinful delights of their new capital, and falling ever lower into
                    sloth, effeminacy, and vice. On the death of Thrasamund, Hilderic (523- 531),
                    the son of Huneric and Eudocia, at length succeeded to the throne. He adhered to
                    the creed of his mother rather than to that of his father; and, in spite of a
                    solemn oath sworn to his predecessor that he would not restore the Catholic
                    churches to their owners, he at once proceeded to do so and to recall the
                    bishops. Hilderic, elderly, Catholic, and timid, was very unpopular with his
                    subjects, and after a reign of eight years he was thrust into prison by his
                    warlike cousin Gelimer (531-534).</p>
                <p>The wrongs of Hilderic, a Catholic, and with the blood of Theodosius in his
                    veins, afforded to Justinian a long-coveted pretext for overthrowing the Vandal
                    dominion, the latent weakness of which was probably known to the statesmen of
                    Constantinople. A great expedition under the command of Belisarius (in whose
                    train was the historian Procopius) sailed from the Bosphorus in June 533, and
                    after touching at Catana in Sicily finally reached Africa in the beginning of
                    September. Gelimer, who was strangely ignorant of the plans of Justinian, had
                    sent his brother Tzazo with some of his best troops to quell a rebellion in
                    Sardinia (that island as well as the Balearic Isles forming part of the Vandal
                    dominions), and the landing of Belisarius was entirely unopposed. He marched
                    rapidly towards Carthage and on the 13th of September was confronted by Gelimer
                    at Ad Decimum, 10 miles from Carthage. The battle did not reflect any great
                    credit either on Byzantine or Vandal generalship. It was in fact a series of
                    blunders on both sides, but Belisarius made the fewest and victory remained with
                    him. On the 14th of September 533 the imperial general entered Carthage and ate
                    the feast prepared in Gelimer’s palace for its lord. Belisarius, however, was
                    too late to save the life of Hilderic, who had been slain by his rival’s orders
                    as soon as the news came of the landing of the imperial army. Still Gelimer with
                    many of the Vandal warriors was at liberty. On the return of Tzazo from Sardinia
                    a force was collected considerably larger than the imperial army, and Gelimer
                    met Belisarius in battle at a place about twenty miles from Carthage, called
                    Tricamarum (December 533). This battle was far more stubbornly contested than
                    that of Ad Decimum, but it ended in the utter rout of the Vandals and the flight
                    of Gelimer. He took refuge in a mountain fortress called Pappua on the Numidian
                    frontier, and there, after enduring great hardships in the squalid dwellings of
                    the Moors, surrendered to his pursuers in March 534. The well-known stories of
                    his laughter when he was introduced to Belisarius, and his chant, “Vanitas
                    vanitatum,” when he walked before the triumphal car of his conqueror through the
                    streets of Constantinople, probably point to an intellect disordered by his
                    reverses and hardships. The Vandals who were carried captive to Constantinople
                    were enlisted in five squadrons of cavalry and sent to serve against the
                    Parthians under the title “Justiniani Vandali.” Four hundred escaped to Africa
                    and took part in a mutiny of the imperial troops which was with difficulty
                    quelled by Belisarius (536). After this the Vandals disappear from history. The
                    overthrow of their kingdom undoubtedly rendered easier the spread of Saracen
                    conquest along the northern shore of Africa in the following century. In this as
                    in many other fields Justinian sowed that Mohammed might reap.</p>
