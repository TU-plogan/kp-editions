                    vinifera</hi> is the species best known and longest cultivated; but out of ten
                    species that grow wild in the United States four (<hi rend="italic">V</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">rotundifolia, V. Labrusca, V. aestivalis,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">V. cordifolia),</hi> according to Engelmann, are cultivated and
                    have given origin to numerous derivatives used for wine-making purposes. Some of
                    the American varieties have been introduced into France and other countries
                    infested with <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera,</hi> to serve as stocks on which to
                    graft the better kinds of European vines, because their roots, though perhaps
                    equally subject to the attacks of the insects, do not suffer so much injury from
                    them as the European species. American vines should not, however, be introduced
                    for grafting or other purposes into a vine-growing country hitherto free from
                    <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera,</hi> but only into those in which the insect has
                    already spread.</p>
                <p>Although the genus <hi rend="italic">Vitis</hi> comprises, according to Bentham
                    and Hooker, more than two hundred species, mostly natives of tropical or
                    subtropical regions, yet less than half-a-dozen species have any economic value,
                    while the great interest centres in four or five only. Vines have woody climbing
                    stems, with alternate, palmately-lobed, or in some cases <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ampelopsis, Cissus)</hi> compound (digitate), leaves, provided at the base
                    with small stipules. Opposite some of these leaves springs a tendril, the nature
                    of which is obvious from the numerous transitional states it offers between the
                    ordinary form of tendril and the inflorescence. The flowers are small, green,
                    and fragrant, and are arranged in dense clusters. Each has a small calyx in the
                    form of a shallow rim, sometimes four-lobed or five-lobed, or toothed. Within
                    this is an equal number of petals, which in the true vines cohere by their tips
                    and form a cap or hood, which is pushed off when the stamens are ripe. In other
                    species (and as a malformation in the vine itself) the petals are free and
                    spreading. Four or five free stamens, placed opposite the petals, spring from a
                    fleshy ring or disk surrounding the ovary, each bearing a two-celled anther. The
                    ovary is surmounted by a sessile stigma and is more or less completely
                    two-celled, with two erect ovules in each cell. This ripens into the berry and
                    seed. Planchon, in his monograph of the <hi rend="italic">Ampelideae
                    (1887),</hi> divides the genus <hi rend="italic">Vitis</hi> into numerous genera
                    of equal rank. He retains, however, the grape vines under their original name.
                    The cultivated vine has usually hermaphrodite flowers; but, as it occurs in a
                    wild state, or as an escape from cultivation, the flowers manifest a tendency
                    towards unisexuality: that is, one plant bears flowers with stamens only, or
                    only the rudiments of the pistil, while on another plant the flowers are
                    bisexual. Exclusively female flowers without stamens do not appear to have been
                    observed. Seedling plants from the cultivated vines often produce unisexual
                    flowers, thus reverting to the feral type. Perhaps the explanation of the fact
                    that some of the cultivated varieties are, as gardeners say, “bad setters,”— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> do not ripen their fruit owing to imperfect
                    fertilization,—is to be sought in this natural tendency to dioecism.</p>
                <p>The conformation of the vine stem has elicited a vast amount of explanatory
                    comment. The most generally accepted explanation is the “sympodial” one.
                    According to this, the shoot of the vine is a “sympode,” consisting of a number
                    of “podia” placed one over the other in longitudinal series. Each podium
                    consists of a portion of the stem bearing one or more leaves, each with an
                    axillary bud or buds, and terminating in a tendril or an inflorescence. In <hi
                    rend="italic">V. Labrusca</hi> there is a tendril opposite to each leaf, so that
                    the podium bears only a single leaf. In other species there is a definite
                    arrangement of the leaves, some with and others without tendrils opposite to
                    them, the numerical order remaining constant or nearly so. These arrangements
                    have doubtless some reference to climatic phenomena, continuity of growth being
                    arrested by cold and promoted by warmth. In any case it is obvious that these
                    facts might be turned to practical ends in cultivation. A vine, for instance,
                    that produces bunches of grapes at each joint is preferable to one in which
                    there are several barren joints, as a larger quantity can be grown within a
                    smaller area. The practice of pruning or “stopping,” as explained under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Horticulture</hi> (vol. xii. p. 277), is consciously or
                    unconsciously regulated by the mode of growth. The tendril or inflorescence,
                    according to the views above explained, though in reality terminal, is bent to
                    one side; hence it appears to be lateral and opposite to the leaf. While the
                    tendril is thus diverted from its orginal direct course, the axillary bud of the
                    leaf opposite the tendril begins a new podium, by lengthening into a shoot which
                    assumes the direction the tendril had prior to its deflexion. This new podium,
                    now in a direct line with its predecessor, produces leaves and ends in its turn
                    in a tendril or inflorescence. A third podium succeeds the second, and so on.
                    Other authorities explain the formation of the tendril and its anomalous
                    position opposite to a leaf by supposing that the end of the stem bifurcates
                    during growth, one division forming the shoot, the other the tendril or
                    inflorescence. It is not possible within the limits at our command to specify
                    the facts and arguments by which these theories are respectively supported.
                    Practically the tendrils assist the plant in its native state to scramble over
                    rocks or trees. As in the case of similar formations generally, they are endowed
                    with a sensitiveness to touch which enables them to grasp and coil themselves
                    round any suitable object which comes in their way, and thus to support the
                    plant. The tendrils of the Virginian creeper (<hi rend="italic">Vitis</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Ampelopsis hederacea;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parthenocissus quinquefolia</hi> of Planchon) are branched, each branch
                    terminating in a little sucker-like expansion by means of which it adheres
                    firmly to walls or rocks. This is especially noticeable in the Japanese species
                    now so commonly grown against walls under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ampelopsis Veitchii</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">Parthenocissus
                    tricuspidata</hi> of Planchon). The extremities of these tendrils turn away from
                    the light, and by this means they are enabled to enter crevices, inside which
                    they expand and fix themselves, just as the lewis or key, used by stone-masons,
                    is fixed into blocks of stone. The anomalous position of the stamens in front of
                    the petals is explained by the abortion or non-development of an outer row of
                    stamens, indications of which are sometimes seen on the hypogynous disk <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0259-0238"/> encircling the ovary. The seeds or grape stones
                    are somewhat club-shaped, with a narrow neck-like portion beneath, which expands
                    into a rounded and thickened portion above. On the inner or central side of the
                    seed is a ridge bounded on either side by a shallow groove. This ridge indicates
                    the point of union of the “raphe” or seed-stalk with the seed; it serves to
                    distinguish the varieties of <hi rend="italic">V. vinifera</hi> from those of
                    other species. In the true vines the neck of the seed is much longer than in the
                    American vines, and the ridge or “chalaza” occupies the upper half of the seed,
                    not the middle portion, as in the American kinds. In endeavouring to trace the
                    filiation and affinities of the vine, the characters afforded by the seed are
                    specially valuable, because they have not been wittingly interfered with by
                    human agency. Characters derived from the size, colour, or flavour of the berry
                    are of less value for historical or genealogical purposes than those which are
                    the outcome of purely natural conditions.</p>
                <p>The native country of the European vine is considered to be the region south of
                    the Caspian. From this presumed centre it has spread eastwards into Central Asia
                    and westwards to both sides of the Mediterranean, Central Europe, and as far
                    north as Belgium (Planchon). Regel has propounded the notion that the cultivated
                    vine originated as a hybrid between <hi rend="italic">V. vulpina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">V. Labrusca,</hi> both North-American species; but he offers
                    little evidence in support of his opinion, which has not received the assent of
                    botanists generally. It is interesting to note that grape stones have been found
                    with mummies in Egyptian tombs of not later age than 3000 years. The seeds,
                    according to Engelmann, have the characteristics of those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >V. vinifera,</hi> but show some very slight variations from the type of seed
                    now prevalent. Among the Greeks in the time of Homer wine was in general use.
                    The cultivation of the vine must also have been introduced into Italy at a very
                    early period. In Virgil’s time the varieties in cultivation seem to have been
                    exceedingly numerous; and the varied methods of training and culture now in use
                    in Italy are in many cases identical with those described by Columella and other
                    Roman writers (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Horticulture,</hi> vol. xii. pp. 223,
                    277). Grape stones have been found among the remains of Swiss and Italian lake
                    dwellings of the Bronze period, and others in tufaceous volcanic deposits near
                    Montpellier, not long before the historic era.</p>
                <p>The vine requires a high summer temperature and a prolonged period in which to
                    ripen its fruit. Where these are forthcoming, it can be profitably cultivated,
                    even though the winter temperature be very low. Tchihatchef mentions that at
                    Erivan in Russian Armenia the mean winter temperature is 7°∙1 C. and falls in
                    January to - 30° C., and at Bokhara the mean temperature of January is 4° C. and
                    the minimum - 22° C., and yet at both places the vine is grown with success. In
                    the Alps it is profitably cultivated up to an altitude of 1870 feet, and in the
                    north of Piedmont as high as 3180 feet. At the present time the limit of
                    profitable cultivation in Europe passes from Brittany, lat. 47° 30', to beyond
                    the Rhine by Liége and through Thuringia to Silesia in lat. 51° 55' (Grisebach).
                    In former centuries vines were cultivated to the north of this region, as, for
                    instance, in Holland, in Belgium largely, and in England, where they might still
                    be grown. Indeed experiments have lately been made in this direction near
                    Cardiff in South Wales. The yield is satisfactory and the wine made, the variety
                    known as Gamay noir, is described as being like still champagne. In the Middle
                    Ages, owing to various causes, the better wines of France and Germany could not
                    be obtained in England except at prohibitive prices; but, when this state of
                    things ceased and foreign wine could be imported, the English consumers would no
                    longer tolerate the inferior productions of their own vineyards. It is also
                    probable that the English mixed sugar or honey with the wine and thus supplied
                    artificially that sweetness which the English sun denied. It is a curious fact
                    that at the present day much or even most of the wine of finest quality is made
                    at or near to the northern limits of possible cultivation with profit. This
                    circumstance is probably explained by the greater care and attention bestowed
                    both on the cultivation of the vine and on the manufacture of the wine in
                    northern countries than in those where the climate is more propitious. The
                    relative inferiority of the wines made at the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia
                    is partly due to variations of climate, the vine not yet having adapted itself
                    to the new conditions, and partly to the deficient skill of the manufacturers.
                    That such inferiority may be expected to disappear is suggested by the success
                    of vine-culture in Madeira and the Canary Islands.</p>
                <p>The development of other species of <hi rend="italic">Vitis,</hi> such as the
                    curious succulent species of the Soudan and other parts of equatorial Africa, or
                    the numerous kinds in India and Cochin China, is of course possible under
                    suitable conditions; but it is obvious that an extremely long period must elapse
                    before they can successfully compete with the product of many centuries.</p>
                <p>For currants and raisins, both produced by varieties of the grape-vine, see the
                    respective articles.</p>
                <p>Apart from their economic value, vines are often cultivated for purely ornamental
                    purposes, owing to the elegance of their foliage, the rich coloration they
                    assume, the shade they afford, and their hardihood. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ. t.
                    μ.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Diseases of Vines.</hi></p>
                <p>The organic diseases which affect the vine may be divided into two categories,
                    those caused by insects and those caused by parasitic fungi.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diseases Caused by Insects.—</hi> Kaltenbach in 1874 enumerated
                    thirty-two species of insects which injure the vine; and since then others have
                    been added to the list. We here deal only with the most important. Amongst those
                    which attack the leaves and young buds a small beetle, <hi rend="italic">Anomala
                    νitis,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Scarabaeidae,</hi> does great harm in
                    some parts of southern Europe by devouring the soft tissue of the leaves. A
                    genus of weevils, <hi rend="italic">Otiorhynchus,</hi> contains several species
                    which are injurious to the vine, chiefly by the adult beetle devouring the buds.
                    <hi rend="italic">O. raucus, hirticornis, picipes, nigritiis, ligustici,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sulcatus</hi> are all reported from various places as
                    doing much damage; the larva of the last-mentioned species attacks the roots of
                    the vine, causing the shoots to be small and ultimately bringing about the death
                    of the plant. Fortunately the members of this genus have no wings, so that the
                    damage they cause is to a great extent localized. The same kind of injury is
                    caused by a small Chrysomeleous beetle, <hi rend="italic">Eumolpus νitis.</hi>
                    The larvae of several <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> attack the vine in the
                    same way, destroying the young buds. Amongst these <hi rend="italic">Naenia
                    typica, Agrotis tritici,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A. pronuba</hi> may be
                    mentioned. The larva of <hi rend="italic">Tortrix pilleriana</hi> in the early
                    spring weaves the young vine leaves together, and, enclosed in this nest,
                    devours the soft tissue at leisure. The imago emerges from the chrysalis in July
                    and shortly after lays its eggs upon the upper surface of the vine leaf. After a
                    few weeks the caterpillars emerge and continue their work of destruction. <hi
                    rend="italic">Lethrus cephalotes,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scarabaeidae,</hi> is very injurious in vineyards which have a dry sandy soil.
                    The beetles live in pairs in holes in the ground; during the summer the beetle
                    bites off the small young shoots and drags them away to its hole, where it is
                    believed they serve as food for the larvae. In this way very serious damage is
                    caused to the vine plants. <hi rend="italic">Rhynchites betuleti,</hi> a weevil,
                    also does much damage to the young shoots and leaves. The grapes are attacked by
                    the caterpillar of a moth, <hi rend="italic">Conchylis ambiguella,</hi> which
                    lays its egg in the young fruit; and in a similar way the larva of <hi
                    rend="italic">Graptolitha (Conchylis) botrana</hi> attacks the flowers and

                    the disease first appeared in France about the same time, in the neighbourhood
                    of Tarascon. From the department of Gard the infection spread south to the sea,
                    and east, west, and north, till the south-eastern corner of France was
                    thoroughly infected. Another centre of infection arose a few years later near
                    Bordeaux in Gironde, whence the disease spread till the whole of the southern
                    half of France was more or less severely attacked. The parasite was first
                    discovered in France in the year 1868. The <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera</hi> has
                    spread to Corsica; it has appeared here and there amongst the vineyards of the
                    Rhine and Switzerland; it is found in Spain and Portugal, Austria, Hungary,
                    Italy, and Greece; and in 1885 its presence was discovered in Australia
                    (Victoria), at the Cape of Good Hope, and in Algeria. Hence it is no
                    exaggeration to say that with very few exceptions its distribution is
                    co-extensive with that of the cultivated grapevine.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of the disease, by means of which an infected spot may be readily
                    recognized, are these. The vines are stunted and bear few leaves, and those
                    small ones. When the disease reaches an advanced stage, the leaves are
                    discoloured, yellow or reddish, with their edges turned back, and withered. The
                    grapes are arrested in their growth and their skin is wrinkled. If the roots are
                    examined, numerous fusiform swellings are found upon the smaller rootlets. These
                    are at first yellowish in colour and fleshy; but as they grow older they become
                    rotten and assume a brown or black colour. If the roots on which these swellings
                    occur be examined with a lens, a number of minute insects of a yellowish brown
                    colour are observed; these are the root - forms (radicola) of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloxera</hi> (fig. 1); they are about ∙8 mm. long, of an oval outline, and
                    with a swollen body. No distinction between head, thorax, and abdomen can be
                    observed. The head bears small red eyes and a pair of three-jointed antennae,
                    the first two joints being short and thick, the third more elongated, with the
                    end cut off obliquely and slightly hollowed out. Underneath, between the legs,
                    lies the rostrum, which reaches back to the abdomen. The insect is fixed by this
                    rostrum, which is inserted into the root of the vine for the purpose of sucking
                    the sap. The abdomen consists of seven segments, and these as well as the
                    anterior segments bear four rows of small tubercles on their dorsal surface.
                    These root-dwelling insects are females, which lay parthenogenetic eggs. The
                    insect is fixed by its proboscis, but moves its abdomen about and lays thirty to
                    forty yellow eggs in small clusters. After the lapse of six, eight, or twelve
                    days, according to the temperature, the larvae hatch out of the eggs. These are
                    light yellow in colour and in appearance resemble their mother, but with
                    relatively larger appendages. They move actively about for a few days and then,
                    having selected a convenient place on the young roots, insert their proboscis
                    and become stationary. They moult five times, becoming with each change of skin
                    darker in colour; in about three weeks they become adult and capable of laying
                    parthenogenetic eggs. In this way the insect increases with appalling rapidity:
                    it has been calculated that a single mother which dies after laying her eggs in
                    March would have over 25,000,000 descendants by October. If, however, the insect
                    were content with this method of reproduction, the disease could be isolated by
                    surrounding the infected patches with a deep ditch full of some such substance
                    as coal-tar, which would prevent the insects spreading on to the roots of
                    healthy vines. The fertility of the parthenogenetically-produced insects would
                    also diminish after a certain number of generations had been produced.</p>
                <p>As the summer wears on a second form of insect appears amongst the root-dwellers,
                    though hatched from the same eggs as the form described above. These are the
                    nymphs, destined to acquire wings; their body is more slender in outline, and at
                    first they bear well-marked tubercles. After several moults the rudiments of two
                    pairs of wings appear, and then the insect creeps up to the surface of the
                    earth, and on to the vine. Here it undergoes its fifth and last moult, and
                    appears as a winged female, capable of reproducing parthenogenetically. The
                    winged form has a slender body with distinct head (fig. 2). The eyes are well
                    developed, with numerous facets; the antennae have three joints, the terminal
                    one shaped like that of the root-dwellers. The wings are transparent, with few
                    nervures, and are well adapted for flight. The anterior pair reach far beyond
                    the end of the abdomen; the posterior are narrower and not so long. These winged
                    forms are about 1 mm. long. They fly about from July till October, living upon
                    the sap of the vine, which is sucked up by the rostrum from the leaves or buds.
                    They lay their parthenogenetically-produced eggs in the angles of the veins of
                    the leaves, in the buds, or, if the season is already far advanced, in the bark.
                    In very damp or cold weather the insect remains in the ground near the surface,
                    and deposits its eggs there. The eggs are very few in number and of two sizes,
                    small and large (fig. 4, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c). From the larger a
                    female (fig. 3) is hatched in eight or ten days, and simultaneously, for the
                    first time in the life-history of the <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera,</hi> a male
                    (fig. 4) appears from the smaller egg. Neither male nor female has wings; the
                    rostrum is replaced by a functionless tubercle; and there is no alimentary
                    canal. The female is larger than the male and differs from it and the other
                    forms in the last joint of the antennae. The life of these sexual forms lasts
                    but a few days, and is entirely taken up with reproduction. The female is
                    fertilized by the male and three or four days later lays a single egg—the winter
                    egg—and then dies. This egg is laid in the crevices of the bark of the vine, and
                    as it is protectively coloured it is almost impossible to find it. Here the
                    winter eggs remain undeveloped during the cold months; but in the following
                    spring, as a rule in the month of April, they give birth to a female insect
                    without wings, which resembles the root-dwelling forms, but has pointed
                    antennae. These forms are termed the stock-mothers; they creep into the buds of
                    the vine, and, as these develop into the young leaves, insert their proboscis
                    into the upper side. By this means a gall is produced on the under side of the
                    leaf. The gall is cup-shaped, and its outer surface is crumpled and covered with
                    small warts and hairs. The opening upon the upper surface of the leaf is
                    protected by similar structures. Within this gall the stockmother lives and
                    surrounds herself with numerous parthenogenetic-ally-produced eggs,—sometimes as
                    many as two hundred in a single gall; these eggs give birth after six or eight
                    days to a numerous progeny (gallicola), some of which form new galls and
                    multiply in the leaves, whilst others descend to the roots and become the
                    rootdwelling forms already described. The galls and the gall-producing form are
                    much commoner in America than in the Old World.</p>
                <p>The natural enemies of the <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera</hi> are few in number:
                    they include some mites,— <hi rend="italic">Hoplophora arctata, Thyroglyphus
                    phylloxerae,</hi> —and the millepede <hi rend="italic">Polyxeniis lagurus,</hi>
                    which devours the subterranean forms. Innumerable artifices have been proposed
                    to combat the terrible disease caused by this minute insect, but none of them
                    seem to be completely successful. As a rule the means suggested<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0261-0240"/> are to render the soil uninhabitable for the root
                    forms by injecting certain chemical poisons. Since the importance of the winter
                    egg in the life-history of the insect was demonstrated by Balbiani, attempts
                    have been made to destroy these eggs by rubbing the branches with a chain-armour
                    glove, or some such contrivance for removing the outer layers of the bark, which
                    should be burnt. Again, certain varieties of American vines, which have the
                    reputation of being <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera</hi> proof, have been grafted
                    on European stocks; but this has proved to be only a doubtful success as regards
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera,</hi> whilst the wine made from such vines has
                    undoubtedly deteriorated. The treatment which has been most successful is
                    periodically to submerge the vineyard for a period of not less than forty days.
                    Where this plan has been tried, it has been most successful; unfortunately the
                    majority of vineyards are planted on hill-sides and other places where this
                    method of treatment is impracticable. The root-dwelling forms do not thrive in a
                    sandy soil; hence vines grown in a district where such soil is found usually
                    escape the disease.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fungoid Diseases.—</hi> The most destructive form of fungoid
                    disease which attacks the vine is caused by a Pyrenomycetous fungus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oidium (Erysiphe) Tuckeri.</hi> The disease was first noticed in
                    England in 1845; in 1848 it appeared at Versailles; by 1851 it had spread
                    through all the wine-producing countries of Europe, being especially virulent in
                    the lands bordering on the Mediterranean; and in the following year it made its
                    appearance in Madeira. There is little doubt that, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylloxera,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Oidium</hi> is in its origin American.
                    The disease is characterized by the appearance of a white mycelium on the young
                    leaves; this spreads quickly and attacks the older leaves and branches, and
                    ultimately reaches the grapes. At first these are marked only by small brown
                    spots; but the spots spread and fuse together, the skin of the grape is
                    destroyed, and the flesh decays, the seed only remaining apparently untouched.
                    The disease spreads by the mycelium growing over the epidermis of the plant. The
                    hyphae composing the mycelium are provided with haustoria, which project into
                    the cells of the affected part. Some of the hyphae which project from the leaf
                    bear conidia, which are constricted off one at a time, and it is by their means
                    that the fungus spreads. The perithecia have not yet been discovered in Europe.
                    But it is not impossible that this stage of the life-history of <hi
                    rend="italic">Oidium</hi> exists in the United States in the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">Uncinula spiralis,</hi> which causes a widely spread disease
                    amongst the American vines. The <hi rend="italic">Oidium</hi> is in its turn
                    attacked by a fungus of the same tribe, <hi rend="italic">Cicinnobolus
                    Cesatii,</hi> De By, which lives parasitically within the hyphae of its host,
                    and at times even succeeds in destroying it. The means which have proved most
                    efficacious, both as a remedy and a preventative of this disease, is to scatter
                    flower of sulphur over the vines, before the morning dew has evaporated. Another
                    method is to boil one part of lime with three parts of sulphur, and to sprinkle
                    the mixture over the affected plants.</p>
                <p>Another fungus which attacks vines, especially those of America, is <hi
                    rend="italic">Peronospora viticola.</hi> The mycelium spreads through the green
                    parts of the plant, attacking the leaves, twigs, and unripe grapes. On the upper
                    side of the leaf, where it is first visible, it forms pale green irregular
                    spots, which become darker in colour. On the under side of the leaf these
                    patches are white and are composed of the spore-bearing hyphae. The leaf
                    ultimately becomes dried up and brittle. The grapes which are attacked cease to
                    grow, turn brown or white, and ultimately dry up and fall off. This disease has
                    been successfully treated with a spray of copper sulphate and lime, or sulphate
                    of iron; solutions of these salts prevent the conidia from germinating.</p>
                <p>Anthracnose is the name usually given to a disease which was formerly known as
                    “charbon,” “pech,” or “brenner.” This disease is caused by the parasitism of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphaceloma ampelinum,</hi> one of the Pyrenomycetous fungi. The
                    fungus assails all the green parts of the vine, and injures the leaves and young
                    shoots as much as it does the grape itself. The first sign of its presence is
                    the appearance of a minute spot, which is greyish in the centre, with a brown
                    border. This spot increases in size; in the stalks it assumes an oval shape,
                    with its long axis parallel to the stalk, whilst in the leaves and grapes it is
                    more or less circular in outline. The centre of the spots on the grapes becomes
                    darker as the disease advances, and a red line appears dividing the dark brown
                    border into an outer and an inner rim and giving a very characteristic
                    appearance to the diseased plant. The berries do not shrivel up as those do that
                    are affected by the black rot. The mycelium of <hi rend="italic">Sphaceloma</hi>
                    grows just beneath the cuticle of the vine, through which it soon bursts, giving
                    rise to a number of minute hyphae, which bear conidia. These are minute, oval,
                    colourless spores, which serve to spread the disease over the vineyard and from
                    place to place. The complete life-history of this form is at present unknown;
                    and information as to where the fungus passes the winter, and in what form,
                    would probably afford some useful indications as to the method that should be
                    adopted to combat the disease. Anthracnose has been known in Europe for many
                    years, but has only been observed in America since 1881, whither it was probably
                    imported from the Old World. As a preventative to its attacks a solution (50 per
                    cent.) of iron sulphate has been found very useful, as well as care in planting
                    on well-drained soil that does not lie too low, the disease seldom appealing in
                    dry, well-exposed vineyards.</p>
                <p>The black rot, like the <hi rend="italic">Oidium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.
                    viticola,</hi> is American in its origin. It has been known and observed there
                    since 1848, but appeared for the first time in France in 1885. The disease is
                    caused by a fungus, <hi rend="italic">Physalospora Bidwellii,</hi> Sacc. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phoma uvicola),</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrenomycetes,</hi> and by some authorities it has been considered to be a
                    further stage in the life-history of <hi rend="italic">Sphaceloma.</hi> The
                    fungus confines its attacks to the grapes, the leaves and stems being rarely if
                    ever affected. The grapes are not assailed until nearly full-grown, when a
                    brownish spot appears, which spreads over the whole grape. The latter at first
                    retains its plumpness, but on the appearance of little black pustules, which
                    first occur on the part first affected, the grape begins to shrivel. This
                    continues until the grape is reduced to a black hard mass, with the folds of
                    skin pressed closely against the seed. The disease does not spread from grape to
                    grape, so that as a rule only a certain number of grapes in a bunch are
                    destroyed. The hyphae of the mycelium of this fungus are septate, with numerous
                    short branches. The pustules on the surface are due to fructifications,
                    pycnidia, and spermagonia. The presence of conidia has also been recently
                    demonstrated. The fungus passes the winter in the withered grapes which fall to
                    the ground; hence every care should be taken to collect these and bum them. The
                    use of the solutions mentioned above may also be recommended as a
                    preventative.</p>
                <p>Among the other fungi which infest the vine may be mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phyllosticta viticola</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ph. Labruscae,</hi> which,
                    when the attack is severe, cause the destruction of the leaves, the only part
                    they assail. These, like the foregoing, are members of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrenomycetes.</hi> To the same class belongs also <hi rend="italic">Cercospora
                    vitis (Cladosporium viticolum),</hi> which has club-shaped spores of a
                    green-brown colour. This also attacks the leaves; but, unless the season is
                    extremely unfavourable, it does little harm.</p>
                <p>A very disastrous root-disease of the vine is due to the ravages of the fungus
                    <hi rend="italic">Dematophora necatrix,</hi> which forms subterranean strings of
                    mycelium—so-called rhizomorphs—the fructification of which is as yet not known;
                    it forms conidia and sclerotia, however, and presents certain analogies to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Discomycetes.</hi> The diseased roots have been confounded
                    with those attacked by <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera.</hi> The only mode of
                    combating the malady seems to be to uproot the plants and burn them. Isolation
                    of the diseased areas by means of trenches has also been practised. This fungus
                    has extended its ravages considerably in southern France and Switzerland within
                    the last ten years. (A. E. S.)</p>
