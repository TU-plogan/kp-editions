                    Madrid, in a house in the Platerias or jewellers’ quarter adjoining the Puerta
                    de Guadalajara. His father and mother, Felix de Vega and Francisca Hernandez,
                    belonged to the lesser provincial nobility, and originally came from the valley
                    of Carriedo in Asturias, where the hamlet of Vega still exists. How they came by
                    the illustrious name of Carpio is not very clear; the family tradition which
                    made them descendants of the famous Bernardo seems insufficiently supported.
                    Lope himself frankly ridiculed the aristocratic pretensions of his parents; but
                    this did not prevent him from invariably signing his comedies at full length as
                    Lope de Vega Carpio. Lope began his studies in the imperial college, the
                    principal establishment of the Jesuits in Madrid, where he was instructed in
                    grammar and rhetoric. His precocity was extraordinary and his memory astounding.
                    At five he read not only Spanish but Latin, and already showed such a passion
                    for poetry that he would give up part of his meals to the older boys in exchange
                    for their services in writing out verses to his dictation. It was not the way of
                    the Jesuits to turn out pedants; educators of the nobility, their single aim was
                    to make their pupils accomplished men of the world, and accordingly Lope learned
                    with them, besides the ordinary book-lessons, the accomplishments of singing and
                    dancing and fencing. On leaving college—where he had been guilty of an escapade
                    of some sort along with one of his companions—he was placed by his parents, who
                    were far from wealthy, in the service of Don Gerónimo Manrique, bishop of Avila.
                    Such an arrangement did not at that time involve any sacrifice of dignity: it
                    was almost the only resource open to a multitude of needy gentlemen, <hi
                    rend="italic">hidalgos,</hi> who, to avoid entering a trade, which would have
                    compromised their position, found in the palaces of the higher aristocracy,
                    first as pages and afterwards as secretaries, the wherewithal to <hi
                    rend="italic">pasar la vida,</hi> as the phrase ran. In the service of Don
                    Gerónimo, Lope appears to have begun the composition of his earlier dramas. But
                    after a while he quitted the bishop’s service to enter the university of Alcalá,
                    where for four years he devoted himself to what was then honoured with the name
                    of philosophy, crammed his brain with names and citations from ancient writers,
                    and acquired the habit of disputing in accordance with the formulae of the
                    schools. It was then that he accumulated the materials for the pedantic
                    dissertations with which the prefaces to his various works are encumbered, in
                    which he so complacently displays everything that he has remembered of his
                    university days. Leaving Alcalá with the degree of bachelor in arts, Lope became
                    secretary to the duke of Alva. Some time afterwards, about 1584, he married
                    Isabel de Urbina, daughter of a herald-at-arms of Philip II. An incident such as
                    he often afterwards reproduced in his plays soon arose to disturb the union.
                    Some one who had spoken ill of Lope, and had in turn been severely lampooned by
                    the poet, challenged him. In the encounter Lope wounded his opponent; but he was
                    unable to put himself right with the law and was compelled to take to flight.
                    Perhaps he may have had upon his conscience some other peccadilloes which
                    prejudiced him in the eyes of his judges, as seems to be hinted in Montalban’s
                    words, “This vexatious affair, and certain other bad turns of fortune, . . .
                    compelled him to leave his home, his country, and his wife.” He retired to
                    Valencia, where he met with an enthusiastic reception from a group of young
                    poets, who were destined afterwards to range themselves under the banner of the
                    creator of the new comedy. After the lapse of two years Lope returned to Madrid;
                    but in 1588 his wife died after giving birth to a daughter, who did not long
                    survive her mother. The death of his wife and daughter were doubtless what now
                    led him to join the Invincible Armada, in which expedition he had one of his
                    brothers shot dead by his side. Once more at Madrid, he again entered service,
                    becoming secretary, first to the marquis of Malpica and afterwards to the duke
                    of Lemos. Meanwhile he married a second wife, Juana de Guardio, a Madrileña, by
                    whom he had two children (Carlos, who died in infancy, and Feliciana Felix); but
                    she died, shortly after giving birth to the latter, in 1612. During this wife’s
                    lifetime the poet had by a mistress, Maria de Luxan, two other children,—Marcela
                    del Carpio, who became a nun, and Lope Felix del Carpio y Luxan, who chose the
                    profession of arms and perished at sea at the age of fifteen. Widowed a second
                    time, Lope, like many other men of letters of the period, sought a refuge in the
                    church. After a period of initiation, and after having been for some time
                    affiliated to a tertiary order, he took priest’s orders. At this juncture, that
                    is to say, about 1614, he was in the very zenith of his glory. A veritable
                    dictator and pope in the Spanish world of letters, he wielded over all the
                    authors of his nation a sort of magisterial power similar to that which was
                    exercised in France at a later period by Voltaire. At this distance of time we
                    fail to see in Lope anything more than a great dramatic poet, the founder of the
                    Spanish theatre; but to his contemporaries he was a great deal more. His epics,
                    his pastorals, his odes, his sonnets, buried though they now are in oblivion,
                    all placed him in the front rank of authorship. Such was his prestige that he
                    dealt with his noble patrons almost on a footing of equality. The duke of Sesa
                    in particular, his last Maecenas, was also his personal friend, and the tone of
                    the letters addressed to him by the poet is that of a frank familiarity,
                    modified only by some forms of deference,—a fact sufficiently striking to be
                    worthy of notice at a time when talent, however great, in no way diminished
                    differences of rank, and when the man of letters under the protection of a
                    patron was neither more nor less than a kind of domestic in the house of a <hi
                    rend="italic">grand seigneur.</hi> Lope’s fame, too, had travelled abroad:
                    foreigners of distinction passing through Madrid made a point of visiting him;
                    papal legates brought him the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0137-0122"/> compliments of their master; in 1627 Urban VIII.,
                    a Barberini, sent him the diploma of doctor of theology in the Collegium
                    Sapientiae and the cross of the order of St John of Jerusalem (whence the poet’s
                    titles of <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frey).</hi> Since
                    Lope’s correspondence with the duke of Sesa has made us acquainted with the
                    closing period of his life, we may well ask whether his retirement within the
                    church was the result of any genuine vocation, and up to what point his devotion
                    was sincere. It is difficult to avoid inquiring whether it may not have been due
                    to a mere selfish desire for tranquillity, a desire to protect himself against
                    any further reverse of fortune. This feeling may very well have had something to
                    do with his decision; still it would be unjust to regard Lope as nothing better
                    than a mere hypocrite. Certainly he was far from being an ideal priest; we now
                    know something of the nature of the services which he often rendered to the duke
                    of Sesa, and we know how lightly he held one of his most sacred vows,
                    maintaining for a long period illicit relations with Marta de Nevares Santoyo, a
                    married woman, by whom he even had a daughter, who was baptized very publicly at
                    San Sebastian in Madrid (26th August 1617), the son of the duke of Sesa acting
                    as godfather. But, on the other hand, we must not forget his penitence,
                    frequently expressed in touching terms, the sincerity of which ought to be above
                    suspicion: “Mal haya amor que se quiere oponer al cielo !” He has a claim also
                    to our pity for having been at an advanced age the victim of foolish passion
                    which his extreme mobility of character and his utter want of balance made him
                    unable to resist: “Yo nací en dos extremos que son amar y aborrecer; no he
                    tenido medio jamás.” His last years were years of severe penance: Montalban
                    tells us that every Friday the poet scourged himself so severely that the walls
                    of his room were sprinkled with his blood. His death, on 27th August 1635, was
                    followed by national mourning. The duke of Sesa, his executor, was chief
                    mourner; the nobility and the church were represented by high dignitaries; the
                    populace crowded the streets. After the funeral came a multitude of funeral
                    orations and of panegyrics in prose and verse. Montalban has collected into a
                    volume the tributes of posthumous admiration thus paid by Spanish authors;
                    another collection was printed in Italy under the auspices of Marini.</p>
                <p>In the intercourse of everyday life, in his relations with his contemporaries,
                    Lope was affable and kindly. He sometimes defended himself when attacked,
                    especially on the subject of his dramatic writings, but always in measured terms
                    and without any pretence that his high position exempted him from criticism by
                    his less successful rivals. Some severe and unjust criticisms on other writers,
                    notably on Cervantes, are quoted against him; but it is only fair to remember
                    that they occur in letters to his intimates and that it is not necessary to
                    regard them as deliberate. It would be just as fair to set him down as an enemy
                    of the secular clergy because in writing to the duke of Sesa he on one occasion
                    expressed himself thus freely about the monks: “Los frailes son los hombres mas
                    discretos del mundo: no van a la guerra, ni pagan millones, gozan lo mejor, y
                    danles dineros, . . . ellos hacen hijos y otros los crian, perdone lo descalzo.”
                    It would indeed be more just to reproach him with his universal and uniform
                    indulgence, which he extends to all, great and small, good and bad, and with his
                    mania for praising in hyperbolical and extravagant terms. He loved all the arts,
                    particularly painting; his little house in the Calle de Francos was full of
                    pictures. He himself writes to a friend in 1619: “With some garden flowers,
                    half-a-dozen pictures, and a few books, I live without envy, without desire,
                    without fear, and without hope” (dedication of <hi rend="italic">El Alcalde
                    Mayor).</hi> But his most marked taste was for flowers. He had a small garden,
                    which he himself tended with jealous care; he sought out rare species and tried
                    to acclimatize in Spain varieties of plants sent by his friends from abroad. In
                    particular he was a tulip - fancier; hence his dedication of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lucinda Perseguida</hi> to Manuel Sueiro, a Spaniard resident in Flanders who
                    had supplied him with fine specimens. Tending this garden became the great
                    occupation of his old age; he watered it with his own hands, and, according to
                    Montalban, the chill which led to his death was caught while he was thus
                    engaged.</p>
                <p>One can easily detect in his writings the traces of this taste. It is not that he
                    had in a higher degree than his contemporaries the feeling for nature, but the
                    form, the colour, the perfume of flowers largely supply him with his figures and
                    metaphors—his flowers of rhetoric, in short. It is to be regretted that this
                    delicate taste of his, a taste very rare in Spain, where flowers and trees have
                    never been greatly cared for, should have contributed rather to augment than to
                    lessen the elaborateness, pomposity, and affectation of his style. But these
                    faults were shared by all the writers of that age. In his comedies, for example,
                    where he does not pique himself on a fine style and does not attempt to take the
                    Latins or the Italians for his models, his language is, if not nervous and
                    self-restrained, at least limpid and flowing, in this respect contrasting very
                    favourably with the florid and laboured style of his epics and prose pastorals.
                    Viewed broadly, and leaving out of account certain theories which in the long
                    run greatly influenced his manner of writing, Lope belonged in literature to
                    what may be called the school of good sense; he made it his boast that he was a
                    Spaniard <hi rend="italic">pur sang,</hi> and steadfastly maintained that a
                    writer’s business is to write so as to make himself understood. When brought
                    face to face with the coterie of the <hi rend="italic">précieux</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">quintessenciés,</hi> the “cultos,” and “criticos,” and
                    “conceptistas,” Lope takes the position of a defender of the language of
                    ordinary life, the good old Castilian tongue. In the dispute which arose between
                    the partisans of the two schools of “cultos” or “culteranos” and “llanos,” the
                    dramatist ranged himself on the side of the latter. In the matter of
                    versification he refuses to admit that the long Italian verse has the advantage
                    of the Castilian octosyllabic: “No pienso que el verso largo Italiano haga
                    ventaja al nuestro, que si en Espana lo dizen es porque, no sabiendo hazer el
                    suyo, se passan al estrangero como mas largo y licencioso. . . . Qué cosa iguala
                    á una redondilla de Garci Sanchez ό Don Diego de Mendoza ?” (Preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Isidro).</hi> Unfortunately the books that he read, his literary
                    connexions, his fear of being unfavourably judged by the Italians, all exercised
                    an influence upon his naturally robust spirit, and, like so many others, he
                    caught the prevalent contagion of mannerism and of empty and pompous
                    phraseology. In his studies at the imperial college and at Alcala Lope had never
                    found his way up to the truest and highest sources of the beautiful; he had
                    never attempted Greek, but had contented himself with Latin, which he chose to
                    regard as the only ancient tongue which a man of letters needed to learn. To his
                    natural son, Lope Felix del Carpio, when entering upon his Latin studies, he
                    wrote, ‘ ‘ So you have begun to grapple with the rudiments? It is one of the
                    things which cannot possibly be avoided; but, for all that, if I could find some
                    one to teach you your own language well, I should be quite satisfied, for I have
                    seen too many of those who, having learned Latin, are ignorant of their native
                    tongue and affect to despise everything written in the vulgar idiom. What
                    presumption to forget that the Greeks did not write in Latin or the Latins in
                    Greek! I confess I laugh whenever I see men giving themselves out for Latin
                    poets who write in their own language like mere barbarians; and I conclude that
                    they cannot possibly have been born poets, for the true poet (there is not more
                    than one, they say, in a generation) writes in his own language, and it is
                    therein that he shows his excellence,—witness Petrarch in Italy, Ronsard in
                    France, and Garcilaso in Spain. Nevertheless I do not wish to discourage you
                    from learning that queen of languages (Latin), the third in the world in point
                    of antiquity. Try to know it as well as you can, my son, but by no means learn
                    Greek, for I would not have you like those who strut and give themselves airs
                    because they have acquired a smattering of it. Greek tends too much to vanity,
                    and what is the use of learning a language which is known to so few ?” After
                    thus warning his son against the dangers of Greek, Lope adds other counsels
                    which reveal to us his feelings towards his own bygone days. “Have but few
                    books, and those choose with care; diligently observe the thoughts they contain,
                    and do not let anything noteworthy pass without a mark on the margin. Should it
                    be your misfortune to become a maker of verses (which God forbid !) try at least
                    not to make that your chief occupation, nor let it divert you from more
                    important matters, for therein you will spend your time to no profit. The less
                    of verse you make the more you will be esteemed and appreciated. You need only
                    take an example from me. Certainly you will never be able to render more
                    services than I have done to so many patrons, and see to what my diligence has
                    brought me,—to the smallest of houses, a narrow bed, a poor table, and a patch
                    of garden, the flowers of which dispel my cares and supply me with ideas.” Lope
                    knew only Latin, but this he knew well. Yet, instead of filling himself with the
                    spirit of antiquity, and purifying his taste by contact with its literary
                    masters, he regarded their writings as nothing more than repertories of
                    beautiful and out-of-the-way expressions. After the Latins Lope turned by
                    preference to the Italians. Like every other Spanish man of letters of his time,
                    he had been reared on Italian literature: he knew intimately the works of its
                    great poets of the Renaissance, especially Ariosto and Tasso, as well as
                    Sannazaro, the last-named of whom he imitated on several occasions; <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0138-0123"/> he kept a steady watch upon all that was
                    published in Italy, cultivated carefully the connexions he had established with
                    Italian writers of repute, and was always flattered by the eulogies which
                    reached him from that quarter. His principal friend and correspondent in Italy
                    was the Neapolitan poet, G. B. Marini, one of the worst corrupters of Italian
                    literature (see vol. xiii. p. 511). He puts himself at Marini’s feet, calls him
                    <hi rend="italic">antistes Musarum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Italiae
                    décos,</hi> sends him his portrait, and humbly begs his indulgence for a drama
                    which he has been so bold as to dedicate to him (see dedication to <hi
                    rend="italic">Virtud, Pobreza, y Muger).</hi> Lope knew French also, and his
                    works give evidence of an acquaintance with French poetry of the 16th and 17th
                    centuries such as is rare in Spain; he occasionally quotes Ronsard and Malherbe,
                    and shows solicitude as to French opinion about his dramatic writings. In a
                    word, his literary culture was chiefly Latin-Italian; and, if he defends the
                    tradition of the nation, and the pure simplicity of the old Castilian against
                    “los de la nueva poesia,” that is to say, the innovators of the school of
                    Gongora, and against the jargon of the “cultos,” still he does not wish to be
                    taken for an uninformed person, for a mere casual litterateur devoid of
                    classical training: he especially emphasizes the fact that he has passed through
                    the university, and is continually accentuating the difference between the
                    “ingenios científicos” (those who know Latin) and “legos ignorantes” (ignorant
                    laymen). With what a sense of superiority, for example, does he mention that
                    Cervantes was not to his mind sufficiently “científico” (preface to <hi
                    rend="italic">Las Fortunas de Diana),</hi> the fact being that Cervantes had
                    been neither at Alcala nor at Salamanca!</p>
                <p>For a rapid survey of the works of Lope, it is convenient to begin with those
                    which the Spaniards include under the name of <hi rend="italic">Obras
                    Sueltas,</hi> the title of the large collection of the poet’s non-dramatic works
                    (Madrid, 21 vols. 4to, 1776-79). We shall enumerate the most important of these,
                    as far as possible in the order of publication. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcadia</hi> (1598), a pastoral romance, composed at the instance of the duke
                    of Alva, and inspired by Sannazaro, Montemayor, and Cervantes, is one of the
                    poet’s feeblest and most wearisome productions. <hi rend="italic">Isidro</hi>
                    (1599), a narrative of the life of Isidore, patron of Madrid, is called a
                    Castilian poem on account of the rhythm in which it is composed,— <hi
                    rend="italic">quintillas</hi> of octosyllabic verse. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermosura de Angélica</hi> (1602), in three books, is a sort of continuation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso,</hi> in octaves after the fashion of the
                    original poem. Similar in form is <hi rend="italic">La Dragontea,</hi> a
                    fantastic history of the last expedition and the death of Sir Francis Drake, who
                    was such a terror to the fleets and the coast of Spain that his name had become
                    a synonym for that of the evil one. Finally the <hi rend="italic">Rimas</hi> are
                    a miscellany of short pieces. In 1604 was published the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peregrino en su Patria,</hi> a romance in prose and verse, similar in kind to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopica</hi> of Heliodorus; it is a mediocre work, but
                    of great bibliographical interest, on account of its authentic list of the
                    comedies which Lope recognized as having been written by him up to that date, a
                    list which he augmented by 114 new titles in the 1618 edition of the novel. The
                    more Lope composed poetry the more he went to the Italian poets for inspiration,
                    labouring to show that the mechanism of the Italian octave was as familiar to
                    him as that of the national redondilla. Having imitated Ariosto, he proceeded to
                    imitate Tasso; but his <hi rend="italic">Jerusalem Conquistada</hi> (1609) has
                    preserved nothing of the art shown in its model, and is a dull and insipid
                    performance. Little need be said about the <hi rend="italic">Pastores de
                    Belen</hi> (1612), a sort of pious pastoral, dedicated to his son Carlos, which
                    forms a pendant to his secular <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> or about the
                    incidental pieces which he published in connexion with the solemnities of the
                    beatification and canonization of St Isidore in 1620 and 1622. And it is enough
                    simply to mention <hi rend="italic">La Filomena</hi> (1621), <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Circe</hi> (1624), and other poems published about the same date, as also
                    the four prose novels, <hi rend="italic">Las Fortunas de Diana, El Desdichado
                    por la Honra, La Mas Prudente Venganza,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guzman el
                    Bravo.</hi> The great success of the <hi rend="italic">Novelas Egemplares</hi>
                    of Cervantes (1613) had stimulated Lope, who wished to measure himself with the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> on the field of the novel; and, as
                    this literary form had been borrowed from the Italians, he expected to achieve a
                    success as great as that which he supposed to be already his in the fields of
                    pastoral romance and epic poetry. But in this instance at least the "
                    cientifíco” was completely defeated by the “lego”: Lope’s novels have none of
                    the grace, naturalness, or interest which characterize those of his rival. The
                    last important work which has to be mentioned before we leave the narrative
                    poetry of Lope is the <hi rend="italic">Laurel de Apolo</hi> (1630). This piece
                    describes the coronation of the poets of Spain on Helicon by Apollo. All of
                    them—good, middling, and bad—share in the ceremonial, and among the poets
                    properly so called appear some other men of letters, certain important
                    personages to whom Lope felt under obligations, which could not be more
                    satisfactorily paid than in the current coin of verse which he had so readily at
                    his command. This work is more meritorious as a bibliographical manual of
                    Spanish poetry at that time than as genuine poetry. One other “obra suelta,”
                    closely akin to Lope’s dramatic works, though not properly speaking a drama, is
                    <hi rend="italic">La Dorotea</hi> (1632). Lope describes it as an “action in
                    prose,” but it is rather a “romance in dialogue”; for, although divided into
                    acts, the narrative has nothing dramatic about it except its outward form; and
                    on account of its size and the digressions with which it is encumbered it has
                    never succeeded in finding its way to the stage. It belongs to the class of
                    which <hi rend="italic">Celestina</hi> is the type, in so far as one of the
                    principal characters, La Gerarda, is a go-between; but Lope has amplified his
                    model, idealized it, and purged away much of the grossness belonging to the mean
                    surroundings of the character of the original <hi rend="italic">Celestina</hi>
                    and common to the numerous works of the 16th and 17th centuries to which it gave
                    rise. Of all Lope’s productions <hi rend="italic">Dorotea</hi> is undoubtedly
                    that which shows most observation and study; the style also is unusually simple
                    and easy. The attempt has sometimes been made to discover in the adventures of
                    Fernando, one of its heroes, allusions to Lope’s early youth; but there is
                    nothing conclusive in any of the supposed coincidences between fact and fiction
                    which Fauriel and others after him have sought to establish. Of all this mass of
                    <hi rend="italic">Obras Sueltas,</hi> filling more than twenty volumes, very
                    little (leaving <hi rend="italic">Dorotea</hi> out of account) holds its own in
                    the impartial judgment of posterity. The long epic or narrative poems are quite
                    unreadable, and almost the same must be said of the pastorals and novels. The
                    lyrical element alone retains some vitality. From the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rimas</hi> and other collections of detached pieces one could compile a
                    pleasing anthology of sonnets, epistles, elegies, and romances, to which it
                    would be proper to add the <hi rend="italic">Gatomaquia,</hi> a burlesque poem
                    published along with other metrical pieces in 1634 by Lope under the pseudonym
                    of Tomé de Burguillos. But here the list would have to stop.</p>
                <p>It is, however, to his dramatic writings that Lope owes his very considerable
                    place in literary history. It is very curious to notice how he himself seizes
                    every available occasion for depreciating the work of the drama, treats the art
                    of comedy-writing as one of the humblest of trades (<hi rend="italic">de pane
                    lucrando),</hi> and protests against the supposition that in writing for the
                    stage his aim is glory and not money.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Algunos que piensan que las escribo por opinion;
                    desengañeles V. Μ. y digales que por dinero.</p></note> The reason is not far to
                    seek. The Spanish drama, which, if not literally the creation of Lope, at least
                    owes to him its definitive form—the three-act comedy—was totally regardless of
                    the precepts of the school, the pseudo-Aristotelianism of the doctors of the
                    period. Lope accordingly, who stood in awe of the criticism of the
                    “cientificos,” felt bound to let them see that, from the point of view of
                    literary art, he attached no value to the “rustic fruits of his humble <hi
                    rend="italic">vega.”</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Arte Nuevo de Hacer Comedias
                    en Este Tiempo,</hi> which was published in 1609 and is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ars Poetica</hi> of the new school, Lope begins by showing that he knows as
                    well as any one the established rules of poetry, and then excuses himself for
                    his inability to follow them on the ground that the " vulgar” Spaniard cares
                    nothing about them. “Let us then speak to him in the language of fools, since it
                    is he who pays us.” Under such conditions all that the dramatic poet can do is
                    to plan ingenious plots, so as adroitly to sustain the interest and retard as
                    long as possible the denouement, for nothing is more displeasing to the ordinary
                    public than to be able to divine too soon the solution of the problem set before
                    them on the boards of the theatre. Such, with a few pieces of advice as to the
                    choice of metres and the costume of the actors, is the recipe for the new or
                    free comedy, a barbarous kind of literature, according to Lope, and outside the
                    region of art, yet the only drama possible in Spain.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Las comedias de España no guardan el arte . .
                    . porque con aquel rigor de ninguna manera fueran oidas de los
                    Españoles.</p></note> Another reason, more serious still, which made it
                    necessary for him to speak deprecatingly of his dramatic works is the
                    circumstance that the vast majority of them were written in haste and to order,
                    precisely like so many feuilleton romances of Alexandre Dumas; they are for the
                    most part <hi rend="italic">comedias de repente,</hi> hurriedly conceived at the
                    request of some grandee or of some impresario or manager. The poet does not
                    hesitate to confess that “more than a hundred of my comedies have taken only
                    twenty-four hours to pass from my brain to the boards of the theatre.” Perez de
                    Montalban, who has a great admiration for this kind of cleverness, tells how, at
                    Toledo, on a certain occasion, Lope composed fifteen acts in fifteen days—that
                    is to say, five entire comedies, which he read to his friends step by step with
                    the process of their composition. On another occasion, when pressed by a manager
                    who wanted something for the carnival, Lope took Montalban as a collaborateur;
                    the two friends parcelled out the comedy between them, Lope undertaking the
                    first act, Montalban the second, and the third, to save time, was divided
                    between them. In two days they had finished the first two acts, and on the third
                    Alon talban rose at two in the morning and at eleven he had finished. Then he
                    went in search of Lope, who, when questioned as to his progress, replied: “I got
                    up at five, finished the act, breakfasted, wrote an epistle of fifty tercets,
                    and have now finished watering the garden, and a rather tough business it has
                    been.” This is not art; it is handicraft, and one understands why Lope sometimes
                    found it prudent to lay stress on the fact that his comedies had been written
                    for the ears of spectators, not for readers in <pb break="no"

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>No las escriví. . . para que de los oydos del
                    teatro se trasladáran á la censura de los aposentos.</p></note> Nevertheless, he
                    did write some dramas in which the plan is more fully matured and the execution
                    more carefully carried out; still, hurried composition and reckless production
                    are after all among the most distinctive marks of his theatrical works. Towards
                    the close of his career Lope somewhat modified the severe and disdainful
                    judgments he had formerly passed upon his dramatic performances; he seems to
                    have had a presentiment that posterity, in spite of the grave defects of his
                    work in that department, would nevertheless place it much higher than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jerusalem Conquistada, La Dragontea,</hi> and other works of which
                    he himself thought so much. In his <hi rend="italic">Egloga á Claudio,</hi>
                    which is, so to say, his literary last will and testament, he claims to have
                    been a creator: “It is to me that the art (of comedy) owes its beginnings,
                    although I have departed from the strictness of Terence, and do not for a moment
                    pretend to deny the part which belongs to the three or four great geniuses who
                    have watched over the infancy of the drama. To whom are we indebted, Claudio,
                    for so many delineations of love and jealousy, so many moving pieces of
                    eloquence, such a copious supply of all the figures which rhetoric has ever been
                    able to invent? All that is produced to-day is nothing but imitation of what art
                    created yesterday. The path,—it is I who have opened it up and made it
                    practicable, and everybody now traverses it with ease. It was I who gave the
                    example which is followed and copied on all hands.” We may certainly credit Lope
                    with creative power, with the instinct which enabled him to reproduce the facts
                    of history or those supplied by the imagination in a multitude of dramatic
                    situations with an astonishing cleverness and flexibility of expression; but
                    unfortunately, instead of concentrating his talent upon the production of a
                    limited number of works which he might have brought to perfection, he dissipated
                    it, so to say, and scattered it to the winds.</p>
                <p>The catalogue of Lope’s comedies has been drawn up by himself; and, in spite of
                    some discrepancies in his figures, it is established that up to 1604 he had
                    composed, in round numbers, as many as 230. In 1609 the figure had risen to 500,
                    in 1618 to 800, in 1620 to 900, in 1625 to 1070, and in 1632 to 1500. Ultimately
                    Montalban in his general survey published in 1636 (<hi rend="italic">Fama
                    Posthuma)</hi> set down the total of Lope’s dramatic productions at 1800
                    comedies and 400 <hi rend="italic">autos sacramentales.</hi> Of this number
                    there are nearly 608 comedies of which the text is extant, or which are at least
                    known to us by their titles (from the lists of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peregrino)</hi>; but the printed or MS. text of only 439 is actually
                    accessible, besides some 40 <hi rend="italic">autos</hi> and a few <hi

                    or as separate issues by booksellers who bought from the actors in an underhand
                    way the manuscripts of their <hi rend="italic">rôles</hi> or else caused the
                    unpublished comedy to be written down from memory by persons whom they sent to
                    attend the first representation. Such pieces therefore as do not figure in the
                    collection published under Lope’s own direction or under that of his friends
                    cannot be regarded as perfectly authentic, and it would be unfair to hold their
                    author responsible for all the faults and defects they exhibit. On the other
                    hand, there exist in various libraries entire comedies in Lope’s own handwriting
                    which have never been printed.</p>
                <p>The classification of this enormous mass of dramatic literature is a task of
                    great difficulty, inasmuch as the terms usually employed, such as comedy,
                    tragedy, and the like, do not apply here. There is not explicitness enough in
                    the division current in Spain, which recognizes three categories :—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">comedias de capa y espada,</hi> the subjects of which are drawn
                    from everyday life and in which the persons appear as simple <hi rend="italic"
                    >caballeros</hi>; (2) <hi rend="italic">comedias de ruido</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">de teatro,</hi> in which kings and princes are the leading
                    characters and the action is accompanied with a greater display of dramatic
                    machinery; (3) <hi rend="italic">comedias divinas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de
                    santos.</hi> Some other arrangement must be attempted. In the first place Lope’s
                    work belongs essentially to the drama of intrigue; be the subject what it may,
                    it is always the plot that determines everything else, not the delineation of
                    manners or of character. Lope in the whole range of his dramatic works has not a
                    single piece comparable to <hi rend="italic">La Verdad Sospechosa</hi> of
                    Alarcon, the most finished example in Spanish literature of the comedy of
                    character; and what is called the comedy of manners is no better represented:
                    only <hi rend="italic">El Rufian Castrucho, El Anzuelo de Fenisa,</hi> and one
                    or two others can be named. It is from history, and particularly Spanish
                    history, that he has borrowed more than from any other source. It would in fact
                    be difficult to say what national and patriotic subjects, from the reign of the
                    half fabulous King Pelayo down to the history of his own age, he has not put
                    upon the stage. Sometimes he contents himself with serving up old chronicles
                    afresh or stringing together fragments of old popular songs, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">El Bastardo Mudarra,</hi> with inventing here and there a few
                    secondary characters when the original material is not sufficiently rich and
                    complicated, as in <hi rend="italic">Las Doncellas de Simancas, Los Benavides,
                    El Casamiento en la Muerte,</hi> and many others, or sometimes even with
                    clothing with complete dramatic action one single fact of history, as in one of
                    his most famous plays, <hi rend="italic">La Estrella de Sevilla,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Porfiar hasta Morir,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">El Mejor Alcalde el
                    Rey,</hi> and others. Even current events as they took place under his eyes
                    furnished him with motives. In an age when people read but little, the theatre
                    was a channel of information and a means of rousing patriotic sentiment. A
                    victory of the Spanish arms in Flanders or the success of hardy adventurers in
                    planting the royal banner of Castile in some virgin land in the West,—events
                    like these promptly gave rise to a comedy. On the basis of any sort of report of
                    battle or conquest Lope improvises a dramatic action, or at least a narrative in
                    dialogue. Thus under the title of <hi rend="italic">La Mayor Victoria de
                    Alemania</hi> he describes a victory won in the Palatinate by Don Gonzalo de
                    Cordoba, brother of the duke of Sesa, his patron. Such are the principal
                    varieties of historical or heroic comedy. But it is to the class of <hi
                    rend="italic">capa y espada</hi> —also called <hi rend="italic">novelesco,</hi>
                    because the subjects are almost always love intrigues complicated with affairs
                    of honour— that Lope’s most celebrated plays belong. In these he has most fully
                    displayed his powers of imagination (the subjects being all invented) and his
                    skill in elaborating a plot. Among the plays of this class which are those best
                    known in Europe, and most frequently imitated and translated, may be specially
                    mentioned <hi rend="italic">Los Ramilletes de Madrid, La Boba para los Otros y
                    Discreta para sí, El Perro del Hortelano, La Viuda de Valencia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">El Maestro de Danzar.</hi> In some of them Lope has sought to set
                    forth some moral maxim, and illustrate its abuse by a living example. Thus, on
                    the theme that “poverty is no crime,” we have the play entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Las Flores de Don Juan,</hi> in which he shows in the history of
                    two brothers the triumph of virtuous poverty over opulent vice; at the same time
                    he attacks indirectly the institution of primogeniture, which often places in
                    the hands of an unworthy person the honour and substance of a family when the
                    younger members would be much better qualified for the trust. Such pieces are,
                    however, rare in Lope’s repertory; in common with all other writers of his order
                    in Spain, with the occasional exception of Alarcon, his sole aim is to amuse and
                    stir his public, not troubling himself about its instruction. The strong point
                    of such writers is and always will be their management of the plot. As has been
                    said by Le Sage, a good judge: “The Spaniards are our masters in the art of
                    planning and skilfully working out a plot; they know how to set forth their
                    subject with infinite art and in the most advantageous light.” It is not
                    necessary to dwell here upon the other varieties of comedy represented in Lope’s
                    works, that is, the <hi rend="italic">comedias divinas, fiestas</hi>
                    (mythological dramas for the most part), <hi rend="italic">entremeses,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">autos.</hi> In none of them has he produced anything of the
                    highest order, or even comparable to the better performances of his
                    contemporaries and successors.</p>
                <p>To sum up, Lope found a poorly organized drama, plays being composed sometimes in
                    four acts, sometimes in three; and, though they were written in verse, the
                    structure of the versification was left far too much to the caprice of the
                    individual writer. The style of drama then in vogue he adopted, because the
                    Spanish public liked it. The narrow framework it afforded he enlarged to an
                    extraordinary degree, introducing everything that could possibly furnish
                    material for dramatic situations,—the Bible, ancient mythology, the lives of the
                    saints, ancient history, Spanish history, the legends of the Middle Ages, the
                    writings of the Italian novelists, current events, Spanish life in the 17th
                    century. Before him manners and the conditions of persons and characters had
                    been barely sketched; with fuller observation and more careful description he
                    created real types, and gave to each social order the language and drapery
                    appropriate to it. The old comedy was awkward and poor in its versification; he
                    introduced order into the use of all the forms of national poetry, from the old
                    romance couplets to the rarest lyrical combinations borrowed from Italy. Hence
                    he was justified in saying that those who should come after him had only to go
                    on along the path which he had opened up. Calderon notably, whose merit has been
                    much exaggerated, especially since the Germans took him under their protection,
                    is merely a pupil and inferior to his master; at all events, his indebtedness to
                    the latter is enormous and has not as yet been adequately recognized.</p>
