                    Sefström, when analysing a kind of iron obtained from the ores of Taberg in
                    Sweden. Berzelius, in the course of an extensive investigation on vanadium, came
                    to the conclusion that it is analogous to chromium, forming like it an acid
                    trioxide, VanO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, in which “Van” signifies 134∙4<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Calculated from our present
                    constants.</p></note> parts of a radical analogous to the Cr = 52 parts of
                    chromium in chromic acid, CrO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. He succeeded in
                    isolating this radical, and, as it exhibited semi-metallic properties, he had no
                    doubt that it was the element vanadium itself. His results were universally
                    adopted as correct until Roscoe (in 1867) found that Berzelius’s vanadium is an
                    oxide containing O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 32 parts of oxygen per Van,
                    whence it followed that the presumed trioxide, VanO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, is really a pentoxide, V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, where V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 2 × 51∙2 = 2
                    atoms of the real element. Our present knowledge of vanadium is based chiefly
                    upon his investigations. Of vanadium minerals, which are all very rare, we name
                    two only,—mottramite, (Pb,Cu) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (VO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> +2(Pb,Cu)(OH) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and vanadinite, 3Pb <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (VO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + PbCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. This last is amorphous with apatite, which previous to
                    Roscoe’s discovery was difficult to explain. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chemistry,</hi> vol. v. p. 539.</p>
                <p>Traces of vanadium are found in certain iron ores and in many other minerals.
                    Roscoe utilized a kind of sandstone from Alderley Edge and Mottram in Cheshire
                    which contains a small admixture of mottramite. Another suitable material is the
                    “Bohnerz” of Steinlade and Haverloh, essentially a hydrated ferric oxide. For
                    the extraction of vanadium from this latter mineral Wöhler recommends the
                    following method. The finely powdered mineral is mixed with one-third of its
                    weight of nitre and the mixture kept at a dull red heat for an hour. The ignited
                    mass is powdered and lixiviated with water, which extracts the potash salts of
                    the oxides V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, CrO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, MoO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">As</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">O</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 5</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">,</hi> P2O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, and SiO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ The filtered solution is almost neutralized with
                    nitric acid, but not completely, or else some of the V <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> would be reduced by the nitrous acid to
                    lower oxides; and the vanadic and most of the other acids named are precipitated
                    as baryta salts by addition of chloride of barium. From the washed precipitate
                    the acids are liberated by boiling dilute sulphuric acid, and the sulphate of
                    baryta is filtered off. The solution is neutralized with ammonia, concentrated
                    by evaporation, and, after cooling, kept in contact with a solid piece of
                    sal-ammoniac more than sufficient to saturate the solution with this salt.
                    Meta-vanadate of ammonia, V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, being
                    characteristically insoluble in sal-ammoniac solution, separates out as a
                    yellowish crystalline precipitate. This is collected, washed with sal-ammoniac
                    solution and after that with alcohol, and purified by re-crystallization or
                    otherwise. The pure salt when heated to dull redness leaves the pentoxide, V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> (vanadic acid), as a red
                    liquid, which freezes into a red-brown crystalline mass of sp. gr. 3∙35 (J. J.
                    Watts). It dissolves in about 1000 parts of water, forming a yellow solution
                    which reddens litmus. The pentoxide, though capable of uniting with strong
                    acids, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> with sulphuric into a salt, V <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, behaves on the whole as an acid oxide
                    analogous in its combining habits to phosphoric (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phosphorus,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 818, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi>
                    vol. v. p. 540). Solutions of vanadates are easily recognized: on addition of
                    mineral acid they assume the yellow colour characteristic of the pentoxide, and
                    if the mixture is then kept in contact with zinc it passes through all shades of
                    (intense) green till it ultimately assumes a lavender colour. The solution then
                    contains a chloride corresponding to the oxide V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (Berzelius’s metal). It absorbs atmospheric oxygen
                    with an extraordinary degree of avidity, assuming, in the absence of free acid,
                    a dark brown colour. An acidified vanadate solution, if shaken with peroxide of
                    hydrogen and ether, furnishes a dark red reduction product, which passes into
                    the ethereal layer. One part of vanadic acid in 40,000 parts of water can thus
                    be rendered distinctly visible (Werther). If a mixture of the pentoxide and
                    charcoal is heated in dry chlorine, it is converted into an oxychloride, VOCl
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (trichloride of Berzelius), which distils over and
                    may be purified by re-distillation over sodium. It is a canary-yellow mobile
                    liquid, freezing below -15° C. and boiling at 126° ∙7 C., and its sp. gr. at 14°
                    C. is 1∙841. Water decomposes it with formation of hydrochloric acid and
                    pentoxide V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. If the
                    vapour of this chloride is passed over red-hot charcoal in a current of
                    chlorine, the tetrachloride VC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> is produced as a
                    dark brown liquid, boiling at about 154° C. A mixture of the vapour of this
                    chloride with hydrogen, when passed through a dull-red-hot tube, yields (more or
                    less of “sesqui-” chloride, V <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and) the dichloride VC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    which, if pure, forms apple-green, mica-like, hexagonal plates. From this
                    dichloride Roscoe for the first time prepared the true metal by heating it to
                    redness in hydrogen gas, a simple enough method in theory, but in practice one
                    of the most difficult of operations, because the dichloride is very difficult to
                    prepare and highly hygroscopic, and because the metal is extremely prone to take
                    up oxygen. Even the purest product which Roscoe succeeded in obtaining contained
                    an appreciable admixture of oxide. Vanadium is a light grey powder, which under
                    the microscope appears crystalline and exhibits a silvery lustre, sp. gr. =5∙5.
                    Of its chemical properties the most remarkable is that it combines directly with
                    nitrogen gas, N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, into a bronze-coloured nitride,
                    VN.</p>
                <p>Rare and expensive as vanadium is, it has found a practical application in the
                    production of aniline black. The black is produced from aniline by the action of
                    chloric acid, aided by the presence of some oxygen carrier. Sulphide of copper
                    is usually employed; but, as Lightfoot found, a mere trace of vanadic acid (or
                    vanadate of ammonia) acts more energetically than any other available agent.
                    According to Witz, 1 part of vanadic acid suffices for 67,000 parts of aniline
                    salt.</p>
