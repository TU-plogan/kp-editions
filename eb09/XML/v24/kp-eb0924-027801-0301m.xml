                <p><label type="entry">VOLGA, <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi></label>, the chief river
                    of European Russia, rises in the Valdai plateau of Tver in north-western Russia,
                    and after a winding course of 2325 miles (1040 in a straight line) falls into
                    the Caspian at Astrakhan. It is by far the largest river of Europe, those next
                    in length, the Danube and the Ural, being only 1735 and 1478 miles respectively,
                    while the Rhine (825 miles) is shorter even than two of the chief tributaries of
                    the Volga,—the Oka and the Kama. Its drainage area, which includes the whole of
                    middle and eastern as well as part of southeastern Russia, amounts to 563,300
                    square miles, thus exceeding the aggregate superficies of Germany, France, and
                    the United Kingdom. A hundred tributaries of the Volga are navigable for an
                    aggregate length of 14,600 miles, a distance greater than the aggregate length
                    of all the railways of England and Wales. The drainage area embraces twenty-one
                    provinces of the Russian empire, or, in other words, nearly the whole of Great
                    Russia proper, and has a population of nearly 40,000,000. The most populous
                    regions of Great Russia are situated within the Volga basin, and cities like
                    Moscow, Nijni-Novgorod, Saratoff, Simbirsk, and Kazan, as well as many others,
                    are indebted for their growth aud present importance to their situation on the
                    Volga or its tributaries. But the real “basin” of the Volga is not limited to
                    its drainage area. By a system of canals which connects the upper Volga with the
                    Neva, the commercial mouth of the Volga has been transferred, so to speak, from
                    the Caspian to the Baltic, thus making St Petersburg, the capital and chief
                    seaport of Russia, the chief port of the Volga basin as well. Other less
                    important canals connect it with the Düna and the White Sea (Riga and
                    Archangel); while a railway only 40 miles in length joins the Volga with the Don
                    and the Sea of Azoff, and three great trunk lines bring its lower parts into
                    connexion with the Baltic and western Europe. Traffic on the river and its
                    tributaries is carried on by more than 760 steamers, 20,000 barges and boats,
                    aud 50,000 rafts; upwards of 4,000,000 tons of various goods, valued at
                    500,000,000 roubles (in weight one-half and in value three-fourths of the total
                    merchandise on Russian rivers) are carried. If in addition some 50,000 rafts of
                    timber not included in the preceding statistics are reckoned, the timber floated
                    in the basin of the Volga exceeds by nearly a million tons the total weight of
                    merchandise carried on the 13,000 miles of Russian railways.<note

                <p>The Volga rises in the extensive marshes covering the western parts of the Valdai
                    plateau, where the Düna also has its origin. Small streamlets languidly
                    circulate from marsh to marsh, so that <pb break="no"

                    to be regarded as the real source. Lake Seliger was formerly so considered; but
                    at present that distinction is given to a small spring trickling into a wooden
                    trough from beneath a small chapel in the midst of an extensive marsh to the
                    south of Seliger (57° 10' N. lat.). The honour has also been claimed of late,
                    not without plausibility, for the Kuna rivulet.<note anchored="true"

                    more than 665 feet above sea-level. The stream first traverses several small
                    lakes, all having the same level, and, after its junction with the Runa, enters
                    Lake Volgo. A dam recently erected a few miles below that lake, with a storage
                    of 350 million cubic yards of water, makes it possible to raise the level of the
                    Volga as far as the Sheksna, thus rendering it navigable, even at low water,
                    from its 65th mile onwards. Unlike most other great rivers, the Volga has thus
                    no “upper course” among the mountains. From the Valdai plateau, however, its
                    descent is rapid, until at Tver its level is only 420 feet. Before reaching this
                    point it has received numerous small tributaries, so as to be already 300 yards
                    in breadth, with a volume of more than 4000 cubic feet per second, and a minimum
                    depth at low water of 19 inches. The Tvertsa is connected by the
                    Vyshniy-Vołotchok Canal with the Tsna, a tributary to the Msta and Volkhoff,
                    which flows to Lake Ladoga,—the first of the three systems of canals which, as
                    already remarked, have removed the commercial mouth of the Volga to the Baltic.
                    From Tver the Volga is regularly navigated, although not without some
                    difficulties on account of the shallows and sandbanks. It flows north-east along
                    a broad valley to join the Mołoga and the Sheksna, two important tributaries
                    connected by the Tikhvinsk and Mariinsk Canals with the tributaries of Lake
                    Ladoga. Of these two systems the latter is much the more important, and the town
                    of Rybinsk, at the mouth of the Sheksna, has therefore become the chief port of
                    the upper Volga.</p>
                <p>From its junction with the Sheksna the Volga flows with a very gentle descent
                    towards the south-east, past Yaroslavl and Kostroma, along a broad valley
                    hollowed to a depth of some 150 and 200 feet in the Permian and Jurassic
                    deposits. In fact, its course is through a succession of depressions formerly
                    filled with wide lakes, and connected by links. When the Volga assumes a due
                    south-east direction it is already a large river (8250 cubic feet per second,
                    rising occasionally in high flood to as much as 178,360 cubic feet); of its
                    numerous tributaries, the Unzha (365 miles, 330 navigable), from the north, is
                    the most important.</p>
                <p>The next great tributary is the Oka, which comes from the southwest after having
                    traversed, on its course of 920 miles, all the Great Russian provinces of
                    central Russia. It rises in Orel among hills which also send tributaries to the
                    Dnieper and the Don, and receives on the left the Upa, the Jizdra, the Ugra (300
                    miles), navigable up to Kozelsk, the Moskva, on which steamers ply up to Moscow,
                    the Klyazma (395 miles), on whose banks arose the Middle Russian principality of
                    Suzdal, and on the right the navigable Tsna (255 miles) and Moksha. Every one of
                    these tributaries is connected with some important event in the history of Great
                    Russia, and the drainage area of the Oka is a territory of 97,800 square miles.
                    It has been maintained of late that, of the two rivers which unite at
                    Nijni-Novgorod, the Oka, not the Volga, is the chief; and the fact is that both
                    in length (818 miles) and in drainage area above the junction (89,500 square
                    miles), as well as in the aggregate length of its tributaries, the Volga is the
                    inferior. But, on the other hand, the Volga contributes on the whole the largest
                    volume of water, although in flood the Oka here also has the advantage.</p>
                <p>At its junction with the Oka the Volga enters the broad lacustrine depression
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia)</hi> which must have communicated with the
                    Caspian during the Post-Pliocene period by means of at least a broad strait. Its
                    level at low water is only 190 feet above that of the ocean. Immediately below
                    the junction its breadth ranges from 350 to 1750 yards, and even at the lowest
                    water (in 1873) it had a minimum depth of 5½ feet. The valley, which is nearly 7
                    miles wide, but at several places is narrowed to less than 2 miles, shows
                    evident traces of having originated from a succession of elongated lakes, the
                    shores of which bear numerous traces of the dwellings of prehistoric man from
                    the Stone Age. There are many islands which change their appearance and position
                    after each inundation. On the right it is joined by the Sura, which drains a
                    large area and brings a volume of from 2700 to 22,000 cubic feet of water per
                    second, the Vetluga (465 miles long, of which 365 are navigable), from the
                    forest-tracts of Yaroslavl, and many smaller tributaries; then it turns
                    south-east and descends to another lacustrine depression, where it receives the
                    Kama below Kazafi, 300 miles below its junction with the Oka, and only 110 feet
                    above the sea. Remains of molluscs still extant in the Caspian occur extensively
                    throughout this depression and up the lower Kama.</p>
                <p>The Kama, which brings to the Volga a contribution ranging from 52,500 to 144,400
                    cubic feet and occasionally reaching even 515,000 cubic feet per second, might
                    again be considered as the more important of the two rivers. It rises in Vyatka,
                    takes a wide sweep towards the north and east, and then flows south and
                    southwest to join the Volga after a course of no less than 1120 miles. A great
                    number of important rivers join it:—the Wishera, coming from the depth of the
                    forest region; the Kosva, so important for the export of metallic wares from the
                    Ural works; the Tchusovaya (430 miles), which receives the Sylva and connects
                    the Ekaterinburg mining district with central Russia; and finally the Byełaya
                    (800 miles), which, together with the Ufa, its tributary, waters the fertile
                    lands of the Bashkirs, rapidly being settled now by the Russians. A territory
                    larger than France is thus brought into connexion with the great artery of
                    Russian industrial life.</p>
                <p>Along the next 738 miles of its course the Volga—now from 580 to 2600 yards
                    wide—flows south-south-west, with but one great bend at Samara. At this point,
                    where it pierces a range of limestone hills, the course of the river is very
                    picturesque, fringed as it is by high cliffs which rise about 1000 feet above
                    the level of the water (which is only 54 feet above the sea at Samara). Along
                    the whole of the Samara bend the Volga is accompanied on its right bank by high
                    cliffs, which it is constantly undermining, while wide lowland areas extend on
                    the left or eastern bank, and are intersected by several old beds of the Volga.
                    At <hi rend="smallcaps">Saratoff (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> the cliffs
                    are being undermined so rapidly that a broad beach now separates the chief
                    channel of the river from the city. Very few streams of any importance join the
                    Volga in this part of its course. Still, at Ekaterinenstadt, a few miles above
                    Saratoff, the volume per second for the two years 1884 and 1885 appears to have
                    been as much as 384,000 cubic feet. In flood 1,427,000 cubic feet per second has
                    been recorded (Boguslavskiy). In the lower portion of this section the Volga has
                    already passed below sea-level (58 feet below at Tsaritsyn).</p>
                <p>At Tsaritsyn the Volga reaches its extreme south-western limit, where it is
                    separated from the Don by an isthmus of only 40 miles in width. The isthmus is
                    too high to be crossed by means of a canal, but a railway at Duboffka brings the
                    Volga into some sort of connexion with the Don and the Sea of Azoff. At
                    Tsaritsyn the river takes a sharp turn in a south-easterly direction towards the
                    Caspian; it enters the Caspian steppes, and some 50 miles below Tsaritsyn sends
                    off a branch—the Akhtuba—which accompanies it for 330 miles before falling into
                    the Caspian. Here the Volga receives no tributaries; its right bank is skirted
                    by low hills, but on the left it spreads freely, joining the Akhtuba by many
                    branches when its waters are high, and flooding the country for from 15 to 35
                    miles. The width of the main branch ranges from 520 to 3500 yards, and the depth
                    exceeds 80 feet. The delta proper begins 40 miles above Astrakhan, and the
                    branches subdivide so as to reach the sea by as many as 200 separate mouths.
                    Below Astrakhan navigation is difficult, and on the sand-bars at the mouth the
                    maximum depth is only 12 feet in calm weather,—-a depth increased or diminished
                    by a few feet according to the force and direction of the wind.</p>
                <p>The figures given above, showing as they do how immensely different in volume is
                    the river at different periods, help to indicate the greatness of the changes
                    which are constantly going on in the channel and on its banks. Not only does its
                    level occasionally rise in flood as much as 50 feet and cover its low-lying
                    banks for a distance ranging from 5 to 15 miles; even the level of the Caspian
                    is considerably affected by the sudden influx of water brought by the Volga. The
                    amount of suspended matter brought down is of course correspondingly great; and,
                    were it not for the action of the wind in driving back masses of water at the
                    mouth of the Volga and thus filling up lakes where the mud is deposited, the bar
                    at Astrakhan would soon become so silted up as completely to prevent navigation.
                    All along its course the Volga wastes its banks with great rapidity; towns and
                    loading ports have constantly to be shifted farther back. The shoals and
                    shallows are continually changing, and maps of the river made for a series of
                    consecutive years are of the greatest interest to the physical geographer.</p>
                <p>The question as to the gradual desiccation of the Volga, and its causes, has
                    often been discussed, and in 1838 a committee which included Karl Baer among its
                    members was appointed by the academy of sciences to investigate the subject; no
                    positive result has, however, been arrived at, principally on account of the
                    want of regular measurements of the volume of the Volga and its tributaries,
                    —measurements which began to be made on scientific principles only in 1880.
                    Still, it may be regarded as established that during the last thirty years new
                    shallows have appeared in the upper Volga, aud the old ones have increased in
                    size; while if we go back two or three centuries it is indisputable that rivers
                    of the Volga basin which were easily navigable then are now hardly accessible to
                    the smallest craft. The desiccation of the rivers of Russia has been often
                    attributed to the steady destruction of its forests. But it is obvious that
                    there are other general causes at work much more important,—causes to which the
                    larger phenomena of the general desiccation of all rivers of the northern
                    hemisphere in the deserts of Siberia and Turkestan, as well as in Russia, must
                    be attributed. The gradual elevation of the whole of northern Russia and
                    Siberia, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n303/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0303-0280"/> and the consequent draining of the marshes (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Novgorod),</hi> is one of them; the drying-up of lakes all
                    over the northern hemisphere, a process which is going on so rapidly (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tomsk),</hi> in consequence of the deepening of the outflows of
                    lakes and the cessation of supply to the lakes which remained after the
                    glaciation of the northern hemisphere, is another; and both causes are amply
                    sufficient to explain the known phenomena throughout the historical period. The
                    desiccation of the Russian rivers is only one instance of the general
                    desiccation of the northern parts of the Old World, of which so many instances
                    have been given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia, Turkestan, Transcaspian

                    Caspian, sweetened as these are by the water of the Volga, the Ural, the Kura,
                    and the Terek, is exceedingly favourable to the breeding of fish, and as a whole
                    constitutes one of the richest fishing grounds of the world. As soon as the ice
                    breaks up in the delta innumerable shoals of roach <hi rend="italic">(Leuciscus

                    the river. They are followed by the great sturgeon <hi rend="italic">(Acipenser

                    search of a gravelly spawningground the sturgeons go up the river as far as
                    Sarepta (250 miles). The lamprey, now extensively pickled, the sterlet <hi
                    rend="italic">(A. ruthenus),</hi> the tench, the gudgeon, and other river
                    species also appear in immense numbers. No less than 15,000 men, partly from
                    central Russia, are engaged in the fisheries of the lower Volga and its delta,
                    while on the waters of the northern Caspian there are as many as 3000
                    fishing-boats, giving employment to something like 50,000 persons. From the end
                    of June onwards immense trawl-nets, sometimes a mile in length, and occasionally
                    taking at one haul as many as 40,000 bream, 150,000 roach, and 200,000 herrings,
                    are continually at work, and it is estimated that 3,600,000 cwts. of various
                    fish, of the value of 15,000,000 roubles, are taken annually in the four fishing
                    districts of the Volga, Ural, Terek, and Kura. Seal-hunting is also carried on
                    off the Volga, and every year about 40,000 of the <hi rend="italic">Phoca
                    vitulina</hi> are killed to the north of the Man-ghishlak peninsula. Fishing is
                    extensively carried on along the entire course of the Volga and its tributaries,
                    as also in the lakes of its upper basin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ice-Covering.—</hi> In winter the numberless tributaries and
                    subtributaries of the Volga become so many highways for sledges. The ice lasts
                    from 90 to 160 days according to the climatic conditions, and breaks up earlier
                    in its upper course than in some parts lower down. The average date of the
                    break-up is April 11th at Tver, and 14 days later about Kostroma, from which
                    point a regular acceleration is observed (April 16th at Kazan, April 7th at
                    Tsaritsyn, and March 17th at Astrakhan). Similarly, the average dates of
                    freezing are November 23d at Tver, November 20th about Kostroma, December 7th at
                    Kazañ, 20th at Tsaritsyn, and 17th at Astrakhan. Thus the river is open for an
                    average of 226 days at Ostashkoff and Tver, 215 days at Kostroma, and 209 at
                    Kineshma; from Nijni-Novgorod, where the average is 224 days, there is a regular
                    increase (235 days at Kazafi, 241 at Samara, 257 at Tsaritsyn, and 275 at
                    Astrakhan). There are, however, great fluctuations, the navigation in some years
                    having lasted only 182 days in the upper course, 169 at Kostroma, and 243 at
                    Tsaritsyn; while within the last eighty years maxima of 260 days in the upper
                    course and 288 in the lower course have been observed. The tributaries are
                    navigable for periods ranging from 180 to 246 days.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The chief Volga traffic is up river, the amount of
                    merchandise which reaches Astrakhan being nearly fifteen times less than that
                    reaching St Petersburg by the Volga canals. The details of this traffic are
                    highly characteristic of the present economic life of Russia. Ten million cwts.
                    of fish, salt, and naphtha are despatched from Astrakhan; this contingent is
                    soon swelled to 12 millions at Tsaritsyn by the salt brought by rail from the
                    Baskuntchak salt-lakes. From Tsaritsyn 7 million cwts. of fish, salt, and
                    naphtha are despatched by the first of the three railways which traverse Russia
                    from south-east to north-west and connect the lower Volga with the Baltic.
                    Considerable amounts of corn are added to this total on its way towards the
                    north-west; and, while salt, fish, and naphtha are discharged for use at various
                    points in middle Russia, the flow of corn continues to swell; portions of it are
                    sent to Moscow from Gryazi and Orel, but the remainder goes north-west, so as to
                    reach Riga to the amount of 9,300,000 cwts., chiefly of corn and flax.</p>
                <p>By the Volga itself only 5,100,000 cwts., chiefly of fish, salt, and naphtha,
                    leave Tsaritsyn, but before this ascending traffic reaches Saratoff it has
                    increased to 6,300,000 cwts., chiefly by the addition of corn from the Saratoff
                    steppes. There the current of merchan dise divides again; 3 million cwts. of
                    corn, fish, &amp;c., leave the Volga to be carried north-westwards towards
                    Tamboff, while the remainder is carried on farther north, up the Volga,
                    receiving on the way considerable additions of corn from the fertile tracts of
                    Samara and the steppes of Orenburg, which are connected with Samara by rail. At
                    Samara the flow again divides, and part of it is sent again north-west, <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Penza, to Ryazhsk; there the three north-western currents
                    which leave the Volga respectively at Tsaritsyn, Saratoff, and Samara reunite
                    after having taken in corn from the fertile regions of Tamboff and Ryazan, so
                    that nearly 20 million cwts. of corn and other produce leave Ryazhsk to be
                    carried on to Moscow. But the flow of corn ascending the Volga does not
                    diminish, and Samara sends farther north no less than 14 million cwts., chiefly
                    corn. At Kazan the volume of traffic is 16,200,000 cwts. (13 million cwts. of
                    corn). Here a new mass, consisting of 11 million cwts. of corn, 3½ of various
                    metals, 4 of salt, and 6½ of miscellaneous merchandise, all shipped down the
                    Kama, joins the former, so that the total amount of merchandise forwarded from
                    Kazan up the Volga reaches 35 million cwts. The Sura, the Oka, and the Vetluga
                    add their corn, timber, and manufactured goods, and the volume reaching
                    Nijni-Novgorod amounts to 38 million cwts. Here the stream divides once more:
                    while manufactured goods brought in to the Nijni-Novgorod fair are dispersed
                    from it all over Russia, nearly 10 million cwts. of various merchandise (4
                    million of corn) are sent by rail to Moscow, but the great bulk (28 million
                    cwts.) continues to move up the river, receiving on the way more timber from the
                    Unzha, and sending some com northwards to Vologda and Archangel.</p>
                <p>When the traffic reaches Rybinsk, we find that it consists of 20 million cwts. of
                    corn and flax, and 5½ million of metals, metallic and manufactured goods, hides,
                    leather, and so on. At Rybinsk it again subdivides into three branches; one
                    (6,300,000 cwts., chiefly of corn) is discharged and sent by rail to St
                    Petersburg; another (2,800,000 cwts.) continues up the Volga to enter the
                    Vyshniy Vołotchok and Tikhvinsk canal-systems; and the third and largest (16
                    million cwts., almost entirely corn and flax) moves along the Mariinsk system
                    towards Lake Ladoga and St Petersburg. Masses of timber and wood for fuel are
                    added to it from the forest tracts of the lake district,—the Syas and the
                    Volkhoff bringing together nearly 17 million cwts., chiefly wood, so that
                    finally 14,000,000 cwts. of corn and flax, 31,300,000 of timber and wood,
                    16,000,000 of building materials, and 4,000,000 of miscellaneous goods reach St
                    Petersburg, which thus is the real seaport of the Volga basin.</p>
                <p>The goods traffic down the river is much less important in weight, but relatively
                    greater in value. Its prominent feature is the amount of wood sent to supply the
                    provinces of Samara, Saratoff, and Astrakhan, as well as the lower Don, which
                    now have very few or no forests. But the 8½million cwts. of wood and timber
                    which reach Samara on boats are but a trifle in comparison with what is floated
                    in the shape of rafts. The down traffic in manufactured goods is still more
                    important. The great bulk of those exported from St Petersburg is sent to Moscow
                    by rail, and thence distributed by rail over central Russia; but part of it is
                    sent by rail to Rybinsk, and thence shipped down the Volga. Moscow sends its
                    goods for the same purpose, partly to Yaroslavl, and partly to Nijni-Novgorod
                    (by rail), as also does Vladimir. Nijni-Novgorod distributes the merchandise all
                    over eastern Russia, sends it up the Kama to Siberia, and ships nearly 2 million
                    cwts. down the Volga. This quantity is increased by the additions brought by
                    rail to Samara, Saratoff, and Tsaritsyn.</p>
                <p>According to official returns the aggregate amount of goods loaded in the basin
                    of the Volga amounts to nearly 4 million tons, valued at 150 million roubles (2
                    million tons, 100 millions worth, on the Volga proper); trustworthy authorities,
                    however, consider the real value of goods loaded in the basin of the Volga to be
                    not less than 500 million roubles, exclusive of nearly 34 million tons of timber
                    and fuel.</p>
                <p>Formerly tens of thousands of “burłaki” were employed in dragging boats up the
                    Volga and its tributaries, but this method of traction has disappeared unless
                    from a few of the tributaries. Horse-power is still extensively resorted to
                    along the three canal systems. The first large steamers of the American type
                    were built in 1872. Steamers arc now very common; in 1885 as many as 766 were
                    already in use on the Volga and its tributaries, and of these only one-eighth
                    were not built within the Volga basin itself. One-third of them used naphtha as
                    fuel. Of barges and other light vessels an immense variety of types are now in
                    use; during 1885 no fewer than 20,610 vessels were afloat, and during the last
                    thirteen years the annual average of vessels built on the Volga and its
                    tributaries has been 5030 (4,130,000 roubles). Large numbers of them are broken
                    up after a single voyage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Volga was not improbably known to the early
                    Greeks, though it is not mentioned by any of the writers previous to Ptolemy,
                    who all confounded the Caspian with a gulf of the Arctic Ocean. According to
                    Ptolemy, the Rha is a tributary of an interior sea, formed from the confluence
                    of two great rivers, the sources of which are separated by twenty degrees of
                    longitude; but <pb break="no"

                    statements how far the Slavonians had by that time succeeded in penetrating into
                    the basin of the Volga. The Arabian geographers also throw but little light on
                    the condition of the Volga (which they knew under the names of Itil, Etil, or
                    Atel) during the great migrations of the 3d century, or subsequently under the
                    invasion of the Huns, the growth of the great Khazar empire in the southern
                    steppes, and of that of Bulgaria on the middle Volga. But we know that in the
                    9th century the Volga basin was occupied by Finnish stems in the north, and by
                    Khazars and various Turkish stems in the south. The Slavonians, driven perhaps
                    to the west, had only the Volkhoff and the Dnieper, while the Mohammedan
                    Bulgarian empire, at the confluence of the Volga with the Kama, was so strong
                    that for some time it was an open question whether Islam or Christianity was to
                    gain the upper hand among the Slavonian idolaters. But, while the Russians were
                    driven from the Black Sea by the Khazars, and later on by a tide of Ugrian
                    migration from the north-east to the south-west (see p. 5 <hi rend="italic"
                    >supra),</hi> a stream of Slavonians slowly moved towards the north-east, down
                    the Oka, into the borderland between the Finnish and Turkish stems. After two
                    centuries of struggle the Russians succeeded in colonizing the fertile valleys
                    of the Oka basin; in the 12th century they built a series of fortified towns on
                    the Oka and Klyazma, and finally they reached the mouth of the Oka, there
                    founding (in 1222) a new Novgorod—the Novgorod of the Lowlands, now
                    Nijni-Novgorod. The great lacustrine depression of the middle Volga was thus
                    reached. Under the protection of the forts in the north-east, of the forests of
                    Ryazan in the south, and of the marshes of Novgorod and Tver in the north, the
                    Great-Russian nationality freely developed in the fertile valleys of the Oka,
                    absorbing the feeble Finnish tribes which formerly peopled them; and when the
                    Tartar-Mongolian invasion came it encountered in the Oka basin a dense
                    agricultural population with many fortified and wealthy towns,—a population
                    which the Mongols found they could conquer, indeed, but were unable to drive
                    before them as they had done with so many of the Turkish stems. This invasion
                    only checked but did not stop the further advance of the Russians down the
                    Volga; nay, it partly facilitated it, because it weakened the Bulgarian empire,
                    and, by keeping up on the lower Volga a continual flow and ebb of nomads,
                    prevented the development there of any settled population which might ultimately
                    have opposed the further advance of the Russians towards the Caspian. Two
                    centuries elapsed before the Russians covered the 300 miles which separate the
                    mouths of the Oka and the Kama, and took possession of Kazan. But in the
                    meantime a flow of Novgorodian colonization had moved eastward, in the upper
                    portions of the left-bank tributaries of the Volga, and had reached the Urals,
                    thus opening the way to Siberia.</p>
                <p>With the capture of Kazan the Russians found the lower Volga open to their boats,
                    and eight years afterwards they were already masters of the mouth of the river
                    at Astrakhan. The Tartars and Turks of the steppes between the Dnieper and the
                    Volga were thus encircled; the Little Russians endeavoured to take possession of
                    the lower Dnieper, and the Great Russians already had a firm footing on tho
                    lower Volga. The possession of the latter opened a free passage to the Don, up
                    the little river Kamyshinka (now dried up but then navigable), which gave easy
                    means of crossing the narrow isthmus between the Don and the Volga. Thus the
                    lower Don was colonized. But two centuries more elapsed before the Russians
                    opened for themselves a free passage to the Black Sea and became masters of the
                    Sea of Azoff and the Crimea; the Volga, however, was their route. During these
                    two centuries they fortified the lower river, settled it, and penetrated also
                    farther eastward into the steppes, towards the upper Ural and thence to the
                    upper parts of the Tobol and the other great Siberian rivers. They penetrated
                    also into the northern parts of the Caucasus isthmus, while another stream of
                    armed colonization moved up the Kama and its numerous tributaries; finding the
                    sources of these close to those of the Ob and Tobol, they crossed the low
                    watersheds of the Urals and spread over northern Siberia, always following the
                    river courses and taking advantage of the portages for penetrating from one
                    basin into the next. The entire growth of Russia towards the east went on from
                    the Volga and its tributaries, and the long line of water communication (nearly
                    1000 miles) which flows from the upper Kama (60° N. lat. ) to Astrakhan (46°
                    4'), between Europe and Asia, and extends as far south as Astrabad on the
                    Caspian (36° 51' N. lat.), became the basis for all further advance of Russia
                    into Asia.</p>
