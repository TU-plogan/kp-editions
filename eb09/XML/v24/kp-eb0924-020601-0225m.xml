                <p><label type="entry">VETO</label>. By this expression (Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >veto,</hi> “I forbid”) is understood in public law the constitutional right of
                    the competent authority, or in republics of the whole people in their primary
                    assembly, to protest against a legislative or administrative act, and to prevent
                    wholly, or for the time being, the validation or execution of the same.</p>
                <p>It is generally stated that this right was called into existence in the Roman
                    republic by the <hi rend="italic">tribunicia potestas,</hi> because by this
                    authority decisions of the senate, and of the consuls and other magistrates,
                    could be declared inoperative. Such a statement must, however, be qualified by
                    reference to the facts that <hi rend="italic">interdico, interdicimus</hi> were
                    the expressions used, and, in general, that in ancient Rome every holder of a
                    magistracy could check a negotiation set on foot by a colleague, his equal in
                    rank, by his opposition and intervention. This was a consequence of the position
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n226/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0226-0207"/> that each of the colleagues possessed the whole
                    power of the magistracy, and this right of intervention must have come into
                    existence with the introduction of colleagued authorities, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> with the commencement of the republic. In the Roman magistracy a
                    twofold power must be distinguished,—the positive management of the affairs of
                    the state entrusted to each individual and the power of restraining the acts of
                    magistrates of equal or inferior rank by his protest. As the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tribuni plebis</hi> possessed this latter negative competence to a great
                    extent, it is customary to attribute to them the origin of the veto.</p>
                <p>In the former kingdom of Poland the precedent first set in 1652 was established
                    by law as a constant right, that in the imperial diet a single deputy by his
                    protest “Nie pozwalam,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “I do not permit it,” could
                    invalidate the decision sanctioned by the other members. The king of France
                    received the right of a suspensory veto at the commencement of the French
                    Revolution, from the national assembly sitting at Versailles in 1789, with
                    regard to the decrees of the latter, which was only to be valid for the time
                    being against the decisions come to and during the following national assembly,
                    but during the period of the third session it was to lose its power if the
                    assembly persisted in its resolution. By this means it was endeavoured to
                    diminish the odium of the measure; but, as is well known, the monarchy was soon
                    afterwards entirely abolished. Similarly the Spanish constitution of 1812
                    prescribed that the king might twice refuse his sanction to bills laid twice
                    before him by two sessions of the cortes, but if the third session repeated the
                    same he could no longer exercise the power of veto. The same is the case in the
                    Norwegian constitution of 1814.</p>
                <p>In the present French republic the president has no veto, except against
                    decisions of the general councillors (<hi rend="italic">conseils générals du
                    departements),</hi> just as the prefect possesses the same power against
                    decisions of the communal councillors. The king or queen of England has the
                    right to withhold sanction from a bill passed by both houses of parliament. This
                    royal prerogative has not been exercised since 1692 and may now be considered
                    obsolete. The governor of an English colony has the power of veto against a bill
                    passed by the legislative body of a colony, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Canada.
                    In this case the bill is finally lost, just as a bill would be which had been
                    rejected by the colonial council, or as a bill passed by the English houses of
                    parliament would be if the crown were to exert the prerogative of refusing the
                    royal assent. The governor may, however, without refusing his assent, reserve
                    the bill for the consideration of the crown. In that case the bill does not come
                    into force until it has either actually or constructively received the royal
                    assent, which is in effect the assent of the English ministry, and therefore
                    indirectly of the imperial parliament. Thus the colonial liberty of legislation
                    is made legally reconcilable with imperial sovereignty, and conflicts between
                    colonial and imperial laws are prevented.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The constitution of the United States of North America contains in art. i., sect.
                    7, § 2, the following order :—</p>
                <p>“Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate
                    shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United
                    States; if he approve, he shall sign it; if not, he shall return it with his
                    objections to that house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the
                    objections at large on their journal and proceed to reconsider it. If, after
                    such reconsideration, two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it
                    shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it
                    shall likewise be reconsidered, and, if approved by two-thirds of that house, it
                    shall become a law. Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of
                    the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question
                    of adjournment)</p>
                <p>shall be presented to the president of the United States, and, before the same
                    shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or, being disapproved by him, shall
                    be repassed by two-thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according
                    to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.”</p>
                <p>In most States of the Union the governors, in the same manner or to a modified
                    extent, possess the right of protesting against the laws and decisions of the
                    legislature. Here therefore we have again a suspensory veto which is frequently
                    exercised. According to the official report for 1886, the president of the
                    United States exercised his right of veto in that year 115 times against bills,
                    resolutions, and orders of the most different kinds. Between 1840 and 1850 the
                    Whigs agitated for the total abolition of the power of veto. Of late an
                    agitation has begun in the opposite direction.<note anchored="true"

                <p>According to the constitution of the German empire of 1871, the imperial
                    legislation is executed by the federal council and imperial diet; the emperor is
                    not mentioned. In the federal council the simple majority of votes decides. But
                    in the case of bills concerning the army, the navy, and certain specially noted
                    taxes, as well as in the case of decisions concerning the alteration of orders
                    for the administration, and arrangements for the execution of the laws of
                    customs and taxes, the proposal of the federal council is only accepted if the
                    Prussian votes are on the side of the majority in favour of the same (art. 7,
                    sect. 3). Prussia presides in the federal council. The state of things is
                    therefore in fact as follows: it is not the German emperor, but the same monarch
                    as king of Prussia, who has the right of veto against bills and decisions of the
                    federal council, and therefore can prevent the passing of an imperial law. The
                    superior power of the presidential vote obtains, it is true, its due influence
                    only in one legislative body, but in reality it has the same effect as the veto
                    of the head of the empire.</p>
                <p>The Swiss federal constitution grants the president of the Confederation no
                    superior position at all; neither he nor the federal council possesses the power
                    of veto against laws or decisions of the federal assembly. But in some cantons,
                    viz., St Gall (1831), Basel (1832), and Lucerne (1841), the veto was introduced
                    as a right of the people. The citizens had the power to submit to a plebiscite
                    laws which had been debated and accepted by the cantonal council (the
                    legislative authority), and to reject the same. If this plebiscite was not
                    demanded within a certain short specified time, the law came into force. But, if
                    the voting took place, and if the number of persons voting against the law
                    exceeded by one vote half the number of persons entitled to vote in the canton,
                    the law was rejected. The absent voters were considered as having voted in
                    favour of the law. An attempt to introduce the veto in Zurich in 1847 failed.
                    Thurgau and Schaffhausen accepted it later. Meanwhile another arrangement has
                    quite driven it out of the field. For of late years the so-called “referendum,”
                    —properly speaking, direct legislation by the people,— has been introduced into
                    most of the Swiss cantons. Formerly in all cantons—with the exception of the
                    small mountainous districts of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Glarus, and
                    Appenzell—it was not a pure democracy, but a representative constitution that
                    prevailed: the great councillors or cantonal councillors periodically chosen by
                    the people were the possessors of the sovereign power, and after deliberating
                    twice passed the bills definitively. Now they have only to discuss the bills,
                    which are printed and sent to all voters with an explanatory message; then the
                    people on a certain day vote for the acceptance or rejection of the law by
                    writing “yes” or “no” on a printed voting-paper<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n227/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0227-0208"/>, which is placed in an urn under official
                    control. In some cantons important financial resolutions involving large state
                    expenses are also submitted to the decision of the people. In the revised
                    federal constitution of 1874, under certain suppositions which have no further
                    interest for us at present, a facultative referendum (<hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi>, the possibility of demanding a plebiscite under exceptional
                    circumstances) has been introduced for federal laws. Since that period it has
                    often been employed and has operated like a veto. It is evident that by the
                    compulsory referendum in the cantons the mere veto is rendered superfluous.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A. v. Orelli, <hi

                <p>In examining the question as to what position the veto occupies in jurisprudence,
                    we must separate quite different conceptions which are comprised under the same
                    name.</p>
                <p>1. The veto may be a mere <hi rend="italic">right of intervention</hi> on the
                    part of a magistrate against the order of another official, or against that of
                    an authority of equal or inferior rank. This was the case in ancient Rome. To
                    this class belong also those cases in which, in the present French republic, the
                    president makes his “no” valid against decisions of the general councillors, and
                    the prefect does the same against decisions of the communal councillors. The use
                    of the expression here is quite justifiable, and this veto is not confined to
                    bills, but refers particularly to administrative measures. It affords a
                    guarantee against the abuse of an official position.</p>
                <p>2. The veto may be a safety-valve against precipitate decisions, and so a <hi
                    rend="italic">preventive measure.</hi> This task is fulfilled by the suspensory
                    veto of the president of the North American Union. Similarly, to this class
                    belong the above-mentioned prescriptions of the Spanish and Norwegian
                    constitutions, and also the veto of the governor of an English colony against
                    decisions of the legislature; for this protest is only intended to prevent a
                    certain want of harmony between the general and the colonial legislation, by
                    calling forth a renewed investigation. This veto is neither an interference with
                    the competence of an authority, nor a division of the legislative power among
                    different factors, but simply a guarantee against precipitancy in the case of a
                    purely legislative measure. The wisdom of establishing this veto power by the
                    constitution is thus manifest.</p>
                <p>3. It is wrong to apply the term veto to what is merely the <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative side of the sanctioning of the laws,</hi> in other words, an act of
                    sovereignty. It would not be in accordance with the nature of a constitutional
                    monarchy to declare the monarch’s consent to a law unnecessary, or make it a
                    compulsory duty; the legislative power is divided between him and the chambers.
                    The sovereign must therefore be perfectly at liberty to say “yes” or “no” in
                    each single case according to his opinion. If he says the latter, we speak of it
                    as his veto, but this—if he possesses an absolute and not merely a suspensory
                    veto—is not an intervention and not a preventive measure, but the negative side
                    of the exercise of the legislative power, and therefore an act of sovereignty.
                    That this right belongs fully and entirely to the holder of sovereign
                    power—however he may be called—is self-evident. One chamber can also by protest
                    prevent a bill of the other from coming into force. The “placet of the temporal
                    power for church affairs—when it occurs—also involves in this manner in itself
                    the veto or non placet.” Where in pure democracies the people in their assembly
                    have the right of veto or referendum, the exercise of it is also a result of the
                    sovereign rights of legislature.</p>
                <p>The peculiar power of veto possessed by the (Prussian)</p>
                <p>president of the federal council of Germany lies on the boundary between (2) and
                    (3). <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. v.</hi> O.)</p>
