                    called “the Silurist,” poet and mystic, was born into an ancient Welsh family
                    settled at Skethiog-on-Usk, in the parish of Llansaintfraed, Brecknockshire, in
                    1621. From 1632 to 1638 he and his twin brother Thomas were privately educated
                    by the rector of Llangattock, and then they proceeded to Jesus College, Oxford.
                    At what time Henry left the university is not known; but it was evidently after
                    he had studied for some time in London and had been introduced into the society
                    of men of letters that he printed his first volume, <hi rend="italic">Poems,
                    with the Tenth Satire of Juvenal Englished</hi> (1646). Of this publication he
                    was afterwards, very needlessly, ashamed. Vaughan presently became a physician
                    and returned to his native country, first for a while practising in the town of
                    Brecon, and then settling down for the remainder of his life in Skethiog. From
                    this place he sent forth his collection of sacred poems, <hi rend="italic">Silex
                    Scintillans,</hi> in 1650, of which a second part appeared in 1655, and the
                    secular poems of his <hi rend="italic">Olor Iscanus,</hi> prepared for the press
                    in 1647, and published without his consent by his brother Thomas in 1651. A
                    mystical treatise in prose, <hi rend="italic">The Mount of Olives,</hi> followed
                    in 1652, and then two prose translations, <hi rend="italic">Flores
                    Solitudinis,</hi> 1654, and <hi rend="italic">Hermetical Physick,</hi> 1655. The
                    world took little notice of these performances. In 1678 an Oxford friend
                    collected the miscellaneous verses of Vaughan’s middle life in a volume entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Thalia Rediviva.</hi> Henry Vaughan died at Skethiog on 23d
                    April 1693, and lies buried in the churchyard of Llansaintfraed.</p>

                <p>As a poet Vaughan comes latest in the so-called “metaphysical” school of the 17th
                    century. He is the most remote of the disciples of Donne, and follows him mainly
                    as he saw him reflected in George Herbert. He analyses his experiences, amatory
                    and sacred, with excessive ingenuity, striking out, every now and then, through
                    his extreme intensity of feeling and his close though limited observation of
                    nature, lines and phrases of marvellous felicity. He is of imagination all
                    compact, and is happiest when he abandons himself most completely to his vision.
                    His verse is apt to seem crabbed and untunable in comparison with that of
                    Crashaw, and even of Herbert at his best. “The Retreat,” with its Wordsworthian
                    intimations, “The World,” mainly because of the magnificence of its opening
                    lines, and “Beyond the Veil” are by far the most popular of Vaughan’s poems and
                    represent him at his best. His passion for the Usk, and his desire to
                    immortalize that pastoral river, are pathetically prominent in his writings. His
                    metrical ear was not fine, and he affected, almost more than Herbert himself,
                    tortured and tuneless forms of self-invented stanza.</p>
                <p>The earlier works of Henry Vaughan, in prose and verse, were collected in a very
                    limited private edition in four volumes, in 1871, by Dr A. B. Grosart. The Rev.
                    H. F. Lyte edited the sacred poems alone in 1847, up to which time Vaughan was
                    practically unknown as a poet.</p>
