                    stretching along the west side of the Rhine valley in a north-northeast
                    direction, from Basel to Mainz, for a distance of 150 miles. Since 1871 the
                    southern portion, from the Ballon d’Alsace to Mont Donon, has been the political
                    boundary between France and Germany. There is a remarkable similarity between
                    the Vosges and the corresponding range of the Black Forest on the other side of
                    the Rhine: both lie within the same degrees of latitude and have the same
                    geological formation; both are characterized by fine forests on their lower
                    slopes, above which are open pasturages and rounded summits of a uniform
                    altitude; both have a steep fall to the Rhine and a gradual descent on the other
                    side. The Vosges in their southern portion are mainly of granite, with some
                    porphyritic masses, and of a kind of red sandstone (occasionally 1640 feet in
                    thickness) which on the western versant bears the name of “grès Vosgien.”</p>
                <p>Orographically the range is divided from south to north into four sections :—the
                    Grandes Vosges (62 miles), extending from Belfort to the valley of the Bruche;
                    the Central Vosges (31 miles), between the Bruche and the Col de Saverne; the
                    Lower Vosges (30 miles), between the Col de Saverne and the source of the
                    Lauter; and the Hardt (25 miles). The rounded summits of the Grandes Vosges are
                    called “ballons.” The departments of Vosges and Haute Saône are divided from
                    Alsace and the territory of Belfort by the Ballon d’Alsace or St Maurice (4100
                    feet). Thence northwards the average height of the range is 3000 feet, the
                    highest point of all, the Ballon de Guebwiller (Gebweiler) or Soultz, rising on
                    the east to a height of 4680 feet. The Col de Saales, between the Grandes Vosges
                    and the central section, is 1900 feet high; the latter is both lower and
                    narrower than the Grandes Vosges, the Mont Donon and other chief heights not
                    exceeding 3300 feet. The railway from Paris to Strasburg and the Rhine and Marne
                    Canal traverse the Col de Saverne (1085 feet). No railway crosses the Vosges
                    between Saverne and Belfort, but there are very good carriage roads over the
                    passes of Bussang (2410 feet) from Remire-mont to Thann, the Schlucht (3746
                    feet) from Gérardmer to Munster, the Bon Homme (3100 feet) from St Dié to
                    Colmar, and from St Dié to St Marie-aux-Mines (2625 feet). The Lower Vosges are
                    a sandstone plateau ranging from 1000 to 1850 feet high, and are crossed by the
                    railway from Hagenau to Sarreguemines, defended by the fort of Bitche. The
                    Hardt, a sterile region, covered with heath and low brushwood, has for its
                    highest point the Donnersberg (Mont Tonnerre), 2264 feet high; it is traversed
                    through deep ravines by the railways from Deux-Ponts to Laudau, and from
                    Kaiserslautern to Spires and Worms. Meteorologically, the difference between the
                    eastern and western versants of the range is very marked, the annual rainfall
                    being much higher and the mean temperature being much lower in the latter than
                    in the former. On the eastern slope the vine ripens to a height of 1300 feet; on
                    the other hand, its only rivers are the Ill and other shorter streams, which
                    afford water-power rather by their rapid fall than by their abundance. The
                    Moselle, Meurthe, and Sarre all rise on the Lorraine side. Moraines, boulders,
                    and polished rocks testify the existence of the glaciers which formerly covered
                    the Vosges. The lakes, surrounded by pines, beeches, and maples, the green
                    meadows where hundreds of cows with tinkling bells peacefully graze, and the
                    fine views of the Rhine valley, Black Forest, and snow-covered Swiss mountains
                    combine to make the district charmingly picturesque. The lower heights and
                    buttresses of the main chain on the Alsatian side are covered with numerous
                    castles, generally in ruins, in connexion with which curious legends and
                    interesting historical incidents are told. At several points on the main ridge,
                    especially at St Odile above Ribeauvillé (Rappoltsweiler), are the remains of a
                    wall of unmortared stone with tenons of wood, 6 to 7 feet thick and 4 to 5 feet
                    high, called the pagan wall (Mur Payen). It was certainly used for local defence
                    in the Middle Ages, and archaeologists are divided as to whether it was built
                    for this purpose by the Romans, or before their arrival.</p>
