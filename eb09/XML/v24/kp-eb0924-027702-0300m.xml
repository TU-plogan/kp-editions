                    (1598-1648), the best writer of <hi rend="italic">vers de société</hi> that
                    France has yet produced, and one of the most influential preceptors of classical
                    French prose, was born at Amiens in 1598. His father was a well-to-do wine
                    merchant, who had connexions with the court, and it is one of the charges
                    brought against Voiture that he was unnecessarily ashamed of his origin. At any
                    rate he soon obtained a position in society, being appointed by Gaston d’Orléans
                    to various offices in his household. Voiture had been well educated, and had
                    profited both by his education and by the school friendships which it enabled
                    him to make. He was early introduced to the Hôtel de Rambouillet, and travelled
                    in the suite of Monsieur, or on missions, a good deal both in and out of France,
                    on one occasion extending his journeyings as far as Ceuta, whence he wrote a
                    letter of elaborate gallantry to Mademoiselle Paulet. Although a follower of
                    Gaston, he made friends with Richelieu, and was one of the earliest
                    Academicians. He also received appointments and pensions from Louis XIII. and
                    Anne of Austria, and became altogether a very prosperous person. During his
                    lifetime he, like most of the literary men of his time who were not cither
                    dramatists or serious scholars, published nothing in book form, but his verses
                    and his prose letters were the delight of the coteries, and were copied, handed
                    about, and admired more perhaps than the work of any contemporary. This coterie
                    success has, it would seem, done them more harm than good in the eyes of
                    posterity. When the long and rather wearisome history of the quarrel between the
                    Uranistes and the Jobelins (partisans of the respective merits of a sonnet of
                    Voiture addressed to a certain Uranie and of another composed by his younger
                    rival Benserade on the subject of Job) is mentioned, the modern reader is apt to
                    suppose that the interest of the affair is merely one of antiquarian gossip. Yet
                    it is difficult to think of any living writer who could surpass, or of any
                    writer living during the last two centuries who could have surpassed, the
                    mixture of gallantry and sincerity in the Uranie sonnet. Another famous piece of
                    his of the same kind, “La Belle Matineuse,” is less exquisite, but still very
                    admirable, and, generally speaking, Voiture deserves the praise given to him at
                    the head of this article. His prose letters, if less interesting to the present
                    generation, are full of lively wit, and are historically even more important. He
                    ranks with Jean de Balzac as the chief director of the reform in French prose
                    which accompanied that of Malherbe, and preceded that of Corneille, in French
                    verse. Nor is there any one to whom more than to Voiture (who was for many years
                    almost an <hi rend="italic">arbiter elegantiarum</hi> in literary matters) the
                    escape of French prose from the over-legislation which had such injurious effect
                    on French verse can be ascribed. The fault of the century—a tendency to
                    elaborate and “metaphysical” turns of phrase—affected him to a certain extent,
                    but in a mild form; and, on the whole, he was the Frenchman of letters of the
                    old school who has been least favourably treated by the resurrection of taste
                    for that old school which the present century has seen. It may seem absurd, but
                    is probably just, to ascribe this absence of enthusiasm in part to the fact that
                    the most unjust censures of the extreme classical school passed harmless by him.
                    Boileau had no abuse for him, and the 18th century read him with pleasure. The
                    militant spirit of Romanticism had therefore nothing to avenge. Voiture lived a
                    careless and Epicurean life for just fifty years, and died at the outbreak of
                    the Fronde, which killed the society to which he was accustomed, on the 26th of
                    May 1648. His works were first published two years later, and a characteristic
                    and rather absurd literary quarrel, which made a great noise at the time, broke
                    out, on the subject of his literary merits, between his friend Costar and a
                    certain Sieur de Griac. The standard modern edition of Voiture is that of
                    Ubicini, 2 vols., Paris, 1855.</p>
