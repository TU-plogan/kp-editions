                    of Paris, with which it is connected by railways on both banks of the Seine and
                    by a tramway. The town owes its existence to the palace (460 feet above the sea)
                    built by Louis XIV. The fresh healthy air and the nearness of the town to Paris
                    have attracted many residents, and the interest attaching to the place draws
                    crowds of visitors. The population in 1881 was 48,012; in 1886 it was 49,514
                    (commune 49,852), including about 10,000 military.</p>
                <p>The three avenues of St Cloud, Paris, and Sceaux converge in the Place d’Armes.
                    Between them stand the former stables of the palace, now occupied by the
                    artillery and engineers. To the south lies the quarter of Satory, the oldest
                    part of Versailles, with the cathedral of St Louis, and to the north the new
                    quarter, with the church of Notre Dame. To the west a gilded iron gate and a
                    stone balustrade shut off the great court of the palace from the Place d’Armes.
                    On either side are allegorical groups, besides statues of the statesmen Suger,
                    Sully, Richelieu, and Colbert, the soldiers Duguesclin, Bayard, Turenne, and
                    Condé, the sailors Duquesne, Tourville, Duguay-Trouin, and Suffren, and the
                    marshals Jourdan, Masséna, Lannes, and Mortier. At the highest point of the
                    court there is an equestrian statue in bronze of Louis XIV., and to the right
                    and left of this stretch the long wings of the palace, while behind it stand the
                    central buildings one behind the other as far as the Marble Court. Here all the
                    lines of construction meet, and here were the rooms of Louis XIV. To the north
                    the Chapel Court and to the south the Princes Court, with vaulted passages
                    leading to the gardens, separate the side from the central buildings. On the
                    latter is the inscription “À toutes les gloires de la France,” which Louis
                    Philippe justified by forming a collection of five thousand works of art (valued
                    at £1,000,000), commemorating the great events and persons of French history.
                    The palace chapel (1696-1710), the roof of which can be seen from afar rising
                    above the rest of the building, was the last work of Mansard. Opposite the altar
                    is the king’s gallery, which communicates with the rooms on the first floor of
                    the palace. The ground-floor of the north wing on the garden side contains
                    eleven halls of historical pictures from Clovis to Louis XIV., and on the side
                    of the interior courts a gallery of tombs, statues, busts of kings and
                    celebrities of France for the same period. The Halls of the Crusades open

                <p>this gallery, and are decorated with the arms of crusaders, kings, princes,
                    lords, and knights, and with those of the grand-masters and knights of the
                    military religious orders. On the first floor of the north wing on the garden
                    side are ten halls of pictures commemorating historical events from 1795 to
                    1855; on the court side is the gallery of sculpture which contains the Joan of
                    Arc of the Princess Marie of Orleans; and there are seven halls chiefly devoted
                    to French campaigns and generals in Africa, Italy, the Crimea, and Mexico, with
                    some famous war pictures by Horace Vernet. The second story has a portrait
                    gallery. In the north wing is also the theatre built under Louis XV. by Gabriel,
                    which was first used on the 16th of May 1770 on the marriage of the dauphin
                    (afterwards Louis XVI.) and Marie Antoinette. Here, on 2d October 1789, the
                    celebrated banquet was given to the Gardes du Corps, the toasts at which
                    provoked the riots that drove the royal family from Versailles; and here the
                    national assembly met from 10th March 1871 till the proclamation of the
                    constitution in 1875, and the senate from 8th March 1876 till the return of the
                    two chambers to Paris in 1879. The central buildings of the palace project into
                    the garden. On the ground floor are the halls of celebrated warriors (once the
                    anteroom of Madame de Pompadour), marshals, constables, and admirals. The Great
                    Dauphin (son of Louis XIV. ), the duke and duchess of Berri, the dauphin (son of
                    Louis XV.), Madame de Montespan, Madame de Pompadour, and the daughters of Louis
                    XV. all lived in this part of the palace. The gallery of Louis XIII., decorated
                    with historical pictures of his and Louis XIV.’s time, leads to the halls
                    surrounding the Marble Court. One of these contains many plans of battles, and
                    at its door Louis XV. was wounded by Damiens in 1757. The lobbies of the ground
                    floor are full of busts, statues, and tombs of kings and celebrated men. The
                    famous state rooms are on the first floor. On the garden side, facing the north,
                    are a series of seven halls,—among them that of Hercules, till 1710 the upper
                    half of the old chapel, where the dukes of Chartres, Maine, and Burgundy were
                    married, and Bossuet, Massillon, and Bourdaloue preached; the Hall of Mercury,
                    where the coffin of Louis XIV. stood for eight days after his death; and the
                    Hall of Apollo, or throne room. To the front of the palace, facing the west, are
                    the Galleries of War and Peace, with allegorical pictures, and the Glass
                    Gallery, built by Mansard in 1678 (240 feet long, 34 wide, and 43 high), having
                    34 arches, 17 of which are filled with windows looking on the gardens and 17
                    with large mirrors. The gallery is overloaded with ornament, and the pictures by
                    Lebrun, the trophies and figures of children by Coysevox, and the inscriptions
                    attributed to Boileau and Racine all glorify Louis XIV. This gallery was used by
                    him as a throne room on state occasions. Here the king of Prussia was proclaimed
                    emperor of Germany on 16th January 1871. Connected with the Gallery of Peace is
                    the queen's room, occupied successively by Marie Thérèse, Marie Leczinska, and
                    Marie Antoinette, where the duchess of Angoulême was born, the duchess of
                    Burgundy died, and Marie Antoinette was almost assassinated on 6th October 1789.
                    The Coronation Hall is so called from David’s picture of Napoleon’s coronation,
                    which is regarded as the artist’s masterpiece. This hall opens on the marble, or
                    queen’s, staircase. Behind the Glass Gallery on the side of the court are the
                    rooms of Louis XIV. The Oeil de Boeuf, named from its oval window, was the
                    anteroom where the courtiers waited till the king rose. In it is a picture
                    representing Louis XIV. and his family as Olympian deities; and it leads to the
                    bedroom in which Louis XIV. died, after using it from 1701, and which Louis XV.
                    occupied from 1722 to 1738. To the north of the Marble Court are the “petits
                    appartements” of Louis XV. and to the south those of Marie Antoinette. Among the
                    former is the Porcelain Gallery, where every year under Louis XVI. the best work
                    made at Sèvres was displayed. On the second floor of the buildings surrounding
                    the Stags Court Madame du Barry lived, and Louis XVI. afterwards worked at
                    lockmaking. Marie Thérèse and Marie Leczinska had previously used the “petits
                    appartements” of Marie Antoinette, one of the rooms of which is ornamented with
                    woodwork of her time. In this part of the palace Madame de Maintenon and the
                    duke of Burgundy had rooms, those of the latter being afterwards occupied by
                    Cardinal de Fleury and the duke of Penthièvre. In the south wing of the palace,
                    on the ground floor, are the Imperial Galleries (the first rooms of which were
                    used by the duke and duchess of Bourbon under Louis XIV.) and the rooms occupied
                    by the president of congress when the two legislative bodies meet together at
                    Versailles. A sculpture gallery contains busts of celebrated scholars, artists,
                    generals, and public men from the time of Louis XVI. onwards. In the south wing
                    is also the room where the chamber of deputies met from 1876 till 1879, and
                    where the congress has since sat to revise the constitution of 1875 and to elect
                    the president of the republic. The first floor is almost entirely occupied by
                    the Battle Gallery (394 feet long and 43 wide), opened in 1836 on the site of
                    rooms used by Monsieur the brother of Louis XIV. and the duke and duchess of
                    Chartres. It is lighted from above, and the walls are hung with pictures of
                    French victories. In the window openings are the names of soldiers killed while
                    fighting for France, with the names of the battles in which they fell, and there
                    are more than eighty busts of princes, admirals, constables, marshals, and
                    celebrated warriors who met a similar death. Another room is given up to the
                    events of 1830 and the accession of Louis Philippe, and a gallery contains the
                    statues and busts of kings and celebrities from Philip VI. to Louis XVI. In the
                    rooms of the second story are portraits (mostly modern), sea-pieces, pictures of
                    royal residences, and some historical pictures of the time of Louis
                    Philippe.</p>
                <p>The gardens of Versailles were planned by Le Nôtre. The best view is obtained
                    from a balcony of the Glass Gallery. The ground falls away on every side from a
                    terrace adorned with ornamental basins, statues, and bronze groups. Westwards
                    from the palace extends a broad avenue, planted with large trees, and having
                    along its centre the grass of the “Tapis Vert”; it is continued by the Grand
                    Canal, 200 feet wide and 1 mile long. On the south two splendid staircases of
                    103 steps, 66 feet wide, lead past the Orangery to the Swiss Lake, 1312 feet
                    long and 460 wide, beyond which is the wood of Satory. On the north an avenue,
                    with twenty-two groups of three children, each group holding a marble basin,
                    from which a jet of water rises, slopes gently down to the Basin of Neptune,
                    remarkable for its fine sculptures and abundant water. The Orangery (built in
                    1685 by Mansard) is the finest piece of architecture at Versailles; the central
                    gallery is 508 feet long and 42 wide, and each of the side galleries is 375 feet
                    long. There are twelve hundred orange-trees, one of which is said to be 465
                    years old, and three hundred other kinds of trees. The alleys of the parks are
                    ornamented with statues, vases, and regularly-cut yews, and bordered by hedges
                    surrounding the shrubberies. Between the central terrace and the Tapis Vert is
                    the Basin of Latona or the Frogs, with a white marble group of Latona with
                    Apollo and Diana. Beyond the Tapis Vert is the large Basin of Apollo, who is
                    represented in his chariot drawn by four horses; there are three jets of water,
                    one 60, the others 50 feet in height. The Grand Canal is still used for nautical
                    displays; under Louis XIV. it was covered with Venetian gondolas and other
                    boats, and the evening entertainments usually ended with a display of fireworks.
                    Around the Tapis Vert are numerous groves, the most remarkable being the
                    Ballroom or Rockery, with a waterfall; the Queen’s Shrubbery, the scene of the
                    intrigue of the diamond necklace; that of the Colonnade, with thirty-two marble
                    columns and a group of Pluto carrying off Proserpine, by Girardon; the King’s
                    Shrubbery, laid out in the English style by Louis Philippe; the beautiful Grove
                    of Apollo, with a group of that god and the nymphs, by Girardon; and the Basin
                    of Enceladus, with a jet of water 75 feet high. Among the chief attractions of
                    Versailles are the fountains and waterworks made by Louis XIV. in imitation of
                    those he had seen at Fouquet’s chateau of Vaux. Owing to the scarcity of water
                    at Versailles, the works at <hi rend="smallcaps">Marly-le-Roi (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> were constructed in order to bring water from the
                    Seine; but part of the supply thus obtained was diverted to the newly-erected
                    château of Marly. Vast sums of money were spent and many lives lost in an
                    attempt to bring water from the Eure, but the work was stopped by the war of
                    1688. At last the waters of the plateau between Versailles and Rambouillet were
                    collected and led by channels (total length 98 miles) to the gardens, the soil
                    of which covers innumerable pipes, vaults, and aqueducts. The total volume of
                    water annually brought to Versailles is about 175,000,000 cubic feet, of which
                    two-fifths supply the town and the rest the park.</p>
                <p>Beyond the present park, but within that of Louis XIV., are the two Trianons. The
                    Grand Trianon was originally erected as a retreat for Louis XIV. in 1670, but in
                    1687 Mansard built a new palace on its site. Louis XV., after establishing a
                    botanic garden, made Gabriel build in 1766 the small pavilion of the Petit
                    Trianon, where the machinery is still shown by which his supper-table came up
                    through the floor. It was a favourite residence of Marie Antoinette, who had a
                    garden laid out in the English style, and lived an imaginary peasant-life. The
                    Grand Trianon is a one-storied building with two wings, and has been occupied by
                    Monsieur (Louis XIV.’s brother), by the Great Dauphin, the duke of Burgundy, the
                    duchess of Orleans, Napoleon I., and Louis Philippe and his court. The duke and
                    duchess of Orleans lived in the Petit Trianon. The gardens of the Grand Trianon
                    are in the same style as those of Versailles, and there is a museum with a
                    curious collection of state carriages, old harness, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Apart from the palace, there are no buildings of interest in Versailles, the
                    church of Notre Dame, built by Mansard, the cathedral of St Louis, built by his
                    grandson, the Protestant church, and the English chapel being in no way
                    remarkable. The celebrated tennis-court is now used as a museum. The large and
                    sumptuous palace of the prefecture was built during the second empire, and was a
                    residence of the president of the republic from 1871 to 1879. The library
                    consists of 60,000 volumes; and the military hospital formerly accommodated 2000
                    people in the service of the palace. There are a statue of General Hoche and one
                    of Abbé de 1’ Épée in the town. A school of horticulture was founded in 1874,
                    attached to an excellent garden, near the Swiss Lake.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi> —Louis XIII. often hunted in the woods of
                    Versailles, and built a small pavilion at the corner of what is now the Rue de
                    La Pompe and the avenue of St Cloud. In 1627 he entrusted Lemercier with the
                    plan of a château, and in 1632 bought the land from François de Gondi, first
                    archbishop of Paris, for £2640. In 1661 Levau made some additions, and in 1682
                    Louis XIV. took up his residence at Versailles, and gave Mansard orders to erect
                    the great palace in which the original buildings disappeared. Fabulous sums were
                    spent on the palace, gardens, and works of art, the accounts for which were
                    destroyed by the king. Till his time the town was represented by a few houses to
                    the south of the present Place d’Armes; but land was given to the lords of the
                    court and new houses sprang up, chiefly in the north quarter. Under Louis XV.
                    the parish of St Louis was formed to the south for the increasing population,
                    and new streets were built to the north on the meadows of Clagny, where in 1674
                    Mansard had built at Louis XIV.’s orders a chateau for Madame de Montespan,
                    which was now pulled down. Under Louis XVI. the town extended to the east and
                    received a municipality; in 1802 it gave its name to a bishopric. In 1783 the
                    peace by which England recognized the independence of the United States was
                    signed at Versailles. The states-general met here on 5th May 1789, and on 20th
                    June took the solemn oath by which they bound themselves never to separate till
                    they had given France a constitution, and which led to the riots of 5th and 6th
                    October. Napoleon, Louis XVIII., and Charles X. merely kept up Versailles, but
