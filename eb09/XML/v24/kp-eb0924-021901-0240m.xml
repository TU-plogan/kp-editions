                    1489-1566), one of the most eminent Latin poets and scholars of the age of Leo
                    X., was born at Cremona shortly before the year 1490. He received the name of
                    Marcantonio in baptism, but changed this to Marco Girolamo when he entered the
                    order of the Canonici Regolari Lateranensi. During his early manhood he acquired
                    considerable fame by the composition of two didactic poems in the Latin tongue,
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Game of Chess</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Silkworm.</hi> This reputation induced him to seek the papal court in Rome,
                    which was rapidly becoming the headquarters of polite learning, the place where
                    students might expect advancement through their literary talents. Vida reached
                    Rome in the last years of the pontificate of Julius II. Leo X., on succeeding to
                    the papal chair (1513), treated him with marked favour, bestowed on him the
                    priory of St Sylvester at Frascati, and bade him compose a heroic Latin poem on
                    the life of Christ. Such was the origin of the <hi rend="italic">Christiad,</hi>
                    Vida’s most celebrated, if not his best, performance. It did not, however, see
                    the light in Leo’s lifetime. Between the years 1520 and 1527 Vida produced the
                    second of his masterpieces in Latin hexameters, a didactic poem on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Art of Poetry.</hi> Clement VII. raised him to the rank of
                    apostolic protonotary, and in 1532 conferred on him the bishopric of Alba. It is
                    probable that he took up his residence in this town soon after the death of
                    Clement; and here he spent the greater portion of his remaining years. Vida
                    attended the council of Trent, where he enjoyed the society of Cardinals
                    Cervini, Pole, and Del Monte, together with his friend the poet Flaminio. A
                    record of their conversations may be studied in Vida’s Latin dialogue <hi
                    rend="italic">De Republica.</hi> Among his other writings should be mentioned
                    three eloquent orations in defence of Cremona against Pavia, composed upon the
                    occasion of some dispute as to precedency between those two cities. Vida died at
                    Alba on 27th September 1566.</p>
                <p>Vida’s fame rests almost wholly on his Latin poems. These are more remarkable for
                    their purity and grace of style than for qualities of imagination or powerful
                    thinking. His contemporaries were of opinion that Vida approached more nearly to
                    the ancients in majesty and gravity of diction than his rivals. Indeed, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ρoetica</hi> can still be read with both pleasure and instruction.
                    Though we miss the poetic glow of Poliziano’s and Pontano’s Latin compositions,
                    and the exquisite workmanship of Flaminio’s lyrics, there is in Vida so facile a
                    command of the Latin language and metre that we might fancy ourselves listening
                    to a writer of the Augustan age. The following lines will give a fair notion of
                    his powers</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Vida’s poems were collected and printed at Oxford in 1722, and
                    an enlarged edition appeared in 1731. For an account of his works, see
