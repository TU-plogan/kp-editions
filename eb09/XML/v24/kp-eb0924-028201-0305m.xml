                    afterwards assumed the name of Volney. When he was about four aud twenty he
                    acquired some reputation by an essay on the chronology of Herodotus, and was
                    introduced into literary and philosophical society. He then did what was at the
                    time not common, common as it has become since. Having inherited a sum of money,
                    he visited the East and spent some four years in Egypt and Syria, writing the
                    history of his travels when he returned, and publishing it in 1787. He had not
                    merely travelled but had learnt Arabic, and had studied the politics as well as
                    the topography of the countries he visited. Of the former study he gave evidence
                    the year before the Revolution by some <hi rend="italic">Considerations</hi> on
                    the war between Russia and Turkey. He was a member both of the States-General
                    and of the Constituante, and distinguished himself as an ardent reformer. In
                    1791 appeared the book <hi rend="italic">Les Ruines,</hi> by which he is known
                    to a great many people who have never read it. It is a kind of essay on the
                    philosophy of history written from the <hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi> point
                    of view, and of course containing some direct and much oblique manifestation of
                    <hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi> antipathy to religion. It is probable,
                    however, that those who, after the lapse of a century, read it under the
                    impression of the strong denunciations of it by some orthodox writers of its own
                    and immediately succeeding times will be not a little surprised. The book, of
                    which the full title is <hi rend="italic">Les Ruines, ou Méditation sur les
                    Révolutions des Empires,</hi> purports to contain the discourses of a traveller
                    among the ruins of Palmyra with a very 18th-century genius. Volney was a good
                    deal more than a mere author. He tried to put his politico-economic theories
                    into practice in Corsica, where in 1792 he bought an estate and made an attempt
                    to cultivate colonial produce. He was thrown into prison during the Jacobin
                    triumph, but escaped the guillotine. He was some time professor of history at
                    the newly-founded École Normale, lectured there, and published his lectures.
                    Then he undertook a journey to the United States, the result of which took form
                    in a book (chiefly geographical) published in 1803. Next year he republished and
                    much enlarged his early essay on Herodotus. He was not a partisan of Napoleon,
                    but, being a moderate man, a savant, and a Liberal, was impressed into service
                    by the emperor, who made him a count and put him into the senate, of which he
                    was one of the least servile members. The restoration in the same way recruited
                    him against his will, and he became a peer of France. He was a member of the
                    Institute and latterly of the Academy proper, and, besides his historical,
                    political, and (as the 18th century understood philosophy) philosophical
                    studies, was a philologist of some power. He died at Paris on April 25, 1820,
                    and his complete works appeared soon afterwards in 8 volumes.</p>
                <p>Volney has been called the last of the <hi rend="italic">philosophes,</hi> and
                    so, if date and eminence together be considered, he was. It may, as in many such
                    cases, be doubted whether his identification with a powerful but one-sided
                    movement was more of service than of disservice to him. No doubt it stimulated
                    his work, but it also cramped and distorted it,—the curious and not wholly
                    intelligible attitude of the whole school towards Christianity showing itself
                    distinctly in him as a prejudicing and narrowing force. He was, however, an
                    accurate observer, a thinker of acuteness and originality if not of great width
                    or depth, and master of his pen in no ordinary degree. His style suffers from
                    the general defects of 18th-century French prose, in being thin, colourless, and
                    devoid of flavour despite its clearness and brilliancy. But it serves him as a
                    most excellent vehicle both of description and of argument.</p>
