                    Armenia and Kurdistan, in an extremely fertile plain some 40 miles in circuit,
                    which is described as one of the gardens of the East, whence the local saying:
                    “Van in this world, heaven in the next.” Its low flat-roofed houses are grouped
                    irregularly at the southern base of a nummulitic limestone eminence, somewhat
                    resembling a camel’s back, which rises 100 feet sheer above the plain and is
                    crowned by the so-called citadel, the fortifications of which are mostly in a
                    dilapidated state. But it is naturally a position of great strength and of
                    considerable strategic importance, standing at the junction of two military
                    routes, which here diverge westwards through Mush and Kharpút to Asia Minor and
                    southwards to Mosul and Mesopotamia, besides commanding the approaches to the
                    Persian frontier at Kotúr and Bayezid. The town itself, which contains four
                    mosques, two large churches, an Armenian bazaar, baths, and caravanserais, is
                    enclosed within a double line of crenellated walls and ditches on the three
                    sides not protected by the rock; and beyond these enclosures lies the suburban
                    district of Baghlar, or the “Gardens.” The population, estimated at from 30,000
                    to 35,000, are Turks, except about 2000 Armenians and a few hundred Mohammedan
                    and Nestorian Kurds. Besides trade and agriculture, the inhabitants are engaged
                    in a few industries, such as the making of coarse cotton chintzes, a highly
                    prized goat-hair waterproof moire antique, a thick woollen cloth called <hi
                    rend="italic">shayak,</hi> and an excellent soap, prepared from the saline
                    efflorescences of Lakes Van and Erchek, which consist in about equal proportions
                    of the carbonate and sulphate of soda.</p>
                <p>Armenian tradition derives the name of Van from an Armenian king who reigned a
                    little before Alexander the Great, and speaks of an older city founded by
                    Semiramis (Shemiramagerd). This is of course fable; but the Vannic inscriptions
                    (vol. xiii. p. 116) show that the region was the seat of an Armenian kingdom,
                    whose native name was Biaina, as early as the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> In the isolated rock towering above the plain there are numerous
                    galleries, flights of steps, crypts, and cuneiform rock inscriptions, one of
                    which is trilingual, like that of Behistún, and like it relates the deeds of
                    Xerxes, son of Darius. Others are in the Haikan or Old Armenian language; while
                    for others scattered over the district a solution has been sought by Prof. Sayce
                    with doubtful success in the present language of Georgia.</p>
                <p>The vilayet of Van, one of the finest but also one of the least developed regions
                    of Asiatic Turkey, lies on the Persian frontier between Erzerum (north) and
                    Baghdad (south). It has an area of 15,000 square miles, with a population of
                    over 1,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lake Van.</hi></p>
                <p>Lake Van, called <hi rend="italic">Arsissa Palus</hi> by the ancients, and also
                    <hi rend="italic">Thos-pitis,</hi> from its Armenian name Tosp, is 80 miles long
                    and 30 broad, with a total area of 1500 square miles. Although of smaller extent
                    than Lake Urmia, it contains a much larger volume of water owing to its much
                    greater depth, which is at least 80 feet near Van and still more along the south
                    side. The lake stands about 5400 feet above sea-level on the south Armenian
                    plateau, which is encircled by the lofty ranges that bifurcate west and south
                    from Ararat and culminate in the Sipan-Dagh (12,000 feet) on the north side of
                    the lake. These mountains are clad with dense forests of beech, chestnut, ash,
                    and walnut, while the broad fertile belt between their base and the lake is
                    planted with melon gardens and orchards of plums, peaches, apricots, figs, and
                    pomegranates, festooned with a vine which yields a palatable wine.</p>

                <p>Lake Van, which is too brackish to be drinkable for man or beast, is inhabited by
                    a species of blay or bleak, which abound especially about the mouths of the
                    influents, and come to the surface when the spring floods spread over the
                    heavier saline layers. This lake is a completely land-locked basin, or at least
                    has no visible outlet. But the natives speak of underground channels through
                    which it communicates south-westwards with the head-waters of the Tigris,
                    attributing to the occasional obstruction of these channels the great
                    oscillations of level that have undoubtedly occurred in past and recent times.
                    In the 17th century and again about 1840 the water rose from 10 to 12 feet, and
                    is even now (1888) rising. Lake Erchek perhaps marks its extreme eastern limit
                    in former times. Lake Van is also indirectly connected with the Euphrates
                    through the little Lake of Nazik, which lies west of the Sipan-Dagh, on the
                    water-parting between the lacustrian and fluvial basins, and which by a rare
                    phenomenon sends emissaries to both. The narrow part of Lake Van, which runs for
                    nearly 40 miles towards the north-east, and gives the lake somewhat the
                    appearance of a frying-pan, is very shallow, and was once, according to
                    tradition, a fertile plain. The lake is not regularly navigated. Scattered along
                    the south-east shore are a few picturesque islets, one of which, Aktamar, is the
                    seat of an Armenian patriarch.</p>
