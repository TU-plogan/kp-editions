                    the rank of brigadier-general. He afterwards served for some time with the army
                    of the eastern Pyrenees, and in the Italian campaign of 1795-97 he so acquitted
                    himself at Mondovi, Roveredo, Porto Legnago, and many other places that he was
                    promoted to be general of a division. After the peace of Campo Formio he for
                    some time commanded the forces in the department of La Vendée; but in 1798 he
                    was again in Italy and in the battle of Marengo especially took a very important
                    part. In 1803 he became commander-inchief of the Batavian army, and after the
                    peace of Amiens he acted for eighteen months as French plenipotentiary at
                    Copenhagen. On the outbreak of hostilities with Prussia he joined the fifth army
                    corps as chief of the general staff; at the battle of Friedland he commanded the
                    first corps in such a manner that Napoleon made him marshal of the empire on the
                    field. After the peace of Tilsit he became governor of Prussia, and in 1808 he
                    was created duke of Belluno. In the same year he was sent to Spain, where he
                    took a prominent part in military affairs, until his appointment in 1812 to
                    command the ninth army corps destined to operate in Russia. Here his most
                    important service was in protecting the retreating army at the crossing of the
                    Berezina. He took an active part in the wars of 1813-14, till in February of the
                    latter year he had the misfortune to arrive too late at Montereau-sur-Yonne. The
                    result was a scene of violent recrimination and his deprivation by the emperor,
                    who transferred his command to Gérard. Thus wounded in his amour propre, Victor
                    now transferred his allegiance to the Bourbon dynasty, and in December 1814
                    received from Louis XVIII. the command of the second military division. In 1815
                    he accompanied the king to Ghent, and on the second restoration he was made a
                    peer of France and major-general of the royal guard. In 1821 he was appointed
                    war minister and held this office for two years. After the revolution of 1830 he
                    retired altogether into private life. His death took place at Paris on 3d March
                    1841.</p>
