                    Petersburg and Archangel.</p>
                <p>Vologda existed as a place of commerce as early as the 12th century. It was a
                    colony of Novgorod, and, owing to its advantageous position and the enterprise
                    of the Novgorod merchants, it grew to be a populous city. It carried on a brisk
                    trade in flax, tallow, and furs, which were sent in from Ustyug Velikiy,—another
                    important colony of Novgorod; while the Byelo-ozero merchants brought to Vologda
                    and Ustyug corn, leather, and various manufactured goods to be bartered against
                    furs, or to be shipped to Klołmogory, at the mouth of the Dwina. In 1273 it was
                    plundered by the prince of Tver in alliance with the Tartars, but soon
                    recovered. Moscow disputed its possession with Novgorod until the 15th century;
                    the Moscow princes intrigued to find support amidst the poorer inhabitants
                    against the richer Novgorod merchants, and four successive times Vologda had to
                    fight against its metropolis. It was definitely annexed to Moscow in 1447. When
                    Archangel was founded, and opened for foreign trade in 1553, Vologda became the
                    chief depôt for goods exported through that channel. They were brought on
                    sledges from Moseow, Yaroslavl, and Kostroma; and special <hi rend="italic"
                    >yams,</hi> or post stations, were maintained to connect Vologda with Moscow.
                    Many foreigners lived at Vologda; Fletcher, the British envoy, stayed there, and
                    the first Russian envoy to Britain came originally from Vologda. Polish bands
                    plundered it in 1613, and the plague of 1648 devastated it; but it maintained
                    its commercial importance until the foundation of St Petersburg, when Russian
                    foreign trade took another channel.</p>
