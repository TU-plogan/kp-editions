                <p>UP to a comparatively recent date an “observatory” was a place exclusively
                    devoted to the taking of astronomical observations, although frequently a rough
                    account of the weather was kept. When the progress of terrestrial magnetism and
                    meteorology began to make regular observations necessary, the duty of taking
                    these was often thrown on astronomical observatories, although in some cases
                    separate institutions were created for the purpose. Of late years, as the work
                    to be done in astronomical observatories is increasing, there seems to be a
                    general tendency to have the magnetical and meteorological observations taken in
                    separate establishments; but, as the exclusively magnetical or meteorological
                    observatories now existing are generally very small institutions and of recent
                    creation, the astronomical observatories will be chiefly considered in this
                    article.</p>
                <p>Up to about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> it can scarcely be said that an
                    observatory existed anywhere, as the crude observations <pb break="no"

                    individuals and at intervals, employing the simplest possible apparatuses. But,
                    when philosophical speculation had exhausted its resources, and an accumulation
                    of facts was found to be necessary before the knowledge of the construction of
                    the universe could advance farther, the first observatory was founded at
                    Alexandria, and continued in activity for about four hundred years, or until the
                    middle or end of the 2d century of the Christian era. It was here that
                    Hipparchus, the founder of modern astronomy, by repeating observations made by
                    his predecessors, discovered the precession of the equinoxes, and investigated
                    with considerable success the motions of the sun, moon, and planets. His work
                    was continued by more or less distinguished astronomers, until Ptolemy (in the
                    2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> gave the astronomy of Alexandria its
                    final development. When science again began to be cultivated after the dark ages
                    which followed, we find several observatories founded by Arabian princes; first
                    one at Baghdad (and possibly one at Damascus), built by the caliph Al-Mamùn
                    early in the 9th century, then one on the Mokattam near Cairo, built for Ibn
                    Yιinis by the caliph Hâkim (about 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> where
                    the Hâkimite tables of the sun, moon, and planets were constructed. The Mongol
                    khans followed the example; thus arose the splendid observatory at Merâgha in
                    the north-west of Persia, founded about 1260 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by
                    Hulagu Khan, where Nâsir al-din Tùsi constructed the Ilohkhanic tables; and in
                    the 15th century the observatory at Samarkand was founded by Ulug Begh, and
                    served not only in the construction of new planetary tables but also in the
                    formation of a new catalogue of stars.</p>
                <p>With the commencement of scientific studies in Europe in the 15th century the
                    necessity of astronomical observations became at once felt, as they afforded the
                    only hope of improving the theory of the motions of the celestial bodies.
                    Although astronomy was taught in all universities, the taking of observations
                    was for two hundred years left to private individuals. The first observatory in
                    Europe was erected at Nuremberg in 1472 by a wealthy citizen, Bernhard Walther,
                    who for some years enjoyed the co-operation of the celebrated astronomer
                    Regiomontanus. At this observatory, where the work was continued till the
                    founder’s death in 1504, many new methods of observing were invented, so that
                    the revival of practical astronomy may be dated from its foundation. The two
                    celebrated observatories of the 16th century, Tycho Brahe’s on the Danish island
                    of Huen (in activity from 1576 to 1597) and that of Landgrave William IV. at
                    Cassel (1561-97), made a complete revolution in the art of observing. "While the
                    credit of having vastly improved the astronomical instruments perhaps should be
                    φvided equally between Tycho Brahe and the landgrave’s astronomer Biirgi, the
                    former may claim the honour of having been the first to see the necessity of
                    carrying on for a number of years an extensive and carefully-planned series of
                    observations with various instruments, worked by himself and a staff of
                    assistants. In this respect his observatory (Uraniburgum) resembles our modem
                    larger institutions more closely than do many observatories of much more recent
                    date. The mighty impulse which Tycho Brahe gave to practical astronomy at last
                    installed this science at the universities, among which those of Leyden and
                    Copenhagen were the first to found observatories. We still find a large private
                    observatory in the middle of the 17th century, that of Johannes Hevelius at
                    Dantzic, but the foundation of the royal observatories at Paris and Greenwich
                    and of numerous university observatories shows how rapidly the importance of
                    observations had become recognized by governments and public bodies, and it is
                    not until within the last hundred years that the development of various new
                    branches of astronomy has enabled private observers to compete with public
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>The instruments employed in observatories have of course changed considerably
                    during the last two hundred years. When the first royal observatories were
                    founded, the principal instruments were the mural quadrant for measuring
                    meridian zenith distances of stars, and the sextant for measuring distances of
                    stars <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> with a view of determining their
                    difference of right ascension by a simple calculation. These instruments were
                    introduced by Tycho Brahe, but were subsequently much improved by the addition
                    of telescopes and micrometers. When the law of gravitation was discovered it
                    became necessary to test the correctness of the theoretical conclusions drawn
                    from it as to the motions within the solar system, and this necessarily added to
                    the importance of observations. By degrees, as theory progressed, it made
                    greater demands for the accuracy of observations, and accordingly the
                    instruments had to be improved. The transit instrument superseded the sextant
                    and offered the advantage of furnishing the difference of right ascension
                    directly; the clocks and chronometers were greatly improved; and lastly
                    astronomers began early in the 19th century to treat their instruments, not as
                    faultless apparatuses but as imperfect ones, whose errors of construction had to
                    be detected, studied, and taken into account before the results of observations
                    could be used to test the theory. This century has also witnessed the
                    combination of the transit instrument and the mural quadrant or circle in one
                    instrument,—the transit or meridian circle.</p>
                <p>While the necessity of following the sun, moon, and planets as regularly as
                    possible increased the daily work of observatories, other branches of astronomy
                    were opened and demanded other observations. Hitherto observations of the “fixed
                    stars” had been supposed to be of little importance beyond fixing points of
                    comparison for observations of the movable bodies. But when many of the fixed
                    stars were found to be endowed with “proper motion,” it became necessary to
                    include them among the objects of constant attention, and in their turn the
                    hitherto totally neglected telescopic stars had to be observed with precision,
                    when they were required as comparison stars for comets or minor planets. Thus
                    the field of work for meridian instruments became very considerably
                    enlarged.</p>
                <p>In addition to this, the increase of optical power of telescopes revealed
                    hitherto unknown objects—double stars and nebulae—and brought the study of the
                    physical constitution of the heavenly bodies within the range of observatory
                    work. Researches connected with these matters were, however, for a number of
                    years chiefly left to amateur observers, and it is only within the last fifty
                    years that many public observatories have taken up this kind of work. The
                    application of spectrum analysis, photography, photometry, &amp;c., in astronomy
                    has still more increased the number and variety of observations to be made, so
                    that it has now become necessary for most observatories to devote themselves to
                    one or two special fields of work.</p>
                <p>It would be difficult to arrange the existing observatories into classes either
                    according to the work pursued in them or their organization, as the work in many
                    cases at different times has been directed to different objects, while the
                    organization depends mostly on national and local circumstances. As already
                    alluded to above, one of the principal characteristics of the larger
                    observatories of the present day is the distribution of the work among a number
                    of assistants under the general superintendence of a director. This applies
                    principally to the great observatories, where the sun, moon, planets, and a
                    limited number of fixed stars are without interruption being observed, but even
                    among <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n767/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0767-0710"/> these institutions hardly two are conducted on
                    the same principles. Thus in Greenwich the instruments and observations are all
                    treated according to strict rules laid down by the astronomer-royal, while in
                    Washington or Pulkowa each astronomer has to a certain extent his choice as to
                    the treatment of the instrument and arrangement of the observations. The same is
                    the case with the smaller institutions, in most of which these arrangements vary
                    very much with change of personnel.</p>
                <p>The way in which the results of observations are published depends principally on
                    the size of the institutions. The larger observatories issue their “Annals” or
                    “Observations” as separate periodically-published volumes, while the smaller
                    ones chiefly depend on scientific journals to lay their results before the
                    public, naturally less fully as to details. Among these journals the principal

                    navigation. The observations have therefore from the first been principally
                    intended to determine the positions of standard stars, the sun and planets, and
                    above all to follow the motion of the moon with as little interruption as
                    possible, both on and outside the meridian. Since 1873 spectroscopic
                    observations and a daily photographic record of sun-spots have been taken. The
                    observatory is under the direction of the astronomer-royal; and from the time of
                    its first astronomer, Flamsteed, the institution has always maintained its place
                    in the foremost rank of observatories. Thus the observations of Bradley <hi
                    rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1762) form the foundation of modern stellar astronomy;
                    but it was especially during the directorship of Airy (1835-81) that the
                    observatory rose to its present high state of efficiency. There are now a chief
                    assistant, eight assistants, and a staff of computers employed. The principal
                    instruments now in use are :—a meridian circle by Simms (and Ransomes and May as
                    engineers), erected in 1850, having a circle of 6-feet diameter and a telescope
                    of 8-inches aperture; a large chronograph (1854); an altazimuth by Simms and
                    Ransomes and May, for observations of the moon, erected in 1847, with 3- feet
                    circles and 4-inch telescope; an equatorial refractor by the same makers (O.G.
                    12 ’ 8 inches, by Merz), mounted in the “English” manner with long polar axis,
                    chiefly used for spectroscopic work; photoheliograph by Dallmeyer of 4-inches
                    aperture, smaller equatorials, clocks, &amp;c. The standard “motor clock” is the
                    centre of a system of electrically <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> controlled
                    clocks scattered over many provincial towns in the three kingdoms. The
                    magnetical and meteorological department was founded in 1838; it contains a
                    complete set of instruments giving continuous photographic records of magnetic
                    declination, horizontal and vertical force, barometric pressure, dry and wet
                    bulb thermometers, &amp;c. The <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi> are published

                    published until Manuel J. Johnson was appointed Radcliffe observer in 1839, when
                    systematic observations λvere commenced with an 8-feet transit instrument by
                    Bird (1773) and a 6-feet mural circle by Jones (1836). Johnson was succeeded in
                    1860 by Rev. R. Main, who died in 1878, and was followed in 1879 by E. J. Stone.

                    the founders handed over the administration to the Government, and in 1846 the
                    ownership was similarly transferred. Since 1834 the observatory has been under

                    practical astronomy in the university; there are two assistants. Professor T.
                    Henderson (1833 to 1845) commenced extensive meridian observations of fixed
                    stars, since continued by his successor, C. Piazzi Smyth. The mural circle of
                    6-feet diameter and 8-feet transit are now out of date. A reflector of 2-feet
                    aperture by Grubb (silver on glass) was erected in 1872, but has never been
                    quite finished nor come into use. Observations with deep-soil thermometers have
                    been carried on since 1837, and delicate spectroscopic investigations made by
                    the present astronomer, partly abroad. Observations and results have been

                    reversible meridian circle by Ramsden and Berge of 8-feet diameter was put up,
                    with which Brinkley observed assiduously till 1827, though of his results those
                    relating to stellar parallax were affected by certain instrumental errors which
                    rendered them of no value. Sir W. R. Hamilton (1827-65) devoted himself
                    exclusively to mathematics. In 1868 was erected an equatorial refractor,
                    object-glass of ll∣-inches aperture by Cauchoix (formerly belonging to and given
                    by Sir J. South), which has been used by Briinnow and his successor R. S. Ball

                    stars have been observed since 1864, and these are now (1884) ready for press.
                    There is also a 15-inch reflector. Armagh was (1868-83) one of the seven

                    consists now of the director, four astronomers, four assistants, two computers,
                    and a secretary. The principal instruments are :—a transit instrument by Ertel
                    of 6-inches aperture and 8⅜-feet focal length; a vertical circle by Ertel of
                    6-inches aperture and 6⅜-feet focal length (the circle of 3⅛-feet diameter has
                    been redivided by Repsold),—these two instruments have been used for determining
                    standard places of stars for the epochs 1845 and 1865; a meridian circle by
                    Repsold (6-inches aperture, 4-feet circles), used since 1841 to observe all
                    stars north of-15° decl. down to the 6th mag., and all others observed by
                    Bradley; a prime vertical transit by Repsold with 6∣- inches aperture, used for
                    determining the constant of aberration; a 7⅜-inch heliometer by Merz, which has
                    been very little used; an equatorial refractor by Merz of 22-feet focal length
                    and 14'9-inches aperture (remounted by Repsold in 1880), which has been used
                    incessantly by O. Struve since 1841 to observe double stars. A 30-inch refractor

                    about 3⅜ miles from Cape Town. Observations were commenced by Fallows in 1829
                    with a transit instrument by Dollond of 5-inches aperture and a mural circle by
                    Jones. After the death of Fallows (1831), T. Henderson observed from 1832-33,
                    chiefly the moon and Mars for determining their parallaxes, and α Centauri for
                    annual parallax. He was succeeded as “His Majesty’s astronomer” by Thomas
                    Maclear, who undertook to verify and extend the arc of meridian measured by
                    Lacaille in 1751-53, which work occupied the observatory staff for a number of
                    years. The results of the meridian observations were therefore first published
                    by Maclear’s successors in the form of three star catalogues for 1840, 1850, and
                    1860. In 1849 a 7-inch equatorial refractor by Merz was mounted, and in 1855 a
                    new meridian circle, a facsimile of the one at Greenwich, superseded the older
                    instruments. With the equatorial comets, occultations of stars, &amp;c., were
                    observed. Maclear was succeeded by E. J. Stone (1870 to 1879), who, in addition
                    to bringing out much of his predecessor’s work, devoted himself and the staff to
                    observations of stars, embodied in a catalogue of 12,441 stars for the epoch
                    1880. Under the present astronomer, D. Gill, standard stars between the equator
                    and -23° deck, as also stars suitable for investigations on refraction, are
                    observed, while a 4-inch heliometer by Repsold is privately employed by the
                    astronomer for researches on annual parallax.</p>
