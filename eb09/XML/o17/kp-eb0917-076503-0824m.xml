                    of the <hi rend="italic">Ausgrabungen</hi> published at Berlin. While the sketch
                    is necessarily confined to salient features and essential points, two aims have
                    been kept in view :—first, to omit nothing that is important to the general
                    study of antiquity; secondly, to make the outlines, however slight, sufficiently
                    precise and consecutive to serve as an introduction to a more special
                    archaeological study. Having enjoyed the advantage of seeing the excavations,
                    under the courteous guidance of Dr. Treu (then at the head of the German
                    archaeological mission), at the close of the third campaign in June 1878, the
                    writer is able to speak of the ground not from a book-knowledge alone. A few
                    words must be premised on the geography and history of Olympia, so far as an
                    acquaintance with the broader aspects of these must be presupposed in an
                    intelligent survey of the topography.</p>
                <p>On the western side of the Peloponnesus, the Alpheus, the chief river of the
                    peninsula, issues from the central highlands of Arcadia. Increased by the
                    tributary streams of the Ladon and the Erymanthus, it then flows, in a broad
                    bed, between hills which gradually subside, until it enters on the sandy levels
                    of the coast, and reaches the sea between two long lagoons. The district
                    traversed by its lower course is that which was anciently called <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisatis,</hi> extending from the mouth of the Alpheus to the
                    Erymanthus, between Elis on the north and Triphylia on the south. The alpine
                    character of Arcadia has here entirely disappeared. There are few steep cliffs
                    or rocks; the banks of the river are generally covered with alluvial earth; and
                    rich vegetation prevails, with abundance of evergreen trees and bushes.
                    Cornfields, vines, and currants are plentiful; even the sandy tracts, coated
                    with a rich mud, prove fertile. Cattle-breeding prospers on the higher ground of
                    Mount Pholoe; and the lagoons yield fish. The stay-at-home character of the
                    inhabitants which the historian Polybius notices was a natural result of their
                    environment. While the region was ill-suited to the secure development of a
                    strong state, it was eminently favourable to a life of quiet industry, and was
                    open on every side to peaceful intercourse with the neighbouring country. The
                    ancient landing-place was at the mouth of the Alpheus,— about 3000 metres above
                    the present mouth. The site of the modern town of Pyrgos—then much nearer the
                    sea— may be that of the ancient Dyspontium. The only modern landing-place is at
                    Catâcolo, where a mole has been constructed by French engineers. It is visited
                    by coasting steamers, being one of the export-stations of the currant-trade. In
                    the valley of the Alpheus, a few miles east of the point at which it enters on
                    the flat seaboard, there existed a primitive shrine of the Pelasgian Zeus. As in
                    other places associated with his worship, the low range bounding the Alpheus on
                    the north was called <hi rend="italic">Olympus,</hi> while the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ossa</hi> was given to the hill-boundary of the valley on the
                    south. When the worship of the Hellenic Zeus had been established on this spot,
                    the place acquired the name of <hi rend="italic">Olympia.</hi></p>
                <p>Olympia is on the right or north bank of the Alpheus (now the Ruphia), about 16
                    kilometres east in a straight line from the modem Pyrgos. The course of the
                    river is here from east to west, and the average breadth of the valley is about
                    1000 metres. At this point a small stream, the ancient Cladeus, flows from the
                    north into the Alpheus. The area known as Olympia is bounded on the west by the
                    Cladeus, on the south by the Alpheus, on the north by the low heights which shut
                    in the Alpheus valley, and on the east by the ancient race-courses. One group of
                    these heights terminates in a conical hill, about 122 metres high, which is cut
                    off from the rest by a deep cleft, and descends abruptly on Olympia. This hill
                    is the famous <hi rend="italic">Cronion</hi><hi rend="italic">(lApôvtov),</hi>
                    sacred to Cronus, the father of Zeus.</p>
                <p>The natural situation of Olympia is, in one sense, of great beauty. When Lysias,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Olympiacus</hi> (spoken here), calls it “the fairest
                    spot of Greece,” he was doubtless thinking also—or perhaps chiefly—of the
                    masterpieces which art, in all its forms, had contributed to the embellishment
                    of this national sanctuary. But even now the praise seems hardly excessive to a
                    visitor who, looking eastward up the valley of Olympia, sees the snow-crowned
                    chains of Erymanthus and Cyllene rising in the distance. The valley, at once
                    spacious and definite, is a natural <hi rend="italic">temenos.</hi> Nowhere
                    could the Greek Zeus be more fitly honoured by the display of human gifts,
                    physical or mental; nowhere could the divided communities of Hellas find a more
                    convenient or attractive place of peaceful re-union.</p>
                <p>The importance of Olympia in the history of Greece has, in fact, this twofold
                    character: it is at once religious and political. The religious associations of
                    the place date from the prehistoric age, when, before the states of Elis and
                    Pisa had been founded, predecessors—perhaps ancestors— of the Hellenes
                    worshipped the “heaven-father” in this valley. The political associations may be
                    said to date from the time when the Achaeans founded Pisa, and combined the
                    Pelasgian worship of the god Zeus with a local cult of their own ancestor, the
                    hero Pelops. It was then, and in honour of Pelops, that games were probably
                    instituted for the first time at Olympia. The addition of Hera and of the mother
                    of the gods to the specially honoured deities must have come early in the
                    Hellenic period. Elis and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0825-0766"/> Pisa were at first associated, as equal states,
                    in the control of the Olympian festival. Sixteen women, representing eight towns
                    of Elis and eight of Pisatis, wove the festal peplus for the Olympian Hera.
                    Olympia thus became the centre of an <hi rend="italic">aμφucτυovia,,</hi> or
                    federal league under religious sanction, for the west coast of the Peloponnesus,
                    as Delphi was for its neighbours in northern Greece. It suited the interests of
                    Sparta to join this amphictyony; and, before the regular catalogue of Olympic
                    victors begins in 776 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Sparta had formed an
                    alliance with Elis. Aristotle saw in the temple of Hera at Olympia a bronze
                    disk, recording the traditional laws of the festival, on which the name of
                    Lycurgus stood next to that of Iphitus, king of Elis. Whatever may have been the
                    age of the disk itself, the relation which it indicates is well attested. Elis
                    had from the first been stronger than Pisa. Elis and Sparta, making common
                    cause, had no difficulty in excluding the Pisatans from their proper share in
                    the management of the Olympian sanctuary. Pisa had, indeed, a brief moment of
                    better fortune. The ascendency of Pheidon of Argos enabled him to reassert the
                    old Achaean claim by celebrating the 28th Olympiad under the presidency of the
                    Pisatans. This festival, from which the Eleans and Spartans were excluded, was
                    afterwards struck out of the official register, as having no proper existence.
                    At last, about 570 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the destruction of Pisa by
                    the combined forces of Sparta and Elis put an end to the long rivalry. Not only
                    Pisatis, but also the district of Triphylia to the south of it, now became
                    dependent on Elis. So far as the religious side of the festival was concerned,
                    the Eleans had now an unquestioned supremacy. It was at Elis, in the gymnasium
                    of the city, that candidates from all parts of Greece were tested, before they
                    were admitted to the athletic competitions at Olympia. To have passed through
                    the training (usually of ten months) at Elis was regarded as the most valuable
                    preparation. Elean officials, who not only adjudged the prizes at Olympia, but
                    decided who should be admitted to compete, marked the national aspect of their
                    functions by assuming the title of <hi rend="italic">Hellanodicae,.</hi></p>
                <p>Long before the overthrow of Pisa the list of contests at Olympia had been so
                    enlarged and diversified as to invest the celebration with a Panhellenic
                    character. Exercises of a Spartan type—testing endurance and strength with an
                    especial view to war—had almost exclusively formed the earlier programme. But as
                    early as the 25th Olympiad —i.e., several years before the interference of
                    Pheidon on behalf of Pisa—the four-horse chariot-race was added. This was an
                    invitation to wealthy competitors from every part of the Hellenic world, and was
                    also the recognition of a popular or spectacular element, as distinct from the
                    skill which had a merely athletic or military interest. Horse-races were added
                    later. For such contests the <hi rend="italic">hippodrome,</hi> was set apart.
                    Meanwhile the list of contests on the old racecourse, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stadwn,</hi> had been enlarged. Besides the foot-race in which the course was
                    traversed once only, there were now the <hi rend="italic">diaulos</hi> or double
                    course, and the “long” foot-race <hi rend="italic">{dolichos).</hi> Wrestling
                    and boxing were combined in the <hi rend="italic">pancration.</hi> Leaping,
                    quoitthrowing, javelin-throwing, running, and wrestling were combined in the <hi
                    rend="italic">pentathlon.</hi></p>
                <p>After the conquest of Messenia Spartan ambition had turned towards Arcadia. The
                    aim of the Spartans was nothing less than the subjugation of the entire
                    Peloponnesus. But the decided check which the aggressors experienced in their
                    new attempt produced a change of design. It became evident that a policy of
                    forcible annexation could be pushed no further. Yet Sparta might at least aspire
                    to the hegemony of the peninsula. The other states of the Peloponnesus, while
                    remaining independent, might be virtually under Spartan control. And for the
                    establishment of such a hegemony what agency could be more suitable than that of
                    Olympia? In the Olympian amphictyony, Sparta, closely allied with Elis, already
                    held a commanding position. The rising popularity of the festival was constantly
                    tending to make Olympia the religious and social centre of Peloponnesian
                    life—indeed, in some sense, of the Hellenic world. As the Eleans, therefore,
                    were now the religious supervisors of Olympia, so the Spartans aimed at
                    constituting themselves its political protectors. Their military
                    strength—greatly superior at the time to that of any single Hellenic
                    state—readily enabled them to do this in the most effectual manner. Spartan arms
                    could enforce the sanction which the Olympian Zeus gave to the oaths of the
                    amphictyones, whose federal bond was symbolized by common worship at his shrine.
                    Spartan arms could punish any violation of that “sacred truce” which was
                    indispensable if Hellenes from all cities were to have peaceable access to the
                    Olympian festival. And in the eyes of all Dorians the assured dignity thus added
                    to Olympia would be enhanced by the fact that the protectors were the Spartan
                    Heraclidae.</p>
                <p>Thus, under the permanent guarantee of the strongest military power, and at the
                    same time under auspices which, for a large part of the Greek world, were the
                    most illustrious possible, Olympia entered on a new phase of brilliant and
                    secure existence as a recognized Panhellenic institution. This phase may be
                    considered as beginning after the destruction of Pisa, about 570 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> And so it continued to be to the last. While the
                    details of the scene and of the festival were the subjects of endless
                    modification or change, Olympia always remained a central expression of the
                    Greek ideas that the body of man has a glory as well as his intellect and
                    spirit, that body and mind should alike be disciplined, and that it is by the
                    harmonious discipline of both that men best honour Zeus. The significance of
                    Olympia was larger and higher than the political fortunes of the Greeks who met
                    there, and it survived the overthrow of Greek independence. In the Macedonian
                    and Roman ages the temples and contests of Olympia still interpreted the ideal
                    at which free Greece had aimed. Philip of Macedon and Nero are, as we shall see,
                    among those whose names have a record in the Altis. Such names are typical of
                    long series of visitors who paid homage to Olympia. Even those who were least in
                    sympathy with the old spirit of the festival could still feel that the place was
                    representative and unique. According to Cedrenus, a Greek writer of the 11th
                    century <hi rend="italic">(∑υvoφιs'</hi> Ιστοριών,i. 326), the Olympian festival
                    ceased to be held after 393 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the first year of
                    the 293d Olympiad. The list of Olympian victors, which begins in 776 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> with Coroebus of Elis, closes with the name of an
                    Armenian, Varastad, who is said to have belonged to the race of the Arsacidae.
                    In the 5th century the desolation of Olympia had set in. The chryselephantine
                    statue of the Olympian Zeus, by Phidias, was carried to Constantinople, and
                    perished in a great fire, 476 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The Olympian temple
                    of Zeus is said to have been destroyed, either by the Goths or by Christian
                    zeal, in the reign of Theodosius II. (402-450 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi></p>
                <p>The German excavations at Olympia were begun in 1875. After six campaigns, of
                    which the first five lasted from September to June, they were completed on the
                    20th of March 1881. The result of these six years’ labours was, first, to strip
                    off a thick covering of earth from the <hi rend="italic">Altis,</hi> the
                    consecrated precinct of the Olympian Zeus. This covering had been formed, during
                    some twelve centuries, partly by clay swept down from the Cronion, partly by
                    deposit from the overflowings of the Cladeus. The task presented to the German
                    explorers may be judged by the fact that the coating of earth over the Altis had
                    an average depth of no less than five metres.</p>

                <p>Their work could not, however, be restricted to the Altis. It was necessary to
                    dig beyond it, especially on the west, the south, and the east, where several
                    ancient buildings existed, not included within the sacred precinct itself. The
                    complexity of the task was further increased by the fact that in many places
                    early Greek work had later Greek on top of it, or late Greek work had been
                    overlaid with Roman. In a concise survey of the results obtained, it will be
                    best to begin with the remains external to the precinct of Zeus.<note

                <p>1. Just outside the Altis at its north-west corner was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnasium.</hi> A large open space, not regularly rectangular, was enclosed on
                    two sides—possibly on three—by Doric colonnades. On the south it was bordered by
                    a portico with a single row of columns in front; on the east by a longer
                    portico, with a similar colonnade in front, and a second row, parallel to the
                    first, traversing the interior of the portico itself. At the south-east corner
                    of the gymnasium, in the angle between the south and the east portico, was a
                    Corinthian doorway, which a double row of columns divided into three passages.
                    Immediately to the east of this doorway was the gate giving access to the Altis
                    at its north-west corner. The gymnasium was used for practice in the first four
                    exercises of the pentathlon—leaping, quoit-throwing, javelin-throwing, running.
                    The great length of the east portico is thus explained.</p>
                <p>2. Immediately adjoining the gymnasium on the south was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaestra,</hi> the place of exercise for wrestlers and boxers. It was ants of
                    Phidias” (Paus. v. 14) whose hereditary privilege it was to keep the statue of
                    Zeus clean. The so-called “workshop of Phidias” (see α) evidently owed its
                    preservation to the fact that it continued to be used for actual work, and the
                    adjacent building would have been a convenient lodging for the artists.</p>
                <p>4. South of the group described above occur the remains of a large building,
                    dating from the late Hellenic or early Macedonian age. It is an oblong, of which
                    the north and south sides measure about 80 metres, the east and west about 73.
                    Its orientation differs from that of all the other buildings above mentioned,
                    being not from north to south, but from west-south-west to east-north-east; and
                    there are signs that it was built before the west Altis wall. Externally it is
                    an Ionic peripteros, enclosing suites of rooms, large and small, grouped round a
                    small interior Doric peristyle. In Roman times it was altered in such a way as
                    to distribute the rooms into (apparently) four quarters, each having an atrium
                    with six or four columns. The most probable conjecture is that it was used as a
                    lodging for distinguished visitors during the games, such as the heads of the
                    special missions from the various Greek cities <hi rend="italic"
                    >(άρχιθέωροι),</hi> or Roman officials. Traces existing within the exterior
                    porticos on north, west, and east indicate much carriage traffic.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">South Side.—</hi> Although the limits of the Altis on the
                    south <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> on the side towards the Alpheus) can be
                    traced with approximate accuracy, the precise line of the south wall becomes
                    doubtful after we have advanced a little more than one-third of the distance
                    from the west to the east end of the south side. The middle and eastern portions
                    of the south side were places at which architectural changes, large or small,
                    were numerous down to the latest times, and where the older buildings met with
                    scant mercy. The westernmost and best-defined part of the south-wall line is, as
                    already stated, coeval with the west wall, belonging to the early Macedonian
                    age.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Council Hall (βoυλeυτf</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pιov,</hi> Paus. v. 23) was just outside the Altis, nearly at the
                    middle of its south wall. It comprised <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0827-0768"/> two separate Doric buildings of identical form,
                    viz., oblong, having a single row of columns dividing the length into two naves,
                    and terminating to the east in a semicircular apse. The orientation of each was
                    from west-south-west to east-north-east, one being south-south-east of the
                    other. In the space between stood a small square building. In front, on the
                    east, was a portico extending along the front of all three buildings; and east
                    of this again a large trapeze-shaped vestibule or fore-hall, enclosed by a
                    colonnade. This bouleuterion would have been available on all occasions when
                    Olympia became the scene of conference or debate between the representatives of
                    different states,—whether the subject was properly political, as concerning the
                    amphictyonie treaties, or related more directly to the administration of the
                    sanctuary and festival. Two smaller Hellenic buildings stood immediately west of
                    the bouleuterion. The more northerly of the two opened on the Altis. Their
                    purpose is uncertain.</p>
                <p>2. Close to the bouleuterion on the south, and running parallel with it from
                    south-west by west to north-east by east, was the <hi rend="italic">South
                    Portico,</hi> a late but handsome structure, closed on the north side, open on
                    the south and at the east and west ends The external colonnade (on south, east,
                    and west) was Doric; the interior row of columns Corinthian. It was used as a
                    promenade, and as a place from which to view the festal processions as they
                    passed towards the Altis.</p>
                <p>3. East of the bouleuterion was a gateway of Boman age, with triple entrance, the
                    central being the widest, opening on the Altis from the south. North of this
                    gateway, but at a somewhat greater depth, traces of a pavement were found in the
                    Altis. This was manifestly the gateway by which the sacred processions entered
                    the Altis in Roman times. The older processional route, however, probably struck
                    the south boundary of the Altis at a point somewhat to the west of the Roman
                    gate, proceeding past the front of the bouleuterion and the eastern end of the
                    south portico.</p>
                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">East Side.—</hi> The line of the east wall, running due
                    north and south, can be traced from the north-east corner of the Altis down
                    about three-fifths of the east side, when it breaks off at the remains known as
                    “Nero’s house.” These are the first which claim attention on the east side.</p>
                <p>1. Pausanias mentions a building called the <hi rend="italic">Leonidaion,</hi>
                    erected by the Elean Leonidas <hi rend="italic">‘ outside</hi> the Altis, and
                    near the Processional Gate.” This Leonidaion was the point from which he set out
                    on many of his walks in the Altis. Its original form is traceable in Hellenic
                    remains at the south-east angle of the Altis, which show that the Leonidaion—an
                    oblong structure with colonnade on north, west, and south—stood <hi
                    rend="italic">within</hi> the Altis. But the Greek Leonidaion was afterwards
                    absorbed into a Roman house which projected beyond the Altis on the east, the
                    south part of the east Altis wall being destroyed to admit of this. A piece of
                    leaden water-pipe found in the house bears NER. AVG. Only a Roman master could
                    have dealt thus with the Altis, and with a building which, like the Leonidaion,
                    stood within its sacred precinct. It cannot be doubted that the Roman house—from
                    which three doors gave access to the Altis—was that occupied by Nero when he
                    visited Olympia. Later Roman hands again enlarged and altered the building,
                    which may perhaps have been used for the reception of Roman governors. But
                    Pausanias, who speaks only of a Leonidaion, shows that the old Greek name was
                    retained, even when the building of Nero’s time had placed the new Leonidaion
                    beyond the limits of the Altis.</p>
                <p>2. Following northwards the line of the east wall, we reach at the north-east
                    corner of the Altis the entrance to the <hi rend="italic">Stadion,</hi> which
                    extends east of the Altis in a direction from west-south-west to
                    east-north-east. The apparently strange and inconvenient position of the Stadion
                    relatively to the Altis was due simply to the necessity of obeying the
                    conditions of the ground, here determined by the curve of the lower slopes which
                    bound the valley on the north. The German explorers excavated the Stadion so far
                    as was necessary for the ascertainment of all essential points. Weak walls had
                    originally been built on west, east, and south, the north boundary being formed
                    by the natural slope of the hill. The walls were afterwards thickened and
                    raised. The space thus defined was a large oblong, about 214 metres in length by
                    32 in breadth. There were no artificial seats. It is computed that from 40,000
                    to 45,000 spectators could have found sitting-room, though it is hardly probable
                    that such a number was ever reached. The exact length of the Stadion
                    itself—which was primarily the course for the foot-race—was 192 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 27 metres,—an important result, as it determines the
                    Olympian foot to be 0 ’ 3204 metre. In the Heraion at Olympia, it may be
                    remarked, the unit adopted was not this Olympian foot, but an older one of 0 ’
                    297 metre. The starting-point and the goal in the Stadion were marked by
                    limestone thresholds. Provision for drainage was made by a channel running round
                    the enclosure. The Stadion was used not only for foot-races but for boxing,
                    wrestling, leaping, quoit-throwing, and javelin-throwing.</p>
                <p>The entrance to the Stadion from the north-east corner of the Altis was a
                    privileged one, reserved for the judges of the games, the competitors, and the
                    heralds. Its form wäs that of a vaulted tunnel, 100 Olympian feet in length.
                    Dating from about 350-300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> it is one of the
                    oldest examples of vaulted work in cut stone. To the west was a vestibule, from
                    which the Altis was entered by a handsome gateway.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Hippodrome,</hi> in which the chariot-races and
                    horse-races were held, can no longer be accurately traced. The overflowings of
                    the Alpheus have washed away all certain indications of its limits. But it is
                    clear that it extended south and south-east of the Stadion, and roughly parallel
                    with it, though stretching far beyond it to the east. From the state of the
                    ground the German explorers inferred that the length of the hippodrome was 770
                    metres or 4 Olympic stadia.</p>
                <p>D. <hi rend="italic">North Side.—</hi> If the northern limit of the Altis, like
                    the λvest, south, and east, had been traced by a boundary wall, this would have
                    had the effect of excluding from the precinct a spot so sacred as the Cronion,
                    the hill inseparably associated with the oldest worship of Zeus at Olympia. It
                    seems therefore unlikely that any such northern boundary wall ever existed. But
                    the line which such a boundary would have followed is partly represented by the
                    remains of a wall running from east to west immediately north of the
                    treasure-houses (see below), which it was designed to protect against the
                    descent of earth from the Cronion just above. This was the wall along which,
                    about 157 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the main water-channel constructed by
                    Herodes Atticus was carried.</p>
                <p>Having now surveyed the chief remains external to the sacred precinct on west,
                    south, east, and north, we proceed to notice those which have been traced within
                    it.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Remains within the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Altis.</hi></p>
                <p>The form of the Altis, as indicated by the existing traces, is not regularly
                    rectangular. The length of the west side, where the line of direction is from
                    south-south-east to north-north-west, is about 195 metres. The south side,
                    running nearly due east and west, is about equally long, if measured from the
                    end of the west wall to the point which the east wall would touch when produced
                    due south in a straight line from the place at which it was demolished to make
                    way for “Nero’s house.” The east side, measured to a point just behind the
                    treasure-houses, is the shortest, about 180 metres. The north side is the
                    longest. A line drawn eastward behind the treasure-houses, from the Prytaneion
                    at the north-west angle, would give about 250 metres.</p>
                <p>The remains or sites within the Altis may conveniently be classed in three main
                    groups, viz.—(A) the chief centres of religious worship; (B) votive buildings;
                    (C) buildings, &amp;c., connected with the administration of Olympia or the
                    reception of visitors.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Chief Centres of Religious Worship.—</hi> 1. The earliest
                    Hellenic phase of the sanctuary, when a pre-Hellenic worship of Zeus was
                    combined with a cult of the hero Pelops, is recalled by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Altar of Zeus.</hi> This, the central object of the older temenos, stood a
                    little east of the Pelopion, and after the Altis had been enlarged was still
                    nearly at its centre. The basis was of elliptic form, the length of the lozenge
                    being directed from south-south-west to northnorth-east, in such a manner that
                    the axis would pass through the Cronion. The upper structure imposed on this
                    basis was in two tiers, and also, probably, lozenge - shaped. This was the
                    famous “ash-altar” at which the lamidae. the hereditary gens of <hi
                    rend="italic">μdvτeιs,</hi> practised those rites of divination by fire (μαντική
                    δι’ <hi rend="italic">έμπυρων)</hi> in virtue of which more especially Olympia
                    is saluted by Pindar as “mistress of truth” <hi rend="italic">(δlσπoιv</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Λλaθeias).</hi> The steps by
                    which the priests mounted the altar seem to have been at north and south.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Pelopion,</hi> to the west of the Altar of Zeus, was a
                    small precinct in which, from the time when Pisa was founded by the Achaeans,
                    sacrifices were offered to the Achaean <hi rend="italic">ηpωs</hi> Pelops. The
                    traces agree with the account of Pausanias. Walls, inclined to each other at
                    obtuse angles, enclosed a plot of ground having in the middle a low tumulus of
                    elliptic form, about 35 metres from east to west by 20 from north to south. A
                    Doric propylaion with three doors gave access on the south-west side.</p>
                <p>The three temples of the Altis were those of Zeus, Hera, and the Mother of the
                    gods. All were Doric. All, too, were completely surrounded by a colonnade <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> were “peripteral.”</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Temple of Zeus,</hi> south of the Pelopion, stood on a
                    high substructure with three steps. The colonnades at the east and west side
                    were of six columns each; those at the north and south sides (counting the
                    corner columns again) of thirteen each. The cella had a prodomos on the east and
                    an opisthodomos on the west. The cella itself was divided longitudinally <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> from east to west) into three partitions by a double
                    row of columns. The central partition, which was the widest, consisted of three
                    sections. The west section was shut off; it contained the throne and image of
                    the Olympian Zeus. The middle section, next to the east, contained a table and
                    stelae. Here, probably, the wreaths were presented to the victors. The third or
                    easternmost section, which had side porticos, was open to the public. This
                    temple was most richly adorned with statues and reliefs. On the east front
                    Paeonius had represented in twenty-one colossal figures the moment before the
                    contest between (Enomaus and Pelops. The west front exhibited the fight of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0828-0769"/> Lapithae and Centaurs, and was connected with the
                    name of Alcamenes. The Twelve Labours of Heracles were depicted on the metopes
                    of the prodomos and opisthodomos; and of these reliefs much the greater part was
                    found,—enough to determine with certainty all the essential features of the
                    composition. It was near this temple, at a point about 35 metres east-south-east
                    from the south-east angle, that the explorers found the fragment of a flying
                    goddess of victory—the Nice of Paeonius.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Temple of Hera</hi> (Heraion), north of the Pelopion,
                    was raised on two steps. It was originally built as a temple <hi rend="italic"
                    >in antis,</hi> and afterwards converted into a peripteros, having colonnades of
                    six columns each at east and west, and of sixteen each (counting the corner
                    columns again) at north and south. It was smaller than the temple of Zeus, and,
                    while resembling it in general plan, differed from it by its singular length
                    relatively to its breadth. When Pausanias saw it, one of the two columns of the
                    opisthodomos (at the west end of the cella) was of wood; and for a long period
                    all the columns of this temple had probably been of the same material. A good
                    deal of patch - work in the restoration of particular parts seems to have been
                    done at various periods. The cella—divided, like that of Zeus, into three
                    partitions by a double row of columns —had four “tongue-walls,” or small
                    screens, projecting at right angles from its north wall, and as many from the
                    south wall. Five niches were thus formed on the north side and five on the
                    south. In the third niche from the east, on the north side of the cella, was
                    found one of the greatest of all the treasures which rewarded the German
                    explorers,—the Hermes of Praxiteles (1878).</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Temple of the Mother of the Gods</hi> (Metroon) was
                    again considerably smaller than the Heraion. It stood to the east of the latter,
                    and had a different orientation, viz., not west to east, but west-north-west to
                    east-south-east. It was raised on three steps, and had a peripteros of six
                    columns (east and west) by eleven (north and south), having thus a slightly
                    smaller length relatively to its breadth than either of the other two temples.
                    Here also the cella had prodomos and opisthodomos. The adornment and painting of
                    this temple had once been very rich and varied. There are indications that in
                    Roman times it underwent a restoration, conducted, apparently, with little taste
                    or skill.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Votive Edifices.—</hi> Under this head are placed buildings
                    erected, either by states or by individuals, as offerings to the Olympian
                    god.</p>
                <p>1. The twelve <hi rend="italic">Treasure-houses</hi> on the north side of the
                    Altis, immediately under the Cronion, belong to this class. We have seen that on
                    the north side the limit of the Altis does not seem to have been defined by a
                    wall, as on the other three sides. Here, then, we cannot distinguish with the
                    same precision between objects within or without the precinct. The row of
                    treasure-houses is, however, so situated that they are most naturally regarded
                    as standing <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the Altis, with a single exception.
                    This is the easternmost of the twelve, the treasure-house dedicated by the state
                    of Gela, which projected on the east beyond the line of the east Altis wall. It
                    was evidently the oldest of the series. Originally planned as a small Doric
                    temple <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> of which the longer sides were the north
                    and south, it was afterwards adorned on the south side with a colonnade, having
                    six columns in front Doric cut stonework, overlaid with coloured terra-cotta
                    plates, occurred here, as in monuments found at Gela itself, at Selinus, and
                    elsewhere in Sicily.</p>
                <p>The same general character—that of a Doric temple <hi rend="italic">in
                    antis,</hi> facing south—is traceable in all its younger neighbours on the west.
                    In the cases of six of these the fragments are sufficient to aid a
                    reconstruction. Two—viz., the 2d and 3d counting from the west—had been
                    dismantled at an early date, and their site was traversed Εy a roadway winding
                    upward towards the Cronion. This roadway seems to have been older at least than
                    157 A.D., since it caused a deflexion in the watercourse along the base of the
                    Cronion constructed by Herodes Atticus. Pausanias, therefore, would not have
                    seen treasure-houses Nos. 2 and 3. This explains the fact that, though we can
                    trace twelve, he names only ten.</p>
                <p>As the temples of ancient Greece partly served the purposes of banks, in which
                    precious objects could be securely deposited, so the form of a small Doric
                    chapel was a natural one for the “treasure-house” to assume. Each of these
                    treasure-houses was erected by a Greek state, either as a thank-offering for
                    Olympian victories gained by its citizens, or as a general mark of homage to the
                    Olympian Zeus. The treasure-houses were designed to contain the various <hi
                    rend="italic">άναθήματα</hi> or dedicated gifts (such as gold and silver plate,
                    &amp;c. ), in which the wealth of the sanctuary partly consisted. The temple
                    inventories recently discovered at Delos illustrate the great quantity of such
                    possessions which were apt to accumulate at a shrine of Panhellenic celebrity.
                    Taken in order from the west, the treasure-houses were founded by the following
                    states :—1, Sicyon; 2, 3, unknown; 4, Syracuse (referred by Pausanias to
                    Carthage); 5, Epidamnus; 6, Byzantium; 7, Sybaris; 8, Cyrene; 9, Selinus; 10,
                    Metapontum; 11, Megara; 12, Gela. It is interesting to remark how this list
                    represents the Greek colonies, from Libya to Sicily, from the Euxine to the
                    Adriatic. Greece proper, on the other hand, is represented only by Megara and
                    Sicyon. The dates of the foundations cannot be fixed.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Philippeion</hi> stood near the north-west corner of the
                    Altis, a short space west-south-west of the Heraion. It was dedicated by Philip
                    of Macedon, after his victory at Chaeronea (338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.).</hi>
                    As a thank-offering for the overthrow of Greek freedom, it might seem strangely
                    placed in the Olympian Altis. But it is, in fact, only another illustration of
                    the manner in which Philip’s position and power enabled him to place a decent
                    disguise on the real nature of the change. Without risking any revolt of
                    Hellenic feeling, the new “captain-general” of Greece could erect a monument of
                    his triumph in the very heart of the Panhellenic sanctuary. The building
                    consisted of a circular Ionic colonnade (of eighteen columns), about 15 metres
                    in diameter, raised on three steps, and enclosing a small circular cella,
                    probably adorned with fourteen Corinthian half-columns.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Exedra</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Herodes</hi><hi rend="italic">Atticus</hi> stood at the north limit of the
                    Altis, close to the north-east angle of the Heraion, and immediately west of the
                    westernmost treasure-house (that of Sicyon). It consisted of a half-dome of
                    brick, 16'6 metres in diameter, with southsouth-west aspect. Under the half-dome
                    were placed twenty-one marble statues, representing the family of Antoninus
                    Pius, of Marcus Aurelius, and of the founder, Herodes Atticus. In front of the
                    half-dome on the south, and extending slightly beyond it, was a basin of water
                    for drinking, 22 metres long. The ends of the basin at north-north-west and
                    south-south-east were adorned by very small open temples, each with a circular
                    colonnade of eight pillars. A marble bull, in front of the basin, bore an
                    inscription saying that Herodes dedicates the whole to Zeus, in the name of his
                    wife, Annia Regilla. The exedra must have been seen by Pausanias, but he does
                    not mention it.</p>
                <p>C. It remains to notice those features of the Altis which were connected with the
                    management of the sanctuary or with the accommodation of its guests.</p>
                <p>1. Olympia, besides its religious character, originally possessed also a
                    political character, as the centre of an amphictyony. It was, in fact, a sacred
                    <hi rend="italic">ιrb</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">ts.</hi> We
                    have seen that it had a bouleuterion for purposes of public debate or
                    conference. So also it was needful that, like a Greek city, it should have a
                    public hearth or prytaneion, where fire should always burn on the altar of the
                    Olympian Hestia, and where the controllers of Olympia should exercise public
                    hospitality. The <hi rend="italic">Prytaneion</hi> was at the north-west corner
                    of the Altis, in such a position that its south-east angle was close to the
                    north-west angle of the Heraion. It was apparently a square building, of which
                    each side measured 100 Olympian feet, with a south-west aspect. It contained a
                    chapel of Hestia at the front or south-west side, before which a portico was
                    afterwards built. The dining-hall was at the back (north-east), the kitchen on
                    the north-west side. On the same side with the kitchen, and also on the opposite
                    side (south-east), there were some smaller rooms.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Porch of Echo,</hi> also called the “Painted Porch”
                    (στοά ποικίλη), extended to a length of 96 metres along the east Altis wall.
                    Raised on three steps, and formed by a single Doric colonnade, open towards the
                    Altis, it afforded a place from which spectators could conveniently view the
                    passage of processions and the sacrifices at the great altar of Zeus.</p>
                <p>3. Before the Porch of Echo, and east of the Altar of Zeus, was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proedria,</hi> a structure 20 metres long, containing places of
                    honour for officials and visitors of distinction. A flight of steps, curved
                    inwards in a semicircle, gave access from the west. At either end of the
                    Proedria (north and south) stood a colossal Ionic column. These columns, as the
                    inscriptions show, once supported statues of Ptolemy and Berenice.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">Agora</hi> was the name given to that part of the Altis
                    which had the Porch of Echo and Proedria on the east, the Altar of Zeus on the
                    west, the Metroon on the north, and the precinct of the Temple of Zeus on the
                    south-west. In this part stood the altars of Zeus Agoraios and Artemis
                    Agoraia.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">Zanes</hi><hi rend="italic">(Zâves)</hi> were brazen
                    images of Zeus, the cost of making which was defrayed by the fines exacted from
                    competitors who had infringed the rules of the contests at Olympia. These images
                    stood at the northern side of the Agora, in a row, which extended from the
                    north-east angle of the Metroon to the gate of the private entrance from the
                    Altis into the stadion. Sixteen pedestals were here discovered <hi rend="italic"
                    >in situ.</hi> A lesson of loyalty was thus impressed on aspirants to renown by
                    the last objects which met their eyes as they passed from the sacred enclosure
                    to the scene of their trial.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Arrangements for Water-supply.—</hi> A copious supply of
                    water was required for the service of the altars and temples, for the private
                    dwellings of priests and officials, for the use of the gymnasium, palaestra,
                    &amp;c., and for the thermae which arose in Roman times. In the Hellenic age the
                    water was derived wholly from the Cladeus and from the small lateral tributaries
                    of its valley. A basin, to serve as a chief reservoir, was built at the
                    north-west corner of the Altis; and a supplementary reservoir was afterwards
                    constructed a little to the north-east of this, on the slope of the Cronion. A
                    new source of supply was for the first time made available bv Herodes Atticus,
                    <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 157 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> At a short distance
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0829-0770"/> east of Olympia, near the village of Miraka,
                    small streams flow from comparatively high ground through the side-valleys which
                    descend towards the right or northern bank of the Alpheus. From these
                    side-valleys water was now conducted to Olympia, entering the Altis at its
                    north-east corner by an arched canal which passed behind the treasure-houses to
                    the reservoir at the back of the exedra. The large basin of drinking-water in
                    front of the exedra was fed thence, and served to associate the name of Herodes
                    with a benefit of the highest practical value. Olympia further possessed several
                    fountains, enclosed by round or square walls, chiefly in connexion with the
                    buildings outside the Altis. The drainage of the Altis followed two main lines.
                    One, for the west part, passed from the south-west angle of the Heraion to the
                    south portico outside the south Altis wall. The other, which served for the
                    treasure-houses, passed in front of the Porch of Echo parallel with the line of
                    the east Altis wall. The whole subject of the water-works of Olympia was
                    exhaustively investigated by Herr Graber, and has been explained by him in vol.
                    v. of the <hi rend="italic">Excavations,</hi> pp. 26 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p>
                <p>Such, in brief outline, are the more important results of the German exploration
                    of Olympia, an enterprise alike honourable to the’ Government which undertook it
                    and to the eminent men by whom it was conducted. The work of excavation was from
                    the outset guided by scientific knowledge, and the results were at no point
                    confused or obscured by rash and unsound theories. The general outcome of the
                    undertaking is certainly greater than could have reasonably been anticipated at
                    its commencement. In the Olympia seen by Pausanias there was, of course, very
                    much of which not the slightest trace has been found,—such, for instance, as the
                    temples of Eileithyia, of Aphrodite Urania, and of Demeter Chameune. In regard
                    to particular works of art, many hopes of discovery have been disappointed, nor
                    can “the survival of the fittest” be always acknowledged in the salvage from so
                    many centuries of ruin. On the other hand, the German campaigns had their
                    welcome surprises and their strokes of good fortune, such as the finding of the
                    Hermes and the Nice. Above all, they have their reward in this, that the
                    topography of Olympia is now thoroughly ascertained. We now know with certainty
                    the exact position of the principal buildings, the plan of the Altis and its
                    relation to its whole environment, and all the main local conditions of the
                    festival. In reading an Olympian ode of Pindar, the modern student can now call
                    up the scene with adequate fulness of detail. Precious as are the particular
                    works of ancient art which have been discovered, and valuable as are the results
                    of the study of art and architecture, the largest gain of all consists in the
                    vivid and suggestive light thus shed on a great centre of Hellenic history and
                    life. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. c. j.)</hi></p>
