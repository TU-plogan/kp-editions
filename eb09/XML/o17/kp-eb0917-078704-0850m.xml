                <p><label type="entry">OPIUM</label> (6τrιov, dim. from οπός, juice), a narcotic
                    drug prepared from the juice oξ the opium poppy, <hi rend="italic">Papaver
                    somniferum,</hi> L., a plant probably indigenous in the south of Europe and
                    western Asia, but now so widely cultivated that its original habitat is
                    uncertain. The medicinal properties of the juice have been recognized from a
                    very early period. It was known to Theophrastus by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >μηκωvιov,</hi> and appears in his time to have consisted of an extract of the
                    whole plant, since Dioscorides about 77 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> draws a
                    distinction between <hi rend="italic">pηκωveιov,</hi> which he describes as an

                    and of Malwa.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Kaempfer describes the various kinds of opium prepared in Persia, and states
                    that the best sorts were flavoured with spices and called “theriaka.” These
                    preparations were held in great estimation during the Middle Ages, and probably
                    supplied to a large extent the place of the pure drug. Opium is said to have
                    been introduced into China, probably by the Arabs (1280-95), during the reign of
                    Taitsu, and its use seems to have temporarily ceased in 1368. It appears to have
                    been commonly used in that country as a medicine before the trade with India
                    commenced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr R.

                    purchased the drug for export long before the East India Company held
                    possessions in India.</p></note> In a Chinese herbal compiled more than two
                    centuries ago both the plant and its inspissated juice are described, together
                    with the mode of collecting it, and in the <hi rend="italic">General History of
                    the Southern Provinces of Yunnan,</hi> revised and republished in 1736, opium is
                    noticed as a common product. Up to this date, however, it was imported in
                    comparatively small quantity by the Chinese solely as a remedy for dysentery,
                    diarrhoea, and fevers, and was usually brought from India by junks as a return
                    cargo. In the year 1757 the monopoly of opium cultivation passed into the hands
                    of the East India Company through the victory of Clive at Plassey. Up to 1773
                    the trade with China had been in the hands of the Portuguese, but the quantity
                    annually exported to that country rarely exceeded 200 chests. In that year the
                    East India Company took the trade under their own charge, and in 1776 the annual
                    export reached 1000 chests, and 4054 chests in 1790. Although the importation
                    was forbidden by the Chinese emperor Keaking in 1796, and opium-smoking punished
                    with severe penalties, which were ultimately increased to transportation and
                    death, the trade continued and had increased during 1820-30 to 16,877 chests per
                    annum. In 1839 a proclamation was issued threatening hostile measures if the
                    English opium ships serving as dépôts were not sent away. The demand for removal
                    not being complied with, 20,291 chests of opium (of 149⅜ H&gt; each), valued at
                    £2,000,000, were destroyed by the Chinese commissioner Lin; but still the
                    British sought to smuggle cargoes on shore, and some outrages committed on both
                    sides led to an open war, which was ended by the treaty of Nanking in 1842 (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">China,</hi> vol. v. p. 651). From that time to the present,
                    in spite of the remonstrances of the Chinese Government, the exportation of
                    opium from India to China has continued, having increased from 52,925 piculs (of
                    133 J K&gt;) in 1850 to 96,839 piculs in 1880. It appears to be certain,
                    however, that, while the court of Peking was endeavouring to suppress the
                    foreign trade in opium from 1796 to 1840, it did not or could not put a stop to
                    the home cultivation of the drug, since a Chinese censor in 1830 represented to
                    the throne that the poppy was grown over one-half of the province of Chekeang,
                    and in 1836 another, Cho Tsun, stated that the annual produce of opium in Yunnan
                    could not be less than several thousand piculs. At present it is estimated that
                    south-western China, including Szechuen, produces not less than 224,000 piculs,
                    while the entire import from India does not exceed 100,000 piculs. Opium is now
                    produced in nine out of the eighteen provinces of China. The comparative
                    cheapness of the Chinese opium, the lighter duties levied upon it, and the
                    increasing care taken in its cultivation are enabling it to compete successfully
                    with the Indian drug even in eastern China, where, however, it has hitherto been
                    chiefly used to mix with and cheapen the foreign article. A time is confidently
                    anticipated by the Chinese when Indian opium will be entirely supplanted by the
                    native drug. See <hi rend="italic">Commercial Reports,</hi> China, No. 2 (1881),
                    p. 138.</p>
                <p>The amount of opium imported into Great Britain in 1861, 1871, and 1881 was
                    284,005, 591,466, and 793,146 lb respectively, and the exports for the same
                    years 290,120, 307,399, and 401,883 fi&gt;.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Production and Commerce.—</hi> Although the collection of opium
                    is possible in all places where there is not an excessive rainfall and the
                    climate is temperate or subtropical, the yield is smaller in temperate than in
                    tropical regions, and the industry can only be profitably carried on where
                    labour and land are sufficiently cheap and abundant; hence production on a large
                    scale is limited to comparatively few countries. The varieties of poppy grown,
                    the mode of cultivation adopted, and the character of the opium produced differ
                    so greatly that it will be convenient to consider the opiums of each country
                    separately.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turkey.—</hi> The poppy cultivated in Asia Minor is the variety
                    <hi rend="italic">glabrum,</hi> Boissier, distinguished by the sub-globular
                    shape of the capsule and by the stigmata or rays at the top of the fruit being
                    ten or twelve in number. The flowers are usually of a purplish colour, but are
                    sometimes white, and the seeds, like the petals, vary in tint from dark violet
                    to white. The cultivation is carried on, both on the more elevated and lower
                    lands, chiefly by peasant proprietors. A naturally light and rich soil, further
                    improved by manure, is necessary, and moisture is indispensable, although
                    injurious in excess, so that after a wet winter the best crops are obtained on
                    hilly ground, and in a dry season on the plains. The land is ploughed twice, the
                    second time crosswise, so that it may be thoroughly pulverized; and the seed,
                    mixed with four times its quantity of sand, to prevent its being sown too
                    thickly, is scattered broadcast, about ⅞ to 1 ft being used for every toloom
                    (1600 square yards). The crop is very uncertain owing to droughts, spring
                    frosts, and locusts, and, in order to avoid a total failure and to allow time
                    for collecting the produce, there are three sowings at intervals from October to
                    March, —the crops thus coming to perfection in succession. But notwithstanding
                    these precautions quantities of the drug are wasted when the crop is a full one,
                    owing to the difficulty of gathering the whole in the short time during which
                    collection is possible. The first sowing produces the hardiest plants, the yield
                    of the other two depending almost entirely on favourable weather. In localities
                    where there is hoar frost in autumn and spring the seed is sown in September or
                    at latest in the beginning of October, and the yield of opium and seed is then
                    greater than if sown later. After sowing, the land is harrowed, and the young
                    plants are hoed and weeded, chiefly by women and children, from early spring
                    until the time of flowering. In the plains the flowers expand at the end of May,
                    on the uplands in July. At this period gentle showers are of great value, as
                    they cause an increase in the subsequent yield of opium. The petals fall in a
                    few hours, and the capsules grow so rapidly that in a short time—generally from
                    nine to fifteen days— the opium is fit for collection. This period is known by
                    the capsules yielding to pressure with the fingers, assuming a lighter green
                    tint, and exhibiting a kind of bloom called “cougak,” easily rubbed off with the
                    fingers; they are then about 1⅜ inches in diameter. The incisions are made by
                    holding the capsule in the left hand and drawing a knife two - thirds round it,
                    or spirally beyond the starting-point (see fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> p.
                    790), great care being taken not to let the incisions penetrate to the interior
                    lest the juice should flow inside and be lost. (In this case also it is said
                    that the seeds will not ripen, and that no oil can be obtained from them.) The
                    operation is usually performed after the heat of the day, commencing early in
                    the afternoon and continuing to nightfall, and the exuded juice is collected the
                    next morning. This is done by scraping the capsule with a knife and transferring
                    the concreted juice to a poppy-leaf held in the left hand, the edges of the leaf
                    being turned in to avoid spilling the juice, and the knife-blade moistened with
                    saliva by drawing it through the mouth after every alternate scraping to prevent
                    the juice from adhering to it. When as much opium has been collected as the size
                    of the leaf will allow, another leaf is wrapped over the top of the lump, which
                    is then placed in the shade to dry for several days. The pieces vary in size
                    from about 2 oz. to over 2 lb, being made larger in some districts than in
                    others. The capsules are generally incised only once, but the fields are visited
                    a second or third time to collect the opium from the poppy-heads subsequently
                    developed by the branching of the stem. The yield of opium varies, even on the
                    same piece of land, from ⅛ to 7⅜ chequis (of 1 ’ 62 lb) per toloom (1600 square
                    yards), the average being 1⅜ chequis of opium and 4 bushels (of 50 ft) of seed.
                    The seed, which yields 35 to 42 per cent, of oil, is worth about two-thirds of
                    the value of the opium. The whole of the operation must, of course, be completed
                    in the few days—five to ten—during which the capsules are capable of yielding
                    the drug. A cold wind or a chilly atmosphere at the time of collection lessens
                    the yield, and rain washes the opium off the capsules. Before the crop is all
                    gathered in a meeting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0852-0789"/> of buyers and sellers takes place in each
                    district, at which the price to be asked is discussed and settled, and the opium
                    handed to the buyers, who in many instances have advanced money on the standing
                    crop. When sufficiently solid the pieces of opium are packed in cotton bags, a
                    quantity of the fruits of a species of <hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi> being thrown
                    in to prevent the cakes from adhering together. The bags are then sealed up,
                    packed in oblong or circular baskets, and sent to Smyrna or other ports on
                    mules. On the arrival of the opium at its destination, in the end of July or
                    beginning of August, it is placed in cool warehouses to avoid loss of weight
                    until sold. When transferred to the buyer’s warehouses the bags are opened and
                    each piece is examined by a public inspector in the presence of both buyer and
                    seller, the quality of the opium being judged by appearance, odour, colour, and
                    weight. It is then sorted into three qualities :—(1) finest quality; (2) current
                    or second; (3) chicanti or rejected pieces. A fourth sort consists of the very
                    bad or wholly factitious pieces. The substances used to adulterate opium are
                    grape-juice thickened with flour, fig-paste, liquorice, half-dried apricots,
                    inferior gum tragacanth, and sometimes clay or pieces of lead or other metals.
                    The chicanti is returned to the seller, who disposes of it at 20 to 30 per cent,
                    discount to French and German merchants for the manufacture of morphia. After
                    inspection the opium is hermetically sealed in tin-lined boxes containing about
                    150 tb. Turkey opium is principally used in medicine on account of its purity
                    and the large percentage of morphia that it contains, a comparatively small
                    quantity being exported to China.</p>
                <p>A number of varieties exist in commerce, differing in certain qualities, and, to
                    a certain extent, in external character. These are generally exported under the
                    names of the districts where they are prepared, but are more generally known in
                    English commerce by the name of the port from which they are shipped. Thus,
                    Constantinople opium includes the produce of Bogaditz, Karahissar Sahib,
                    Kutchaya, Balukhissar, Kurkagatsch, Ghéve, Beybazar, Angora, Malatia, and Tokat,
                    as well as Macedonian opium from Salonica. Smyrna opium comprises opium from
                    Afium Karahissar, Ushak, Akhissar, Tanshauli, Isbarta, Koniyeh, Bulladan, Hamid,
                    and Magnesia, and the Yerli<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The word <hi rend="italic">yerli</hi> means “grown near,” and is applied to

                    In English commerce these are roughly divided into shipping, druggist’s, and
                    manufacturer’s opium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shipping</hi> opium includes varieties of a pale or yellowish
                    colour internally, of a soft consistence, and free from poppy débris, &amp;c.,
                    or “chaff,” as it is technically called. Such opium affords a large amount of
                    extract, and leaves very little insoluble residue when dissolved in water, and
                    on this account is preferred in countries where opium-smoking or eating is
                    practised. The principal varieties used for this purpose are Malatia (including
                    that of Kharput), Tokat, Salonica, Balukhissar (including the produce of
                    Kurkagatsch), Bogaditz, and the finest qualities of Angora and Yerli. The chief
                    markets are China, Peru, the West India Islands, British Guiana, and Brazil; and
                    the United States also purchase the same kinds for reshipment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Druggist's</hi> opium includes the varieties purchased for use
                    in medicine in European countries and the United States. It is generally of
                    firmer consistence and rather darker colour than shipping opium. The finest
                    varieties of this kind in English commerce are Bey bazar, Yerli, Karahissar

                    Ushak, Yerli, and Karahissar opiums are purchased chiefly for the American
                    market, and the Ghéve or Ismid opium for the Continental.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacturer's</hi> opium includes chicanti or low-priced

                <p>Malatia opium usually occurs in pieces of irregular shape, weighing from 1⅜ to 3
                    lb, and about 1⅜ to 2 inches thick, the “paste” or substance being soft and pale
                    and remarkably free from foreign matter or “chaff,” and the exterior being
                    covered with a bright bluish green leaf; the paste of Tokat is similar, but
                    usually of thinner consistence and darker colour. Bogaditz opium is met with in
                    smaller pieces, usually 2 to 3 oz., and is covered with a yellowish green leaf,
                    the surface being rough with <hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi> fruit. Occasionally,
                    however, pieces are met with from 1 to 1⅜ lb in weight, still more rarely up to
                    4 lb in weight, approaching more nearly to the Balukhissar and Kurkagatsch
                    varieties, which are usually similar to the Bogaditz, but in larger pieces.
                    Karahissar opium is in rather large conical lumps; formerly the pieces
                    frequently bore the impress of a poppy-head pressed into the top. The Adet,
                    Akhissar, and Amasia opiums are very similar in appearance, and usually pass
                    under the name of Karahissar. Angora opium usually occurs in small pieces
                    carelessly prepared, so as to be rough and unsightly in appearance although of
                    good quality. Occasionally samples of good colour, soft consistency, and
                    excellent quality are met with, and these are always used as shipping opium.

                    in small rounded cakes, weighing about 2 to 3 oz. in weight. The pieces, known
                    in trade as “Constantinople pats,” have a smooth shining appearance, with the
                    midrib of the poppy-leaf they are wrapped in forming a median line on the
                    surface. The interior often shows layers of light and dark colour. Yoghourma is
                    a very inferior opium, and, as its name implies, is “remade” or made up at the
                    port of shipment. It is usually sold to morphia manufacturers at a price
                    determined by analysis.</p>
                <p>In Macedonia opium culture was commenced in 1865 at Istip, with seed obtained
                    from Karahissar in Asia Minor, and has since extended to the adjacent districts
                    of Kotchava, Stroumnitza, Tikvish, ami Kinprulu-veles. The crop in 1882 was
                    135,000 lb of opium and 500,000 to 600,000 lb of seed, most of the drug being
                    exported under the name of Salonica opium to Great Britain at prices ranging
                    from 12s. 6d. to 16s. per lb. Macedonian opium, especially that produced at
                    Istip, is very pure, yielding about 11 per cent, of morphia, and is considered
                    equal to the Malatia produce. The Turkish Government encourage the development
                    of the industry by remitting the tithes on opium and poppy-seed for one year on
                    lands sown for the first time, and by distributing printed instructions for
                    cultivating the poppy and preparing the opium. In these directions it is pointed
                    out that the opium crop is ten times as profitable as that of wheat. Four
                    varieties of poppy are distinguished,—two with white flowers, large oval
                    capsules without holes under their “combs” (stigmas), and bearing respectively
                    yellow and white seed, and the other two having red or purple flowers and seeds
                    of the same colour, one bearing small capsules perforated at the top, and the
                    other larger oval capsules not perforated. The white varieties are recommended
                    as yielding a more abundant opium of superior quality. The yellow seed is said
                    to yield the best oil; that obtained by hot pressure is used for lamps and for
                    paint, and the cold-pressed oil for culinary purposes.</p>
                <p>Opium is also grown in Bulgaria, but almost entirely for home consumption; any
                    surplus produce is, however, bought by Jews and Turks at low prices and sent to
                    Constantinople, where it is sold as Turkish opium. It is produced in the
                    districts of Kustendil, Lowtscha, and Halitz, and is made into lumps weighing
                    about 4 oz., of a light-brown colour internally, and containing a few seeds; it
                    is covered with leaves which have not been identified. Samples that have been
                    analysed by Herr Theegarten have yielded from 7 to 19 per cent, of morphia, and
                    only 2 to 3 per cent, of ash, and are therefore of excellent quality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">India.—</hi> The poppy grown in India is generally the same as
                    that used in Persia, but in the Himalayas a red-flowered variety with black
                    seeds is met with. The largest amount of opium is produced in the central tract
                    of the Ganges, extending from Dinajpur in the east to Agra in the west, and from
                    Gorakhpur in the north to Hazaribagh in the south, and comprising an area of
                    about 600 miles long by 200 broad. The region next in importance consists of the
                    tableland of Malwa and the slopes of the Vindhya Hills in Indore.</p>
                <p>The opium industry in Bengal is a Government monopoly, and the districts are
                    divided into two agencies, Behar and Benares, which are under the control of
                    officials residing respectively at Patna and Ghazipur. In 1883 463,829 acres
                    were under poppy cultivation in the Behar agency, and 412,625 in that of
                    Benares. Any one who chooses may undertake the industry, but cultivators are
                    obliged to sell the opium exclusively to the Government agent at a price fixed
                    beforehand by the latter, which is approximately 3s. 6d. per It&gt;, the
                    Government selling it at about Ils. per lb. The peasant is, however, said to be
                    fully remunerated by the price he receives. It is considered that with greater
                    freedom the cultivator would produce too great a quantity, and loss to the
                    Government would soon result. Advances of money are often made by the Government
                    to enable the ryots to grow the poppy.</p>
                <p>In Malwa the cultivation is free and extremely profitable, the crop realizing
                    usually from three to seven times the value of wheat or other cereals, and in
                    exceptionally advantageous situations from twelve to twenty times as much. On
                    its entering British territory a heavy duty is imposed on Malwa opium, so as to
                    raise its price to an equality with the Government article. The tax was formerly
                    collected at Indore only, but since other stations have been made at Ujjain,
                    Jaora, and Udaipur the export has increased to 500 chests a month. Malwa opium
                    is shipped from Bombay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The area under poppy cultivation outside these districts is comparatively small,
                    but it appears to be increasing throughout the plains of the Punjab. The poppy
                    is grown for opium, according to Stewart <hi rend="italic">{Punjaub Plants,</hi>
                    Lahore, 1869, p. 10), in the valley of the Bias east of Lahore. It is cultivated
                    up to 7500 feet above sea-level, the opium of Kulu in this district being
                    considered of excellent quality. In Nepal, Bashahr, and Rampur, and at Doda
                    Kashtwar in the Jammu territory, opium is produced and exported to Yarkand,
                    Khotan, Aksu, and various Chinese provinces.</p>
                <p>The land intended for poppy culture is usually selected near villages in order
                    that it may be more easily manured and irrigated. On a rich soil a crop of maize
                    or vegetables is grown during the rainv season, and after its removal in
                    September the ground is <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0853-0790"/> prepared, for the poppy-culture. Under less
                    favourable circumstances the land is prepared from July till October by
                    ploughing, weeding, and manuring. The seed is sown between the 1st and 15th of
                    November, and germinates in ten or fifteen days. The fields are divided for
                    purposes of irrigation into beds about 10 feet square, which usually are
                    irrigated twice between November and February, but if the season be cold, with
                    hardly any rain, the operation is repeated five or six times. When the seedlings
                    are 2 or 3 inches high they are thinned out and weeded. The plants during growth
                    are liable to injury by severe frost, excessive rain, insects, fungi, and the
                    growth of a root-parasite <hi rend="italic">(Orobanche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >indica).</hi> The poppy blossoms about the middle of February, and the petals
                    when about to fall are collected for the purpose of making “leaves” for the
                    spherical coverings of the balls of opium. These are made by heating a
                    circular-ridged earthen plate over a slow fire, and spreading the petals, a few
                    at a time, over its surface. As the juice exudes, more petals are pressed on to
                    them with a cloth until a layer of sufficient thickness is obtained. The leaves
                    are forwarded to the opium-factories, where they are sorted into three classes,
                    according to size and colour, the smaller and dark-coloured being reserved for
                    the inside of the shells of the opium-balls, and the larger and least coloured
                    for the outside. These are valued respectively at 10 to 7 and 5 rupees per maund
                    of 82⅜ lb. The collection of opium commences in Behar about 25th February, and
                    continues to about 25th March, but in Malwa is performed in March and April. The
                    capsules are scarified vertically (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> in most
                    districts (although in some the incisions are made horizontally, as in Asia
                    Minor), the “nushtur” or cutting instrument being drawn twice upwards for each
                    incision, and repeated two to six times at intervals of two or three days. The
                    nushtur (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">c)</hi> consists of three to five flattened
                    blades forked at the larger end, and separated about one - sixteenth of an inch
                    from each other by winding cotton thread between them, the whole being also
                    bound together by thread, and the protrusion of the points being restricted to
                    one-twelfth of an inch, by which the depth of the incision is limited. The
                    operation is usually performed about three or four o’clock in the afternoon, and
                    the opium collected the next morning. In Bengal a small sheet-iron scoop or
                    “seetoah” is used for scraping off the dried juice, and, as it becomes filled,
                    the opium is emptied into an earthen pot carried for the purpose. In Malwa a
                    flat scraper is employed, a small piece of cotton soaked in linseed oil being
                    attached to the upper part of the blade, and used for smearing the thumb and
                    edge of the scraper to prevent adhesion of the juice; sometimes water is used
                    instead of oil, but both practices injure the quality of the product. Sometimes
                    the opium is in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> fluid state by reason of dew, and in
                    some places it is rendered still more so by the practice adopted by collectors
                    of washing their scrapers, and adding the washings to the morning’s collection.
                    The juice, when brought home, is consequently a wet granular mass of pinkish
                    colour, from which a dark fluid drains to the bottom of the vessel. In order to
                    get rid of this fluid, called “pasewa” or “pussewah,” the opium is placed in a
                    shallow earthen vessel tilted on one side, and the pussewah drained off. The
                    residual mass is then exposed to the air in the shade, and regularly turned over
                    every few days, until it has reached the proper consistence, which takes place
                    in about three or four weeks. The drug is then taken to the Government factory
                    to be sold. It is turned out of the pots into wide tin vessels or “tagars,” in
                    which it is weighed in quantities not exceeding 21 lb. It is then examined by a
                    native expert (purkhea) as to impurities, colour, fracture, aroma, and
                    consistence. To determine the amount of moisture, which should not exceed 30 per
                    cent., a weighed sample is evaporated and dried in a plate on a metallic surface
                    heated by steam. Adulterations such as mud, sand, powdered charcoal, soot,
                    cow-dung, powdered poppy petals, and powdered seeds of various kinds are easily
                    detected by breaking up the drug in cold water. Flour, potatoflour, ghee, and
                    ghoor (crude date-sugar) are revealed by their odour and the consistence they
                    impart. Various other adulterants are sometimes used, such as the inspissated
                    juice of the prickly pear, extracts from tobacco, stramonium, and hemp, pulp of
                    the tamarind and bael fruit, mahwah flowers, and gums of different kinds. The
                    price paid to the cultivator is regulated chiefly by the amount of water
                    contained in the drug. When received into the Government stores the opium is
                    kept in large wooden boxes holding about 50 maunds and occasionally stirred up,
                    if only a little below the standard. If containing much water it is placed in
                    shallow wooden drawers and constantly turned over. During the process it deepens
                    in colour. From the store about 250 maunds are taken daily to be manufactured
                    into cakes.</p>
                <p>Various portions, each weighing 10 sers (of 2⅛ ft&gt;), are selected by test
                    assay so as to ensure the mass being of standard consistence (70 per cent, of
                    the pure dry drug and 30 per cent, of water), and are thrown into shallow
                    drawers and kneaded together. The mass is then packed into boxes all of one
                    size, and a specimen of each again assayed, the mean of the whole being taken as
                    the average. Before evening these boxes are emptied into wooden vats 20 feet
                    long, 3⅜ feet wide, and 1∣ feet deep, and the opium further kneaded and mixed by
                    men wading through it from end to end until it appears to.be of a uniform
                    consistence. Next morning the manufacture of the opium into balls commences. The
                    workman sits on a wooden stand, with a brass cup before him, which he lines with
                    the leaves of poppy petals before-mentioned until the thickness of half an inch
                    is reached, a few being allowed to hang over the cup; the leaves are
                    agglutinated by means of “lewa,” a pasty fluid which consists of a mixture of
                    inferior opium, 8 per cent, of pasewa, and the “dhoe” or washings of the vessels
                    that have contained opium, and the whole is made of such consistence that 100
                    grains evaporated to dryness over a water-bath leave 53 grains of solid residue.
                    All the ingredients for the opium-ball are furnished to the workmen by measure.
                    When the inside of the brass cup is ready a ball of opium previously weighed is
                    placed on the leafy case in it, and the upper half of it covered with leaves in
                    the same way that the casing for the lower half was made, the overhanging leaves
                    of the lower half being pressed upwards and the sphere completed by one large
                    leaf which is placed over the upper half. The ball, which resembles a Dutch
                    cheese in size and shape, is now rolled in “poppy trash” made from the
                    coarsely-powdered leaves, capsules, and stalks of the poppy plant, and is placed
                    in an earthen cup of the same size as the brass one; the cups are then placed in
                    dishes and the opium exposed to the sun to dry for three days, being constantly
                    turned and examined. If it becomes distended the ball is pierced to liberate the
                    gas and again lightly closed. On the third evening the cups are placed in open
                    frames which allow free circulation of the air. This operation is usually
                    completed by the end of July. The balls thus made consist on the average of—</p>

                <p>The average number of cakes that can be made daily by one man is about 70,
                    although 90 to 100 are sometimes turned out by clever workmen. The cakes are
                    liable to become mildewed, and require constant turning and occasional rubbing
                    in dry ‘ ‘ poppy trash” to remove the mildew, and strengthening in weak places
                    with fresh poppy leaves. By October the cakes are dry and fairly solid, and are
                    then packed in chests, which are divided into two tiers of twenty square
                    compartments for the reception of as many cakes, which are steadied by a packing
                    of loose poppy trash.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    warehouse for a length of time, but ultimately the opium ceases to lose moisture
                    to the shell, and the latter becomes extremely solid. This is known as
                    “provision” opium.</p>
                <p>For home consumption Bengal opium is prepared in a different shape, and is known
                    as Abkari or excisable opium. It is exposed to the heat of the sun until it
                    contains only 10 per cent, of moisture, and is then formed into square cakes of
                    2 tb each, which are wrapped in oiled paper, or it is made into flat square
                    tablets. In this form it has not the aroma of the ball-opium.</p>
                <p>The care bestowed on the selection and preparation of the drug in the Bengal
                    opium-factories is such that the merchants who purchase it rarely require to
                    examine it, although permission is given to open at each sale, any number of
                    chests or cakes that they may desire.</p>
                <p>In Malwa the opium is manufactured by private enterprise, the Government levying
                    an export duty of 600 rupees (£60) per chest. It is not made into balls but into
                    rectangular or rounded masses, and is not cased in poppy petals. It contains as
                    much as 95 per cent, of dry opium, but is of much less uniform quality than the
                    Bengal drug, and, having no guarantee as to purity, is not considered<pb

                    differ in any important particular from that in Bengal. The opium is collected
                    in March and April, and the crude drug or * ‘ chick” is thrown into an earthen
                    vessel and covered with linseed oil to prevent evaporation. In this state it is
                    sold to itinerant dealers. It is afterwards tied up in quantities of 25 ft and
                    50 ft in double bags of sheeting, which are suspended to a ceiling out of the
                    light and draught to allow the excess of oil to drain off. This takes place in
                    seven to ten days, but the bags are left for four to six weeks until the oil
                    remaining on the opium has become oxidized and hardened. In June and July, when
                    the rains begin, the bags are taken down and emptied into shallow vats 10 to 15
                    feet across, and 6 to 8 inches deep, in which the opium is kneaded until uniform
                    in colour and consistence and tough enough to be formed into cakes of 8 or 10
                    ounces in weight. These are thrown into a basket containing chaff made from the
                    capsules. They are then rolled in broken leaves and stalks of the poppy and
                    left, with occasional turning, for a week or so, when they become hard enough to
                    bear packing. In October and November they are weighed and sent to market,
                    packed in chests containing as nearly as possible 1 nicul=133⅜ lb, the petals
                    and leaves of the poppy being used as packing materials. The production is said
                    to amount to about 20,000 chests annually.</p>
                <p>The amount of opium revenue collected in India was £10,480,051 in 1881. It is a
                    remarkable fact that the only Indian opium ever seen in England is an occasional
                    sample of the Malwa sort, whilst the Government monopoly opium is quite unknown;
                    indeed, the whole of the opium used in medicine in Europe and the United States
                    is obtained from Turkey. This is in some measure due to the fact that Indian
                    opium contains less morphia. It has recently been shown, however, that opium
                    grown in the hilly districts of the Himalayas yields 50 per cent, more morphia
                    than that of the plains, and that the deficiency of morphia in the Indian drug
                    is due, in some measure, to the long exposure to the air in a semiliquid state
                    which it undergoes. In view, therefore, of the probable decline in the Chinese
                    demand, the cultivation of the drug for the European market in the hilly
                    districts of India, and its preparation after the mode adopted in Turkey, viz.,
                    by drying the concrete juice as quickly as possible, might be worthy of the
                    consideration of the British Government.</p>

                    It is most largely produced in the districts of Ispahan, Shiraz, Yezd, and
                    Khonsar, and to a less extent in those of Khorasan, Kermanshah, and Fars. The
                    Yezd opium is considered better than that of Ispahan, but the strongest or <hi
                    rend="italic">Theriak-e-Arabistani</hi> is produced in the neighbourhood of
                    Dizful and Shuster, east of the river Tigris. Good opium is also produced about
                    Sari and Balfarush in the province of Mazanderan. The capsules are incised
                    vertically, or in some districts vertical cuts with diagonal branches are made.
                    The crop is collected in May and June and reaches the ports for exportation
                    between September and January. Although the cultivation of opium in Persia was
                    probably carried on at an earlier date than in India, Persian opium was almost
                    unknown in England until about the year 1870, except in the form of the inferior
                    quality known as “Trebizond,” which usually contains only 0 · 2 to 3 per cent,
                    of morphia. This opium is in the form of c ylindrical sticks about 6 inches long
                    and half an inch in diameter, wrapped in waxed paper. Since 1870 Persian opium
                    has been largely exported from Bushire and Bandar-Abbas in the Persian Gulf to
                    London, the Straits Settlements, and China. At that date the annual yield is
                    said not to have exceeded 2600 cases; but, the profits on opium having about
                    that time attracted attention, all available ground was utilized for this to the
                    exclusion of cereals, cotton, and other produce. The result was a severe famine
                    in 1871-72, which was further aggravated by drought and other circumstances.
                    Notwithstanding the lesson thus taught, the cultivation is being extended every
                    year, especially in Ispahan, which abounds in streams and rivers, an advantage
                    in which Yezd is deficient. About Shiraz, Behbehan, and Kermanshah it now
                    occupies much of the land, and has consequently affected the price and growth of
                    cereals. The trade—only 300 chests in 1859—gradually increased until 1877, when
                    the Persian opium was much adulterated with glucose. The heavy losses on this
                    inferior opium and the higher prices obtained for the genuine article led to a
                    great improvement in its preparation, and in 1880 the export had increased to
                    7700 chests. About five-sixths of this total finds its way to the Chinese
                    market, chiefly by sea, although some is earned overland through Bokhara,
                    Khokand, and Kashgar; a considerable quantity is exported by way of Trebizond
                    and Samsun to Constantinople, and the remainder to Great Britain. The produce of
                    Ispahan and Fars is carried for exportation to Bushire, and that of Khorasan and
                    Kirman and Yezd partly to Bushire and partly to Bandar-Abbas. The Shuster opium
                    is sent partly <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Bushire to Muscat for transhipment to
                    Zanzibar, and part is believed to be smuggled into India by way of Baluchistan
                    and Mekran. Smaller quantities grown in Teheran, Tabriz, and Kermanshah find
                    their way to Smyrna, where it is mixed with the local drug for the European
                    market, the same practice being carried on at Constantinople with the Persian
                    opium that arrives there from Samsun and Trebizond. For the Chinese market the
                    opium is usually packed in chests containing 10∣ shahmans (of 13⅜ ft), so that
                    on arrival it may weigh 1 Chinese picul { — 133⅜ ft), 5 to 10 per cent, being
                    allowed for loss by drying. At Ispahan, Shiraz, and Yezd the drug, after being
                    dried in the sun, is mixed with oil in the proportion of 6 or 7 lb to 141 ft of
                    opium, with the object, it is said, of suiting the taste of the Chinese,—that
                    intended for the London market being usually free from oil.</p>
                <p>Persian opium, as met with in the London market, occurs in several forms, the
                    most common being that of broad rounded cones weighing 6 to 10 oz. or more, or
                    rarely twice that size. These are packed in poppy trash, or are wrapped
                    separately in paper, or sometimes in poppy, fig, or vine leaves. Ispahan opium
                    also occurs in the form of parallelepipeds weighing about 16 to 20 oz.;
                    sometimes flat circular pieces weighing about 20 oz. are met with. The opium is
                    usually of much firmer and smoother consistence than that of Turkey, of a
                    chocolate-brown colour and cheesy appearance, the pieces bearing evidence of
                    having been beaten into a uniform mass previously to being made into lumps. The
                    odour differs but slightly, except in oily specimens, from that of Turkey opium.
                    Great care is now taken to prevent adulteration, and consequently Persian opium
                    can be obtained nearly as rich in morphia as the Turkish drug,—on the average
                    from 8 to 12 per cent. The greater proportion of the Persian opium imported into
                    London is again exported, a comparatively small quantity being used, chiefly for
                    the manufacture of morphia when Turkey opium is dear, and a little in veterinary
                    practice. According to Dr Reveil, Persian opium usually contains 75 to 84 per
                    cent, of matter soluble in water, and some samples contain from 13 to 30 per
                    cent, of glucose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">China.—</hi> The variety of poppy grown in China appears to be
                    chiefly the <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">somniferum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi><hi rend="italic">album,</hi> especially in the low lands,
                    but red and purple varieties are also met with. The production is principally
                    carried on in the south-western provinces of Szechuen, Yunnan, and Kweichow. It
                    is grown to a less extent in Shanse, Shense, and Shantung in the north, as well
                    as in eastern Mongolia and north-eastern Manchuria and Shingking; but in these
                    provinces the richest soil and the utmost care are necessary to ensure the
                    success of the crop, and the area under opium cannot be greatly extended.
                    Formerly the province of Shense produced 30 per cent, of the native product, but
                    since the famine caused by the neglect of cereals for opium the extension of the
                    cultivation has been rigidly prohibited in Shense, Honan, and Chihli. In
                    Kw’angtung the soil and climate have been found unsuitable, and in Fuhkeen sugar
                    proves equally remunerative, if not more so. There can be no question, however,
                    that, as already stated, the cultivation of the poppy is extending rapidly, in
                    spite of prohibitory edicts issued from time to time; four-fifths of the opium
                    at present used in China is home-grown. According to Consul Spence’s report
                    (1882) the poppy is cultivated chiefly on land near villages where manure and
                    labour can be easily obtained. As soon as the summer crop has been reaped the
                    land is ploughed and cleaned, roots and w*eeds are burnt and the resulting ashes
                    scattered over the ground, and dressings of night-soil are liberally applied.
                    The seeds are sown in November and December in drills 18 inches apart. In
                    January, when the plants are a few inches high, the rows are thinned and.
                    earthed up so as to leave a free passage between. The ground is afterwards
                    weeded occasionally and the earth stirred up. The poppy blooms in March or
                    April, according to the situation. As soon as the capsules begin to form,
                    dressings of liquid manure are given, and in April and May the opium is
                    collected. Vertical incisions are made in the capsules as in India. In some
                    districts, however, a vertical shaving appears to be taken off the surface of
                    the capsule. The excreted juice is scraped off and transferred to a small pot
                    suspended at the waist. The mode of preparation for the market has not been
                    described, but, from the occasional samples that have been sent to England, the
                    opium appears to have undergone manipulation, since it has a uniform pasty
                    consistence and is without any trace of the granular structure indicative of
                    unmixed opium like that of Turkey. The colour is darker and the consistence
                    softer than that of Persian opium, but the odour is good. Some of the Szechuen
                    opium appears to have been mixed with oil. The Yunnan and Szechuen opiums are
                    made into flat cakes, and are wrapped in white paper. Chekeang opium is in the
                    form of treacly extract, and is sold in jars containing 2 to 4 ft. The yield of
                    opium is calculated at 350 oz. per acre. The Shense drug is highly esteemed
                    because it has a flavour resembling the Patna kind and gives 85 to 90 per cent,
                    of extract. Yunnan opium comes next and Szechuen third in value.</p>
                <p>The use of foreign opium by the Chinese bears some relation to its introduction,
                    which was in the following order Patna, Malwa, Benares, and Persian. Thus the
                    Patna opium is preferred along the south-eastern coast as far north as the
                    Yangtsze river, except in the district about Ningpo. Malwa is chiefly consumed
                    in the northern provinces, including part of Kwangtung, Kwangse, Keangse, and
                    Ganhwuy, while Benares is the favourite kind in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n855/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0855-0792"/> Formosa and some parts of Fuhkeen. Persian
                    replaces the Malwa to a limited extent on account of its lower price; it goes
                    principally to the province of Kwangse. Malwa opium is reputed to have a strong
                    flavour and biting taste, and to be more stimulating; it is said to cause
                    heartburn in those unaccustomed to its use, to induce an unhealthy action of the
                    skin, and to prove irritating to the nervous system. Patna is considered mild
                    but narcotic. Persian is also reckoned hot and acrid, and apt to cause
                    dysentery. In some respects the native opium is comparable to the Malwa, having
                    a coarser and more fiery flavour than the Patna, and also has the disadvantage
                    of causing troublesome eruptions on the skin. It is said to be frequently
                    adulterated with seaweed, jelly, oil, &amp;c. It seems worthy of inquiry how far
                    this difference of flavour and action may be due to the oil with which both
                    Malwa and Chinese opiums are often prepared. The native opium is said to have
                    the advantage over the foreign that the habit of smoking it can be broken off
                    with comparative ease, which is not the case with the Indian drug.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Egypt.—</hi> The variety grown in Egypt is the same as in Asia
                    Minor. The cultivation is carried on in Upper Egypt near Esneh, Kenneh, and
                    Siout. The capsules are incised in March by drawing a knife twice round them
                    horizontally. The concreted juice is scraped off next day by a scoop-knife,
                    collected on a leaf, and placed in the shade to harden. Good samples, which are
                    of rare occurrence, yield 9 to 12 per cent, of morphia; but, as a rule, the
                    plant is grown in too moist a soil, scarification is not always performed at the
                    right date, and adulteration is extensively practised, so that the average yield
                    of morphia is only 3 to 4 per cent. As met with in English commerce Egyptian
                    opium is in the form of hard, flat, circular cakes about 4 inches in diameter,
                    covered with poppy and other leaves, but free from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rumex</hi> fruits usually seen on Turkey opium. The fracture is porous, dark
                    liver-coloured, with shining embedded particles and reddish yellow points, and
                    occasionally starchy granules. The total amount exported in 1879 was valued at
                    £2310, of which there was sent to Italy £990, France £630, Greece £540, and
                    Turkey £150. It is not now regularly imported into Britain owing to its inferior
                    quality. Μ. Gastinel found that, when cultivated in his garden at Cairo, the
                    poppies yielded 10 to 12 per cent, of morphia when the capsules were nearly
                    ripe, while opium collected immediately after the flowering was over contained
                    only 3 to 4 per cent.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Mozambique.—</hi> A company was established in Lisbon in 1877,
                    with a grant of 50,000 acres of land in Mozambique, and certain exclusive
                    privileges; the cultivation was commenced in 1879 and was carried on at Chaima
                    between the Mulo and Quaqua rivers. The ground has been sown with Malwa seed,
                    the plants thrive well, and the capsules are larger than those grown in India.
                    The collection of opium is made about seventy-five days after the seed has been
                    sown, and the yield compares favourably with that obtained in India. It is said
                    to be mixed on the spot with 80 to 100 per cent, of a special matter known only
                    to the cultivators. The mixture is made into balls weighing about 1 lb; these
                    are packed in boxes with poppy trash and covered with a layer of indigenous
                    cotton. The yield from the first crop amounted only to a few pounds, and upon
                    examination proved to be of moderate quality only. It was of soft consistence,
                    brownish colour, and yielded 4 per cent, of morphia and 4∙ 3 per cent, of
                    narcotin, and 40’ 9 per cent, of moisture. In 1884 specimens were sent to the
                    London market in the form of spherical balls, having the size and general
                    appearance of Malwa and evidently intended to compete with it in the Chinese
                    market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Australia.—</hi> Experiments in opium-cultivation have been
                    made during the last ten years in the neighbourhood of Melbourne, near
                    Bairnsdale in Gippsland, and at Dromana on Port Phillip Bay, and a few cwts. of
                    opium have been obtained. The first specimens collected contained only 2 per
                    cent, of morphia and about 8 per cent, of narcotin; in subsequent experiments
                    opium yielding 4 to 10 per cent, of morphia was obtained. The seed, procured
                    from Smyrna, was sown in June, July, and the beginning of August, and the opium
                    collected in the summer months of January, February, and March. The plants
                    attained a height of 5 to 7 feet, and each produced three or four large white
                    flowers. The East India variety, with double purple or nearly black flowers, was
                    found to produce only one flower and give but little opium. It seems probable
                    that, with greater care in selection of sheltered hilly localities and rich soil
                    for the cultivation of the poppy, and attention to the very important point of
                    collecting the juice at exactly the right time, opium of very excellent quality
                    might be produced in Australia in sufficient quantity to meet the local
                    demand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Europe.</hi> —Experiments made in England, France, Italy,
                    Switzerland, Greece, Spain, Germany, and even in Sweden prove that opium as rich
                    in morphia as that of Eastern countries can be produced in Europe. In 1830 Mr
                    Young, a surgeon at Edinburgh, succeeded in obtaining 56 lb of opium from an
                    acre of poppies, and sold it at 36s. per lb. In France the cultivation has been
                    carried on since 1844 at Clermont-Ferrand by Μ. Aubergier. The juice, of which a
                    workman is able to collect about 9 ’ 64 troy oz. in a day, is evaporated by
                    artificial heat immediately after collection. The juice yields about one-fourth
                    of its weight of opium, and the percentage of morphia varies according to the
                    variety of poppy used, the purple one giving the best results. By mixing assayed
                    samples he is able to produce an opium containing uniformly 10 per cent, of
                    morphia. It is made up in cakes of 50 grammes, but is not produced in sufficient
                    quantity to become an article of wholesale commerce. Some specimens of French
                    opium have been found by Guibourt to yield 22 ’ 8 per cent, of morphia, being
                    the highest percentage observed as yet in any opium. Experiments made in Germany
                    by Karsten, Jobst, and Vulpius have shown that it is possible to obtain in that
                    country opium of excellent quality, containing from 8 to 13 per cent, of
                    morphia. It was found that the method yielding the best results was to make
                    incisions in the poppyheads soon after sunrise, to collect the juice with the
                    finger immediately after incision, and evaporate it as speedily as possible, the
                    colour of the opium being lighter and the percentage of morphia greater than
                    when the juice was allowed to dry on the plant. Cutting through the poppy-head
                    caused the shrivelling up of the young fruit, but the heads which had been
                    carefully incised yielded more seed than those which had not been cut at all.
                    Newly-manured soil was found to act prejudicially on the poppy. The giant
                    variety of poppy yielded most morphia.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of obtaining the requisite amount of cheap labour at the exact
                    time it is needed and the uncertainty of the weather render the cultivation of
                    opium too much a matter of speculation for it ever to become a regular crop in
                    most European countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">North America.—</hi> In 1865 the cultivation of opium was
                    attempted in Virginia by Mr A. Robertson, and a product was obtained which
                    yielded 4 per cent, of morphia. In 1867 Dr H. Black grew opium in Tennessee
                    which contained 10 per cent, of morphia. Opium produced in California by Dr H.
                    Flint in 1873 yielded 7∣ per cent, of morphia, equal to 10 per cent, in
                    perfectly-dried opium. The expense of cultivation exceeded the returns obtained
                    by its sale. As in Europe, therefore, the high price of labour militates against
                    its production on a large scale.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemical Constitution.—</hi> The activity of opium is
                    principally due to the vegetable alkaloid morphia or morphine, which opium of
                    good quality contains to the extent of 8 to 17 per cent., the average amount
                    being 10 per cent. Opium yielding less than this is considered of inferior grade
                    and below the commercial standard for use in medicine.</p>
                <p>Morphia is interesting as being the first one that was discovered of the now
                    large class of bodies known as alkaloids. Its basic nature was first clearly
                    pointed out in 1816 by Sertürner. It exists in opium in combination with
                    sulphuric and meconic acids. Lactic acid has also been found in opium, but is
                    believed to be formed in it subsequently to the collection of the drug.</p>
                <p>Besides morphia several other basic substances have been detected in different
                    varieties of opium, but only in minute quantities, rarely amounting to 1 per
                    cent. These are narceia; codeia, 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 to 0'4 per
                    cent.; thebaia, 0 ’ 15 to 1 · 0 per cent.; papaveria, 1 · 0 per cent.;
                    cryptopia, meco-nidia, hydrocotarnia, laudanosia, protopia, codamia, gnos-copia;
                    also a few other bodies of a feebly alkaline or neutral character, viz.,
                    narcotin, 2 to 8 per cent.; pseudomorphin, 0Ό2; lanthopin, Ό05; and
                    meconoiosin.</p>
                <p>Opium also contains in considerable quantity a resinoid body which is soluble in
                    its own weight of water, but is thrown down when this solution is diluted with
                    ten times its bulk of water; 11 per cent, of caoutchouc; a gum distinct from gum
                    arabic; pectin; albumen; wax, consisting of palmitate and cerotate of cerotyl;
                    and 4 to 8 per cent, of calcareous salts. Sugar has been frequently found in
                    opium, but whether natural or added as an adulteration is not known. The amount
                    of caoutchouc present has probably some bearing on the value of opium for
                    smoking, since the Chinese estimate its value roughly by the “touch,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the rapidity or slowness with which a thread drawn out
                    from the mass will break by its own weight.</p>
                <p>Of the alkaloids above mentioned only three are used to any extent in medicine,
                    viz., morphia, codeia, and narcotin. Narceia has also been used in medicine in

                    low percentage of morphia, the average yield being only 3 to 4 per cent.,
                    although samples of the kinds known as Khandesh and Garden Patna have afforded
                    on analysis 6 to 7 per cent. Chinese opium is similar in this respect, giving,
                    as a rule, only 3 to 7 per cent, of this alkaloid. The amount of morphia present
                    in opium bears no relation to the preference exhibited by smokers, opium
                    containing a large quantity of morphia being generally considered by them as
                    inferior in quality and apt to cause headache. For use in medicine those
                    containing a large percentage of morphia are the most esteemed. Opium dried as
                    soon as possible after being collected is usually much richer in morphia than
                    that kept for some time in a moist state and exposed to the air; and poppies
                    grown on the hills yield an opium containing more morphia than those cultivated
                    on the plains. Guibourt found that opium twenty years old contained less morphia
                    than when previously analysed in the fresh state. To ascertain the percentage of
                    morphia, the merchant extracts, by means of an instrument like a cheese-cutter,
                    a small cylinder of opium about the thickness of a penholder and about 2 inches
                    long, out of one-third of the pieces in a chest, and it is considered that the
                    analysis of these pieces will fairlyrepresent the value of the chest. Various
                    methods are adopted for estimating the morphia, most of which depend upon the
                    fact that this alkaloid can be precipitated from its salts by ammonia, and that
                    it is insoluble in ether and only very slightly soluble in cold water. When pure
                    it forms colourless shining prismatic crystals having an alkaline reaction. It
                    unites with acids to form salts, most of which are soluble in water. It is
                    soluble in 36 parts of boiling and 100 of cold alcohol, in 500 of boiling water,
                    and very slightly in chloroform. It is also soluble in the fixed and volatile
                    oils, and in solution of the fixed caustic alkalis and lime water, but only very
                    slightly in caustic ammonia. With nitric acid it gives a red colour passing into
                    yellow, with test solution of ferric chloride a blue colour which is destroyed
                    by free acids or alcohol, and with sulphuric acid and bichromate of potash a
                    greenish but not a purple or violet colour. Heated in the open air it burns
                    readily, a portion being volatilized. The salts chiefly used in medicine are the
                    hydrochlorate, sulphate, and acetate; and for subcutaneous injection the
                    tartrate has been recommended by Erskine Stuart, since it is more soluble, and
                    more concentrated solutions can be used of it than of the other salts. Heated in
                    a sealed tube with hydrochloric acid, morphia is decomposed and an alkaloid

                    few minutes even when all ordinary emetics fail to act. In minute doses it has
                    also valuable expectorant properties. It is soluble in ether and 50 parts of
                    alcohol and in 68 parts of boiling water, but the solution soon decomposes, and
                    assumes a gr een colour; consequently it should be made fresh for use in

                    crystallizes out on cooling in rather large octahedral prisms. It differs from

                    a small portion, probably in combination with sulphuric acid, is dissolved. It
                    is, however, very soluble in ether and benzol, and may be readily obtained by
                    means of these solvents from the crude drug. It is doubtful if it should be
                    classed with the alkaloids, for, although it forms definite compounds with some
                    of the mineral acids, it does not exert any influence on vegetable colours. It
                    differs from morphia in being insoluble in the caustic alkalis and not producing
                    a blue colour with ferric salts. When heated on a piece of paper over a candle

                <p>Opium of good quality for medicinal use should not lose more than 12⅜ per cent,
                    of water in drying, should not yield more than 8 per cent, of ash from the dried
                    drug, and ought to afford at least 60 per cent, of matter soluble in water. It
                    should be of somewhat tenacious consistence, yellowish brown colour, strong
                    narcotic odour, and bitter taste. The preparation of crude opium most largely
                    used in medicine is the tincture, commonly known as “laudanum.” It is composed

                    >London Pharmacopoeia</hi> of 1639 consisted of saffron, castor, ambergris,
                    musk, and oil of nutmeg. The liquid preparation which bears the name of laudanum
                    was apparently first introduced by the celebrated Dr Sydenham, and was inserted
                    in the <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</hi> for 1721. It also contained
                    aromatics.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Medicinal Uses.—</hi> The chief value of opium is to relieve
                    pain, to relax spasm, to allay both local and general irritation of the nervous
                    system, and to procure sleep. Its power of diminishing secretions is taken
                    advantage of in the cure of catarrh, bronchorrhoea, diarrhoea, and other forms
                    of inflammation of the mucous membranes accompanied with excessive secretion,
                    and also in diabetes. It is found of great value when conjoined with emetics in
                    improving or stimulating the secretions of the skin. Its use is dangerous in
                    inflammation of the brain or determination of blood to the head. The action of
                    opium is exerted much more powerfully in proportion upon infants than upon
                    adults, as small a dose as one drop of laudanum having proved fatal to an
                    infant. For remedies in cases of poisoning see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Poisons.</hi> Morphia differs slightly in its properties from opium. It is less
                    stimulant, and does not produce the full diaphoretic action; it causes less
                    headache, nausea, and constipation. When used hypodermically its action is more
                    rapid and smaller doses are required. Codeia is used in diabetes, in coughs, Ac.
                    Narceia is considered to be purely hypnotic. Narcotin is official in the
                    pharmacopoeia of India as a tonic in general debility arising from prolonged
                    lactation, and in convalescence from acute febrile and inflammatory
                    diseases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Opium-eating.—</hi> Opium, like many other poisons, produces
                    after a time a less effect if frequently administered as a medicine, so that the
                    dose has to be constantly increased to produce the same result on those who take
                    it habitually. When it is used to relieve pain or diarrhoea, if the dose be not
                    taken at the usual time the symptoms of the disease recur with such violence
                    that the remedy is speedily resorted to as the only means of relief, and thus
                    the habit is exceedingly difficult to break off. Opium-eating is chiefly
                    practised in Asia Minor, Persia, and India. Opinions differ widely as to the
                    injurious effect of the habit; the weight of evidence appears, however, to
                    indicate that it is much more deleterious than opium-smoking. It has been
                    practised in India from very ancient times; some idea of its prevalence there
                    may be gathered from the fact that the mere licence fees for one year amounted
                    to £493,343, and that some of the opium dealers in Calcutta have each no less
                    than seventeen shops where this drug only is sold.</p>
                <p>The following statistics collected by Vincent Richards regarding Balasor in
                    Orissa throw some light on the influence of this practice on the health. He
                    estimates that one in every 12 or 14 of the population use the drug, and that
                    the habit is increasing. Of the 613 opium-eaters examined by him he found that
                    the average age at which the habit was commenced was 20 to 26 years for men and
                    24 to 30 years for women. Of this number 143 had taken the drug for from 10 to
                    20 years, 62 for from 20 to 30 years, and 38 for more than 30 years. The
                    majority took their opium twice daily, morning and evening, the quantity taken
                    varying from 2 to 46 grains &lt;laι y, large doses being the exception, and the
                    average 5 to 7 grains daily. The dose, when large, had been increased from the
                    beginning; when small, there had usually been no increase at all. The causes
                    which first led to the increase of the drug were disease, example, and a belief
                    in its aphrodisiac powers. The diseases for which it was chiefly taken were
                    malarial fever, dysentery, diarrhoea, spitting of blood, rheumatism, and
                    elephantiasis. A number began to take it in the famine year, 1866, as it enabled
                    them to exist on less food and mitigated their sufferings; others used it to
                    enable them to undergo fatigue and to make long journeys. Mr Richards concludes
                    that the excessive use of opium by the agricultural classes, who are the chief
                    consumers in Orissa, is very rare indeed. Its moderate use may be and is
                    indulged in for vears without producing any decided or appreciable ill effect
                    except weakening the reproductive powers, <pb break="no"

                    opium-eaters being 1 · 11 after 11 years of married life. It compares favourably
                    as regards crime and insanity with intoxicating drinks, the inhabitants of
                    Balasor being a particularly law-abiding race, and the insane forming only
                    0’0069 per cent, of the population. Dr W. Dymock of Bombay, speaking of western
                    India, concurs in Mr Richards’s opinion regarding the moderate use of the drug.
                    He believes that excessive indulgence in it is confined to a comparatively small
                    number of the wealthier classes of the community. Dr Moore’s experience of
                    Rajputana strongly supports the same views. It seems probable that violent
                    physical exercise may counteract in great measure the deleterious effect of
                    opium and prevent it from retarding the respiration, and that in such cases the
                    beneficial effects are obtained without the noxious results which would accrue
                    from its use to those engaged in sedentary pursuits. There is no doubt that the
                    spread of the practice is connected with the ban imposed in Mohammedan countries
                    on the use of alcoholic beverages, and to some extent with the long religious
                    fasts of the Buddhists, Hindus, and Moslems, in which opium is used to allay
                    hunger.</p>
                <p>To break off the habit of opium-eating is exceedingly difficult, and can be
                    effected only by actual external restraint, or the strongest effort of a
                    powerful will, especially if the dose has been gradually increased. Various
                    remedies have been proposed to support the system while the habit is being
                    dropped, the most recent of which are coca and strychnia.</p>
                <p>The habit is not confined to India, Persia, and Turkey, but is unfortunately
                    practised in other forms in Western countries. In a few districts of England
                    more opium is consumed than in the rest of the United Kingdom, and in the United
                    States it is calculated that the number of opium-eaters is 82,696, and the
                    average amount of opium consumed by each opium-eater in the State of Michigan is
                    estimated at 1 oz. avoirdupois peι ’ week. Advanced opium-eaters also use in
                    addition chloral and chloroform or ether. Of late years also the practice of
                    using hypodermic injections of morphia has been followed as a luxury by many who
                    have first experienced the speedy relief from pain obtained by its use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Opium-smoking.—</hi> This is chiefly practised by the
                    inhabitants of China and the islands of the Indian Archipelago, and in the
                    countries where Chinese labour is largely employed. It is said to have commenced
                    in China forty or fifty years before the English began to import opium into that
                    country. In 1858 it was estimated that about 2,000,000 of Chinese smoked opium,
                    and in 1878 from onefourth to three-tenths of the entire population of
                    400,000,000.</p>
                <p>For smoking the Chinese use an extract of opium, the privilege of preparing and
                    the exclusive right to deal in which is let to the highest bidder by the
                    Government for a fixed term of years. The present holder of the monopoly in
                    Hong-Kong pays 205,000 dollars annually. The same arrangement is in vogue in
                    Singapore, French Cochin China, and Macao. The process of preparation is thus
                    described by Mr Hugh M ’ Callum, Government analyst at HongKong :—</p>
                <p>“The opium is removed from its covering of leaves, &amp;c., moistened with a
                    little water, and allowed to stand for about fourteen hours; it is then divided
                    into pans, 2⅛ balls of opium and about 10 pints of water going to each pan; it
                    is now boiled and stirred occasionally until a uniform mixture having the
                    consistence of a thin paste is obtained. This operation takes from five to six
                    hours. The paste is at once transferred to a larger pan and cold water added to
                    about 3 gallons, covered, and allowed to stand for from fourteen to fifteen
                    hours. A bunch of ‘ tang suin ’ (lamp-wick, the pith of some plant) is then
                    inserted well into the mass, and the pan slightly canted, when a rich, clear,
                    brown fluid is thus drawn off, and Altered through ‘chi mui’ (paper made from
                    bamboo fibre). The residue is removed to a calico filter and thoroughly washed
                    with boiling water, the wash water being reboiled and used time after time. The
                    last washing is done with pure water; these washings are used in the next day’s
                    boiling.</p>
                <p>“The residues on the calico filters are transferred to a large one of the same
                    material and well pressed. This insoluble residue, called ‘nai chai ’ (opium
                    dirt), is the perquisite of the head boiling coolie, who finds a ready market
                    for it in Canton, where it is used for adulterating, or rather in manufacturing,
                    the moist inferior kinds of prepared opium. The filtrate or opium solution is
                    concentrated by evaporation at the boiling point, with occasional s <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> tirring until of a proper consistence, the time
                    required being from three to four hours; it is then removed from the fire and
                    stirred with great vigour till cold, the cooling being accelerated by coolies
                    with large fans. When quite cold it is taken to the hong and kept there for some
                    months before it is considered in prime condition for smoking. As thus prepared
                    it has the consistence of a thin treacly extract, and is called boiled or
                    prepared opium. In this state it is largely exported from China to America,
                    Australia, &amp;c., being carefully sealed up in small pots having the name of
                    the maker (i.e., hong) on each.</p>
                <p>“The Chinese recognize the following grades of opium(1) ‘raw opium,’ as imported
                    from India; (2) ‘ prepared opium,’ opium made as above; (3) ‘ opium dross,’ the
                    scrapings from the opium pipe; this is reboiled and manufactured as a
                    second-class prepared opium; a Chinese doctor stated lately at a coroner’s
                    inquest on a case of poisoning that it was more poisonous than the ordinary
                    prepared opium; (4) ‘ nai chai ’ (opium dirt), the insoluble residue left on
                    exhausting the raw opium thoroughly with water. The opium is sent every day from
                    the hong (i.e., shop or firm) to the boiling-house, the previous day’s boiling
                    being then returned to the hong. The average quantity boiled each day is from
                    six to eight chests of Patna opium, this being the only kind used.”</p>
                <p>By this process of preparation a considerable portion of the narcotin,
                    caoutchouc, resin, oil, or fatty and insoluble matters are removed, and the
                    prolonged boiling, evaporating, and baking over a naked fire tend to lessen the
                    amount of alkaloids present in the extract. The only alkaloids likely to remain
                    in the prepared opium, and capable of producing well-marked physiological
                    results, are morphia, codeia, and narceia. Morphia, in the pure state, can be
                    sublimed, but codeia and narceia are said not to give a sublimate. Even if
                    sublimed in smoking opium, morphia would, in Μ‘Callum’s opinion, probably be
                    deposited in the pipe before it reached the mouth of the smoker. The bitter
                    taste of morphia is not noticeable when smoking opium, and it is therefore
                    possible that the pleasure derived from smoking the drug is due to some product
                    formed during combustion. This supposition is rendered probable by the fact that
                    the opiums most prized by smokers are not those containing most morphia, and
                    that the quality is judged by the amount of soluble matter in the opium, by its
                    tenacity or “touch,” and by peculiarities of aroma,—the Indian opium, especially
                    the Patna kind, bearing much the same relation to the Chinese and Persian drug
                    that champagne does to vin ordinaire. Opium-smoking is thus described by Mr
                    Theo. Sampson of Canton :—</p>
                <p>“The smoker, lying on his side, with his face towards the tray and his head
                    resting on a high hard pillow (sometimes made of earthenware, but more
                    frequently of bamboo covered with leather), takes the pipe in his hand; with the
                    other hand he takes a dipper and puts the <hi rend="italic">sharp</hi> end of it
                    into the opium, which is of a treacly consistency. Twisting it round and round
                    he gets a large drop of the fluid to adhere to the dipper; still twisting it
                    round to prevent it falling he brings the drop over the flame of the lamp, and
                    twirling it round and round he roasts it; all this is done with acquired
                    dexterity. The opium must not be burnt or made too dry, but roasted gently till
                    it looks like burnt worsted; every now and then he takes it away from the flame
                    and rolls it (still on the end of the dipper) on the flat surface of the. bowl.
                    When it is roasted and rolled to his satisfaction he gently heats the centre of
                    the bowl, where there is a small orifice; then he quickly thrusts the end of the
                    dipper into the orifice, twirls it round smartly, and withdraws it; if this is
                    properly done, the opium (now about the size of a grain of hempseed or a little
                    larger) is left adhering to the bowl immediately over the orifice. It is now
                    ready for smoking.</p>
                <p>“The smoker assumes a comfortable attitude (lying down of course) at a proper
                    distance from the lamp. He now puts the stem to his lips, and holds the bowl
                    over the lamp. The heat causes the opium to frizzle, and the smoker takes three
                    or four long inhalations, all the time using the dipper to bring every particle
                    of the opium to the orifice as it burns away, but not taking his lips from the
                    end of the stem, or the opium pellet from the lamp till all is finished. Then he
                    uses the flattened end of the dipper to scrape away any little residue there may
                    be left around the orifice, and proceeds to prepare another pipe. The
                    preparations occupy from five to ten minutes, and the actual smoking about
                    thirty seconds. The smoke is swallowed, and is exhaled through both the mouth
                    and the nose.”</p>
                <p>Large quantities of morphia are exported to China from Europe for the purpose of
                    preparing the so-called “cure for opium-smoking,” which consists of one-third of
                    a grain of hydrochlorate of morphia mixed with a little powdered rice. The
                    powders are taken at gradually increasing intervals, until the morphia is left
                    off altogether.</p>
                <p>Mr. Allen Williams, in a work recently published, states that there are now
                    nearly a million persons in the United States who indulge in opium-smoking, and
                    the habit seems to be on the increase in New York and other eastern cities, as
                    well as in the west. The records of the National Bureau of Statistics show that,
                    while the number of the Chinese in the United States has remained nearly
                    stationary since 1876, the amount of opium imported has increased from 189,354
                    lb of the crude and 49,375 lb of the prepared drug in 1872 to 243,211 lb of the
                    former and 77,196 lb of the latter in 1880. Of the crude opium a certain
                    quantity appears to be re-exported to the West Indies; the larger proportion of
                    the prepared drug is used in San Francisco.</p>
                <p>So far as can be gathered from the conflicting statements published on the
                    subject, opium-smoking may be regarded much in the same light as the use of
                    alcoholic stimulants. To the great majority of smokers who use it moderately it
                    appears to act as a stimulant, and to enable them to undergo great fatigue and
                    to go for a considerable time with little or no food. According to the reports
                    given by authorities on the subject, when the smoker has plenty of active work
                    it appears to be no more injurious than smoking tobacco. When carried to excess
                    it becomes an inveterate habit; but this happens chiefly in individuals of weak
                    will-power, who would just as easily become the victims of intoxicating drinks,
                    and who are practically moral imbeciles, often addicted also to other forms of
                    depravity. The effect in bad cases is to cause loss of appetite, a leaden pallor
                    of the skin, and a degree of leanness so excessive as to make its victims appear
                    like living skeletons. All inclination for exertion becomes gradually lost,
                    business is neglected, and certain ruin to the smoker follows. There can be no
                    doubt that the use of the drug is opposed by all thinking Chinese who are not
                    pecuniarily interested in the opium trade or cultivation, for several reasons,
                    among which may be mentioned the drain of bullion from the country, the decrease
                    of population, the liability to famine through the cultivation of opium where
                    cereals should be grown, and the corruption of state officials.</p>
