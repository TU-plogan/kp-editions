                    embouchure determines the rapidity of their vibration, on which, concurrently
                    with the length of the tube, depends the pitch, or relative position, of the
                    sound produced.</p>
                <p>The name “ophicleide” is compounded of two Greek words, oφις, serpent, and <hi
                    rend="italic">κλείδες,</hi> keys,—the instrument owing, in fact, its origin to
                    the application of keys to the serpent, a wind instrument the invention of which
                    is generally attributed to Edme Guillaume, canon of Auxerre, somewhere about
                    1590. He contrived it to serve as a bass to the zinken, instruments now entirely
                    obsolete.</p>
                <p>The serpent, represented by fig. 1, is composed of two pieces of wood, hollowed
                    out and cut to the desired contour. They are joined together by gluing so as to
                    form a tube, and are bound with leather to ensure solidity. The upper extremity
                    ends with a bent brass tube or crook, to which the mouthpiece is applied. The
                    tube is pierced laterally with six holes, the first three of which are covered
                    by three fingers of the right hand, and the others by the corresponding fingers
                    of the left hand. When all the holes are thus closed the instrument will produce
                    the following sounds, of which the first is fundamental and the rest are
                    harmonics :—</p>
                <p>The instrumentalist fills up the gaps in the diatonic or natural scale by the
                    successive opening of the lateral holes after the manner practised in fingering
                    the flute. The serpent remained in its primitive form for nearly two centuries,
                    and then only it was attempted to improve it by adding keys. From the time of
                    its origin it had served principally as an accompaniment to the liturgical
                    chanting, but towards the middle of the 18th century it began to be employed as
                    a bass for military music, and, notwithstanding its numerous imperfections, it
                    was but slowly given up.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 represents a curious serpent made, about 1830, by L. Embach and Co.,
                    Amsterdam. The six lateral holes are here placed more rationally along the tube,
                    but, being beyond the reach of the fingers, they are covered by open keys,
                    besides which the instrument also bears six closed keys for the following tones
                    :—</p>
                <p>The primitive form of the serpent was most inconvenient, and it was a musician
                    named Régibo, belonging to the orchestra of the church of St Pierre at Lille,
                    who, about 1780, first thought of giving it the shape of a bassoon (Gerber, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">der Tonkünstler,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1790). The merit of this innovation was rapidly recognized in England and
                    Germany. Still to follow Gerber <hi rend="italic">(Lexicon,</hi> 1812), one
                    Frichot, who was established in London, published in 1800 a description of an
                    instrument, entirely of brass, manufactured by J. Astor, which he claimed as his
                    invention, calling it the basshorn, but which was no other in principle than the
                    new serpent of Régibo. It only made its way to France and Belgium after the
                    passage of the allied armies in 1815. We here reproduce (fig. 3) the drawing of
                    a wooden serpent with bell and mouthpiece of brass, after a scale published by
                    B. Schott of Mainz, in 1816. The English brass basshorn was designated on the
                    Continent the English or the Russian basshorn, the “serpent anglais,” or the
                    “basson russe.” Under this last name all instruments of the form, whether of
                    wood or brass, were later on confounded in France and Belgium. The “basson
                    russe” remained in great vogue until the appearance of the ophicleide, to
                    disappear with it in the complete revolution brought about by the invention of
                    pistons.</p>
                <p>The invention of the ophicleide is generally but falsely attributed to Alexandre
                    Frichot, a professor of music at Lisieux, department of Calvados, France. The
                    instrument, which the inventor called “basse-trompette,” was approved of as
                    early as 13th November 1806 by a commission composed of professors of the Paris
                    Conservatoire, but the patent bears the date 31st December 1810. The
                    “basse-trompette,” which Frichot in his specification had at first, in imitation
                    of the English basshorn, called “basse cor,” was, like the English instrument,
                    entirely of brass, and had, like it, six holes; it only differed in a more
                    favourable disposition brought about by the curvings of the tube, and by the
                    application of four crooks which permitted the instrument to be tuned “in C low
                    pitch and C high pitch for military bands, in C⅛ for churches, and in D for
                    concert use.” The close relationship between the two instruments suggests the
                    question whether this was the Frichot who worked with Astor in London in
                    1800.</p>
                <p>The first idea of adding keys to instruments with cupped mouthpieces, unprovided
                    with lateral holes, with the aim of filling up some of the gaps between the
                    notes of the harmonic scale, goes back, according to Gerber <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lexicon</hi> of 1790), to Kölbel, a hornplayer in the Russian imperial band
                    about 1754. Weidinger, trumpeter in the Austrian imperial band, improved upon
                    this first attempt, and applied it in 1800 to the trumpet. But the honour
                    belongs to Joseph Halliday, bandmaster of the Cavan militia, of being the first
                    to conceive, in 1810, the disposition of a certain number of keys along the
                    tube, setting out from its lower extremity, with the idea of producing by their
                    successive or simultaneous opening a chromatic scale throughout the extent of
                    the instrument. The buglehorn was the object of his reform; the only scale of
                    which, he says, in the preamble of his patent, “until my invention contained but
                    five tones, viz., </p>
                <p>My improvements on that instrument are five keys, to be used by the performer
                    according to the annexed scale, which, with its five original notes, render it
                    capable of producing twenty-five separate tones in regular progression.” Fig. 4
                    represents the keyed bugle of Joseph Hallidav.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0842-0779"/>
                <p>It was not until 1815 that the use of the new instrument spread upon the
                    Continent. We find in the account-books of a Belgian maker, Tuerlinckx of
                    Mechlin, that his first supply of a bugle-horn bears the date of 25 th March
                    1815, and it was made “aen den Heer Muldener, lieutenant in het régiment duc
                    d’York.”</p>
                <p>The acoustic principle inaugurated by Halliday consisted in binding together by
                    chromatic degrees the second and third harmonics, to</p>
                <p>He attained it, as we have just seen, by the help of five keys. The principle
                    once discovered, it became easy to extend it to instruments of the largest size,
                    of which the compass, like the “basson russe,” began at the lowest sound. It was
                    simply necessary to bind the fundamental to the next harmonic sound by a larger
                    number of keys. This was done in 1817 by Jean Hilaire Asté, known as Halary, a
                    professor of music and instrument-maker at Paris. We find the description of the
                    instruments for which he sought a patent in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rapport</hi><hi rend="italic">de·</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Académie Royale</hi><hi rend="italic">des Beaux-Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l'institut de France,</hi> meeting of 19th July 1817. These instruments were
                    three in number :—(1) the clavi-tube, a keyed trumpet;</p>
                <p>(2) the quinti-tube, or quinti-clave; (3) the ophicleide, a keyed serpent. The
                    clavi-tube was no other than the bugle-horn slightly modified in some details of
                    construction, and reproduced in the different tonalities Ah, F, Eh, D, C, Bh, A,
                    and Ah. The quinti-tube had nearly the form of a bassoon, and was, in the first
                    instance, armed with eight keys, and constructed in two tonalities, F and Eh.
                    This was the instrument afterwards named “alto ophicleide.” The ophicleide, of
                    which we reproduce a drawing (fig. 5), had the same form as the quinti-tube. It
                    was at first adjusted with nine or ten keys, and the number was carried on to
                    twelve,—each key to give a semitone (additional patent of 16th August 1822). The
                    ophicleide or bass of the harmony was made in C and in Bh, the contra-bass in F
                    and in Eh. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The report
                    of the Académie des Beaux-Arts on the subject of this invention shows a strange
                    misconception of it, which it is interesting to recall. “As to the two
                    instruments which Μ. Halary designs under the names of ‘ quinti-clave ’ and ‘
                    ophicleide,’ they bear a great resemblance to those submitted to the Academy in
                    the sitting of the 11th of March 1811 by Μ. Dumas, which he designed under the
                    names of ‘ basse et contrebasse guerrières. ’ . . . The opinion of our
                    commission on the quinti-clave and ophicleide is that Μ. Halary can only claim
                    the merit of an improvement and not that of an entire invention; still, for an
                    equitable judgment on this point, we should compare the one with the other, and
                    this our commission cannot do, not having the instruments of Μ. Dumas at our
                    disposal.” This is what the commission ought to have had, but it would have
                    sufficed had they referred to the report of the sittings of 6th and 8th April,
                    in which it is clearly explained that the instruments presented by Μ. Du.nas
                    were bass clarinets <hi rend="italic">{Moniteur Universel</hi> of 19th April
                    1811).</p></note></p>
                <p>It is certain that from the point of view of invention Halary’s labours had only
                    secondary importance; but, if the principle of keyed chromatic instruments with
                    cupped mouthpiece <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We
                    designedly omit the employment of the word “brass” to qualify these instruments.
                    The substance which determines the form of a column of air is demonstrably

                    the sides of the tubes are equally elastic and rigid.</p></note> goes back to
                    Halliday, it was Halary’s merit to know how to take advantage of the principle
                    in extending it to instnιments of diverse tonalities, in grouping them in one
                    single family, that of the bugles, in so complete a manner that the improvements
                    of modern manufacture have not widened its limits either in the grave or the
                    acute direction. Keyed chromatic wind instruments made their way rapidly; to
                    their introduction into military full or brass bands we can date the
                    regeneration of military music. After pistons had been invented some forty
                    years, instruments with keys could still reckon their partisans.</p>
                <p>Now these have utterly disappeared and pistons or rotary cylinders remain
                    absolute masters of the situation.</p>
                <p>The invention of the piston is due to Stoelzel, a Silesian, and Bliimel of
                    Waldenburg (patent of 12th April 1818). It was first signalized by G. B. Bierey,
                    leader of the National Theatre of Breslau, in No. 18 of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</hi> (Leipsic, 1815). The inventors first
                    applied their discovery to the horn, trumpet, and trombone, and this application
                    consisted of only two pistons, or “ventile,” as they called them. We have seen
                    up to this point that chromatic intervals were produced in instruments with
                    cupped mouthpiece by shortenings of the tube by means of lateral openings. It is
                    evident that a column of air so cut off must be very inferior in sonorousness to
                    one vibrating from the mouthpiece to the extremity of the bell; this has been
                    the capital defect of keyed instruments. Stoelzel and Bliimel proceeded in
                    contrary fashion: they produced chromatic intervals by lengthening the tube,
                    just as in the trombone with slides. They introduced contrivances the movement
                    of which permitted an instantaneous communication between the principal tube and
                    two additional tubes, lowering the instrument respectively a tone and a
                    half-tone, or by their simultaneous employment one tone and a half. As these
                    combinations did not suffice to produce a complete chromatic scale, a third
                    piston with an additional tube of a tone and a half was soon afterwards added by
                    the inventors.</p>
                <p>Suppose an instrument giving without pistons the harmonics by the employment of
                    the second piston those sounds become by the first, by the third, or union of
                    the first and second, by the union of the second and third, by the union of the
                    first and third,</p>
                <p>Here is the whole theory of the fingering of these instruments <hi rend="italic"
                    >à</hi><hi rend="italic">pistons,</hi> of which the compass downwards is only
                    bounded by the first harmonic.</p>
                <p>A serious defect exists, however, in these piston instruments,—the want of truth
                    of intonation whenever a note is produced by more than one piston. Let us take,
                    for example, the low G . This note is produced, as we have just seen, by the
                    union of the first and third pistons; in employing the first piston the pitch of
                    the instrument is lowered a major second, and to produce the lowering to a
                    fourth (two tones and a half) a further lowering of a minor third (one tone and
                    a half) is necessary. Now the additional pipe to produce this lowering from C is
                    necessarily proportionately shorter than what is required for a pipe already
                    lowered a tone by the employment of the first piston. It therefore results, as
                    will be seen from this special case, that all notes produced by several pistons
                    at one time are too high in pitch.</p>
                <p>The invention of Stoelzel and Bliimel, like all new ideas, was not accepted
                    without opposition; notwithstanding its crushing superiority it had a lively
                    struggle to sustain, and it is only within the last thirty years that the system
                    of keys has been <pb break="no"
