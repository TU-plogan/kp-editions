                    government of central Russia, bounded by Smolensk, Kaluga, and Tula on the N.,
                    and by Voronezh, Kursk, and Tchernigoff on the S., with an area of 18,040 square
                    miles. The surface is an undulating plateau gently sloping towards the west; the
                    highest hills do not reach 900 feet, and none of the valleys are less than 450
                    feet above the sea. Geologically Orel consists principally of Lower Devonian
                    limestones, marls, and sandstones, covered with Jurassic clays, the last
                    appearing at the surface, however, only as isolated islands, or in the valleys,
                    being concealed for the most part under thick beds of cretaceous chalk, marls,
                    and sands. The Carboniferous limestones and clays (of the so-called Moscow
                    basin) appear in the north-west only at a great depth. The Jurassic clays and
                    marls are covered at several places with a stratum of clay containing good
                    iron-ore, while the Devonian sandstones and limestones are worked for building
                    purposes. The whole is buried under a bed, from 30 to 40 feet thick, of
                    boulder-clay and loess, the last covering extensive areas besides the valleys.
                    The soil—a mixture of “black earth” with clay—is fertile, except in the Desna
                    region, which is covered with sands and tough clays. The principal rivers are
                    the Don, which forms the eastern boundary of the government and has
                    many.tributaries, the chief being the Sosna; the Oka, which rises in the
                    district of Orel and receives the navigable Zusha and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0891-0826"/> many smaller streams; and the Desna, with the
                    Bolva, draining the marshy lowlands in the west. On the Oka, Zusha, Desna, and
                    Bolva there is a brisk traffic in corn, oil, hemp, timber, metal, glass, china,
                    paper, and buildingstone. Marshes occupy large areas in the basin of the Desna,
                    as also in several parts of that of the Oka; they are mostly covered with
                    forests, which occupy from 50 to 65 per cent, of the districts of Bryansk,
                    Trubtchevsk, and Karatcheff, while towards the east, in the basin of the Don,
                    wood is so scarce that straw is used for fuel. The climate is moderate, the
                    average yearly temperature at Orel being 41 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 2
                    (14 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 8 in January and 67° ’ 0 in July).</p>
                <p>The population, 1,596,900 in 1870, and 1,877,100 in 1881, consists almost
                    exclusively of Great Russians belonging to the Greek Church; the Nonconformists
                    are reckoned at about 12,000, the Catholics at 3000, and the Jews at 1000. The
                    chief occupation is agriculture, which is most productive in the east and
                    towards the centre of the government. In 1877 59 per cent, of the province was
                    under crops, the estimated yield being 7,196,000 quarters of corn and 1,212,000
                    quarters of potatoes. Of the grain not used in the distilleries a large
                    proportion is exported to the Baltic. Hemp and hemp-seed oil are extensively
                    exported from the west to Riga, Libau, and St Petersburg. Tobacco is also
                    cultivated with profit. Cattle-breeding and horse-breeding, though somewhat
                    depressed within the last twenty years, are still in a better condition than in
                    neighbouring governments,—the Orel breeds, both of carriage and of cart horses,
                    being held in estimation throughout Russia. In 1881 there were 500,000 horses,
                    340,000 cattle, and 790,000 sheep. Bee-culture is widely diffused in the forest
                    districts, as are also the timber-trade and the preparation of tar and pitch.
                    Manufactures are rapidly increasing; in 1879 there were 540 larger industrial
                    establishments, employing 14,130 hands, and producing castiron rails, machinery,
                    locomotive engines and railway waggons, glass, hemp-yarn and ropes, leather,
                    timber, soap, tobacco, chemical produce, &amp;c. There are also distilleries and
                    a great many smaller oil-works and flour-mills. Karatcheff and Syevsk are
                    important centres for hemp-carding; Bolkhoff and Elets are the chief centres of
                    the tanning industry; while the districts of Elets, Dmitroff, and partly Mtsensk
                    supply flour and various food-pastes. At Bryansk a Government cannon-foundry
                    employs 700 hands. The so-called “MaltsofFs works” in the district of Bryansk
                    are worthy of mention as an industrial colony comprising several iron,
                    machinery, glass, and rope works, where thousands of peasants find temporary or
                    permanent employment; they have their own technical school, employ engineers of
                    their own training, and have their own narrowgauge railways and telegraphs, both
                    managed by boys of the technical school. Numerous petty trades are carried on by
                    peasants, along with agriculture. The fairs held in many villages are animated,
                    and have some importance for the cattle trade. Orel is divided into twelve
                    districts, the chief towns of which are Orel (76,700 inhabitants), Bolkhoff
                    (29,020), Bryansk (12,660), Dmitrovsk (6560), Elets (41,450), Karatcheff
                    (11,200), Kromy (3050), Livny (21,170), Maloarklιanghelsk (3920), Mtsensk
                    (14,200), Syevsk (9650), and Trubtchevsk (5170).</p>
                <p>In the 9th century the country was inhabited by the Syeveryanes on the Desna and
                    the Vyatichees on the Oka, who both paid tribute to the Khazars. The Syeveryanes
                    recognized the rule of the princes of the Rurik family from 884, and the
                    Vyatichees from the middle of the 10th century; but the two peoples followed
                    different historical lines, the former entering into the Suzdal principality,
                    while the latter fell under the rule of that of Tchernigofl'. In the 11th
                    century both had wealthy towns and villages; during the Tartar invasion these
                    were all burned and pillaged, and the whole territory, lying as it did on the
                    two chief lines of the Tartar advance, became a desert, where the Nogays
                    encamped with their herds. With the fall of the Great Horde the western part of
                    the country fell under Lithuanian rule and was the subject of repeated struggles
                    between Lithuania and Moscow. In the 16th century the Russians began to erect
                    new forts or to fortify the old towns, and the territory was rapidly colonized
                    by immigrants from the north. In 1610 the towns of the present government of
                    Orel (then known as the Ukrayna or “border-region”) had an active share in the
                    insurrection against Moscow under the pseudo-Demetrius, and suffered much from
                    the civil war which ensued. They continued, however, to be united with the rest
                    of Russia, and in the next century formed a basis for further Russian advance
                    towards the south.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Orel,</hi> capital of the above government, lies at the
                    confluence of the Oka with the Orlik, on the great line of railway to the
                    Crimea, 238 miles south-south-west from Moscow. It has railway connexion also
                    with Smolensk and the Baltic ports in the west, and with Saratofl*, Tsaritsyn,
                    and Novotcherkassk in the south-east. It was founded in 1566, but developed
                    slowly, and had only a very few houses at the beginning of the last century. The
                    cathedral, begun in 1794, was finished only in 1861. The town now possesses a
                    military gymnasium (corps of cadets), a few secondary schools, a public library,
                    and a theatre; large storehouses for grain and timber, a spacious <hi
                    rend="italic">gostinoy dvor</hi> with numerous shops, and the offices of the
                    municipal bank are perhaps its best buildings. The manufactures are rapidly
                    increasing; in 1879 the hemp-carding, hempspinning, and rope-making industries
                    produced 1,020,000 roubles, the flour-mills about 300,000 roubles, and the
                    aggregate from all the manufactures exceeded 2,000,000 roubles. Orel is one of
                    the chief markets of central Russia for the trade in corn and hemp, as also in
                    hempseed oil and tallow, which are shipped down the Oka or sent by rail. Metal
                    wares, tobacco, kaolin, and glass ware are also exported, while salt, groceries,
                    and manufactured goods are imported for distribution throughout the villages of
                    the government, or to be sent to the Don Cossacks. The population, 45,000 in
                    1875, was 76,700 in 1881.</p>
