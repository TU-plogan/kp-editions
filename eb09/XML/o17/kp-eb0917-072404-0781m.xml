                    long., on the southern shore of a semicircular bay, at the north-western angle
                    of the Black Sea, and is 933 miles distant from Moscow and 403 miles from Kieff.
                    Odessa is the proper seaport for the basins of two great rivers of Russia, the
                    Dnieper, with its tributary the Bug, and the Dniester; the entrances to the
                    mouths of both these offering many difficulties for navigation, trade has froin

                    rivers. The <hi rend="italic">limans</hi> or lagoons of Haji-bey and Kuyalnik,
                    which penetrate far inland from the neighbourhood of Odessa, are separated from
                    the sea by flat sandy isthmuses. The bay of Odessa, which has an area of 14
                    square miles and a depth of 30 feet, with a soft bottom, is a dangerous
                    anchorage on account of its exposure to easterly winds. The ships lie,
                    therefore, in two harbours, both protected by moles,—the “quarantine harbour,”
                    from 4 to 21 feet deep, and the so-called “practical harbour,” for coasting
                    vessels, with a maximum depth of 11 feet. A new one, 1100 yards long and 660
                    yards wide, was constructed a few years ago. The harbours freeze for a few days
                    in winter, as also does the bay itself occasionally, navigation being
                    interrupted every year for an average of sixteen days. Odessa experiences the
                    influence of the continental climate of the neighbouring steppes; its winters
                    are cold (the average temperature for January being 23 <hi rend="superscript">
                    0-</hi> 2, and the isotherm for the entire season that of Königsberg), its
                    summers are hot (72° *8 in July), and the yearly average temperature is 48 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5. The rainfall is scanty (ninety-two rainy days,
                    with 14 inches of rain per annum); and one of the plagues of the city is the
                    chalky dust, which is raised in clouds by the strong winds to which it is
                    exposed. The city is built on a terrace from 100 to 150 feet in height, which
                    descends by steep crags to the sea, and on the other side is continuous with the
                    level of the steppe, which is covered with a layer of “black earth”; the subsoil
                    consists of clay, gravel, and a soft Tertiary sandstone, which is used for
                    building, but readily disintegrates under atmospheric agencies. Catacombs whence
                    this sandstone has been taken extend underneath the town and the suburbs, not
                    without some danger to the buildings. The water-supply is inadequate.
                    Drinking-water was formerly shipped from the Crimea, and the poorer classes had
                    to supply themselves from cisterns and bad wells. An aqueduct, 27 miles long,
                    now brings water from Mayaki on the Dniester.</p>
                <p>The general aspect of Odessa is that of a wealthy west-</p>
                <p>European city. Its chief embankment, bordered with tall and handsome houses,
                    forms a fine promenade; a superb flight of steps descends to the sea from its
                    central square, which is adorned with a statue of Richelieu. The central parts
                    of the city have broad streets and squares, bordered with fine buildings and
                    mansions in the Italian style, and with good shops. But even on the best streets
                    poor houses surrounded with open yards occur side by side with richly-decorated
                    palaces; and in close association with elegant carriages and rich dresses one
                    sees the open car of the peasant and the dirty dress of the Jew or the
                    Bulgarian. The cathedral, finished in 1849, can accommodate 5000 persons; it
                    contains the tomb of Count Worontzoff, a former governor-general, who
                    contributed much towards the development and embellishment of the city. The
                    “Palais Royal,” with its parterre and fountains, and the spacious public park
                    are fine pleasure-grounds, whilst in the ravines that descend to the sea the
                    dirty houses of the poorer classes are massed. The shore is occupied by immense
                    granaries, some of which look like palaces, and large storehouses take up a
                    broad space in the west of the city. Odessa, which has a circumference of 6
                    miles, consists of the city proper, containing the old fort (now a quarantine
                    establishment) and surrounded by a boulevard, where was formerly a wall marking
                    the limits of the free port, of the suburbs Novaya and Peresyp, extending
                    northward along the lower shore of the bay, and of Moldavanka to the south-west.
                    A number of villas and cottages surround the city; the German colonies
                    Liebenthal and Lustdorf are bathing-places.</p>
                <p>Odessa is the real capital, intellectual and commercial, of the so-called
                    Novorossia, which includes the governments of Bessarabia and Kherson. In the
                    official subdivision of Russia it is only the chief town of the district of the
                    same name in the government of Kherson. It constitutes at the same time an
                    independent “municipal district” or captaincy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gradonacTtalstvo),</hi> which covers 182 square miles and includes a dozen
                    villages, some of which have from 2000 to 3000 inhabitants. Odessa, like St
                    Petersburg and Moscow, received in 1863 a new municipal constitution, with an
                    elective mayor, municipal assembly, and executive council. It is also the chief
                    town of the Nbvorossian educational district, and has a university, which
                    replaced Richelieu Lyceum in 1865, and now has about 400 students. The young
                    scientific society at the university is very active in investigating the natural
                    history of southern Russia and of the Black Sea, and has already published some
                    valuable <hi rend="italic">Transactions.</hi> There are also an historical
                    society with a museum containing rich collections from the Hellenic, Genoese,
                    Venetian, and Mongolo-Tatar periods of the history of the Black Sea coast, a
                    society of agriculture, a public library, and many educational institutions.</p>
                <p>The population of Odessa is rapidly increasing. In 1814, twenty years after its
                    foundation, it had 25,000 inhabitants; this figure steadily grew in succeeding
                    years, Worontzoff allowing all sorts of people, runaway serfs included, to
                    settle in the steppes of Bessarabia and Kherson, while at the same time the
                    privileges of a free port, granted in 1817 and abolished only in 1857, attracted
                    great numbers of merchants of all nationalities. In 1850 Odessa had 100,000
                    inhabitants, 185,000 in 1873, and at present (1884) the number exceeds 225,000.
                    Of these the great majority are Great Russians and Little Russians; but there
                    are also large numbers of Jews (67,000, exclusive of Karaites, against 50,000 in
                    1873), as well as of Italians, Greeks, Germans, and French (to which
                    nationalities the chief merchants belong), as also of Roumanians, Servians,
                    Bulgarians, Tatars, Armenians, Lazes, Georgians, &amp;c. These nationalities do
                    not live in perfect harmony, and the continual commercial antagonism between the
                    Greeks and the Jews often leads to scenes of disorder. A numerous floating
                    population of labourers, attracted at certain periods by pressing work in the
                    port, and. afterwards left unemployed owing to the enormous fluctuations in the
                    com trade, is one of the features of Odessa. It is estimated that there are no
                    less than 35,000 people living from hand to mouth in the utmost misery, partly
                    in the extensive labyrinth of the catacombs beneath the city.</p>
                <p>The leading occupations of the inhabitants are connected with exporting,
                    shipping, and manufactures. These latter have extended rapidly within the last
                    twenty years, but their aggregate production (in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gradonachalstvo</hi> of Odessa) does not exceed 20,000,000 roubles (about
                    £2,000,000). To this total the principal items are contributed by the steam
                    flour-mills (about £650,000 in 1879), the manufacture of tobacco (£200,000) and
                    of machinery (£200,000), after which come tanneries, soap-works, chemical-works,
                    biscuit-factories<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0783-0726"/>, rope-works, and carriage - works. The foreign
                    trade, chiefly in corn, has immensely increased of late, since Odessa was
                    brought into railway communication with central Russia. Grain was exported in
                    1880 to the amount of 1,040,400 quarters (2,445,120 quarters in 1878). This
                    figure is subject, however, to great fluctuations. The other articles of export
                    are flour, wool, tallow, hides, cattle (about 140,000 head), soap, ropes, and
                    spirits, the value of the aggregate amount of exports reaching 42,000,000
                    roubles in 1880, against 65,000,000 roubles in 1879, and 85,815,000 in 1878. The
                    chief articles of import are tea (£1,600,000 in 1881), coffee, rice, cotton,
                    tobacco, coal, oil, leather, paper, fruits, wine, and all kinds of manufactured
                    ware, for an aggregate sum of 47,775,000 roubles in 1880. Odessa also carries on
                    a brisk trade with other seaports of Russia, and, besides the 1508 ships (282
                    Russian and 650 English) engaged in foreign trade which entered the port of
                    Odessa in 1879, it was visited by 2700 coasting vessels. Odessa is in regular
                    steam communication with all the chief ports of the Black Sea and the
                    Mediterranean, as also with London. The Russian Navigation Company sends its
                    steamers by the Suez Canal to Chinese, Indian, and Russian Pacific ports, and
                    has a numerous fleet on the Dnieper, Dniester, and Bug. The commercial fleet of
                    Odessa in 1880 numbered 101 steamers (44,000 tons) and 178 sailing ships (19,800
                    tons). The total revenue of the town in 1882 was 1,938,000 roubles, and the
                    expenditure 1,883,000 roubles,—the chief items being, for charitable
                    institutions 434,000 roubles, for the army 213,000, for administration and
                    police 309,000, and for public instruction 138,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi> —The bay of Odessa was colonized by Greeks at a
                    very early period, and their ports—Istrianorum Portus and Isiacorum Portus on
                    the shores of the bay, and Odessus and the modern Skopeli at the mouth of the
                    Tiligul <hi rend="italic">liman—</hi> carried on a lively trade with the
                    neighbouring steppes. These towns disappeared in the 3d and 4th centuries,
                    leaving nothing but heaps of ruins; and for ten centuries thenceforward no
                    settlements in these tracts are mentioned. All that is known is that in the 6th
                    century the space between the mouths of the Dnieper and the Dniester was
                    occupied by the Antes, and in the 9th century by the Tivertsy, both of Slavonian
                    origin. In the 14th century this region belonged to the Lithuanians, and in 1396
                    Olgerd defeated in battle three Tatar chiefs, one of whom, Bek-Haji, had
                    recently founded, at the place now occupied by Odessa, a fort which received his
                    name. The Lithuanians, and subsequently the Poles, kept the country under their
                    dominion until the 16th century, when it λvas seized by the Tatars, who still
                    permitted, however, the Lithuanians to gather salt in the neighbouring lakes.
                    Later on the Turks left a garrison at Haji-bey, and founded in 1764 the fortress
                    Yanidunia. In 1769 the Zaporog Cossacks made a raid on Haji-bey and burned its
                    suburbs, but could not take the fort; and, after the destruction of the
                    Zaporojskaya Sech, the runaway Zaporogians settled close by Haji-bey in what is
                    now the “quarantine ravine.” In 1787 the Cossack leader Chepega again attacked
                    Haji-bey and burned all its storehouses, and two years later the Russians, under
                    the French captain De Ribas, took the fortress by assault. In 1791 Haji-bey and
                    the Otchakoff region were conceded to Russia. De Ribas and the French engineer
                    Voland were entrusted in 1794 with the erection of a town and the construction
                    of a port at Haji-bey; the former was allowed to distribute about 100,000 acres
                    of land freely to new settlers, and two years later Haji-bey, renamed Odessa,
                    had 3153 permanent inhabitants, besides the military, and was visited by 86
                    foreign vessels. In 1803 Odessa became the chief town of a separate municipal
                    district or captaincy, the first captain being the duke of Richelieu, who did
                    very much for the development of the young city and its improvement as a
                    seaport. In 1824 Odessa became the seat of the governors-general of Novorossia
                    and Bessarabia. Since that time it has steadily increased its foreign trade and
                    extended its commercial relations. Ini 866 it was brought into railway connexion
                    with Kieff and Kharkoff <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Balta, and with Jassy in
                    Roumania. (P. A. K.)</p>
