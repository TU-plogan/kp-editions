                <p><label type="entry">OEHLENSCHLÄGER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adam
                    Gottlob</hi></label> (1779-1850), the greatest of modern Danish poets, was born
                    in Vesterbro, a suburb of Copenhagen, on the 14th of November 1779. His father,
                    a Schleswiger by birth, was at that time organist to, and later on became keeper
                    of, the royal palace of Frederiksberg; he was a very brisk and cheerful man. The
                    poet’s mother, on the other hand, who was partly German by extraction, suffered
                    from depressed spirits, which afterwards deepened into melancholy madness. Adam
                    and his sister Sofia were allowed their own way throughout their childhood, and
                    were taught nothing, except to read and write, until their twelfth year. At the
                    age of nine Adam began to make fluent verses. Three years later, while walking
                    in Frederiksberg Gardens, he attracted the notice of the poet Edvard Storm, and
                    the result of the conversation was that he received a nomination to the college
                    called “Posterity’s High School,” an important institution of which Storm was
                    the principal. Storm himself taught the class of Scandinavian mythology, and
                    thus Oehlenschläger received his earliest bias towards the poetical religion of
                    his ancestors. Most other branches of study the boy continued to neglect, and
                    thought most about the romances and dramas which he proposed to write. He was
                    confirmed in 1795, and was to have been apprenticed to a tradesman in
                    Copenhagen. To his great delight there was a hitch in the preliminaries, and he
                    returned to his father’s house. He now, in his eighteenth year, suddenly took up
                    study with great zeal, but soon again abandoned his books for the stage, where a
                    small position was offered him. In 1797 he actually made his appearance on the
                    boards in several successive parts, but soon discovered that he possessed no
                    real histrionic talent, even though he was trained by the great actor Michael
                    Rosing. The brothers Oersted, the eminent savants, with whom he had formed an
                    intimacy fruitful of profit to him, persuaded him to quit the stage, and in 1800
                    he entered the university of Copenhagen as a student. He was doomed, however, to
                    disturbance in his studies, first from the death of his mother, next from his
                    inveterate tendency towards poetry, and finally from the attack of the English
                    upon Copenhagen in April 1801, which, however, inspired a dramatic sketch which
                    is the first thing of the kind by Oehlenschläger that we possess. His promise
                    was already widely felt, and, even in 1800, Baggesen, in departing for Germany,
                    had publicly invested the youth with the laurel that he himself was resigning.
                    It was in the summer of 1802, when Oehlenschläger had an old Scandinavian
                    romance, as well as a volume of lyrics, in the press, that the young Norse
                    philosopher, Henrik Steffens, came back to Copenhagen after a long vi∣it to
                    Schelling in Germany full of new romantic ideas. · His lectures at the
                    university, in which Goethe and Schiller were for the first time revealed to the
                    Danish public, created a great sensation. Steffens and Oehlenschläger met one
                    day at Dreier’s Club, and after a conversation of sixteen hours, which has
                    become famous in the history of anecdote, the latter went home, suppressed his
                    two coming volumes, and wrote at a sitting his splendid poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guldhomene,</hi> in a manner totally new to Danish literature. The result of
                    his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems,
                    published in 1803, now chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called
                    <hi rend="italic">Sanct-Hansaften-Spil.</hi> The next two years saw the
                    production of several exquisite works, in particular <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thors</hi><hi rend="italic">Reise</hi><hi rend="italic">til Jotunheim,</hi> the
                    charming poem in hexameters called <hi rend="italic">Langelandsreisen,</hi> and
                    the bewitching piece of fantasy <hi rend="italic">Aladdin’s Lampe.</hi> At the
                    age of twenty-six Oehlenschläger was now universally recognized, even by the
                    opponents of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of Denmark. He found no
                    difficulty in obtaining <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0788-0731"/> a grant for foreign travel from the Government,
                    and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens at Halle in
                    August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical tragedies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hakon Jarl,</hi> which he sent off to Copenhagen, and then
                    proceeded for the winter months to Berlin, where he associated with Humboldt,
                    Fichte, and the leading men of the day. In the spring of 1806 he went on to
                    Weimar, where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe. The
                    autumn of the same year he spent with Tieck in Dresden, and proceeded in
                    December to Paris. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous
                    masterpieces, <hi rend="italic">Baldur hin</hi><hi rend="italic">Gode,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Palnatoke</hi> (1807), and <hi rend="italic">Axel og Valborg</hi>
                    (1808). In July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and winter in
                    Switzerland as the guest of Madame de Staël-Holstein at Coppet, in the midst of
                    her famous circle of wits. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschläger went to Rome to
                    visit Thorwaldsen, and in his house wrote his tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Correggio,</hi> in German; he translated this into Danish the following year.
                    After an absence of nearly five years he hurriedly returned to Denmark in the
                    spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of aesthetics at the university of
                    Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in -law of Rahbek, to whom he had been
                    long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish predecessor
                    Evald, the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary activity
                    became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of <hi rend="italic"
                    >AU og Gulhyndi,</hi> and in 1812 the last of his great tragedies, <hi
                    rend="italic">Staerkodder.</hi> From 1814 to 1819 he, or rather his admirers,
                    were engaged in a long and angry controversy with Baggesen, who represented the
                    old didactic school. This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of
                    Oehlenschläger’s mind, and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said
                    to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called <hi
                    rend="italic">Helge,</hi> published in 1814. The tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hagbarth og Signe,</hi> 1815, showed a distinct falling-off in style. In 1817
                    he went back to Paris, and published <hi rend="italic">Hroars Saga</hi> and the
                    tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Fostbrödrene.</hi> In 1818 he was again in
                    Copenhagen, and wrote the idyll of <hi rend="italic">Den lille Hyrdedreng</hi>
                    and the Eddaic cycle called <hi rend="italic">Nordens Guder.</hi> His next
                    productions were the tragedies of <hi rend="italic">Erik og Abel</hi> (1820) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Vaeringeme</hi><hi rend="italic">i Miklagaard</hi> (1826), and
                    the epic of <hi rend="italic">Hrolf</hi><hi rend="italic">Krake</hi> (1829). It
                    was in the last-mentioned year that, being in Sweden, Oehlenschläger was
                    publicly crowned with laurel in front of the high altar in Lund cathedral by
                    Bishop Esaias Tegnér, as the “Scandinavian King of Song.” His last volumes were
                    <hi rend="italic">Tordenskjold</hi> (1833), <hi rend="italic">Dronning
                    Margrethe</hi> (1833), <hi rend="italic">Sokrates</hi> (1835), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Olaf den Heilige</hi> (1836), <hi rend="italic">Knud den Store</hi> (1838), <hi
                    rend="italic">Dina</hi> (1842), <hi rend="italic">Erik Clipping</hi> (1843), and
                    <hi rend="italic">Kiartan og Gudrun</hi> (1847), none of which, with the
                    exception, perhaps, of <hi rend="italic">Dina,</hi> can in any way be said to be
                    worthy of his early reputation. On his seventieth birthday, 14th November 1849,
                    a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king
                    of Denmark under circumstances of great pomp. Just two months later, on the 20th
                    of January 1850, he sank, conscious to the last, and was buried in the cemetery
                    of Frederiksberg.</p>
                <p>With the exception of Holberg, there has been no Danish writer who has exercised
                    so wide an influence as Oehlenschläger. His great work was to awaken in the
                    breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their
                    ancestors, and this he performed to so complete an extent that his name remains
                    to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance. He supplied his countrymen
                    with romantic tragedies at the very moment when all eyes were turned to the
                    stage, and when the old-fashioned pieces were felt to be inadequate. His plays,
                    partly, no doubt, in consequence of his own early familiarity with acting,
                    fulfilled the stage-requirements of the day, and were popular beyond all
                    expectation. Several of them still keep the stage in spite of their rhetoric.
                    The earliest are the best,—Oehlenschläger’s dramatic masterpiece being, without
                    doubt, his first tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Hakon Jarl.</hi> In his poems and
                    plays alike his style is limpid, elevated, profuse; his flight is sustained at a
                    high pitch without visible excitement.</p>
                <p>His fluent tenderness and romantic zest have been the secrets of his extreme
                    popularity. Although his inspiration came from Germany, he is not much like a
                    German poet, except when he is consciously following Goethe; his analogy is much
                    rather to be found among the English poets, his contemporaries. His mission
                    towards antiquity reminds us of Scott, but he is, as a poet, a better artist
                    than Scott; he has sometimes touches of exquisite diction and of overwrought
                    sensibility which recall Coleridge to us. In his wide ambition and profuseness
                    he possessed some characteristics of Southey, although his style has far more
                    vitality. With all his faults he was a very great writer, one of the principal
                    pioneers of the romantic movement in Europe, and he will probably not cease to
                    retain the position which he won so easily at the summit of the Scandinavian
                    Parnassus. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi> yy <hi rend="smallcaps">qj</hi></p>
