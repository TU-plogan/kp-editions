                    found throughout the greater part of the continent of America, from the United
                    States to Patagonia, the number of species being largest in the more tropical
                    parts (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marsupialia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 380). They form the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphyidae,</hi> distinguished from the other Marsupial families by their
                    equally developed hind-toes, their nailless but fully opposable hallux, and by
                    their dentition, its formula being t∣ <hi rend="italic">c⅛ pm⅜ m~,</hi> total
                    50, a number only exceeded among heterodont Mammalia by the Australian <hi
                    rend="italic">Myrmecobius</hi><hi rend="italic">fasciatus.</hi> The peculiarity
                    in the mode of succession of these teeth has been explained in the article
                    referred to, where also (p. 378) a figure of the teeth may be seen. Opossums are
                    small animals, varying from the size of a mouse to that of a large cat, with
                    long noses, ears, and tails, the latter being as a rule naked and prehensile,
                    and with their great toes so fully opposable to the other digits as to
                    constitute a functionally perfect posterior pair of “hands.” These opposable
                    great toes are without nail or claw, but their tips are expanded into broad flat
                    pads, which are no doubt of the greatest use to such a climbing animal as an
                    opossum. On the anterior limbs all the five digits are provided with long sharp
                    claws, and the pollex or thumb is but little opposable. Their numerous teeth are
                    covered with minute sharply-pointed cusps, with which to crush the insects on
                    which they feed, for the opossums seem to take in South America the place in the
                    economy of nature filled in other countries by the true <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectiυora,</hi> the hedgehogs, moles, and shrews.</p>
                <p>The family consists of two well-recognized genera only, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphys,</hi> containing all the members of the family, with the exception of
                    the Yapock, a curious animal which forms by itself the second genus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chironectes,</hi> and is distinguished from all other opossums by
                    its webbed feet, non-tuberculated soles, and peculiar coloration. Its ground
                    colour is light grey, with four or five sharply-contrasted brown bands passing
                    across its head and back, giving it a very peculiar mottled appearance. It is
                    almost wholly aquatic in its habits, living on small fish, crustaceans, and
                    other water animals; its range extends from Guatemala to southern Brazil.</p>
                <p>The other genus of opossums, <hi rend="italic">Didelphys,</hi> is an extremely
                    heterogeneous one, and has been split up into several groups, some of which
                    perhaps ought also to be recognized as genera. The first of these consists of
                    three or four large dull-coloured long-and coarse-haired species, with perfect
                    marsupial pouches, large leafy ears, and greatly-developed muscular ridges on
                    their skulls. The best known of these, and indeed of all the family, is the
                    Virginian Opossum, <hi rend="italic">Didelphys virginiana,</hi> an animal spread
                    over all temperate North America; it is extremely common, being even found
                    living in the towns, where it acts as a scavenger by night, retiring for shelter
                    by day upon the roofs of the houses or into the sewers. It produces in the
                    spring from six to sixteen young ones, which are placed by the mother in her
                    pouch immediately after birth, and remain there until able to take care of
                    themselves; the period of gestation is from fourteen to seventeen days. Another
                    very similar species is found in central and tropical South America, and is
                    known as the Crab-eating Opossum (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">cancrivora)</hi> The
                    second group, or sub-genus, named <hi rend="italic">Metachirus,</hi> contains a
                    considerable number of species found all over the tropical parts of the New
                    World. They are of medium size, with short close fur, very long, scaly, and
                    naked tails, and have less developed ridges on their skulls. They have as a rule
                    no pouches in which to carry their young, and the latter therefore commonly ride
                    on their mother’s back, holding on by winding their prehensile tails round hers.
                    The accompanying woodcut represents Lord Derby’s Opossum (Zλ <hi rend="italic"
                    >derbiand)</hi> carrying its young in this manner.</p>
                <p>The third group is <hi rend="italic">Mic&lt;mreus {Grymxomys</hi> of Burmeister),
                    differing only from <hi rend="italic">Metachirus</hi> by the comparatively
                    smaller size of its members and by certain slight differences in the shape of
                    their teeth. Its best-known species is the Murine Opossum (Z&gt;. <hi
                    rend="italic">murind),</hi> no larger than a house-mouse, of a bright-red
                    colour, which is found as far north as central Mexicq <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> and extends thence right down to the south of Brazil. The last sub-genus
                    contains three or four wonderfully shrew-like species, of very small size, with
                    short, hairy, and non-prehensile tails, not half the length of the trunk, and
                    with wholly unridged skulls. The most striking mem ber of the group is the
                    Three-striped Opossum (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">tristriatd),</hi> from Brazil,
                    which is of a reddish-grey colour, with three clearly-defined deep-black bands
                    down its back, very much as in some of the striped mice of Africa. This
                    sub-genus has been named <hi rend="italic">Hemiurus</hi> or “half-tail” by
                    Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire <hi rend="italic">{Microdelphys</hi> of Burmeister), and
                    should perhaps be allowed full generic rank.</p>
                <p>The numerous fossil remains referable to species of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphyidae</hi> are of special interest as showing some of the connecting
                    links in geographical distribution between the opossums and the Australian
                    Marsupials, now so widely and absolutely separated. They consist of the bones of
                    a considerable number of species from the Eocene and Early Miocene deposits of
                    central France, one or two Eocene species having also been found in southern
                    England These ancient opossums have been separated generically from <hi
                    rend="italic">Didelphys</hi> on account of certain differences in the relative
                    sizes of the lower premolars, but as nearly the whole of the species have been
                    formed on lower jaws only, of which some hundreds have been found, it is
                    impossible to judge how far these differences are correlated with other dental
                    or osteological characters. In the opinion of Dr Filhol, who has devoted
                    considerable attention to the subject, the fossils themselves represent two
                    genera, <hi rend="italic">Peratherium,</hi> containing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n860/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0860-0797"/> the greater part of the species, about twenty in
                    number, and <hi rend="italic">Amphi-pcratherium,</hi> with three species only.
                    All are comparatively small animals, few of them exceeding the size of a
                    rat.</p>
                <p>Besides these interesting European fossils, a certain number of Didelphian bones
                    have been found in the caves of Brazil, but these are either closely allied to
                    or identical with the species now living in the same region. (0. T.)</p>
