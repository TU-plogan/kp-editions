                <p><label type="entry">ORDEAL</label> (Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">orddl,
                    ordeel,</hi> judgment) corresponds to modern German <hi rend="italic"
                    >urtheil,</hi> but bears the special sense of the mediaeval Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Dei judicium,</hi> a miraculous decision as to the truth of an
                    accusation or claim. The word is adopted in the late Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordalium,</hi> French <hi rend="italic">ordalie.</hi> The ordeal had existed
                    for many ages before it was thus named in Europe. In principle, and often in the
                    very forms used, it belongs to ancient culture, thence flourishing up to the
                    mediaeval European and modern Asiatic levels, but dying out before modern
                    civilization. Some ordeals, which possibly represent early stages of the
                    practice, are simply magical, being processes of divination turned to legal
                    purpose. Thus in Burmah suits are still determined by plaintiff and defendant
                    being each furnished with a candle, equal in size and both lighted at once,—he
                    whose candle outlasts the other being adjudged, amid the acclamations of his
                    friends, to have won his cause (Shway Yoe, <hi rend="italic">The Burman,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 254). Even quainter is a Dyak ordeal in Borneo, where the two
                    parties are represented by two shell-fish on a plate, which are irritated by
                    pouring on some lime-juice, and the one first moving settles the guilt or
                    innocence (as has been before arranged) of its owner (St John, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forests of the Far East,</hi> vol. i. p. 89). The administration of ordeals has
                    been much in the hands of priests, and they are more often than not worked on a
                    theological basis, the intervention of a deity being invoked and assumed to take
                    place even when the process is in its nature one of symbolic magic. For
                    instance, an ancient divining instrument consisted of a sieve held suspended' by
                    a thread or by a pair of shears with the points stuck into its rim, and
                    considered to move at the mention of the name to be discovered, &lt;fcc. Thus
                    girls consulted the “sieve-witch” <hi rend="italic">(κoσκιv0μa.vτις')</hi> about
                    lovers (Theocr., <hi rend="italic">Idyll.,</hi> iii. 31). This <hi rend="italic"
                    >cosdnomancy</hi> served in the same way to discover a thief, when, with prayer
                    to the gods for direction, the names of the suspected persons were called over
                    tσ-it (Potter, <hi rend="italic">Greek Antiquities,</hi> vol. i. p. 352). When a
                    suspended hatchet was used in the same way to turn to the guilty, the process
                    was called <hi rend="italic">axinomancy.</hi> The sieve-ordeal<pb break="no"

                    description and picture in Cornelius Agrippa, <hi rend="italic">De Occ.
                    PhU.)∙,</hi> it is mentioned in Hudibras (ii. 3):</p>
                <p>“ . . . th’ oracle of sieve and shears That turns as certain as the spheres.”
                    From this ancient ordeal is evidently derived the modern Christian form of the
                    key and Bible, where a Psalter or Bible is suspended by a key tied in at Psalm
                    1. 18: “When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him”; the bow of
                    the key being balanced on the fingers, and the names of those suspected being
                    called over, he or she at whose name the book turns or falls is the culprit (see
                    Brand, <hi rend="italic">Popular Antiquities,</hi> ed. Bohn, vol. iii. p.
                    351).</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable groups of divinations passing into ordeals are those
                    which appeal to the corpse itself for discovery of its murderer. The idea is
                    rooted in that primitive state of mind which has not yet realized the full
                    effect of death, but regards the body as still able to hear and act. Thus the
                    natives of Australia will ask the dead man carried on his bier of boughs who
                    bewitched him; if he has died by witchcraft he will make the bier move round,
                    and if the sorcerer who killed him be present a bough will touch him (Eyre, <hi
                    rend="italic">Australia,</hi> vol. ii. p. 344). That this is no isolated fancy
                    is shown by its recurrence among the negroes of Africa, where, for instance, the
                    corpse causes its bearers to dash against some one’s house, which accuses the
                    owner of the murder (J. L. Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Western Africa,</hi> p.
                    231; Waitz, vol. ii. p. 193). This somewhat resembles the well-known ordeal of
                    the bier in Europe in the Middle Ages, which, however, seems founded on a
                    different principle, the imagination that a sympathetic action of the blood
                    causes it to flow at the touch or neighbourhood of the murderer. Apparently the
                    liquefaction of the blood which in certain cases takes place after death may
                    have furnished the ground for this belief. On Teutonic ground, this ordeal
                    appears in the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> where the murdered
                    Siegfried is laid on his bier, and Hagen is called on to prove his innocence by
                    going to the corpse, but at his approach the dead chief’s wounds bleed afresh.
                    The typical instance in English history is the passage of Matthew Paris, that
                    after Henry H.’s death at Chinon his son Richard came to view the body, “Quo
                    superveniente, confestim erupit sanguis ex naribus regis mortui; ac si
                    indignaretur spiritus in adventu ejus, qui ejusdem mortis causa esse credebatur,
                    ut videretur sanguis clamare ad Deum.” In Shakespeare <hi rend="italic">(Rich.
                    III.,</hi> act 1, sc. 2):</p>
                <p>“0 gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry’s wounds Open their congeal’d mouths, and
                    bleed afresh !”</p>
                <p>At Hertford assizes (4 Car. I.) the deposition was taken as to certain suspected
                    murderers being required to touch the corpse, when the murdered woman thrust out
                    the ring finger three times and it dropped blood on the grass (Brand, vol. iii.
                    p. 231); and there was a case in the Scottish High Court of Justiciary as late
                    as 1668 (T. F. Thiselton Dyer, <hi rend="italic">Folklore of Shakespeare,</hi>
                    p. 487). Durham peasants, apparently remembering the old belief, still expect
                    those who come to look at a corpse to touch it, in token that they bear no
                    ill-will to the departed (W. Henderson, <hi rend="italic">Folklore of Northern
                    Counties,</hi> p. 57).</p>
                <p>Certain ordeals are closely related to oaths, so that the two shade into one
                    another. Let the curse which is to fall on the oath-breaker take effect at once,
                    it then becomes a sign condemning the swearer,—in fact, an ordeal. Thus the
                    drinking of water on which a curse or magical penalty has been laid is a mere
                    oath so long as the time of fulfilment is unfixed (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Oath).</hi> But it becomes an ordeal when, as in Brahmanic India, the accused
                    drinks three handfuls of water in which a sacred image has been dipped; if he is
                    innocent nothing happens, but if he is guilty sickness or misfortune will fall
                    on him within one to three weeks (for accounts of these and other Hindu ordeals
                    see Ali Ibrahim Khan in <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    389, and Stenzler’s summary in <hi rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> vol. ix.).
                    The earliest account of such an ordeal is in Numbers v., which describes the
                    mode of administering to a woman charged with unfaithfulness the bitter water
                    mixed with the dust of the tabernacle floor, with the curse laid on it to
                    cause-her belly to swell and her thigh to fall if guilty. Ewald <hi
                    rend="italic">(Antiquities of Israel,</hi> 236) regards the draught as in itself
                    harmless, and the operation of this curse on the guilty as due to the influence
                    of the mind on the body. But the term “bitter” is applied to the water before it
                    has been cursed, which suggests that it already contained some drug, as in the
                    poison-water ordeal still in constant use over a great part of Africa. Thus the
                    red water of Guinea is a decoction made by pounding in a wooden mortar and
                    steeping in water the inner bark of one of the mimosas, producing a liquor like
                    that of a tan-vat, astringent, narcotic, and when taken in sufficient quantity
                    emetic. The accused, with solemn ceremony and invocation, drinks freely of it;
                    if it nauseates him and he throws it up he is triumphantly acquitted, but if he
                    becomes dizzy he is guilty, and the assembly fall on him, pelt him with stones,
                    and even drag him over the rocks till he is dead. Here the result of the ordeal
                    depends partly on the patient’s constitution, but more on the sorcerer who can
                    prepare the proper dose to prove either guilt or innocence. Among the various
                    drugs used in different parts of Africa are the <hi rend="italic">τnbundu</hi>
                    root, the Calabar bean, the tangena nut <hi rend="italic">(Tanghinia
                    veneniflua,</hi> a strong poison and emetic). The sorcerers who administer this
                    ordeal have in their hands a power of inflicting or remitting judicial murder,
                    giving them boundless influence (details in J. L. Wilson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Western Africa,</hi> pp. 225, 398; Burton, <hi rend="italic">Lake Regions of
                    Central Africa,</hi> vol. ii. p. 357; Bosman, “Guinea,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pinkerton's Voyages,</hi> vol. xvi. pp. 398, &amp;c.). The poison-ordeal is
                    also known to Brahmanic law, decoction of aconite root being one of the poisons
                    given, and the accused if not sickening being declared free (Stenzler, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.).</hi> Theoretically connected with the ordeal by cursed
                    drink is that by cursed food, which is, however, distinguished among this black
                    catalogue by being sometimes an effectual means of discovering the truth. The
                    ordeal by bread and cheese, practised in Alexandria about the 2d century, was
                    practically the same as that known to English law five to ten centuries later as
                    the <hi rend="italic">corsnaed</hi> or “trial slice” of consecrated bread and
                    cheese which was administered from the altar, with the curse that if the accused
                    were guilty God would send the angel Gabriel to stop his throat, that he might
                    not be able to swallow that bread and cheese. In fact, if guilty and not a
                    hardened offender he was apt to fail, dry-mouthed and choking through terror, to
                    get it down. The remembrance of this ancient ordeal still lingers in the popular
                    phrase, “May this bit choke me if I lie !” In India the corresponding trial by
                    rice is prescribed in the old laws to be done by suspected persons chewing the
                    consecrated grains of rice and spitting them out, moist and untinged with blood,
                    on a banyan leaf; this or the mere chewing and swallowing of a mouthful of
                    rice-grains is often used even by the English as a means of detecting a thief. A
                    classical mention of the ordeals by carrying hot iron in the hands and by
                    passing through the fire is made more interesting by the guards who offer to
                    prove their innocence in this way offering further to take oath by the gods,
                    which shows the intimate connexion between oaths and ordeals (Soph., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> 264, see also Aeschyl., <hi rend="italic">fr.</hi>

                <p>The passing through the fire is described in the Hindu codes of Yâjnavalkya and
                    others, and is an incident in Hindu poetry, where in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Râmâyana</hi> the virtuous Sitâ thus proves her innocence to her jealous
                    husband Rama (Stenzler, p. 669; Pictet, <hi rend="italic">Origines
                    Indo-Européennes,</hi> part ii. p. 457). It was not less known to European law
                    and chronicle, as where Richardis, wife of Charles the Fat, proves her innocence
                    by going into a fire clothed in a waxed shift, and is unhurt by the fire (Grimm,
                    <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Rechts-</hi><hi rend="italic">alterthümer,</hi> p.
                    912). Yet more minutely prescribed in the Hindu ordeal-books is the rite of
                    carrying the glowing hot iron seven steps, into the seven or nine circles traced
                    on the ground, the examination of the hands to see if they show traces of
                    burning, and the binding them up in leaves. The close historical connexion of
                    the Hindu ordeal laws with the old European is shown by the correspondence of
                    minute details, as where in a Scandinavian law it is prescribed that the red-hot
                    iron shall be carried nine steps (Grimm, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.,</hi> p.
                    918). In Anglo-Saxon laws the iron to be carried was at first only one pound
                    weight, but Athelstan’s law (in <hi rend="italic">Ancient Laws and Institutes of
                    England,</hi> iv. 6) enacts that it be increased to weigh three pounds. Another
                    form well known in old Germany and England was the walking barefoot over glowing
                    ploughshares, generally nine. The law-codes of the early Middle Ages show this
                    as an ordinary criminal procedure (see the two works last referred to), but it
                    is perhaps best remembered in two non-historical legends. The German queen
                    Kunigunde, “haec dicens stupentibus et flentibus universis qui aderant, vomeres
                    candentes nudo vestigio calcavit et sine adustionis molestia transiit” (<hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Henrici,</hi> ap. Canisium, vi. 387). Queen Emma, mother of
                    Edward the Confessor, accused of familiarity with Alwyn bishop of Winchester,
                    triumphantly purges herself and him by the help of St Swithin,—each of the two
                    thus acquitted giving nine manors to the church of Winchester, in memory of the
                    nine ploughshares, and the king being corrected with stripes (John Bromton; see
                    Freeman’s <hi rend="italic">Norm. Conq.,</hi> vol. ii. App.). To dip the hand in
                    boiling water or oil or melted lead and take out a stone or ring is another
                    ordeal of this class. The traveller may find some of these fiery trials still in
                    use, or at least in recent memory, in barbaric regions of Africa or further
                    Asia,—the negro plunging his arm into the caldron of boiling oil, the Burman
                    doing feats with melted lead, while the Bedouin will settle a conflict of
                    evidence by the opposing witnesses licking a glowing hot-iron spoon (Burckhardt,
                    <hi rend="italic">Arabien,</hi> pp. 98, 233). This latter feat may be done with
                    safety by any one, provided the iron be clean and thoroughly white hot, while if
                    only red-hot it would touch and burn the tongue. Probably the administerers of
                    the ordeal are aware of this, and of the possibility of dipping the hand in
                    melted metal; and there are stories of arts of protecting the skin (see the
                    recipe in Albertus Magnus, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirabilibus'),</hi> though it is not known what can be really done beyond
                    making it horny like a smith’s, which would serve as a defence in stepping on
                    hot coals, but not in serious trials like that of carrying a heavy red-hot iron.
                    The fireordeals are still performed by mountebanks, who very likely keep up the
                    same means of trickery which were in official use when the accused was to be
                    acquitted. The actual practice of the fire· ordeal contrasts shamefully with its
                    theory, that the fire rather than harm the innocent restrained its natural
                    action. Thus it stands in the Hindu code of Manu (viii. 115): “He whom the flame
                    does not burn, whom the water does not cast up, or whom no harm soon befals, is
                    to be taken as truthful in his oath.” The water-ordeal here referred to is that
                    well known in Europe, where the accused is thrown bound into the water, which
                    receives him if innocent, but rejects him if guilty. The manner of carrying out
                    this test is well explained in the directions given by Archbishop Hincmar in the
                    9th century: he who is let down into the water for trial is to be fastened by a
                    rope, that he may not be in danger if the water receives him as innocent, but
                    may be pulled out. In the later Middle Ages this ordeal by “swimming” or
                    “fleeting” became the most approved means of trying a suspected witch: she was
                    stripped naked and cross bound, the right thumb to the left toe, and the left
                    thumb to the right toe. In this state she was cast into a pond or river, in
                    which it was thought impossible for her to sink. (Brand, vol. iii. p. 21.) The
                    cases of “ducking” witches which have occurred in England within the last few
                    years are remains of the ancient ordeal.</p>
                <p>If there is one thing that may be predicated of man in a state of nature it is
                    that two disputants tend to fight out their quarrel. When in the warfare of
                    Greeks and Trojans, of Jews and Philistines, of Vandals and Alamans, heroes come
                    out from the two sides and their combat is taken to mark the powers of the
                    opposing war-gods and decide the victory, then the principle of the ordeal by
                    battle has been practically called in. Among striking instances of the Teutonic
                    custom which influenced the whole of mediaeval Europe may be cited the custom of
                    the Franks that the princes, if they could not quell the strife, had to fight it
                    out between themselves, and Wippo’s account of the quarrel between the Christian
                    Saxons and the Pagan Slavs as to which broke the peace, when both sides demanded
                    of the emperor that it should be settled by duel, which was done by choosing a
                    champion on each side, and the Christian fell. The Scandinavian term “holmgang”
                    refers to the habit of fighting duels on an island. A passage from old German
                    law shows the single combat accepted as a regular legal procedure: “If there be
                    dispute concerning fields, vineyards, or money, that they avoid perjury let two
                    be chosen to fight, and decide the cause by duel” (Grimm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rechtsalterth.,</hi> p. 928). In England, after the Conquest, trial by combat
                    supersedéd other legal ordeals, which were abolished in the time of Henry III.
                    Among famous instances is that of Henry de Essex, hereditary standard-bearer of
                    England, who fled from a battle in Wales, in 1158, threw from him the royal
                    standard, and cried out that the king was slain. Robert de Montfort afterwards,
                    accusing him of having done this with treasonable intent, offered to prove his
                    accusation by combat, and they fought in presence of Henry II. and his court,
                    when Essex was defeated, but the king spared his life, and, his estate being
                    confiscated, he became a monk in Reading Abbey. A lord often sent his man in his
                    stead to such combats, and priests and women were ordinarily represented by
                    champions. The wager of battle died out so quietly in England without being
                    legally abolished that in the Court of King’s Bench in 1818 it was claimed by a
                    person charged with murder, which led to its formal abolition (Ashford <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Thornton in Barnewall and Alderson, 457; see details in H.
                    C. Lea, <hi rend="italic">Superstition and Force,</hi> ii.). A distinct
                    connexion may, however, be traced between the legal duel and the illegal private
                    duel, which has disappeared from England in our own time, but still flourishes
                    in France and Germany. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. b. t.)</hi></p>
