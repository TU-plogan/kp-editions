                    His father, Odeler of Orleans, was one of the followers of Roger Montgomery, a
                    powerful baron who had accompanied William the Conqueror from Normandy, and in
                    whom that monarch reposed especial confidence. Roger had at one time cruelly
                    despoiled the abbey of St Evroul en Ouche, and in his latter years sought to
                    make reparation by bestowing large gifts of benefices and lands on the society.
                    In this manner Odeler also became interested in St Evroul. He was a married
                    priest, and Orderic, the eldest of his three sons, who had at first been sent by
                    him to receive his education at Shrewsbury, was now at the age of ten years
                    dedicated to the monastic life and sent to St Evroul. It was a Benedictine
                    foundation, and at this time perhaps the most celebrated of all the schools in
                    Normandy <hi rend="italic">{Gallia Christiana,</hi> xi. 814-6). On the 21st of
                    September 1085 the youthful Orderic received the tonsure and was admitted one of
                    the oblates of the monastery. It was the feast of St Maurice, the commander of
                    the legendary Theban legion, and Orderic’s name, which seems to have been
                    displeasing to the Norman ear, was now changed into that of Vitalis, one of
                    Maurice’s lieutenants. In March 1093 he was ordained a deacon, but was not
                    admitted to priestly orders until 1107. We have it on his own testimony that he
                    was treated with kindness in his new home, and his uneventful life was chiefly
                    passed in a routine of religious observances and of such studies as the
                    Benedictine rule was then interpreted to admit; but from this number, he tells
                    us, pagan history was excluded. The discipline of the society at St Evroul was
                    well maintained, and not a few of its members were worthy representatives of
                    that spirit of devotion to learning by which their order was long so honourably
                    distinguished. Orderic’s superiors appear to have soon discerned his aptitude
                    for literary labours, and at the suggestion of two of their number (Roger and
                    Guérin) he first commenced to write the history of the foundation. Among his
                    fellow-monks were men who had taken part in the expeditions of the Normans in
                    Italy and Sicily, in the Crusades, and in the wars waged by William the
                    Conqueror and his sons, and to such associations, as well as to the advantages
                    which a resident at St Evroul would enjoy owing to its being a great centre of
                    intercommunication, we must attribute much of the remarkably varied and minute
                    information with which the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> abounds. Travel,
                    again, appears to have had for Orderic a special charm; and, notwithstanding the
                    difficulties interposed by his monastic vow, he twice revisited his native
                    country, Croyland and Worcester having been his principal places of sojourn. We
                    also find him at Cambrai, and in 1132 at Cluny at a great gathering of its
                    celebrated order. In the year 1141, being, as he tells us, worn out with age and
                    infirmities, he was fain to bring his historical labours to a close, and it is
                    inferred that his death occurred soon after. Although compelled to quit his
                    native country at so early an age, Orderic seems always to have felt himself an
                    exile. In the title of his work he is careful to describe himself as
                    “Angligena,” and throughout the narrative he gives special prominence to
                    whatever relates to England.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Historia Ecclesiastica</hi> is divided into three parts. Of
                    these the first, in two books, gives an outline of the history of the church
                    from the commencement of the Christian era to the death of Pope Leo IV. in 855,
                    a list of the popes from that date to Innocent II. being appended. The second
                    part—the first in order of composition (see <hi rend="italic">supra}—</hi> is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Historia Uticensis,</hi> or history of the monastery of St
                    Evroul from its foundation by Abbot Ebrulf in the year 560 to the narrator’s own
                    time; it contains many interesting sketches of the abbots and other members or
                    benefactors of the society. The third part—the only genuinely historical portion
                    of the work—is in seven books, and is devoted to a general account of events in
                    Western Christendom from Carolingian times down to the year 1141. With the year
                    1084 (after a considerable break in the narrative) the work begins to assume its
                    peculiar value as a storehouse of information with respect to the history and
                    social condition of England and Normandy in the latter part of the 11th and
                    first half of the 12th century. In striking contrast to the ordinary chroniclers
                    of his age, Orderic collected and recorded with scrupulous care numerous facts
                    and incidents which others would have deemed too insignificant for notice. But
                    there is no work relating to the same period, says Guizot, which throws so much
                    light on the political, civil, and religious aspects of society in the West, and
                    the conditions of feudal, monastic, and ordinary life. These merits, however,
                    are in no slight degree obscured by Orderic’s singularly involved style and
                    turgid diction, while his absolute disregard of method renders his narrative at
                    times difficult to comprehend and follow.</p>
                <p>In addition to the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> there exists in the library at
                    Rouen a manuscript edition of the Norman history of William of Jumièges, which
                    Μ. Leopold Delisle feels no hesitation in assigning to Orderic (see his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic">Μ. Jules Lair,</hi> 1873).</p>
                <p>The best edition of the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> is that edited by Μ.
                    Auguste Le Prévost, in five volumes (1838-55). In the concluding volume (pp.
                    i.-cvi.) there is an admirable account and criticism of Orderic by Μ. Leopold
                    Delisle. The edition in Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologia,</hi> vol.
                    clxxxviii., though a later publication, is a reprint of the less accurate text
                    of Duchesne. A French translation by Μ. Guizot, in 4 vols., 8vo, was published
                    at Caen in 1821-27; and there is an English version (with Guizot’s preface) by
                    Thomas Forester, 4 vols., 1853-56, in Bohn's <hi rend="italic">Antiquarian
                    Library.</hi></p>
