                    astronomer, freethinker, and epigrammatist, Ghiyâth-uddin Abulfath Omar bin
                    Ibrâhîm al-Khayyâmi, who derived the epithet Khayyâm (the tentmaker) most likely
                    from his father’s trade, was born in or close by Nishâpùr, and is stated to have
                    died there in 517 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (1123 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> This date is accepted by most Eastern and Western writers, but the
                    renowned vizier of the Seljùk sultâns Alp Arslan and Malikshâh, Nizâm-ulmulk of
                    Tùs, whose birth is fixed in 408 A.H. (1017 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    expressly states in one of his writings that Omar was of the same age as
                    himself, and attended with him the lectures of the imâm Muwaffak: in the college
                    of Nishâpùr. However that may be, there cannot be the slightest doubt that at an
                    early age Omar entered into a close friendship both with Nizâm-ulmulk and his
                    schoolfellow Hasan ibn Sabbâh, who founded afterwards the terrible sect of the
                    Isma'flis or Assassins. The three friends pledged themselves by a solemn promise
                    that he who should first gain an influential position in the world would lend a
                    helping hand to the other two and promote their success in life. When
                    Nizâm-ulmulk was raised to the rank of vizier by Alp Arslan (1063-1073 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> he remembered this covenant and bestowed upon Hasan
                    ibn Sabbâh the dignity of a chamberlain, whilst offering a similar court office
                    to Omar Khayyâm. But the latter contented himself with an annual stipend which
                    would enable him to devote all his time to his favourite studies of mathematics
                    and astronomy, and he soon proved his gratitude for the liberality of his patron
                    and friend by the publication of his standard work on algebra, written in
                    Arabic. This and other treatises of a similar character— for instance, on the
                    extraction of cube roots and on the explanation of difficult definitions in
                    Euclid—raised him at once to the foremost rank among the mathematicians of that
                    age, and induced Sultân Malikshâh to summon him in 467 A.H. (1074 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> to institute astronomical observations on a larger
                    scale, and to aid him in his great enterprise of a thorough reform of the
                    calendar. A twofold fruit resulted from Omar’s elaborate research in the
                    sultan’s observatory,—a revised edition of the Zfj or astronomical tables, and
                    the introduction of the Ta’rfkh-i-Malikshâhf or Jalâli, that is, the so-called
                    Jalâlian or Seljùk era, which commences in 471 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>
                    (1079 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> 15th March).</p>
                <p>Great, however, as Omar’s scientific fame has always been throughout the East, it
                    is nearly eclipsed by his still greater poetical renown, which he owes to his
                    <hi rend="italic">rubais</hi> or quatrains, a collection of about 500 epigrams,
                    unequalled by any of his predecessors or followers. The peculiar form of the
                    rubâ'f—viz., four lines, the first, second, and fourth of which have the same
                    rhyme, while the third usually (but not always) remains rhymeless—was first
                    successfully introduced into Persian literature as the exclusive vehicle for
                    subtle thoughts on the various topics of Sùfic mysticism by the sheikh Abù Sa'id
                    bin Abulkhair,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Died Jan.

                    Sa'id. Although some of his quatrains are purely mystic and pantheistic, most of
                    them bear quite another stamp; they are the breviary of a radical freethinker,
                    who protests in the most forcible manner both against the narrowness, bigotry,
                    and uncompromising austerity of the orthodox ulemâ and the eccentricity,
                    hypocrisy, and wild ravings of advanced Süfis, whom he successfully combats with
                    their own weapons, using the whole mystic terminology simply to ridicule
                    mysticism itself. There is in this respect a great resemblance between him and
                    Hâfiz, but Omar is decidedly superior, not so much on account of his priority as
                    for his more concise, more simple, and yet infinitely more energetic style. He
                    has often been called the Voltaire of the East, and cried down as materialist
                    and atheist. As far as purity of diction, fine wit, crushing satire against a
                    debased and ignorant clergy, and a general sympathy with suffering humanity are
                    concerned, Omar certainly reminds us of the great Frenchman; but there the
                    comparison ceases. Voltaire never wrote anything equal to <pb break="no"

                    love, and all earthly joys, to the fervent effusions of his heart so full of the
                    most tender feelings and affections, and his passionate denunciations of a
                    malevolent and inexorable fate which dooms to slow decay or sudden death and to
                    eternal oblivion all that is great, good, and beautiful in this world. There is
                    a touch of Byron, Swinburne, and even of Schopenhauer in many of his rubâ'is,
                    which clearly proves that the modern pessimist is by no means a novel creature
                    in the realm of philosophic thought and poetical imagination.</p>
