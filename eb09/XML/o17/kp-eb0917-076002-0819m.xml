                    chemist Mège-Mouriès sought to convert ordinary animal fat into butter has
                    already been described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Butter</hi> (vol. iv. p. 592).
                    The following account of the mode of manufacture as carried on by the
                    “Commercial Manufacturing Company” in New York is abridged from a report by Mr
                    Victor Drummond, secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, in 1880.</p>
                <p>Fresh fat from recently killed cattle is soaked in tepid water for one hour, then
                    thoroughly washed with cold water, and, after having been soaked in cold water,
                    assorted, the pieces less rich in “oil” being rejected and put aside for the
                    manufacture of tallow. The fat thus selected is hashed up (almost minced) by
                    machinery and melted down in water-jacketed caldrons, the water being heated by
                    means of steam, so that the fat never becomes hotter than 124° Fahr. Through the
                    action of this heat the fat divides into three parts, namely, shreds of membrane
                    below, a scum of an emulsion of fat and water above, and clear oil between the
                    two. The oil is drawn off and kept for thirty to thirty-six hours at a
                    temperature of 85° Fahr., when a portion of the stearin and palmitin
                    crystallizes out, while the more easily fusible components remain as a mother
                    liquor, which is then squeezed out by hydraulic pressure. This oil, which on
                    cooling freezes into a semi-solid fat, constitutes <hi rend="italic"
                    >oleo-margarine,</hi> and is recommended as an excellent substitute for melted
                    butter. Of the oil considerable quantities are worked up into imitation butter.
                    For this purpose it is violently churned up with milk for about twenty minutes,
                    a little arnotto being added to produce a yellow colour. The emulsion is run
                    direct on a mass of pounded ice to cause it to solidify without crystallization.
                    After having been again churned up with fresh milk, it is kneaded to remove the
                    excess of water, salted (in short, manipulated as genuine churned butter is),
                    and sent out into the market.</p>

                <p>Oleo-margarine,—that is, ordinary fat minus part of the palmitin and stearin—is
                    necessarily somewhat richer in those components (2) which are characteristically
                    predominant in butter, but still falls far short of what real butter naturally
                    contains. The physiological action of these butter-glycerides, as we may call
                    them, has never been made out; possibly they may account to some extent for
                    butter being more easily digestible than ordinary fat.</p>
                <p>Hehner and Angell have the merit of being the first to work out an easy and
                    straightforward method for detecting (considerable) admixtures of ordinary
                    animal fat, and consequently also of such things as oleo-margarine, with real
                    butter. It consists in determining the percentage of insoluble and non-volatile
                    acids contained in the previously dehydrated and filtered article. By their <hi
                    rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi> all ordinary animal fats
                    yield close upon 95 per cent., while genuine butter yields only 86 <hi
                    rend="italic">5</hi> to 87'5, at most 89 per cent., of fixed fatty acids. Easier
                    and more decisive is the method of Reichert, who saponifies 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 grammes of the dry filtered article with 1 gramme
                    of caustic potash dissolved in alcohol, expels the alcohol, decomposes the soap,
                    after addition of 50 cubic centimetres of water, with 20 c.c. of dilute
                    sulphuric acid (1 vol. of vitriol, 10 vol. of water), and distils off (exactly)
                    50 c.c., to determine therein the volatile acids by ascertaining the volume of a
                    dilute standard solution of caustic alkali which is required to neutralize them.
                    Real butter (per 2'5 grammes) yields 12 to 13 milligrammes, ordinary fats only
