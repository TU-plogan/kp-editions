                    the heads of which had been Celtic chiefs, had lost their lands in the wars of
                    Ireland, and had felt the full weight of the harsh penal code which long held
                    the Catholic Irish down. His ancestors in the 18th century had sent recruits to
                    the famous brigade of Irish exiles in the service of France, and those who
                    remained at home either lived as tenants on the possessions of which they had
                    once been lords, or gradually made money by smuggling, a very general calling in
                    that wild region. Thus he inherited from his earliest years, with certain
                    traditions of birth and high station, a strong dislike of British rule in
                    Ireland and of the dominant owners of the soil, a firm attachment to his
                    proscribed faith, and habitual skill in evading the law; and these influences
                    may be traced in his subsequent career. O’Connell learned the rudiments at a
                    school in Cork, one of the first which the state in those evil days allowed to
                    be opened for Catholic teaching; and a few years afterwards he became a student,
                    as was customary with Irish youths of his class, in the colleges of St Omer and
                    Douai. His great abilities, it is said, were there perceived by the principals,
                    and their peculiar training undoubtedly left a permanent mark on his mind and
                    nature, for the casuistry and the diction of the Romish priesthood distinctly
                    appear in his speeches and writings, and he had much of the ecclesiastic in his
                    manners and bearing. These years, too, in France had, in another way, a decided
                    effect in forming his judgment on political questions of high moment. He was an
                    eye-witness on more than one occasion of the folly and excesses of the French
                    Revolution; and these scenes not only increased his love for his church, but
                    strongly impressed him with that dread of anarchy, of popular movements ending
                    in bloodshed, and of communistic and socialistic views which characterized him
                    in after life. To these experiences, too, we may partly ascribe the reverence
                    for law, for the rights of property, and for the monarchical form of government
                    which he appears to have sincerely felt; and, demagogue as he became in a
                    certain sense, they gave his mind a deep Conservative tinge. In 1798 he was
                    called to the bar of Ireland, and though, as professing a still degraded creed,
                    he was shut out from the chance of promotion, though he could not even obtain a
                    silk gown, and though, what was of more importance, he was subjected in a
                    variety of ways to caste hostility, he rose before long to the very highest
                    eminence among contemporary lawyers and advocates. This position was in the main
                    due to a dexterity in conducting causes, and especially in examining witnesses,
                    in which he had no rival at the Irish bar, and here his profound sagacity,
                    observant cunning, and intuitive knowledge of the native character enabled him
                    to accomplish wonders, even at the present day not wholly forgotten. He was,
                    however, a thorough lawyer besides, inferior in scientific learning to two or
                    three of his most conspicuous rivals, but well read in every department of law,
                    and especially a master in all that relates to criminal and constitutional
                    jurisprudence. As an advocate, too, he stood in the very highest rank; in mere
                    oratory he was surpassed by Plunket, and in rhetorical gifts by Bushe, the only
                    speakers to be named with him in his best days at the Irish bar; but his style,
                    if not of the most perfect kind, and often <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0778-0721"/> disfigured by decided faults, was marked by a
                    peculiar subtlety and manly power, and produced great and striking effects. On
                    the whole, in the art of winning over juries he had scarcely an equal in the law
                    courts.</p>
                <p>To understand, however, O’Connell’s greatness we must look to the field of Irish
                    politics. From early manhood he had turned his mind to the condition of Ireland
                    and the mass of her people. The worst severities of the penal code had been, in
                    a certain measure, relaxed, but the Catholics were still in a state of
                    vassalage, and they were still pariahs compared with the Protestants. The
                    rebellion of 1798 and the union had dashed the hopes of the Catholic leaders,
                    and their prospects of success seemed very remote when, in the first years of
                    the present century, the still unknown lawyer took up their cause. Up to this
                    juncture the question had been in the hands of Grattan and other Protestants,
                    and of a small knot of Catholic nobles and prelates; but their efforts had not
                    accomplished much, and they aimed only at a kind of compromise, which, while
                    conceding their principal claims, would have placed their church in subjection
                    to the state. O’Connell inaugurated a different policy, and had soon given the
                    Catholic movement an energy it had not before possessed. Himself a Catholic of
                    birth and genius, unfairly kept back in the race of life, he devoted his heart
                    and soul to the cause, and his character and antecedents made him the champion
                    who ultimately assured its triumph. Having no sympathy with the rule of “the
                    Saxon,” he saw clearly how weak was the hold of the Government and the
                    Protestant caste on the vast mass of the Catholic nation; having a firm faith in
                    the influence of his church, he perceived that it might be made an instrument of
                    immense political power in Ireland; and, having attained a mastery over the
                    lawyer’s craft, he knew how a great popular movement might be so conducted as to
                    elude the law and yet be in the highest degree formidable. With these
                    convictions, he formed the bold design of combining the Irish Catholic millions,
                    under the superintendence of the native priesthood, into a vast league against
                    the existing order of things, and of wresting the concession of the Catholic
                    claims from every opposing party in the state by an agitation, continually kept
                    up, and embracing almost the whole of the people, but maintained within
                    constitutional limits, though menacing and shaking the frame of society. He
                    gradually succeeded in carrying out his purpose: Catholic associations, at first
                    small, but slowly assuming larger proportions, were formed in different parts of
                    the country; attempts of the Government and of the local authorities to put them
                    down were skilfully baffled by legal devices of many kinds; and at last, after a
                    conflict of years, all Catholic Ireland was arrayed to a man in an organisation
                    of enormous power, that demanded its rights with no uncertain voice. O’Connell,
                    having long before attained an undisputed and easy ascendency, stood at the head
                    of this great national movement; but it will be observed that, having been
                    controlled from first to last by himself and the priesthood, it had little in
                    common with the mob rule and violence which he had never ceased to regard with
                    aversion. His election for Clare in 1828 proved the forerunner of the inevitable
                    change, and the Catholic claims were granted the next year, to the intense
                    regret of the Protestant Irish, by a Government avowedly hostile to the last,
                    but unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure of a people united to insist
                    on justice. The result, unquestionably, was almost wholly due to the energy and
                    genius of a single man, though the Catholic question would have been settled, in
                    all probability, in the course of time; and it must be added that O’Connell’s
                    triumph, which showed what agitation could effect in Ireland, was far from doing
                    his country unmixed good.</p>
                <p><hi> O’Connell</hi> joined the Whigs on entering parliament, and gave effective
                    aid to the cause of reform. The agitation, however, on the Catholic question had
                    quickened the sense of the wrongs of Ireland, and the Irish Catholics were
                    engaged ere long in a crusade against tithes and the established church, the
                    most offensive symbols of their inferiority in the state. It may be questioned
                    whether O’Connell was not rather led than a leader in this; the movement, at
                    least, passed beyond his control, and the country for many months was terrorized
                    by scenes of appalling crime and bloodshed. Lord Grey, very properly, proposed
                    measures of repression to put this anarchy down, and O’Connell opposed them with
                    extreme vehemence, a seeming departure from his avowed principles, but natural
                    in the case of a popular tribune. This caused a breach between him and the
                    Whigs; but he gradually returned to his allegiance to them when they practically
                    abolished Irish tithes, cut down the revenues of the established church, and
                    endeavoured to secularize the surplus. By this time O’Connell had attained a
                    position of great eminence in the House of Commons: as a debater he stood in the
                    very first rank, though he had entered St Stephen’s after fifty; and his
                    oratory, massive and strong in argument, although too often scurrilous and
                    coarse, and marred by a bearing in which cringing flattery and rude bullying
                    were strangely blended, made a powerful, if not a pleasing, impression.
                    O’Connell steadily supported Lord Melbourne’s Government, gave it valuable aid
                    in its general measures, and repeatedly expressed his cordial approval of its
                    policy in advancing Irish Catholics to places of trust and power in the state,
                    though personally he refused a high judicial office. These were not the least
                    useful years of his life, and they clearly brought out the real character and
                    tendencies of his views on politics. Though a strict adherent of the creed of
                    Rome, he was a Liberal, nay a Radical, as regards measures for the vindication
                    of human liberty, and he sincerely advocated the rights of conscience, the
                    emancipation of the slave, and freedom of trade. But his rooted aversion to the
                    democratic theories imported from France, which were gradually winning their way
                    into England, only grew stronger with advancing age; he denounced Chartism in
                    unmeasured terms; the sovereign had no more loyal subject; and if, as became
                    him, he often condemned the tyranny of bad Continental Governments, he
                    reverenced the constitution and laws of England interpreted in a generous
                    spirit. His conservatism, however, was most apparent in his antipathy to
                    socialistic doctrines and his tenacious regard for the claims of property. He
                    actually opposed the Irish Poor Law, as encouraging a communistic spirit; he
                    declared a movement against rent a crime; and, though he had a strong sympathy
                    with the Irish peasant, and advocated a reform of his precarious tenure, it is
                    difficult to imagine that he could have approved the cardinal principle of the
                    Irish Land Act, the judicial adjustment of rent by the state.</p>
                <p><hi> O’Connell</hi> changed his policy as regards Ireland when Peel became
                    minister in 1841. He declared that a Tory régime in his country was incompatible
                    with good government, and he began an agitation for the repeal of the union. One
                    of his motives in taking this course no doubt was a strong personal dislike of
                    Peel, with whom he had often been in collision, and who had singled him out in
                    1829 for what must be called a marked affront. O ’ Connelζ nevertheless, was
                    sincere and even consistent in his conduct: he had denounced the union in early
                    manhood as an obstacle to the Catholic cause; he had spoken against the measure
                    in parliament; he believed that the claims of Ireland were set aside or slighted
                    in what he deemed an alien assembly; and, though he had ceased for some years to
                    demand repeal, and regarded it as rather a means <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0779-0722"/> than an end, he was throughout life an avowed
                    repealer. It should be observed, however, that in his judgment the repeal of the
                    union would not weaken the real bond between Great Britain and Ireland; and he
                    had nothing in common with the rebellious faction who, at a later period, openly
                    declared for the separation of the two countries by force. The organization
                    which had effected such marvellous results in 1828-29 was recreated for the new
                    project. Enormous meetings, convened by the priesthood, and directed or
                    controlled by O’Connell, assembled in 1842-43, and probably nine-tenths of the
                    Irish Catholics were unanimous in the cry for repeal. O’Connell seems to have
                    thought success certain; but he had not perceived the essential difference
                    between his earlier agitation and this. The enlightened opinion of the three
                    kingdoms for the most part approved the Catholic claims, and as certainly it
                    condemned repeal. After some hesitation Peel resolved to put down the repeal
                    movement. A vast intended meeting was proclaimed unlawful, and O’Connell was
                    arrested and held to bail, with ten or twelve of his principal followers. He was
                    convicted after the trials that followed, but they were not good specimens of
                    equal justice, and the sentence was reversed by the House of Lords, with the
                    approbation of competent judges. The spell, however, of O’Connell’s power had
                    vanished; his health had suffered much from a short confinement; he was verging
                    upon his seventieth year; and he was alarmed and pained by the growth of a party
                    in the repeal ranks who scoffed at his views, and advocated the revolutionary
                    doctrines which he had always feared and abhorred. Before long famine had fallen
                    on the land, and under this visitation the repeal movement, already paralysed,
                    wholly collapsed. O’Connell died soon afterwards, on 15th May 1847, at Genoa,
                    whilst on his way to Rome, profoundly afflicted by his country’s misery, and by
                    the failure of his late high hopes, yet soothed in dying by sincere sympathy,
                    felt throughout Ireland and largely in Europe, and expressed even by political
                    foes. He was a remarkable man in every sense of the word; Catholic Ireland calls
                    him her “Liberator” still; and history will say of him that, with some failings,
                    he had many and great gifts, that he was an orator of a high order, and that,
                    agitator as he was, he possessed the wisdom, the caution, and the tact of a real
                    statesman. O’Connell married in 1802 his cousin Mary O’Connell, by whom he had
                    three daughters and four sons. Of the latter, all have at one time or another
                    had seats in parliament. (w. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
