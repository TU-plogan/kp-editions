                <p><label type="entry">ORLEANS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dukes of</hi></label>. The
                    title duke of Orleans was borne by three distinct dynasties of French princes of
                    the blood. The first duke of Orleans was Louis (1371-1407), second son of King
                    Charles V., who was born in 1371, and received the title from his brother
                    Charles VI. in 1392. Both he and his son and heir played very important parts in
                    the history of the Hundred Years’ War with England (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >France)</hi> in opposition to the duke of Burgundy. He had been appointed
                    regent of France during the madness of his brother, Charles VI., and had, by his
                    immorality and his intimacy with the queen, raised a great scandal throughout
                    the kingdom. The duke of Burgundy made himself the mouthpiece of the general
                    discontent, and on 23d November 1407 had the regent murdered in the streets of
                    Paris in revenge for his own father’s death. Louis’s son <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Charles</hi> is the subject of the preceding article. With his son’s accession
                    to the throne as Louis XII. the dukedom of Orleans merged in the crown. It was
                    revived in 1626, when Louis XIII. created his brother, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean
                    Baptiste Gaston</hi> (1608-1660), the third son of Henry IV., duke of Orleans
                    and Chartres and count of Blois. Gaston of Orleans’s fruitless intrigues fill
                    the history of France from the time of Richelieu and Mary de’ Medici to that of
                    Mazarin and Anne of Austria. Four times he was banished from France, and more
                    than four times did he sacrifice his associates, who had plotted the overthrow
                    of Richelieu. To him Montmorency, Cinq-Mars, and De Thou owed their deaths, and
                    he was only protected from sharing their fate by the fact of his royal birth. On
                    the death of Louis XIII. he was appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom for
                    the minority of Louis XIV. But Mazarin never meant him to exercise any real
                    power, and when he became convinced that his power was subordinate to the
                    cardinal’s he entered the ranks of the Fronde (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mazarin),</hi> in which he played a conspicuous part, but always as the tool or
                    the mouthpiece of others. Far more manly and determined was his daughter, best
                    known as La Grande Mademoiselle, who with her own hands directed the guns of the
                    Bastille upon Turenne’s soldiers on the day of the battle of St Antoine. He was
                    afterwards exiled to his castle of Blois, where he died without male issue in
                    1660. The title was at once revived by Louis XIV., who created his brother <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Philippe</hi> (1640- 1701) duke of Orleans and of Chartres, and
                    married him to Henrietta, the sister of Charles II. of England. The court was
                    soon entertained by the details of the quarrels between the duke and duchess,
                    and by the former’s jealousy even of his brother the king, and, when Henrietta,
                    after successfully detaching Charles from the Triple Alliance and negotiating
                    the treaty of Dover, died suddenly in 1670, the duke was universally accused of
                    poisoning her. In the following year he married Princess Charlotte Elizabeth of
                    Bavaria. In the campaign of 1677 he so distinguished himself that Louis XIV.
                    became afraid of his popularity and refused to allow him to go again to the
                    frontier. He was obliged to waste his time at Paris like other noblemen, in
                    attendance on the court, until his death in 1701. He left one son and three
                    daughters: the daughters married Charles II. of Spain, Victor Amadeus II. of
                    Savoy, and Prince Charles of Lorraine; the son was <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philippe</hi> (1674-1723), the regent, who has been spoken of in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> vol. ix. p. 584. Before succeeding to the dukedom
                    of Orleans in 1701 he had given no indication of political ambition or capacity,
                    yet Louis XIV. distrusted him, and thought to mar his chance of allying himself
                    with any royal or noble family, and to unite his interest with that of his own
                    natural children, by marrying him to his illegitimate daughter by Madame de
                    Montespan, Mademoiselle de Blois. This distrust was increased as the king’s
                    legitimate descendants died off, and in his will he left his natural son, the
                    duke of Maine, guardian of the person of his great-grandson and heir, and
                    greatly circumscribed the authority of Orleans as regent. On the death of the
                    grand monarque in 1715 Philippe, guided by the advice of the duke of Saint
                    Simon, induced the parliament of Paris to upset the will and make him regent of
                    the realm with the fullest authority. By the same nobleman’s advice he procured
                    the degradation of the natural children of the late king from the precedence
                    above the peers of France which had been conferred on them. Saint Simon hoped he
                    would go yet further, and that he would entrust the nobility with their old
                    political authority; but the regent had no mind to restore the privileges which
                    Richelieu had had so much difficulty in combating, and which the policy of Louis
                    XIV. had only, after long years, been able to destroy. He determined to hand
                    down to Louis XV. the absolute power of his great-grandfather. Another main
                    object he sought was to keep France at peace, which alone could restore her to
                    her former prosperity. With this intention he joined the Quadruple Alliance. He
                    remained in close union with Stanhope, the prime minister of England, and the
                    emperoη, whilst Dubois worked out his intentions. This alliance enabled the
                    kingdoms of England and France to overthrow Alberoni and prevent his disturbing
                    the peace of Europe. In compliance with the wishes of Lord Stair, the able
                    English ambassador, Orleans expelled the Pretender from France, and was helped
                    to overthrow the conspiracy of Cellamare—the French part of Alberoni’s scheme by
                    which the bastards of Louis XIV. were to overthrow the regent. Under this
                    peaceful policy France rapidly began to recover prosperity, and Philippe hoped
                    to restore the condition of her finances by listening to the advice of a Scotch
                    adventurer, and buying out the farmers-general of the taxes, who were the real
                    causes of the financial distress (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Law, John,</hi> vol.
                    xiv. p. 367). It should also be noted that the regent showed both courage and
                    determination in putting a stop to the insane speculations of the Rue
                    Quincampoix. He cannot be called a great statesman; he indeed formed great
                    plans, but left all details of government to Dubois. Yet his real political
                    ability must not be overlooked, as is often done, because the period of the
                    regency is only regarded, as a rule, as a period of wild debauchery, in which
                    the regent ruled a court of bacchanals. Philippe never allowed his pleasures to
                    interfere with his politics. His fidelity to the youthful monarch is no less
                    remarkable in a man of his seemingly abandoned character, hence it is no wonder
                    that when Louis XV. attained his majority he maintained the duke of Orleans and
                    with him Dubois in power. But a career of debauchery had weakened his physical
                    powers, and, in the very year in which his ward had thus shown his gratitude to
                    him (1723), he died. His character is best painted in an apologue of his
                    mother’s. “The fairies were all invited to my bedside, and, <pb break="no"

                    Unhappily an old fairy had been forgotten, who, on arriving after the others,
                    exclaimed, ‘ He will have all the talents, excepting that of making good use of
                    them.’”</p>
                <p>The son of the regent, Louis (1703-1752), who succeeded him as duke of Orleans,
                    played no part in politics, though his name frequently occurs in the social
                    history of the time, and fills a great place in contemporary memoirs. Louis’s
                    son, Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">Philippe</hi> (1725-1785), was equally averse to
                    politics, though he served as a soldier at the battle of Dettingen; his great
                    delight was the theatre, and his place is rather in the history of the Paris
                    greenrooms than in the history of France. But to Louis <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philippe Joseph</hi> (1747-1793), son of the preceding, a more adventurous life
                    was allotted, and his part in the history of the French Revolution is one of the
                    most difficult problems to solve of that exciting period. He was born at St
                    Cloud in 1747, and bore the title of duke of Montpensier until his grandfather’s
                    death in 1752. He then became duke of Chartres, and in 1769 married Louise Marie
                    Adelaide de Bourbon Penthièvre, only daughter and heiress of the duke of
                    Penthièvre, grand admiral of France, and the richest heiress of the time. Her
                    wealth made it certain that he would be the richest man in France, and he
                    determined to play a part equal to that of his great-grandfather, the regent,
                    whom he resembled in character and debauchery. As duke of Chartres he opposed
                    the plans of Maupeou in 1771, and was promptly exiled to his country estate of
                    Villers-Cotterets (Aisne). When Louis XVI. came to the throne in 1774 Chartres
                    still found himself looked on coldly at court; Marie Antoinette hated him, and
                    envied him for his wealth, wit, and freedom from etiquette, and he was not slow
                    to return her hatred with scorn. In 1778 he served in the squadron of
                    D’Orvilliers, and was present in the naval battle of Ushant. He hoped to see
                    further service, but the queen was opposed to this, and he was removed from the
                    navy, and given the honorary post of colonel general of hussars. He then
                    abandoned himself to pleasure; he often visited London, and became an intimate
                    friend of the prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.); he brought to Paris the
                    “anglomania,” as it was called, and made jockeys as fashionable as they were in
                    England. He also made himself very popular in Paris by his large gifts to the
                    poor in time of famine, and by throwing open the gardens of the Palais Royal to
                    the people. Before the meeting of the notables in 1787 he had succeeded his
                    father as duke of Orleans, and showed his liberal ideas, which were largely
                    learnt in England, so boldly that he was believed to be aiming at becoming
                    constitutional king of France. In November he again showed his liberalism in the
                    <hi rend="italic">lit de justice,</hi> which Brienne had made the king hold, and
                    was again exiled to Villers-Cotterets. The approaching convocation of the
                    States-General made his friends very active on his behalf; he circulated in
                    every <hi rend="italic">bailliage</hi> the pamphlets which Sieyès had drawn up
                    at his request, and was elected in three—by the noblesse of Paris,
                    Villers-Cotterets, and Crépy-en-Valois. In the estate of the nobility he headed
                    the liberal minority under the guidance of Adrien Duport, and led the minority
                    of forty-seven noblemen who seceded from their own estate (June 1789) and joined
                    the Tiers État. The part he played during the summer of 1789 is one of the most
                    debated points in the history of the Revolution. The court accused him of being
                    at the bottom of every popular movement, and saw the “gold of Orleans” as the
                    cause of the Re-veilion riot and the taking of the Bastille, as the republicans
                    later saw the “gold of Pitt” in every germ of opposition to themselves. There
                    can be no doubt that he hated the queen, and bitterly resented his long court
                    disgrace, and also that he sincerely wished for a thorough reform of the
                    government and the establishment of some such constitution as that of England;
                    and no doubt such friends as Adrien Duport and Choderlos de Laclos, for their
                    own reasons, wished to see him king of France. The best testimony for the
                    behaviour of Orleans during this summer is the testimony of an English lady, Mrs
                    Grace Dalrymple Elliott, who shared his heart with Comtesse de Buffon, and from
                    which it is absolutely certain that at the time of the riot of 12th July he was
                    on a fishing excursion, and was rudely treated by the king on the next day when
                    going to offer him his services. He indeed became so disgusted with the false
                    position of a pretender to the crown, into which he was being forced, that he
                    wished to go to America, but, as Comtesse de Buffon would not go with him, he
                    decided to remain in Paris. He was again accused, unjustly, of having caused the
                    march of the women to Versailles on 5th October. La Fayette, jealous of his
                    popularity, persuaded the king to send the duke to England on a mission, and
                    thus get him out of France, and he accordingly remained in England from October
                    1789 to July 1790. On 7th July he took his seat in the Assembly, and on 2d
                    October both he and Mirabeau were declared by the Assembly entirely free of any
                    complicity in the events of October. He now tried to keep himself as much out of
                    the political world as possible, butin vain, for the court would suspect him,
                    and his friends would talk about his being king. The best proof of his not being
                    ambitious of such a doubtful piece of preferment is that he made no attempt to
                    get himself made king, regent, or lieutenant-general of the kingdom at the time
                    of the flight to Varennes in June 1791. He, on the contrary, again tried to make
                    his peace with the court in January 1792, but he was so insulted that he was not
                    encouraged to sacrifice himself for the sake of the king and queen, who
                    persisted in remembering all old enmities in their time of trouble. In the
                    summer of 1792 he was present for a short time with the army of the north, with
                    his two sons, the duke of Chartres and the duke of Montpensier, but had returned
                    to Paris before 10th August. After that day he underwent great personal risk in
                    saving fugitives; in particular, he saved the life of the count of Champcenetz,
                    the governor of the Tuileries, who was his personal enemy, at the request of Mrs
                    Elliott. It was impossible for him to recede, and, after accepting the title of
                    Citoyen Égalité, conferred on him by the commune of Paris, he was elected
                    twentieth and last deputy for Paris to the Convention. In that body he sat as
                    quietly as he had done in the National Assembly, but on the occasion of the
                    king’s trial he had to speak, and then only to give his vote for the death of
                    Louis. His compliance did not save him from suspicion, which was especially
                    aroused by the friendship of his eldest son, the duke of Chartres, with
                    Dumouriez, and when the news of the desertion of Chartres with Dumouriez became
                    known at Paris all the Bourbons left in France, including Égalité, were ordered
                    to be arrested on 5th April. In prison he remained till the month of October,
                    when the Reign of Terror began. He was naturally the very sort of victim wanted,
                    and he was decreed “of accusation” on 3d October. He was tried on 6th November
                    and was guillotined on the same day, with a smile upon his lips and without any
                    appearance of fear. No man ever was more blamed than Orleans during the
                    Revolution, but the faults of ambition and intrigue were his friends’, not his ·
                    it was his friends who wished him to be on the throne. Personally he possessed
                    the charming manners of a polished grand seigneur: debauched and cynical but
                    never rude or cruel, full of gentle consideration for all about him but selfish
                    in his pursuit of pleasure, he has had to bear a heavy load of blame, but it is
                    ridiculous to describe the idle and courteous voluptuary as being a dark and
                    designing scoundrel, capable of murder if it would serve his ambition. The
                    execution of Philippe Égalité made the friend of Dumouriez, who was living in
                    exile, duke of Orleans. Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">Philippe</hi> (1773-1850) was
                    known as duke of Orleans throughout his long emigration and under the
                    Restoration, and as duke of Orleans he was called upon to become king of the
                    French in 1830. His eldest son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ferdinand Louis Philippe
                    Charles Henri</hi> (1810-1842), at once took the title of duke of Orleans. He
                    was a brave soldier, and served in Algeria from 1834 to 1836. In 1837 he married
                    Princess Helena of Mecklenburg, and became the father of the count of Paris, who
                    is therefore <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> duke of Orleans. In 1839 he again
                    went to Algeria, but the fatigues of the campaign were too much for him. He died
                    at Neuilly in 1842. With him died the last duke of Orleans, for his son will not
                    take the title; but the whole party which supports him is rightly known as the
                    Orleanist party.</p>
