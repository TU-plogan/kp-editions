                    law, in which <hi rend="italic">obligatio</hi> signified a tie of law <hi
                    rend="italic">(vinculum juris}</hi> whereby one person is bound to perform or
                    forbear some act for another. The <hi rend="italic">obligatio</hi> of Roman law
                    arose either from voluntary acts or from circumstances to which legal
                    consequences were annexed. In the former case it was said to arise <hi
                    rend="italic">ex contractu,</hi> from contract, in the latter <hi rend="italic"
                    >quasi ex contractu, ex delicto,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quasi ex
                    delicto,—</hi> that is to say, from tort, or from acts or omissions to which the
                    law practically attached the same results as it did to contract or tort. <hi
                    rend="italic">Obligatio</hi> was used to denote either end of the legal chain
                    that bound the parties, the right of the party who could compel fulfilment of
                    the <hi rend="italic">obligatio,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">creditor,</hi> or
                    the duty of the party who could be compelled to fulfilment, the <hi
                    rend="italic">debitor.</hi> In English law obligation has only the latter sense.
                    Creditor and debtor have also lost their Roman law signification; they have been
                    narrowed to mean the parties where the obligation is the payment of a sum of
                    money. In English law obligation is used in at least four senses—(1) any duty
                    imposed by law; (2) the special duty created by a <hi rend="italic">vinculum
                    juris</hi>; (3) not the duty, but the evidence of the duty,—that is to say, an
                    instrument under seal, otherwise called a bond: (4) the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0762-0705"/> operative part of a bond. The third use of the
                    word is chiefly confined to the older writers. <hi rend="italic">Simplex</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">duplex</hi><hi rend="italic">obligatio</hi> were the old
                    names for what are now more commonly called a single and a double or conditional
                    bond. The party bound is still called the obligor, the party in whose favour the
                    bond is made the obligee. The fourth like the third, is a use scarcely found
                    except in the older writers. The word “bond” is of course a mere translation of
                    <hi rend="italic">obligatio.</hi> Obligations may be either perfect or
                    imperfect. A perfect obligation is one which is directly enforceable by legal
                    proceedings; an imperfect or moral obligation (the <hi rend="italic">naturalis
                    obligatio</hi> of Roman law) is one in which the <hi rend="italic">vinculum
                    juris</hi> is in some respects incomplete, so that it cannot be directly
                    enforced, though it is not entirely destitute of legal effect. A perfect
                    obligation may become imperfect by lapse of time or other means, and,
                    conversely, an imperfect obligation may under certain circumstances become
                    perfect. Thus a debt may be barred by the Statute of Limitations and so cease to
                    be enforceable. The obligation, however, remains, though imperfect, for if there
                    be a subsequent acknowledgment by the debtor, the debt revives, and the
                    imperfect obligation becomes again perfect. At one period there was some doubt
                    among English lawyers whether a moral obligation could be regarded as sufficient
                    consideration for a contract; it has now, however, been long decided that it
                    cannot be so regarded.</p>
                <p>The Scotch law as to obligations closely follows the Roman. As in English law,
                    the term obligation is used to express the instrument itself by which the
                    obligation is imposed. The bond or unilateral obligation of Scotch law is a
                    simple contract to pay the sum borrowed, &amp;c., with interest. The English
                    bond is generally a contract to pay double the sum of the debt, with a condition
                    that the bond is to be void if the debt be paid by a certain day. In Scotch law
                    gratuitous obligations rank in competition with the claims of creditors; in
                    English law a voluntary bond, though effectual against the grantor, cannot be
                    set up against creditors. Bonds in Scotland which are heritable securities still
                    rank as immovables for certain purposes, though they have been made movables as
                    regards the succession of the creditor, unless executors are expressly excluded
                    (31 and 32 Vict. c. 101, s. 117).</p>
                <p>American law is in general agreement with English, except in the case of
                    Louisiana, vdιere the terms obligor and obligee are used in as wide a sense as
                    the <hi rend="italic">debitor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">creditor</hi> of Roman
                    law. By art. 3522 of the Louisiana civil code obligor or debtor means the person
                    who has engaged to perform some obligation, obligee or creditor the person in
                    favour of whom some obligation is contracted, whether such obligation be to pay
                    money or to do or not to do something. The term obligation is important in
                    America from its use in art. i. s. 10 of the constitution of the United States,
                    “No State shall pass any law . . . impairing the obligation of contracts.” This
                    does not affect the power of Congress to pass such a law. Contracts between
                    private individuals are of course within the provision. So are private
                    conveyances, charters of private corporations, and statutory and other grants by
                    a State. On the other hand, marriage and divorce, and arrangements which are
                    political in their nature, such as charters of municipal corporations, licences
                    to carry on particular trades, or regulations of police, are not within the
                    provision. In order to fall within it, the law must act upon the terms of the
                    agreement, and not merely upon the mode of procedure. If it act not upon the
                    terms but upon the remedy, it impairs the obligation if it purport to be
                    retrospective, but it is valid so far as it applies to subsequent contracts.</p>
