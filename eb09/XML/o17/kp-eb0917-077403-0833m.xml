                <p><label type="entry">ONTARIO</label> is the name given under the confederation of
                    the provinces of British North America to what was previously known as Upper
                    Canada (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Canada).</hi> The river Ottawa, through a
                    considerable part of its course, forms the eastern boundary separating it from
                    the province of Quebec. Its southern and south-western boundaries are the Lakes
                    Ontario, Erie, St Clair, Huron, and Superior, with the St Lawrence, Niagara, St
                    Clair, Detroit, and St Mary rivers. The northern and western boundaries, which
                    had remained without precise determination so long as the region beyond was the
                    hunting-ground of the Hudson’s Bay Company, were defined in 1878 by arbitrators
                    named by the Dominion and provincial Governments. By this award the boundary
                    line is traced from a point determined by a line produced due north from the
                    head of Lake Temiscaming to James Bay, along the south shore of Hudson’s Bay
                    westerly to the mouth of the Albany river, and so by the river and lakes to the
                    head of Lake Joseph, and by Lac Seul and the English river to a point of
                    intersection with the meridian line drawn from the north-western angle of the
                    Lake of the Woods on the United States boundary. The legislature of Ontario
                    accepted this award as determining the limits, and defining the boundary line
                    between the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, but the Dominion Government
                    withheld its assent, and the final decision is now referred to the privy
                    council. The area of the province within the limits thus defined would be
                    197,000 square miles. Its area as given in the census returns of 1881 is 101,733
                    square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> The shores of Lakes Erie and
                    Ontario belong to the great plain of Canada, underlaid by Silurian and Devonian
                    limestone and shales, above which rest beds of clay and gravel. Its average
                    breadth is about 70 miles, and, though technically a plain, it is not merely
                    undulating, but is broken by shelving rocks and precipices. To the north of the
                    province a spur from the Laurentian chain in Quebec forms an extensive hilly
                    region, and runs southwards to the coasts of Lake Huron and the Georgian Bay.
                    Within the province there is a great variety of mineral wealth yet only
                    partially developed. Iron, of which, according to the census returns, the annual
                    yield is about 92,000 tons, is found in large quantities to the north of Lake
                    Ontario, between the Georgian Bay and the Ottawa river. Magnetic iron is
                    obtained in various bedsj red hematite in the Bruce copper-mines near Lake
                    Huron, and bog iron in the sandy tracks which flank the Laurentian hills. Copper
                    is found in the same region as iron, the Bruce mines yielding ore to the annual
                    value of £50,000. Silver abounds on the shores of Lake Superior, especially in
                    the neighbourhood of Thunder Bay,—Silver Islet, where the ore is dug 500 feet
                    below Lake Superior, containing one of the richest veins in the world. Gold is
                    obtained in the same region, but the yield is so uncertain as to discourage
                    regular enterprise. There are petroleum wells of immense value in the western
                    districts of the province, the annual yield being nearly 16,000,000 gallons of
                    crude petroleum. Salt brine is drawn up from deep wells at Goderich and the
                    neighbourhood, the annual yield being about 500,000 gallons. Mica is extensively
                    worked. Marble equal to that of Carrara is quarried in several districts. The
                    principal other minerals are galena, plumbago, antimony, arsenic, manganese,
                    calc-spar, and gypsum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture and Trade.—</hi> The oldest settled districts of
                    the province on the shores of Lakes Ontario and Erie, and on the intervening
                    peninsula of Niagara, are favoured in many respects by geographical position,
                    soil, and climate. The fertile area stretching westward between Lake Erie and
                    the Georgian Bay is often styled the “Garden of Canada.” The settled portions
                    include upwards of 9,000,000 acres, much of which has been long cleared and
                    brought into a high state of cultivation. Thousands of acres are planted as
                    orchards; and the apple crop is a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0838-0775"/> profitable branch of farm produce. In the still
                    earlier settled district of Niagara, which lies between the two great lakes, the
                    extremes alike of summer heat and winter cold are tempered by those large bodies
                    of water. There accordingly the peach, grape, and plum flourish; orchards of
                    apple and pear trees cover large areas; and, as seen from Queenston heights, the
                    landscape looks like a garden. The vine is indigenous, and grows luxuriantly in
                    the woods, as do all the smaller fruits.</p>
                <p>But the energy of more recent settlers has greatly extended cultivation. Bands of
                    pioneers, lumber-men, and free-grant settlers have carried the axe and the
                    plough into the Muskoka, Nipissing, and other northern districts; and those
                    regions are now accessible by steamboat and railway. The rich mineral regions of
                    Lake Superior are also filling up with settlers. The town of Prince Arthur’s
                    Landing, at the head of the lake, is now the terminus of the Canadian Pacific
                    Railway, and already numbers fully 2000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>According to the census of 1881, 19,259,909 acres were in occupation, of which
                    11,294,109 were improved, 304,815 being in gardens and orchards, and 10,989,294
                    under cultivation in pasture or grain and root crops. Much of the land is well
                    adapted for wheat, but in many places the crop has been grown too often. Barley,
                    oats, and pease are common crops. Maize and tomatoes ripen well. Tobacco and
                    sugar are profitable crops in some districts. The growth of flax is largely on
                    the increase. As the soil in nearly every part of the province is admirably
                    adapted for root crops, cattle are very largely kept, although there are no
                    extensive grazing districts. The beef trade with England has become very
                    extensive, and dairy-farming is largely prosecuted, especially the making of
                    cheese, a large number of cheese factories being now established on the
                    co-operative principle. Honey is an important source of revenue, about 1,200,000
                    lb being exported annually. There is a very large export of timber, including
                    pines, oak, elm, hackmatack, birch, maple, walnut, and hickory. In the official
                    returns of the exports of the different provinces some of the most valuable
                    produce of Ontario is included in the shipments from the ports of Quebec.
                    According to the trade and navigation tables for 1883, the total value of goods
                    entered for consumption was $44,452,804, or £9,134,143, and of exports
                    $32,890,019, or £6,758,242. The splendid natural water communications have been
                    extensively supplemented by railways, of which there are about 4000 miles in
                    operation. There are very extensive saw-mills at Ottawa. The manufacture of
                    agricultural implements employs a large number of persons throughout the
                    province, as does also that of machinery, sewing-machines, and edged tools.
                    Among the principal other manufactures are woollen goods (especially tweeds),
                    cottons, leather, paper, soap, and iron and hardware. According to the census
                    returns the total capital invested in the various industries, not including
                    agriculture but including cheese factories, was $80,950,847, the number of hands
                    employed 118,308, and the total value of products $157,989,870.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population in 1871 amounted to 1,620,851;
                    in 1881 it had increased to 1,923,228. Of this, the population of twelve towns
                    of upwards of 5000 inhabitants numbered in 1871 179,829. In 1881 the towns of a
                    population exceeding 5000 had increased from twelve to nineteen, with
                    inhabitants numbering 288,964, leaving the remaining population as occupants of
                    the small towns, rural villages, and farms. At the end of 1883 the population
                    was estimated at 1,935,130 (urban, 671,917; rural, 1,263,213).</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> One of the most distinctive features of the
                    province is its system of public instruction, to which special attention has
                    been given from an early period. So early as 1797 lands were set apart for
                    educational purposes; and there now exists a thoroughly efficient system of
                    public schools, high schools and collegiate institutes, provincial college and
                    university, under the administration of a minister of education as the head of
                    this department. The management of all funds for general educational purposes,
                    the provincial school inspectors, normal and model schools, &lt;fcc., are under
                    the direct charge of the educational department. Under its control the local
                    government is vested in boards of school trustees elected by the ratepayers in
                    rural districts or townships, villages, towns, counties, and cities, in
                    accordance with a general system of municipal organization. Each local board
                    determines the required rates to be levied for school purposes, purchases sites,
                    builds schoolhouses, appoints teachers from among those duly qualified and
                    holding Government certificates, and determines and pays their salaries. The
                    councils of county municipalities have certain powers and duties conferred on
                    them in reference to the townships, villages, and towns within each county. They
                    also select duly qualified inspectors, appoint county boards for the examination
                    of third-class teachers, and levy a rate equivalent to the amount of the
                    legislative educational grant to be expended in the payment of one-half of the
                    salaries of their teachers and school inspectors. Collegiate institutes and high
                    schools (in which a higher English course is taught, along with classics,
                    mathematics, and French and German, to pupils admitted from the public schools
                    on an entrance examination) are under the management of special boards of
                    trustees appointed by city or county councils, with the power of requiring the
                    council to raise all funds requisite for the efficient maintenance of the
                    schools. Provincial normal schools for training teachers are established at
                    Toronto and Ottawa, with model schools attached to them; and each county town
                    maintains a model school for training third-class teachers. The school-system is
                    thus mainly dependent on county and local rates levied for the purpose by
                    councils and school-boards elected by the people. This general system is
                    modified in one respect. In any locality where Roman Catholics reside in
                    sufficient numbers, they may require their share of the school funds <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n839/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0839-0776"/> and rates to be applied for the maintenance of
                    separate schools, under their own special school-board; but their teachers must
                    hold the same Government certificates as others. The system includes provision
                    for enforcing attendance of all children of school age, and, at the option of
                    the trustees, making education free of all charge. The report of the minister of
                    education for 1882 shows that there were in all 104 collegiate institutes and
                    high schools, 5013 public schools, and 193 Roman Catholic separate schools. The
                    system thus thoroughly organized has become a model for the other provinces of
                    the Dominion, with the exception of Quebec, where the Roman Catholic Church has
                    the control of the public schools, and a separate school-system is allowed for
                    the Protestant minority.</p>
                <p>Upper Canada College, founded at Toronto on the model of the great public schools
                    of England, was endowed with public lands, from which it now derives an annual
                    income of $15,000 in addition to its fees. The University of Toronto and
                    University College are endowed with lands from the proceeds of which an annual
                    income of upwards of $67,000 is derived. The university prescribes the
                    requirements in all examinations, appoints examiners, and confers degrees in the
                    faculties of law, medicine, and arts. University College gives instruction in
                    the departments of arts and science; but denominational and other colleges are
                    admitted to affiliation, and their students can proceed to degrees in the
                    university. University powers are also exercised by Victoria College, Cobourg,
                    under the control of the Methodist Church; Queen’s College, Kingston, under the
                    control of the Presbyterian Church; and Trinity College, Toronto, and the
                    Western University, London, both under the control of the Church of England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> Like the other provinces of Canada,
                    Ontario is under a lieutenant-governor, appointed for a term of four years by
                    the governor-general in council; the executive council numbers 6 ministers
                    responsible to the local legislature or house of assembly, which consists of 88
                    members. The province is represented by 24 senators in the Dominion Senate, and
                    by 92 members in the House of Commons. In addition to the counties and
                    representative towns there are four provisional districts :— Algoma, Muskoka,
                    Parry Sound, and Manitoulin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Lakes Ontario and Nipissing were visited by
                    Champlain in 1615, and Lake Superior by traders in 1660. Perrot took possession
                    of the district round Lake Huron in 1671. La Salle founded Niagara in 1679, and
                    in the same year the lakes were explored to Lake Michigan. A fort was built at
                    Toronto in 1749. Forming originally part of French Canada, Ontario, then
                    consisting of a few forts and trading ports, was conceded with that province to
                    Britain. Having previously formed part of the province of Quebec, it was, under
                    the name of Upper Canada, formed in 1791 into a distinct province, the first
                    parliament being held at Niagara, 17th November 1792. During the war with the
                    United States in 1812-15 the province was the seat of several conflicts.
                    Political dissent prevailed in it from 1820 until, in 1837, it culminated in
                    rebellion. In 1867 Upper Canada, under the name of Ontario, was made the chief
                    province of the Dominion of Canada. (D. W. )</p>
