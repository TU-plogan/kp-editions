                    Finland, on the N. and E. by Archangel and Vologda, and on the S. by Novgorod.
                    The area is 57,440 square miles. Its north-western portion belongs
                    orographically and geologically to the Finland region; it is covered with hills
                    reaching 1000 feet in height, and with numberless smaller ridges and hollows
                    running from north-west to south-east. The rest of the government is a flat
                    plateau sloping towards the marshy lowlands of the south. The geological
                    structure is very varied. Granites, syenites, and diorites, covered with
                    Laurentian metamorphic slates, occur extensively in the north-west. Near Lake
                    Onega they are covered with Devonian sandstones and limestones, yielding marble
                    and sandstone for building; to the south of that lake the Carboniferous
                    limestones and clays make their appearance. The whole is covered by vast beds of
                    boulder-clay,—the bottom moraine of the great ice-sheet of the Glacial period.
                    The entire region bears traces of glaciation, either in the shape of scratching
                    and elongated grooves on the rocks, or of eskers <hi rend="italic">(osar,
                    seigas')</hi> running parallel to the glacial striation. Numberless lakes, more
                    than 2000 being already laid down on the maps, still occupy the depressions of
                    the surface, while a great many more have left evidence of their past existence
                    in the shape of extensive marshes. Lake Onega covers 3765 square miles and
                    reaches a depth of 125 fathoms. Lakes Seg, Vyg, Lache, and Vodlo cover from 140
                    to 480 square miles each, and their crustacean fauna shows a former connexion
                    with the Arctic Ocean. The south-eastern part of Lake Ladoga belongs also to the
                    government of Olonetz. Altogether, the area covered by lakes, marshes, and
                    rivers reaches one-fifth of the whole surface. The rivers belong to the Baltic
                    and White Sea basins. To the former system belong Lakes Ladoga and Onega, which
                    are connected by the Svir and receive numerous streams; of these the Vytegra,
                    which communicates with the Mariinsk canal-system, and the Oyat, an affluent of
                    Lake Ladoga, are important for navigation. No less than 4,000,000 cwts. of
                    timber, fire-wood, stone, metal, and flour are annually shipped on waters
                    belonging to this government. The Onega river, which has its source in the
                    south-eastern parts of the government and flows into the White Sea, is of minor
                    importance. Seventy per cent, of the area of Olonetz is occupied by forests;
                    those of the crown, maintained for shipbuilding purposes, cover more than
                    800,000 acres.</p>
                <p>The climate is harsh and moist, the average yearly temperature at Petrozavodsk
                    (61° 8' N. lat.) being 33°∙6 Fahr, (12 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 0 in
                    January, 57 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 4 in July); the thermometer rarely
                    falls under - 30° Fahr. The population, which numbered 321,250 in 1881 (296,400
                    in 1873), is made up of Great Russians and Finns; Karelians and Tchudis are
                    estimated at about 52,000 each. The people mostly belong to the Greek Church, or
                    are Nonconformists. Sparse though it is, the population is still too dense in
                    certain places when the smallness of the area available for agriculture (only
                    the summits of the <hi rend="italic">selgas,</hi> or elongated ridges separated
                    by marshes) is taken into account. The villages are mostly small, and in several
                    parts of the government are still aggregated into federations of communes. Only
                    765,000 acres were under crops in 1877. Cattle and horse breeding, which are
                    much interfered with by plague, are insignificant. The chief source of wealth is
                    the timber-trade, next to which come fishing and hunting. Mushrooms and berries
                    are exported to St Petersburg. There are also quarries and iron-mines, and some
                    1600 men find employment in saw-mills, tanneries, iron-works, distilleries, and
                    flour-mills. More than one-fifth of the entire male population leave their homes
                    every year in search of employment. The government is divided into seven
                    districts, the chief towns of which are the capital Petrozavodsk (12,000
                    inhabitants), Kargopol, Olonetz, Povyenets, Vytegra, and Pudozh. Olonetz
                    includes the ‘ ‘ Olonetz Mining District,” a territory belonging to the crown,
                    which covers 432 square miles and extends partly into the Serdobol district of
                    Finland. The iron-works were begun by Peter I. in 1701-14. There is a population
                    of about 60,000, who were, until 1864, serfs to the crown.</p>
                <p>Olonetz was colonized by Novgorod in the 11th century, and though it suffered
                    much from Swedish invasion its towns soon became wealthy trading centres. Ivan
                    III. annexed it to the principality of Moscow.</p>
