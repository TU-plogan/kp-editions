                    genius never fails in the greatest danger. But his cunning is not of the narrow
                    kind that is incompatible with real wisdom; he is not troubled by scruples, but
                    he uses nobly and liberally a power that he has acquired by craft; he is fond of
                    adventure and yet full of prudence, very cautious and yet in case of need brave.
                    It is a character that in the hands of Homer is very fine, but which in those of
                    almost all other writers becomes repulsive. He was son of Laertes and Anticleia,
                    and king of Ithaca, a small rocky island on the western side of Greece. He
                    married Penelope, but very soon after his marriage he was summoned to the Trojan
                    war. Unwilling to go, he feigned madness, yoked an ox and a horse together, but
                    Palamedes discovered his deceit by means of his care for his infant child
                    Telemachus; afterwards Odysseus revenged himself by compassing the death of
                    Palamedes. Obliged to go to the war, he distinguished himself as the wisest
                    councillor of the Greeks, and finally, the capture of Troy, which the bravery of
                    Achilles could not accomplish, was attained by Odysseus’s stratagem of the
                    wooden horse. After the death of Achilles the Greeks adjudged his armour to
                    Odysseus as the man who had done most to make the war successful. When Troy was
                    captured he set sail for Ithaca, but was carried by unfavourable winds to the
                    coast of Africa. After encountering many adventures in all parts of the unknown
                    seas, among the lotus-eaters and the Cyclopes, in the isles of Aeolus and Circe
                    and the perils of Scylla and Charybdis, among the Laestrygons, and even in the
                    world of the dead, having lost all his ships and companions, he barely escaped
                    with his own life to the island of Calypso, where he was detained eight years,
                    an unwilling lover of the beautiful nymph. Then at the command of Zeus he was
                    sent homewards, but was again wrecked on the island of Phaeacia, whence he was
                    conveyed to Ithaca in one of the wondrous Phaeacian ships. Here he found that a
                    host of suitors, taking advantage of the youth of his son Telemachus, were
                    wasting his property and trying to force Penelope to marry one of them. The
                    stratagems and disguises by which he with a few faithful friends slew the
                    suitors are described at length in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the personality of Odysseus developed out of some germ in
                    primitive religious myth; but it is almost hopeless to seek for the early form,
                    so completely has it been transformed. In many heroes of poetry and mythology
                    the chief interest lies in tracing the growth of the conception from the divine
                    form of early religion to the Greek hero of poetry; but in the case of Odysseus
                    the supreme interest attaches to the perfect form as it appears in Homer, the
                    typical representative of the old sailor-race whose adventurous voyages educated
                    and moulded the Hellenic race. The period when the character of Odysseus grew
                    among the Ionian bards was when the Ionian ships were beginning to penetrate to
                    the farthest shores of the Black Sea, and to the western side of Italy, but when
                    Egypt had not yet been freely opened to foreign intercourse by Psammetichus and
                    his successors. The tale of Odysseus gives us the form in which the voyages, the
                    perils, the strange races of foreign lands, and the rich spoils of the sailors
                    were mirrored in the minds of the nation and sung by its poets.</p>

                    Weinsberg, a small town in the north of the modern kingdom of Würtemberg, but
                    then belonging to the Palatinate. He went to school at Weinsberg and Heilbronn,
                    and when twelve years old entered the university of Heidelberg, where he took
                    his bachelor’s degree in 1501. He seems at first to have intended to study for
                    the profession of law, and went to Bologna, but soon returned to Heidelberg and
                    betook himself to theology. He became a zealous student of the new learning and
                    passed from the study of Greek to that of Hebrew. He went from Heidelberg to
                    Tübingen, and thence to Stuttgart, making the acquaintance of Erasmus, Hedio,
                    and Reuchlin, and after some earlier essays in preaching became pastor at Basel
                    in 1515, serving under Christopher von Uttenheim, the evangelical bishop of
                    Basel. From the beginning the sermons of Oecolampadius had “Christ the
                    crucified” as their theme, and his first reformatory zeal showed itself in a
                    protest against the introduction of legends of the saints into Easter sermons.
                    While in Basel, preaching did not absorb all his energies; he was in daily
                    intercourse with learned friends at the university, and pursued his literary
                    researches and humanist studies. In 1518 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Greek Grammar.</hi> The same year he was asked to become pastor in the high
                    church in Augsburg. Germany was then ablaze with the questions raised by
                    Luther’s theses, and his introduction into this new world seems to have
                    compelled Oecolampadius to severe self-examination, which ended in his entering
                    a convent and becoming a monk. A short experiénee sufficed to convince him that
                    the monkish was not the ideal Christian life <hi rend="italic">(amisi monachum,
                    inveni Christianum),</hi> for in the beginning of 1522 he became private
                    chaplain to the famous Franz von Sickingen. He left his service in the end of
                    the same year and returned to Basel. Zwingli’s famous disputation at Zurich (in
                    1523) fired the minds of many in Switzerland, and among others stirred
                    Oecolampadius to make a more decided stand for reformation. He began to imitate
                    Zwingli and preach Reformed doctrine. To his surprise he found that the
                    humanists of the university did not countenance him in his zeal for evangelical
                    truth. When “disputations” were held, they prohibited the students and teachers
                    from attending. After more than a year of earnest preaching, after four public
                    disputations had been held, in which the popular verdict had been given in
                    favour of Oecolampadius and his friends, the authorities of Basel began to see
                    the necessity of some reformation. They began with the convents, and
                    Oecolampadius was able to refrain in public worship on certain festival days
                    from some practices he believed to be superstitious. Basel was slow to accept
                    the Reformation; the news of the Peasants’ War and the inroads of Anabaptists
                    prevented progress; but at last, in 1525, it seemed as if the authorities were
                    resolved to listen to schemes for restoring the purity of worship and teaching.
                    In the midst of these hopes and difficulties Oecolampadius married, in the
                    beginning of 1528, Wilibrandis Rosenblatt, the widow of Ludwig Keller, who
                    proved to be <hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">rixosa vel garrula vel
                    vaga,</hi> he says, and made him a good wife. After his death she married
                    Capito, and, when Capito died, Bucer. She died in 1564. In 1528 the mass and
                    image worship were at <pb break="no"

                    five years’ struggle was ended. He lived on, growing in influence in Basel and
                    throughout south Germany, three years longer, and died in November 1531.</p>
                <p>(Ecolampadius was not a great theologian, like Luther, Zwingli, or Calvin, and
                    yet he was a trusted theological leader. With Zwingli he represented the Swiss
                    views at the unfortunate conference at Marburg, and had proved himself, by his
                    defence of Zwingli’s doctrine of the Lord’s Supper against both Brenz and
                    Luther, an able controversialist. He was a man of very wide sympathies. His
                    readiness to sympathize with the early Reformatory movements in France and his
                    eager welcome of the Waldenses were of great value to the Swiss Church.</p>
