                    “harlequin opal” these rainbow-tints are flashed forth from small flakes,
                    forming a kind of polychromatic mosaic, while in other kinds of opal the colours
                    are disposed in broad bands or in irregular patches of comparatively large area.
                    The tints vary with the angle at which the light is incident, and with the
                    relative position of the stone and the observer, so that by moving the opal a
                    brilliant succession of flashes of fire may be obtained. Careful examination of
                    a precious opal shows that these flashes are reflected from surfaces of
                    irregular dimensions, situated at different depths in the translucent stone, and
                    intersecting at various angles. The colours are not due to the presence of any
                    material pigment in the mineral, but are optical effects due to certain
                    structural peculiarities.</p>
                <p>According to Sir David Brewster the colours of the opal may be referred to the
                    presence of multitudes of microscopic pores arranged in parallel lines, the
                    differences of tint arising from differences in the magnitude of these cavities.
                    Μ. Descloizeaux, a very high authority on the optical properties of minerals,
                    has also connected the iridescence of the opal with a regular system of internal
                    cavities, but at the same time seems disposed to think that the colours bear
                    some relation to the presence of a small quantity of organic matter in the
                    mineral. Mr Crookes refers the colours to delicate striae or minute fissures
                    lying in different planes within the opal. The whole subject has been
                    exhaustively studied by H. Behrens, who explains the colour as due not to
                    reflexion from the walls of cavities but to the interposition of very thin
                    lamellae possessing a different index of refraction from that of the matrix in
                    which they are embedded. He has detected in the opal a variety of microscopic
                    enclosures, including flecks of hydrophane and delicate laminae of ferric oxide.
                    On the whole, therefore, it seems likely that the iridescence of the opal is
                    simply a case of the well-known colours of thin plates. A ray of light is
                    reflected from the anterior surface of an attenuated film; another ray, having
                    traversed the lamina, is reflected from the posterior surface; and the meeting
                    of these rays differing in phase gives rise to interference phenomena.</p>
                <p>The noble opal, in consequence of its brilliant iridescence, is valued as an
                    ornamental stone. It is displayed to best advantage when cut <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">cabochon</hi> or with a convex surface. Pliny relates
                    that the rich Roman senator Nonius was proscribed by Mark Antony for the sake of
                    a magnificent <hi rend="italic">opalus</hi> which he possessed, a stone as large
                    as a hazel nut, and valued at 20,000 sesterces.</p>
                <p>The precious opal occurs in veins in trachytic rocks, chiefly in Hungary. The
                    best-known localities are Czerwenitza and Kaschau, but the most brilliantly -
                    coloured stones are said to come from Kremnitz and Dubnik. It is found also in
                    Honduras, principally near Gracias a Dios, where it occurs in like manner,
                    forming veins in volcanic rocks. The American opal is generally less milky and
                    less fiery than the Hungarian. Of late years some very brilliant opal has been
                    sent into the market from Queensland. This is found as thin films spread over
                    the walls of fissures in ironstone nodules, occurring in the neighbourhood of
                    the Baracorra river. It is generally too thin to be cut <hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">cabochon,</hi> but is largely used for <hi
                    rend="italic">camei,</hi> the iridescent layers showing to great advantage
                    against the ironstone matrix, which when polished assumes a dark-brown colour.
                    The so-called “black opals,” which have lately become popular, consist of this
                    matrix penetrated in all directions by veins and spots of opal, forming a
                    mixture sometimes known as “root of opal.” Certain stones sold as black opals
                    have evidently been modified in colour by staining or by heat.</p>
