                    October 1610. He was grandson of Walter, earl of Ormonde, and eldest son of
                    Thomas, Viscount Thurles, and Elizabeth Poyntz.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His pedigree extends back to Henry II.’s
                    expedition to Ireland, when Theobald Walter received, in addition to large
                    estates, the hereditary butlership of Ireland, and the prisage of λvines, which
                    formed an important part of the vast wealth which the family always possessed.
                    The title of Ormonde appears to have been granted to James the “noble earl,” who
                    by the female side was a great-grandson of Edward I. This title, at the request
                    of Henry VIII., the 8th earl resigned to Sir Thomas Boleyn, receiving that of
                    Ossory instead, and regaining that of Ormonde at Boleyn’s death. The 9th earl,
                    having borne a chief part in the suppression of the Geraldine rebellion,
                    received a grant of the defeated chieftain’s lands, and, in recognition of his
                    further efforts when Henry threw off his allegiance to the pope, the title of
                    Viscount Thurles was given him.</p></note> His father having been drowned (15th
                    December 1619) during the lifetime of Earl Walter, he became heir to the title
                    and estates. By some legal artifice the boy was made a royal ward, and James I.
                    at once removed him from his Catholic tutor and placed him in the household of
                    Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he stayed until 1626, after which he
                    resided with his grandfather. In 1629, by his marriage with his cousin
                    Elizabeth, the daughter of the earl of Desmond, he put an end to the
                    long-standing quarrel between the families. In 1630 he accompanied the old earl
                    to Carrick, and in 1632 succeeded him in the earldom.</p>
                <p>He was already noted, as had been many of his race, for his fine presence and
                    great bodily vigour. ' His active career began with the arrival of Strafford in
                    1633. In all ways he was forward in assisting the deputy, but showed such
                    independence and masterfulness of character, along with considerable capacity,
                    that Strafford was for a while doubtful whether to crush or to favour him.
                    Reflecting that Ormonde was one of the richest and probably the most influential
                    of the Irish nobility, he decided to secure his interest; and Ormonde was
                    throughout his government his chief friend and support. Such was the confidence
                    felt in him that in April 1640, when Strafford was with Charles, he was made
                    commander-in-chief of the forces. In August he was appointed lieutenant-general
                    of the kingdom by Strafford, who, upon the death of Wandesford in December,
                    urged Charles to make him deputy. His loyalty to his chief was shown by the
                    vehemence with which he defended him against the attacks of the Irish House of
                    Commons. Upon Strafford’s death, and, it is said, at his request, Ormonde was
                    offered the vacant Garter, but refused it for reasons characteristic of the man
                    (Carte). On the arrival of the news of the rebellion in 1641 he received another
                    commission as lieutenant-general from Charles himself, and, though much hampered
                    by the lords justices, he did admirable service in the expedition to the Naas,
                    and in the march into the Pale in 1642, after the rebellion had drawn in the
                    Roman Catholic gentry of English descent. In both of these expeditions the
                    ferocious traditions of Irish warfare were but too faithfully followed. So
                    highly were his services regarded that he was publicly complimented by the
                    English Parliament, who, along with their letter of thanks, sent him a jewel of
                    the value of £620. On 15th April 1642 he gained the battle of Kilrusli against
                    Lord Mountgarret, and on 18th March in the following year that of Ross against
                    Preston. In September 1643, the civil war in England having meanwhile broken
                    out, the opposition between Ormonde, who always stood much upon his dignity, and
                    the lords justices became more open and acute. Ormonde, seeing that the large
                    army of Scots in Ulster was both unable to cope with the rebels and was
                    ill-disposed to the king, and that the rebels had been successful at many
                    points, concluded on 15th September the “cessation” with the latter, having
                    power from Charles to treat with the recusants. He had previously, on 16th
                    September 1642, been made a marquis by the king, and had been offered the
                    lord-lieutenantship. This, however, he declined; but his command was made
                    independent of Leicester. Ormonde now threw himself unreservedly into Charles’s
                    cause, and at his command sent a body of troops into England, having first
                    exacted an oath of loyalty from the officers (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Monk);</hi> it, however, was shortly afterwards routed by Fairfax at the
                    raising of the siege of Nantwich. On the arrival of the news of the “cessation”
                    Charles, anxious to be quit of the Irish problem, which was complicated by the
                    refusal of the Ulster Scots to concur in the “cessation,” and desirous at the
                    same time to see the country in safe hands, again offered Ormonde the supreme
                    post, which he now accepted, receiving his commission in January 1644, with
                    special instructions to do all in his power to keep the Scotch army occupied. In
                    all the complications of Scots, Old Irish, Catholic Irish of English race, and
                    Protestants, and in face of the intrigues of the Pope’s nuncio as well as of the
                    attempts of the Parliament’s commissioners to Ulster to ruin his power, he
                    showed firmness and ability, and especially did his utmost to assist Antrim in
                    his expedition into Scotland. He kept his post until the ground was cut from
                    beneath him by Glamorgan’s treaty with the Catholics in 1646, and until it was
                    clear that he could not long hope to hold Dublin against the Irish rebels. He
                    thereupon applied to the English Parliament, gave Dublin into their hands upon
                    terms which protected the interests of both Protestants and Roman Catholics so
                    far as they had not actually entered into rebellion, and sailed for England at
                    the beginning of August 1647. He attended Charles during August and October at
                    Hampton Court, and, after the king’s escape to the Isle of Wight, appears to
                    have been his agent in the preliminary negotiation regarding the “engagement”
                    with the Scots. Having good reason to fear that the Parliament intended to
                    secure his person, he hurriedly left England and joined the queen and prince of
                    Wales at Paris in March 1648, where he was of great service in dealing with the
                    agents of the revolted Irish. In September of the same year, the pope’s nuncio
                    having been expelled, and affairs otherwise looking favourable, he returned to
                    Ireland to endeavour to unite all parties for the king. He concluded a peace
                    with the rebels on the basis of the free exercise of their religion, proclaimed
                    Charles II., and upheld the royal cause with great vigouι∙ though with slight
                    success. He was meanwhile urgent with Charles that he should come in person, but
                    was outwitted and overborne by the Scots and their friends at the king’s court.
                    Cromwell having become irresistible, and Charles, under the influence of Argyll,
                    having annulled the peace just concluded, Ormonde returned to France in 1650. He
                    had meanwhile, in September 1649, received the Garter from Charles II.</p>
                <p>Ormonde now, though in great straits for want of money, resided in constant
                    attendance upon Charles and the queenmother at Paris, and accompanied the former
                    when, on his dismissal from France, he went to Aix and Cologne. He appears to
                    have incurred the queen’s enmity by frustrating<pb break="no"

                    Gloucester to become Catholic. In 1658, at great risk, he went upon a secret
                    mission into England, to gain trustworthy intelligence as to the chances of a
                    rising.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a notice of
                    this see Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi> 8th June 1658.</p></note> He
                    attended the king at the treaty of Fontarabia, and was actively engaged in the
                    secret transactions immediately preceding the Restoration. In the distribution
                    of honours which followed he had a considerable share: he was at once made lord
                    steward of the household, a privy councillor, lord-lieutenant of Somerset, high
                    steward of Westminster, Kingston, and Bristol, chancellor of Dublin University,
                    Baron Butler of Llanthony, and earl of Brecknock; and on 30th March 1661 he was
                    created duke of Ormonde in the Irish peerage and lord high steward of England.
                    At the same time large grants, in recompense of the fortune he had spent in the
                    royal service, were made by the king, while in the following year the Irish
                    parliament presented him with £30,000. His losses, however, according to Carte,
                    exceeded his gains by a sum almost incredibly enormous. On 4th November 1661 he
                    once more received the lord-lieutenantship of Ireland, and was busily engaged in
                    the settlement of that country until 1664, His heart was in his government, and
                    he vehemently opposed the bill prohibiting the importation of Irish cattle,
                    which struck so fatal a blow at her trade; and, when it was passed, in order to
                    lessen, as he thought, the misfortune, he prohibited the import of Scotch linen,
                    and, further, obtained leave for a certain number of Irish vessels to trade with
                    the foreign enemies of England. He encouraged Irish manufactures and learning to
                    the utmost, and it was to his efforts that the Irish College of Physicians owes
                    its incorporation.</p>
                <p>Ormonde’s personality had always been a striking one. He had been noted for
                    purity of life and purpose, and for generous and unswerving devotion to the
                    royal cause, when purity and devotion, stimulated by the great argument, were
                    not rare in the court of Charles I, In the court of Charles II. he assumed a
                    still more noteworthy character. At a time when every form of baseness had free
                    course, he figured as almost the sole representative of the high-toned virtues
                    of a nobler generation. Where everything was little he, by force of what is
                    emphatically called “character <hi rend="italic">” far more</hi> than by any
                    special ability, was great. The friend and comrade of Strafford, one who had in
                    the royal cause ungrudgingly spent a princely fortune, we see him standing aloof
                    while persons like Bennet intrigued and lied for office or money. Of strict
                    purity of life, he was a living rebuke to the Sedleys and Castlemaines who
                    turned the court into a brothel. Compelled to see the councils of the king
                    guided by dishonour, he acquired over him the influence which Charles was always
                    ready to concede to greatness <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Pepys, 19th May
                    1668). Proud of the loyalty of his race, which had been unspotted through five
                    centuries, he bore with silent self-respect calumny, envy, and his seven years’
                    loss of court favour, waiting until his master should be shamed into an
                    acknowledgment of the wrong.</p>
                <p>He soon became the mark for attack from all that was worst in the court.
                    Buckingham especially did his utmost to undermine his influence. In his almost
                    irresponsible government of Ireland during troublous times Ormonde had no doubt
                    acted now and then in a way which offered advantage to men eager for his
                    overthrow. He had billeted soldiers on civilians, and had executed martial law.
                    The impeachment, however, threatened by Buckingham fell through. Nevertheless,
                    by 1669, constant importunity had had its usual effect upon Charles, and Ormonde
                    was removed from the government of Ireland and from the committee for Irish
                    affairs. He made no complaint, insisted that his sons and others over whom he
                    had influence should retain their posts, and continued to fulfil with dignified
                    persistence the duties of his other offices. The compromise made by Charles with
                    his conscience was marked by a public declaration that, in spite of what had
                    happened, Ormonde had in no degree lost his confidence.</p>
                <p>By way of recompense, unsought honours came to him and his family. At the
                    suggestion of Sheldon, Oxford chose him as her chancellor, while Dublin,
                    ignoring Roberts, the new lord-lieutenant, gave to his eldest son Ossory the
                    freedom of the city.</p>
                <p>In 1670, while driving through London, he was attacked and dragged out of his
                    carriage by the well-known ruffian Blood, who had been deeply concerned in the
                    attempt upon Dublin Castle in 1663. By whom he was set upon this deed is not
                    known, though Ossory publicly laid it to the charge of Buckingham. Nothing
                    appears to have saved Ormonde’s life but the whim of Blood to hang him at
                    Tyburn. The delay thus caused, and Ormonde’s vigorous resistance, gave time for
                    rescue. What was the mysterious connexion between Blood and the court has never
                    been discovered; but it is certain that Charles, when Blood was captured,
                    himself asked Ormonde to pardon him.</p>
                <p>In 1671 Richard Talbot came over from Ireland in order, if possible, to secure
                    the repeal of the Act of Settlement in favour of the dispossessed Irish gentry.
                    Ormonde was placed on the committee of investigation, and did his utmost to
                    frustrate Talbot’s endeavours.</p>
                <p>The return of Ormonde to favour, and his appointment to the government of Ireland
                    in 1677, were characteristic both of the times and of Charles himself (Carte).
                    It appears probable that it was the result in a great measure of the desire of
                    James to set up a rival to Monmouth, for whom Shaftesbury had requested the
                    lord-lieutenantship. On his arrival in Ireland he was for a considerable time
                    occupied in placing the revenue and the army upon a proper footing. Upon the
                    outbreak of the Popish terror in England he at once took the most vigorous and
                    comprehensive steps, though with as little harshness as possible, towards
                    rendering the Catholics, who were in the proportion of 15 to 1, powerless
                    (Carte). So mild, however, did his measures appear that they served, in spite of
                    the fact that Ireland was kept in perfect peace, as a reason for an attack upon
                    him in England, which was led by Shaftesbury, and from which he was defended
                    with great spirit by his son Ossory, He kept his course, giving even justice to
                    both religious parties, and Charles had the good sense to refuse to remove
                    him.</p>
                <p>Hitherto Ormonde had been singularly fortunate in his family life. But in 1680 he
                    lost his eldest son Ossory, a pure and gallant man, and this was but the
                    beginning of his private sorrows. In 1682 Charles summoned Ormonde to court, and
                    from that time retained him about his person. His first duty was to answer, at
                    the king’s request, the memoirs published by the earl of Castlehaven, in which
                    he had reflected upon Charles I. His vigour also during the election of aidermen
                    and during the disputed election of sheriffs for the city after Shaftesbury’s
                    acquittal was of the greatest service to the court. On 9th November 1683 an
                    English dukedom was conferred upon him, and in J une 1684 he returned to
                    Ireland; scarcely, however, had he set out when intrigues against him once more
                    proved successful, and he was recalled in October, Before, however, he could
                    give up his government to Rochester, Charles II. died, and Ormonde’s last act as
                    lord-lieutenant was to proclaim James II. in Dublin, On his return to London he
                    was met with all the pomp and ceremony which, while himself of simple tastes, he
                    had always practised as befitting <pb break="no"

                    retirement at Cornbury (Oxfordshire), signalizing, however, his loyalty to
                    Protestantism and the Church of England by opposing the attempts of James to
                    assume the dispensing power, in spite of which James to his credit refused to
                    take away his offices, and continued to hold him in respect and favour to the
                    last. On Saturday, 21st July 1688, he died quietly of decay, not having, as he
                    rejoiced to know, “outlived his intellectuals.” He was buried in Westminster
                    Abbey on the 1st of August.</p>
