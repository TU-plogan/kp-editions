                <p><label type="entry">OATH</label>, Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">âdh,</hi> a word
                    found throughout the Teutonic languages (Gothic <hi rend="italic">aiths,</hi>
                    modern German <hi rend="italic">eid),</hi> but without ascertainable etymology.
                    The verb to <hi rend="italic">swear</hi> is also Old Teutonic (Gothic <hi
                    rend="italic">svaran,</hi> modern German <hi rend="italic">schioören)·,</hi>
                    this word, too, is not clear in original meaning, but is in some way connected
                    with the notion of answering, —indeed it still forms part of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">answer,</hi> Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">and-swarian ∙,</hi> it
                    has been suggested that the swearer answered by word or gesture to a solemn
                    formula or act. Among other terms in this connexion, the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >jurare,</hi> whence English law has such derivatives as <hi rend="italic"
                    >jury,</hi> seems grounded on the metaphorical idea of binding (root <hi
                    rend="italic">ju,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">jungo)</hi>; the similar idea of
                    a bond or restraint may perhaps be traced in the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >opκo&lt;s.</hi> It may be worth notice that the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacramentum</hi> (whence modern French <hi rend="italic">serment)</hi> does not
                    really imply the sacredness of an oath, but had its origin in the money paid
                    into court in a Roman lawsuit, the loser forfeiting his pledge, which went to
                    pay for the public rites <hi rend="italic">(sacra)</hi>; thence the word passed
                    to signify other solemn pledges, such as military and judicial oaths.</p>
                <p>The subject of oaths and swearing, difficult in itself, has been made more
                    obscure by the unsatisfactory methods employed by most writers on it. This is
                    not due to want of ability in the writers themselves, among whom are included
                    such men as Calvin and Paley, but to their not having followed their subject on
                    the lines of historical development; on the contrary, the usual plan has been to
                    accommodate to modern views, and discuss with modern arguments, an institution
                    which originated in an early stage of knowledge, and has been confused by the
                    changes it has undergone while being carried on into the midst of new ideas. The
                    student who finds, by consulting modern theological and legal authorities, how
                    indefinite are their views of the binding operation of an oath and the
                    consequences of breaking it (apart from prosecution for perjury) will understand
                    that its meaning must be sought, not among those who now administer and take it,
                    but in the history of older states of culture in which it arose. The very
                    formula, “so help you God,” by which legal oaths are administered in England,
                    has not for ages had any precise signification.</p>
                <p>An oath may be defined as an asseveration or promise made under non-human penalty
                    or sanction. Writers, viewing the subject among civilized nations only, have
                    sometimes defined the oath as an appeal to a deity. It will be seen, however, by
                    some following examples, that the harm or penalty consequent on perjury may be
                    considered to result directly, without any spirit or deity being mentioned;
                    indeed it is not unlikely that these mere direct curses invoked on himself by
                    the swearer may be more primitive than the invocation of divinities to punish.
                    Oaths scarcely belong to the lowest or savage level of life, unless when rude
                    tribes may have learned them from more civilized neighbours. Their original
                    appearance may rather have been in a somewhat higher barbaric stage of society,
                    where legal forms had already come into use, and oaths were needed as a means of
                    strengthening testimony or promise. Examples of the simplest kind of curse-oath
                    may be seen among the Nagas of Assam, where two men will lay hold of a dog or a
                    fowl by head and feet, which is then chopped in two with a single blow of the
                    dao, this being emblematic of the fate expected to befall the perjurer. Or a man
                    will stand within a circle of rope, with the implication that if he breaks his
                    vow he may rot as a rope does, or he will take hold of the barrel of a gun, a
                    spearhead, or a tiger’s tooth, and solemnly declare, “If I do not faithfully
                    perform this my promise, may I fall by this!” (Butler in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal,</hi> 1875, p. 316). Another stage in the history of
                    oaths is that in which the swearer calls on some fierce beast to punish him if
                    he lies, believing that it has the intelligence to know what he says and the
                    power to interfere in his affairs. In Siberia, in lawsuits between Russians and
                    the wild Ostyaks, it is described as customary to bring into court the head of a
                    bear, the Ostyak making the gesture of eating, and calling on the bear to devour
                    him in like manner if he does not tell the truth (Erman, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Travels in Siberia,</hi> vol. i. p. 492, London, 1848). Similar oaths are still
                    sworn on the head or skin of a tiger by the Santals and other indigenous tribes
                    of India. To modern views, a bear or a tiger seems at any rate a more rational
                    being to appeal to than a river or the sun, but in the earlier stage of
                    nature-religion these and other great objects of nature are regarded as animate
                    and personal. The prevalence of river-worship is seen in the extent to which in
                    the old and modern world oaths by rivers are most sacred. In earlier ages men
                    swore inviolably by Styx or Tiber, and to this day an oath on water of the
                    Ganges is to the Hindu the most binding of pledges, for the goddess will take
                    awful vengeance on the children of the perjurer In New Guinea certain tribes are
                    reported to swear by the sun, or a mountain, or a weapon, that the sun may burn
                    them, or the mountain crush them, or the weapon wound them if they forswear
                    themselves. The Tunguz brandishes a knife before the sun, saying, “If I lie may
                    the sun plunge sickness into my entrails like this knife.” The natural
                    transition from swearing by these great objects of nature to invoking gods
                    conceived in human form is well shown in the treaty-oath between the Macedonians
                    and the Carthaginians recorded by Polybius (vii. 9); here the sun and moon and
                    earth, the rivers and meadows and waters, are invoked side by side with Zeus and
                    Hera and Apollo, and the gods of the Carthaginians. The heaven-god, able to
                    smite the perjurer with his lightning, was invoked by the Romans, when a hog was
                    slain with the sacred flint representing the thunderbolt, with the invocation to
                    Jove so to smite the Roman people if they broke the oath (Liv., i. 24; Polyb.,
                    iii. 25). Another form of this Aryan rite was preserved by the old Slavonic
                    nation of Prussia, where a man would lay his right hand on his own neck and his
                    left on the holy oak, saying, “May Perkun (the thundergod) destroy me !” The
                    oaths of the lower culture show <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n756/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0756-0699"/> a remarkable difference from those of later
                    stages. In the apparently primitive forms the curse on the perjurer is to take
                    effect in this world, as when an African negro swears by his head or limbs,
                    which will wither if he lies; this kind of oath by the swearer’s body is still
                    found in both the Eastern and the Western worlds, and generally with the same
                    implication of evil to fall on the part sworn by. But as nations became more
                    observant, experience must have shown that bears and tigers were as apt to kill
                    truth-tellers as perjurers, and that even the lightningflash falls without moral
                    discrimination. In the <hi rend="italic">Clouds</hi> of Aristophanes, indeed,
                    men have come openly to ridicule such beliefs, the Socrates of the play pointing
                    out that notorious perjurers go unharmed, while Zeus hurls his bolts at his own
                    temple, and the tall oaks, as if an oak-tree could perjure itself. The doctrine
                    of miraculous earthly retribution on the perjurer lasted on in legend, as where
                    Eusebius relates how three villains conspired to bring a false accusation
                    against Narcissus, bishop of Jerusalem, which accusation they confirmed by
                    solemn oath before the church, one wishing that if he swore falsely he might
                    perish by fire, one that he might die of the pestilence, one that he might lose
                    his eyes; a spark no man knew from whence burned to ashes the first perjurer’s
                    house and all within, the second was consumed by the plague from head to foot,
                    whereupon the third confessed the crime with tears so copious that he lost his
                    sight (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi. 9). Asa general rule,
                    however, the supernatural retribution on perjury has been transferred from the
                    present world to the regions beyond the grave, as is evident from any collection
                    of customary oaths. A single instance will show at once the combination of
                    retributions in and after the present life, and the tendency to heap up remote
                    penalties in the vain hope of securing present honesty. The Siamese Buddhist in
                    his oath, not content to call down on himself various kinds of death if he
                    breaks it, desires that he may afterwards be cast into hell to go through
                    innumerable tortures, among them to carry water over the flames in a wicker
                    basket to assuage the thirst of the infernal judge, then that he may migrate
                    into the body of a slave for as many years as there are grains of sand in four
                    seas, and after this that he may be born a beast through five hundred
                    generations and an hermaphrodite five hundred more.</p>
                <p>The forms of oath belonging to all nations and ages, various as they are in
                    detail, come under a few general heads. It may be first observed that gestures
                    such as grasping hands, or putting one hand between the hands of another in
                    token of homage, are sometimes treated as of the nature of oaths, but wrongly
                    so, they being rather of the nature of ceremonies of øompact. The Hebrew
                    practice of putting the hand under another’s thigh is usually reckoned among
                    oath-rites, but it may have been merely a ceremony of covenant (Gen. xxiv. 2,
                    xlvii. 29; see Joseph., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> i. 16). Even the covenant
                    among many ancient and modern nations by the parties mixing their blood or
                    drinking one another’s is in itself only a solemn rite of union, not an oath
                    proper, unless some such ceremony is introduced as dipping weapons into the
                    blood, as in the form among the ancient Scythians (Herod., iv. 70); this, by
                    bringing in the idea of death befalling the covenant-breaker, converts the
                    proceeding into an oath of the strongest kind. The custom of swearing by
                    weapons, though frequent in the world, is far from consistent in meaning. It may
                    signify, in cases such as those just mentioned, that the swearer if forsworn is
                    to die by such a weapon; or the warrior may appeal to his weapon as a powerful
                    or divine object, as Parthenopaeus swears by his spear that he will level to the
                    ground the walls of Thebes (Aeschyl., <hi rend="italic">Sept, contra Theb.,</hi>
                    530; see the custom of the Quadi in Ammian. Marcellin., xvii.); or the weapon
                    may be a divine emblem, as when the Scythians swore by the wind and the sword as
                    denoting life and death (Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Toxaris,</hi> 38). Oaths by
                    weapons lasted into the Christian period; for instance, the Lombards swore
                    lesser oaths by consecrated weapons and greater on the Gospels (see Ducange, <hi
                    rend="italic">s.v.</hi> “Juramenta super arma”; Grimm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Rechtsalterth.,</hi> p. 896). Stretching forth the hand towards the
                    object or deity sworn by is a natural gesture, well shown in the oath of
                    Agamemnon, who with uplifted hands (∆ιι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> χeζpας
                    άναο-χών) takes Heaven to witness with Sun and Earth and the Erinnyes who below
                    the earth wreak vengeance on the perjurer (Homer, <hi rend="italic">Il.,</hi>
                    xix. 254; see also Pindar, <hi rend="italic">Olymp.,</hi> vii. 120). The gesture
                    of lifting the hand towards heaven was also an Israelite form of oath: Abraham
                    says, “I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah,” while Jehovah Himself is
                    represented as so swearing, “For I lift up My hand to heaven, and say, I live
                    for ever” (Gen. xiv. 22; Deut, xxxii. 40; see Dan. xii. 7; Rev. x. 5). This
                    gesture established itself in Christendom, and has continued to modern times. In
                    England, for example, in the parliament at Shrewsbury in 1398, when the Lords
                    took an oath on the cross of Canterbury never to suffer the transactions of that
                    parliament to be changed, the members of the Commons held up their hands to
                    signify their taking upon themselves the same oath (J. E. Tyler, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oaths,</hi> p. 99). In France a juror takes oath by raising his
                    hand, saying, “Je jure !” The Scottish judicial oath is taken by the witness
                    holding up his right hand uncovered, and repeating after the usher, “I swear by
                    Almighty God, and as I shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, that I
                    will,” &amp;c. In the ancient world sacrifice often formed part of the ceremony
                    of the oath; typical examples may be found in the Homeric poems, as in
                    Agamemnon’s oath already mentioned, or the compact between the Greeks and
                    Trojans <hi rend="italic">(Il.,</hi> iii. 276), where wine is poured out in
                    libation, with prayer to Zeus and the immortal gods that the perjurer’s brains
                    shall, like the wine, be poured on the ground; the rite thus passes into a
                    symbolic curse-oath of the ordinary barbaric type. Connected with such
                    sacrificial oaths is the practice of laying the hand on the victim or the altar,
                    or touching the image of the god. A classic instance is in a comedy of Plautus
                    <hi rend="italic">(Rudens,</hi> v. 2, 45), where Gripus says, “Tange aram hanc
                    Veneris,” and Labrax answers “Tango” (Greek instance, Thucyd., v. 47; see
                    Justin, xxiv. 2). Thus Livy (xxi. 1) introduces the phrase “touching the sacred
                    objects” <hi rend="italic">(tactis sacris)</hi> into the picturesque story of
                    Hannibal’s oath. Details of the old Scandinavian oath have been preserved in
                    Iceland in the Landnâmabôk <hi rend="italic">(Islendinga</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sögur,</hi> Copenhagen, 1843): a bracelet (baugr) of two rings or more was to
                    be kept on the altar in every head court, which the godi or priest should wear
                    at all law-things held by him, and should redden in the blood of the bullock
                    sacrificed, the witness pronouncing the remarkable formula: “Name I to witness
                    that I take oath by the ring, law-oath, so help me Frey, and Niörd, and almighty
                    Thor/’ (hialpi mer svâ Freyr, ok Niördr, ok hinn almâttki Ass), &amp;c. This was
                    doubtless the great oath on the holy ring or bracelet which the Danes swore to
                    King Alfred to quit his kingdom (“on tham halgan beage,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anglo-Sax. Chron.</hi>; “in eorum armilla sacra,” Ethelwerd, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chron.,</hi> iv.). An oath, though not necessarily expressed in words, is
                    usually so. In the Homeric instances the prayer which constitutes the oath has a
                    somewhat conventional form, and in the classical ages we find well-marked
                    formulas. These are often references to deities, as “by Zeus !” “I call Zeus to
                    witness” (ναι <hi rend="italic">μλ</hi><hi rend="italic">Δία</hi>; foτω Zeus);
                    “by the immortal gods !” “I call to witness the ashes of my ancestors” (per deos
                    immortales<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n757/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0757-0700"/>; testor majorum cineres). Sometimes a curse is
                    invoked on himself by the swearer, that he may perish if he fail to keep his
                    oath, as “the gods destroy me,” “let me perish if,” &amp;c. (dii me perdant;
                    dispeream si). An important class of Roman oaths invokes the deity to favour or
                    preserve the swearer in so far as he shall fulfil his promise—“as the gods may
                    preserve me,” “as I wish the gods to be propitious to me” (me ita di servent;
                    ita deos mihi velim propitios). The best Roman collection is to be found in the
                    old work of Brissonius, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Biblical examples of these classes of oaths are “as the Lord liveth” (1 Sam.
                    xiv. 39, and elsewhere), “so do God to me, and more also” (2 Sam. iii. 35, and
                    elsewhere).</p>
                <p>The history of oaths in the early Christian ages opens a controversy which to
                    this day has not been closed. Under Christ’s injunction, “Swear not at all”
                    (Matt. v. 34; also James v. 12), many Christians seem at first to have shrunk
                    from taking oaths, and, though after a time the usual customs of judicial and
                    even colloquial oaths came to prevail among them, the writings of the Fathers
                    show efforts to resist the practice. Chrysostom perhaps goes furthest in
                    inveighing against this “snare of Satan”: “Do as you choose; I lay it down as a
                    law that there be no swearing at all. If any bid you swear, tell him, Christ has
                    spoken, and I do not swear” (Homil. ix. in <hi rend="italic">Act. Apostol.;</hi>
                    see a collection of patristic passages in Sixt. Senens., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothec. Sanct.,</hi> vi. adnot. 26). The line mostly taken by influential
                    teachers, however, was that swearing should indeed be avoided as much as
                    possible from its leading to perjury, but that the passages forbidding it only
                    applied to superfluous or trifling oaths, or those sworn by created objects,
                    such as heaven or earth or one’s own head. On the other hand, they argued that
                    judicial and other serious swearing could not have been forbidden, seeing that
                    Paul in his epistles repeatedly introduces oaths (2 Cor. i. 23; Phil. i. 8; Gal.
                    i. 20). Thus Athanasius writes: “I stretch out my hand, and as I have learned of
                    the apostle, I call God to witness on my soul” <hi rend="italic">(Apol. ad Imp.
                    Const.·,</hi> see Augustine, <hi rend="italic">De Mend.,</hi> 28; <hi
                    rend="italic">Epist.,</hi> cl., iii. 9; cl., iv. 250; <hi rend="italic">Enarr.
                    in Psalm.</hi> Ixxxviii. (4); <hi rend="italic">Serm.,</hi> 307, 319). This
                    argument is the more forcible from Paul’s expressions being actually oaths in
                    accepted forms, and it has also been fairly adduced that Christ, by answering to
                    the adjuration of the high priest, took the judicial oath in solemn form (Matt,
                    xxvi. 63). The passages here referred to will give an idea of the theological
                    grounds on which in more modern times Anabaptists, Mennonites, and Quakers have
                    refused to take even judicial oaths, while, on the other hand, the laws of
                    Christendom from early ages have been only directed against such swearing as was
                    considered profane or otherwise improper, and against perjury. Thus from the 3d
                    or 4th century we find oaths taking much the same place in Christian as in
                    non-Christian society. In the 4th century the Christian military oath by God,
                    Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the majesty of the emperor is recorded by Vegetius
                    <hi rend="italic">(Rei</hi><hi rend="italic">Milit. Inst.,</hi> ii. 5).
                    Constantine’s laws required every witness in a cause to take oath; this is
                    confirmed in Justinian’s code, which even in some cases requires also the
                    parties and advocates to be sworn <hi rend="italic">(Cod. Theod.,</hi> xi. 39;
                    <hi rend="italic">Justin. Cod.,</hi> iv. 20, 59). Bishops and clergy were called
                    upon to take oath in ordination, monastic vows, and other ecclesiastical matters
                    (see details in Bingham, <hi rend="italic">Antiq. of Chr. Church,</hi> xvi. 7).
                    By the Middle Ages oaths had increased and multiplied in Christendom far beyond
                    the practice of any other age or religion. The Reformation made no change in
                    principle, as is seen, for instance, in Art. xxxix. of the church of England:
                    “As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our
                    Lord Jesus Christ, and</p>
                <p>James His apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not prohibit, but
                    that a man may swear when the Magistrate require th, in a cause of faith and
                    charity, so it be done according to the Prophet’s teaching, in justice,
                    judgement, and truth.” But about this time began a legal reformation, which has
                    for reasons of public policy continually reduced the number of oaths required to
                    be taken, and apparently tends toward their total abolition.</p>
                <p>The history of swearing in early Christendom would lead us to expect that the
                    forms used would be adopted with more or less modification from Hebrew or Roman
                    sources, as indeed proves to be the case. The oath introduced in the body of one
                    of Constantine’s laws—“As the Most High Divinity may ever be propitious to me”
                    (Ita mihi summa Divinitas semper propitia sit)—follows an old Roman form. The
                    Roman oath by the genius of the emperor being objected to by Christians as
                    recognizing a demon, they swore by his safety (TertulL, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apol.,</hi> 32). The gesture of holding up the hand in swearing has been
                    already spoken of. The Christian oath on a copy of the Gospels seems derived
                    from the late Jewish oath taken holding in the hand the scroll of the law (or
                    the phylacteries), a ceremony itself possibly adapted from Roman custom (see
                    treatise “Shebuoth” in <hi rend="italic">Gemard).</hi> Among the various
                    mentions of the oath on the Gospels in early Christian writers is that
                    characteristic passage of Chrysostom in a sermon to the people of Antioch: “But
                    do thou, if nothing else, at least reverence the very book thou boldest forth to
                    be sworn by, open the Gospel thou takest in thy hands to administer the oath,
                    and, hearing what Christ therein saith of oaths, tremble and desist” <hi
                    rend="italic">(8erm. ad Pop. Antioch.,</hi> Homil. XV. ). The usual mode was to
                    lay the hand on the Gospel, as is often stated in the records, and was kept up
                    to a modern date in the oath in the university of Oxford, “tactis sacrosanctis
                    Evangeliis”; the practice of kissing the book, which has now almost superseded
                    it in England, appears in the Middle Ages (J. E. Tyler, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oaths,</hi> pp. 119, 151). The book was often laid on the altar, or (after the
                    manner of ancient Rome) the swearer laid his hand on the altar itself, or looked
                    towards it; above all, it became customary to touch relics of saints on the
                    altar, a ceremony of which the typical instance is seen in the representation of
                    Harold’s oath in the Bayeux tapestry. Other objects, as the cross, the bishop’s
                    crosier, &amp;c., were sworn by (see Ducange, <hi rend="italic">s.υ.</hi>
                    “Jurare”). An oath ratified by contact or inspection of a sacred object was
                    called a “corporal” or bodily oath, as distinguished from a merely spoken or
                    written oath; this is well seen in an old English coronation oath, “so helpe me
                    God, and these holy euan-gelists by me bodily touched vppon this hooly awter.”
                    The English word signifying the “sacred object” on which oath is taken is <hi
                    rend="italic">halidome</hi> (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic">haligdom;</hi>
                    German, <hi rend="italic">heiligthum);</hi> the halidome on which oaths are now
                    sworn in England is a copy of the New Testament. Jews are sworn on the Old
                    Testament; the sacred books of other religions are used in like manner, a
                    Mohammedan swearing on the Koran, a Hindu on the Vedas.</p>
                <p>Among the oath-formulas used in Christendom, that taken by provincial governors
                    under Justinian is typical of one class: “I swear by God Almighty, and His only
                    begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and the Most Holy
                    Glorious Mother of God and ever Virgin Mary, and by the Four Gospels which I
                    hold in my hand, and by the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel,” &amp;c. The
                    famous oath of the kings Louis and Charles at Strasburg in 842 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(a.d.)</hi> runs: “By God’s love and the Christian people and
                    our common salvation, as God shall give me knowledge and power,” &lt;fcc.
                    Earlier than this, as in the oath of fealty in the capitularies of Charlemagne
                    in 802, is found the familiar form “Sic me adjuvet <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0758-0701"/> Deus,” closely corresponding to above-mentioned
                    formulas of pre-Christian Rome. This became widely spread in Europe, appearing
                    in Old French “Si m’ait Dex,” German “So mir Gott helfe,” English “So help me
                    God.” A remarkable point in its history is its occurrence in the “So help me
                    Frey,” &lt;fcc., of the old Scandinavian ring-oath already described. Among the
                    curiosities of the subject are quaint oaths of kings and other great personages:
                    William Rufus swore “by that and that” (per hoc et per hoc), William the
                    Conqueror “by the splendour of God,” John “by God’s teeth”; other phrases are
                    given in Ducange <hi rend="italic">(l.c.),</hi> as “per omnes gentes,” “per
                    coronam,” “par la sainte figure de Dieu,” “par la mort Dieu,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Profane swearing, the trifling or colloquial use of sacred oaths, is not without
                    historical interest, formulas used being apt to keep up traces of old manners
                    and extinct religions. Thus the early Christians were reproved for continuing to
                    say “<hi rend="italic">mehercle !”</hi> some of them not knowing that they were
                    swearing by Hercules (Tertull,, <hi rend="italic">De Idol.,</hi> 20). Oaths by
                    deities of pre-Christian Europe lasted into the modern world, as when a few
                    generations ago Swedish peasants might be heard to swear, “Odin take me if it is
                    not true !” (Hylten-Cavallius, <hi rend="italic">Wärend och</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wirdame,</hi> vol. i. p. 228). The thunder-god holdS his place
                    still in vulgar German exclamati ons, such as “Donner!” (Grimm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Mythologie,</hi> pp. 10, 166). The
                    affected revival of classical deities in Italy in the Middle Ages still lingers
                    in such forms as “per Bacco!” “cospetto di Bacco!” (by Bacchus! face of Bacchus!
                    ). In France the concluding oath of the last paragraph has dwindled into
                    “mordieu!” or “morbleu!” much as in England the old oaths by God’s body and
                    wounds became converted into “oddsbodikins!” and “zounds!”</p>
                <p>The oaths now administered among civilized nations are chiefly intended for
                    maintaining governments and securing the performance of public business. They
                    fall under the headings of political, ecclesiastical, and legal. In England the
                    coronation oath is to be administered by one of the archbishops or bishops in
                    the presence of all the people, who, on their parts, reciprocally take the oath
                    of allegiance to the crown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The, archbishop or bishop shall say:</hi> “Will you solemnly
                    promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England and the
                    dominions thereto belonging according to the statutes in parliament agreed on,
                    and the laws and customs of the same?” <hi rend="italic">The king or queen shall

                    so help me God,” <hi rend="italic">and then shall kiss the book.</hi></p>
                <p>The chief officers of state take an “official” oath well and truly to serve his
                    (or her) majesty. Special oaths are taken by privy councillors, archbishops and
                    bishops, peers, baronets and knights, recruits, and others. The old oath of
                    allegiance, as administered (says Blackstone) upwards of 600 years, contained a
                    promise ‘ ‘ to be true and faithful to the king and hi⅛ heirs, and truth and
                    faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour, and not to know or hear of
                    any ill or damage intended him without defending him therefrom” (Blackstone, <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> book i. chap. x.). In the reign of William III.
                    it was replaced by a shorter form, and in the present τeign stands: “I do swear
                    that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Victoria,
                    her heirs and successors, according to law.” Statutes of Charles II. and George
                    I. enacted that no member should vote or sit in either house of parliament
                    without having taken the several oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration.
                    The oath of supremacy in the reign of William III. was: “I A B doe swear that I
                    doe from my heart abhorr detest and abjure as impious and hereticall this
                    damnable doctrine and position that princes excommunicated or deprived by the
                    Pope or any authority of the see of Rome may be deposed or murdered by their
                    subjects or any other whatsoever. And I doe declare that no forreigne prince
                    person prelate state or potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction power
                    superiority preeminence or authoritie ecclesiasticall or spirituali within this
                    realme. Soe,” &amp;c. The oath of abjuration introduced in the time of William
                    III. recognizes the king’s rights, engages the juror to support him and disclose
                    all traitorous conspiracies against him, promises to maintain the Hanoverian
                    Protestant succession, and expressly renounces any claim of the descendants of
                    the late Pretender. This oath was not only taken by persons in office, but might
                    be tendered by two justices tθ any person suspected of disaffection. In modern
                    times a single parliamentary oath was substituted for the three, and this was
                    altered to enable Roman Catholics to take it, and Jews were enabled to sit in
                    parliament by being allowed to omit the words “on the true faith of a
                    Christian.” In its present form the parliamentary oath consists of an oath of
                    allegiance and a promise to maintain the succession to the crown as limited and
                    settled in the reign of William III. The “judicial” oath taken by judges of the
                    Court of Appeal or of the High Court of Justice, and by justices of the peace,
                    is “to do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of this realm,
                    without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.” J urors are sworn, whence indeed
                    their name <hi rend="italic">(juratores)</hi>; in felonies the oath administered
                    is: “You shall well and truly try and true deliverance make between our
                    sovereign lady the Queen and the prisoner at the bar whom you shall have in
                    charge, and a true verdict give according to the evidence.” In misdemeanours the
                    form is: “Well and truly try the issue joined between our sovereign lady the
                    Queen and the defendant, and a true verdict,” &amp;c. The oath of the jurors in
                    the Scottish criminal courts is: “You [the jury collectively] swear in the name
                    of Almighty God and as you shall answer to God at the great day of judgment that
                    you will truth say and no truth conceal in so far as you are to pass upon this
                    assize.” The oldest trace of this form of oath in Scotland is in <hi
                    rend="italic">Reg. maj.,</hi> i. cap. 11, copied from Glenville, which points to
                    an origin in the Norman inquest or “recognition.” In the ancient custom of
                    compurgation, once prevalent in Europe, the accused’s oath was supported by the
                    oaths of a number of helpers or compurgators who swore to their belief in its
                    validity. A remnant of it lasted on till the 17th century in the “ex officio”
                    oath of a clergyman cited before the ecclesiastical court for misconduct, who
                    might be required to call his neighbours as compurgators to swear to their
                    belief in his innocence. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Υ∖q</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >jusjurandum</hi> or decisory oath of Roman law, which was of greater authority
                    than <hi rend="italic">res judicata (Digest</hi> xii. 2, 2), is still
                    represented in modern law by the <hi rend="italic">serment décisoire</hi> of the
                    Code Civil, and the “reference to the oath of the party” of Scotch law (see the
                    case of Longworth <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Yelverton, in <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Reports,</hi> 1 Scotch Appeals, 218). Such an oath is final and conclusive. It
                    has something in common with the old “wager of law” in England, abolished by 3
                    and 4 William IV. c. 42, s. 13, in so far as it makes an oath the <hi
                    rend="italic">finis</hi><hi rend="italic">litium.</hi> The decisory oath was
                    formerly used in the ecclesiastical courts (Burn, <hi rend="italic">Eccl. Law,
                    s.υ.</hi> “Oaths”). It seems to be still used in admiralty cases in
                    Massachusetts (Dunlop, <hi rend="italic">Adm. Pr.,</hi> 290). Witnesses are
                    sworn: “The evidence you shall give . . . shall be the truth, the whole truth,
                    and nothing but the truth. So,” &amp;c. Where a witness is sworn on the <hi
                    rend="italic">voir dire,</hi> the oath is: “You shall true answer make to all
                    such questions as the court shall demand of you. So help you God.” As to
                    witnesses of religions other than Christian, an oath is to be administered to
                    them in such form and with such ceremonies as they may declare to be binding.
                    The great number of oaths formerly required have been much reduced by modern
                    legislation, in many cases a voluntary declaration before a justice, notary,
                    &amp;c., being substituted. Many alterations of the English law as to oaths have
                    been made of late years in relief of those conscientiously objecting. Quakers,
                    Moravians, and Separatists are allowed to make affirmation, whether as witnesses
                    or on other occasions, where an oath was formerly required. Thus a Quaker in the
                    witness-box affirms by answering “Yea!” and when taking his seat in parliament
                    substitutes for “swear” the words “solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and
                    affirm,” and omits “So help me God.” The Evidence Further Amendment Act, 1869
                    (32 and 33 Viet c. 68, s. 4), allowing affirmations in place of oaths in certain
                    cases in judicial proceedings, is by the Evidence Amendment Act, 1870 (33 and 34
                    Vict. c. 49), extended to proceedings before all persons having authority to
                    administer oaths. It was specially intended to meet the case of an arbitrator.
                    But the right to affirm in lieu of taking the parliamentary oath has been held
                    not to apply to the case of avowed atheists, as appears from the case of Mr
                    Charles Bradlaugh, elected member for Northampton, but not permitted to take the
                    affirmation and sit (1883; see Clarke <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> Bradlaugh, 7 Q.
                    B. D. 38). False witness given under affirmation is punishable as perjury.
                    Profane swearing and cursing is punishable by law, any labourer, sailor, or
                    soldier being liable to forfeit Is., every other person under the degree of a
                    gentleman 2s., and every gentleman or person of superior rank 5s., to the poor

                    person taking the same to engage in any mutinous or seditious purpose; to
                    disturb the public peace; to be of any association, society, or confederacy
                    formed for any such purpose; to obey the orders or commands of any committee or
                    body of men not lawfully constituted, or of any leader or commander, or other
                    person not having authority by law for that purpose; not to inform or give
                    evidence against any associate, confederate, or other person; not to reveal or
                    discover any unlawful combination or confederacy or any illegal act done or to
                    be done, or any illegal oath or engagement which may have been administered or
                    tendered to or taken by any person, or the import of any such oath or
                    engagement; (5) to take any such oath or engagement, not being compelled thereto
                    (37 George III. c. 123, s. 1). Compulsion is no defence unless the person taking
                    the oath or engagement within fourteen days (in the case of oaths falling under
                    52 George III. c. 104) or within four days if not prevented by actual force or
                    sickness, and then within four days after the cessation of the hindrance
                    produced by such force or sickness (in the case of oaths falling under 37 George
                    III. c. 123), declares the circumstances of the administration of the oath by
                    information on oath before a justice of the peace or a secretary of state or the
                    privy council, or, if on active service, to his commanding officer. The Draft
                    Criminal Code proposes to incorporate these provisions with little alteration.
                    The Irish Act (50 George III. c. 102) is more stringent than 37 George III. c.
                    123, as the person administering the oath is punishable with penal servitude for
                    life, the person taking the oath is punishable as in England and Scotland. A
                    club or society in which members are required or permitted to take an unlawful
                    oath is unlawful, and the members may be proceeded against either summarily or
                    by indictment (39 George III. c. 79, 57 George III. c. Ί9). The latter statute,
                    as appears from the preamble, was specially aimed at the corresponding societies
                    which existed in Great Britain at the time of the French Revolution.</p>
                <p>Politicians and moralists have placed much reliance on oaths as a practical
                    security. It has been held, as Lycurgus the orator said to the Athenians, that
                    “an oath is the bond that keeps the state together” (Lycurg., Zeocr., 80; see
                    Montesquieu, <hi rend="italic">Spirit of Laws').</hi> Thus modern law-books
                    quote from the leading case of Omychund <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Barker: “No
                    country can subsist a twelvemonth where an oath is thought not binding; for the
                    want of it must necessarily dissolve society.” On the other hand, wherever the
                    belief in supernatural interference becomes weakened, and oaths are taken with
                    solemn form but secret contempt or open ridicule, they become a serious moral
                    scandal, as had already begun to happen in classical times. The yet more
                    disastrous effect of the practice of swearing is the public inference that, if a
                    man has to swear in order to be believed, he need not speak the truth when not
                    under oath. The early Christian fathers were alive to this depreciation of
                    ordinary truthfulness by the practice of swearing, and opposed, though
                    unavailingly, the system of oaths which more and more pervaded public business.
                    How in the course of the Middle Ages oaths were multiplied is best seen by
                    examining a collection of formulas such as the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Oaths</hi> (London, 1649), which range from the coronation oath to the oaths
                    sworn by such as valuers of cloths and the city scavengers.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As to reform of the excessive multiplication
                    of oaths see Paley, <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy,</hi> book iii. part i.
                    chap. 16; and J. E. Tyler, <hi rend="italic">Oaths.</hi></p></note> Oaths of
                    allegiance and other official oaths are still taken throughout Europe, but
                    experience shows that in times of revolution they are violated with little
                    scruple, and in the case of the United Kingdom it is doubtful whether they have
                    any more practical value than, if so much as, simple declarations. The question
                    of legal oaths is more difficult. On the one hand, it is admitted that they do
                    induce witnesses, especially the ignorant and superstitious, to give evidence
                    more truthfully than they would do on even solemn declaration. On the other
                    hand, all who practise in courts of justice declare that a large proportion of
                    the evidence given under oath is knowingly false, and that such perjury is
                    perceptibly detrimental to public morals. The lowering of truth in ordinary
                    intercourse, which follows from the requirement of swearing as a confirmation in
                    public matters, remains much as it was in ancient times. One noteworthy point is
                    that an effect is now produced by oaths foreign to their proper purpose, which
                    is to use the sanction of religion for the enforcement of obligations; now,
                    however, the oath has passed into a sanction of the religion, so that an oath
                    taken in legal form is construed as a confession of faith in Christianity, or at
                    least in the existence of God. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. b. t.)</hi></p>
