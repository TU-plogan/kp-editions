                <p><label type="entry">OILS</label>. The term oil is a generic expression under
                    which are included several extensive series of bodies of diverse chemical
                    character and physical properties. In its most comprehensive ordinary
                    acceptation the word embraces the hard solid odourless waxes, tallows, and fats,
                    the viscid fluid fixed oils, the odorous essential oils, and the solid, fluid,
                    and volatile hydrocarbons obtained in nature or by destructive distillation.
                    Further, in former days, when substances were principally classified by obvious
                    physical characteristics, the word applied to various substances which, beyond
                    an oily consistency, possess no other properties in common with ordinary oils.
                    Thus we have still in common use for sulphuric acid the term “oil of vitriol,” a
                    substance which, it need hardly be said, is widely different from any oil.
                    Leaving out of account bodies of this nature, the remaining diverse bodies have
                    in common the characters that they are compounds consisting principally, in some
                    cases exclusively, of carbon and hydrogen, that they are mostly insoluble in
                    water, and that they are all readily inflammable. The mineral hydrocarbons
                    obtained either in nature or by destructive distillation do not come within the
                    range of this article (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Naphtha, Paraffin,
                    Petroleum),</hi> which is restricted to the series of neutral bodies formed
                    naturally within animal or vegetable organisms. These bodies are divided into
                    two well-defined groups— the fixed oils and fats, and the essential or volatile
                    oils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fixed Oils.</hi></p>
                <p>The fixed or fatty oils, although varying considerably in external appearance,
                    form in reality a well-defined and homogeneous group of substances having great
                    similarity of chemical composition. They appear to be essential constituents of
                    the most highly-organized forms of animal and vegetable life, being found in
                    plants chiefly in the seed, and in animals chiefly enclosed in the cellular
                    tissue and in special body cavities, but some proportion of fatty matter is
                    found in almost all tissues and organs. Although oils and fats are universally
                    distributed and perform most important functions in animal and vegetable life,
                    those used for technical purposes are not drawn from any very great number of
                    sources; and many bodies might be utilized for the production of oil which at
                    present are not so employed.</p>
                <p>As found in commerce, oils possess a faint characteristic taste, a slight odour,
                    and some amount of colour, generally brownish yellow. These characteristics,
                    however, are due to certain impurities; in a really pure condition most oils
                    have scarcely any characteristic taste, odour, colour, or physiological
                    influence. In a few cases only they have special properties which appear to be
                    inseparable characteristics, such as the purgative principle of castor oil,
                    croton oil, and some others. At the ordinary temperatures most vegetable oils
                    are fluid, but a few, produced especially by tropical plants, such as palm oil,
                    cocoa butter, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n799/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0799-0740"/> Chinese tallow, Ac., are solid fats. Animal fats
                    are for the most part solid, the oils of marine animals and neat’s-foot oil
                    being important exceptions. The various solid fats differ greatly in
                    consistency, and the hardness of individual samples is largely affected by the
                    nature of the food and by the health of the animal yielding them, and by some
                    other circumstances. The relative fluidity or solidity of the various oils and
                    fats depends on the proportions of the three principal constituents of all
                    oils—olein, stearin, and palmitin. The fluid oils contain olein in larger
                    proportion, that body being itself liquid at ordinary temperatures, while solid
                    stearin and palmitin predominate in the hard fats. The viscosity of the fluid
                    oils also ranges between wide limits. The rate of flow of an oil, which is a
                    matter of considerable importance in several industrial applications, is
                    estimated by comparison with the standard rate at which water of the same
                    temperature flows through an aperture of fixed dimensions. The most viscid of
                    the fluid oils is castor oil, which at a temperature of 15° C. is more than two
                    hundred times thicker or more slow-flowing than water. Olive oil at the same
                    temperature is more than twenty times thicker, and linseed and hemp oils, though
                    among the most limpid of fixed oils, still flow about ten times as slowly as
                    water.</p>
                <p>Oils communicate to paper and like substances a stain which remains an
                    irremovable translucent grease spot. They are almost entirely insoluble in
                    water, and, excepting croton and castor oils, in cold alcohol, but in boiling
                    alcohol they dissolve more freely, and they are perfectly soluble in ether,
                    bisulphide of carbon, chloroform, benzol, and light petroleum spirit. In their
                    pure condition they are neutral bodies, but, on their becoming rancid, free
                    fatty acids are developed which give them an acid reaction. Exposed to air they
                    absorb oxygen freely, and the class containing linoleic acid, known as drying
                    oils, of which linseed oil is the type, thereby harden into a solid translucent
                    semielastic caoutchouc-like body, a property of the utmost value in the arts.
                    When they are exposed in thin layers over a great surface the absorption of
                    oxygen proceeds with such energy that heat is evolved sufficient to produce
                    spontaneous combustion, a circumstance frequently exemplified in the heating and
                    igniting of heaps of oily cotton waste. The non-drying oils also on exposure to
                    air thicken and become greasy; they acquire the peculiar disagreeable smell and
                    acrid taste known as rancidity, owing to a kind of fermentation being set up in
                    them through the agency of impurities, whereby the fixed fatty acids they
                    contain are decomposed, and odorous volatile fatty acids formed by oxidation at
                    their expense.</p>
                <p>The specific gravity of all oils is lower than that of water, ranging from '900
                    in the case of cocoa butter to ∙970, the specific gravity of castor oil. Most
                    fluid oils have a specific gravity between ’ 915 and ∙930. The specific gravity
                    of oils varies with the temperature far more than is the case with water. It is
                    found that for each degree Centigrade rise of temperature whale oil increases in
                    volume 1 per 1000, rape oil 0 ’ 89, and olive oil 0’83.</p>
                <p>When a solid fat is heated slowly till it melts and is allowed gradually to cool,
                    it remains fluid till it falls considerably under the temperature at which it
                    melted, and at the moment of solidification there is a sensible increase in its
                    temperature. Butter, for example, melts at 30° to 31 <hi rend="superscript">
                    0,</hi> 5 C., but does not resolidify till it falls to 19° or 20° C. These
                    phenomena have been investigated in the case of the pure fats stearin and
                    palmitin by Duffy <hi rend="italic">(Chem. Soc. Qu. J.,</hi> V. 197), who finds
                    that these bodies undergo with great readiness three isomeric modifications,
                    each having a distinct melting point widely apart from each other (stearin from
                    beef giving 5Γ, 63°, and 67°), the solidifying point being slightly under the
                    lowest of the three. The freezing point of the ordinary fluid oils ranges down
                    to from - 27° to - 28 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> C. for hemp oil, nut oil,
                    and linseed oil, while olive oil solidifies at + 2° to 4° C. Fluid oils heated
                    to from 280° to 300° C., and solid fats to from 300° to 325° C., undergo
                    destructive distillation, resolving into a mixture of rich inflammable gases and
                    a peculiarly irritating acrid vapour, acrolein.</p>
                <p>Oils and fats are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, in proportions
                    ranging, as a rule, for carbon between 76 and 80 per cent., hydrogen from 11 to
                    13 per cent., and oxygen from 10 to 12 per cent. Their proximate constitution
                    was first demonstrated by Chevreul, who indeed, in the great series of classical
                    researches embodied in his <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les corps gras</hi><hi rend="italic">iïorigine animale</hi>
                    (1823), established the modern chemistry of oils.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of saponification, as exemplified on a great scale in the important
                    industry of soap-making, furnished the key for discovering the intimate
                    constitution of oils. Oils and fats treated with alkalis, alkaline earths, and
                    basic metallic oxides in presence of water undergo decomposition and enter new
                    combinations. A soap is formed by the union of the alkaline body with acid
                    constituents of the oil, known as fatty acids, ajιd the sweet body, glycerin, is
                    liberated. The saponification of stearin with sodic hydrate, for example, may be
                    thus represented :—</p>
                <p>c'⅛° <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>} o, <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> g≈} o = <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> ⅛⅞θ } o <hi

                <p>Stearin. Sodic Stearate of Glycerin, hydrate, sodium (soap).</p>
                <p>By heating oil with steam under a pressure of from 10 to 12 atmospheres, or with
                    water superheated to about 220° C., the oil is decomposed into free fatty acid
                    and glycerin. Thus, again taking the simple fat stearin, we have :—</p>
                <p>⅛⅝ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 4o <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> ¾ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3c</hi> ½θ} 0 <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi><hi

                <p>Stearin. Water. Stearic acid. Glycerin.</p>
                <p>In the above reactions it will be observed that three molecules of water are
                    required for the formation of free stearic acid and glycerin from one molecule
                    of stearin, and to that extent the resulting products are heavier than the
                    original. Beading the equation in the inverse manner we find the formation of
                    stearin takes place by the substitution of the three acid residues of stearic
                    acid C <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 35</hi> O for the
                    three hydroxyls H. O in the molecule of glycerin. No fat or oil is found in
                    nature consisting of a single chemical fat such as stearin alone. All are
                    mixtures of at least two and for the most part three or·more simple fats or
                    glycerides of fatty acids closely allied in nature and constitution. These
                    glycerides or combinations of glycerin and fatty acids are in their chemical
                    relations ethers. Glycerin itself is a triatomic alcohol, and bears to the fatty
                    acids and resulting ethers the same relation which a basic substance bears to an
                    acid and to the salt which results from their combination. In all natural fats
                    glycerin combines, as in stearin, by having substituted for its three
                    replaceable hydrogen atoms three equivalents of fatty acids, whence the natural
                    simple fats are all triacid compounds — tristearin (θi8¾5θ)3 j. O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, tripalmitin (θi6¾1θ)310 <hi rend="subscript"> 3j</hi>
                    triolein (θi8¾O9 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> j. 0 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    &amp;c., though commonly called stearin, palmitin, and olein, &amp;c. (For
                    further information as to the constitution of glycerides see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Glycerin,</hi> vol. x. p. 697.) The three simple fats above
                    named form by far the largest and most important constituents of all oils and
                    fats, the only others which bulk largely being the glycerides of linoleic acid
                    in drying oils, and of physetoleie acid characteristic of marine oils. The
                    number of fatty acids found combined with glycerin in oils is, however, very
                    considerable. They constitute members of homologous series, the first or stearic
                    series of which possess the common formula C <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> H <hi

                <p>The ordinary method for separating vegetable oils and fats from the nuts, seeds,
                    &amp;c., of which they form constituent parts is by pressure, with or without
                    the assistance of heat. They are also obtained by the agency of solvents,
                    principally by the use of bisulphide of carbon and the light petroleum spirit
                    benzin, these being methods of production of comparatively recent introduction.
                    Animal oils and fats are principally isolated by simple melting or “rendering”
                    by heat. The degrees of heat and pressure necessary for separating the several
                    fats vary very much with the fluidity of the oils themselves, the proportion in
                    which they are present in the substances, and the nature and consistence of the
                    associated materials. Sperm oil is indeed obtained direct in its fluid condition
                    from the head of the sperm whale. Virgin olive oil is obtained with the gentlest
                    pressure, and palm oil and several other vegetable fats and waxes are liberated
                    by the agency of boiling water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Oil Pressing.—</hi> Pliny describes in detail the
                    apparatus and processes used for obtaining olive oil among his Roman
                    contemporaries, by which it appears that they derived a knowledge of the screw
                    press from the Greeks, and applied it to the pressure of oil from pulped olives.
                    In the East, where vegetable oil forms a most important article for food and for
                    other personal and domestic purposes, various ingenious applications of lever
                    presses and of combined lever and wedge presses have been in use from the
                    earliest times. The Chinese employ the same series of operations which are
                    followed in the most advanced oil mills of modern times, viz., bruising and
                    reducing the seeds to meal under an edge-stone, heating the meal in an open pan,
                    and pressing out the oil in a wedge press in which the wedges are driven home by
                    hand hammers. The apparatus used in Europe in modern times for the extraction of
                    oil by pressure consists of forms of the screw press, the Dutch or stamper
                    press, and the hydraulic press. With the screw press, even of the most improved
                    form, the amount of pressure practically obtainable is limited from the failure
                    of its parts under the severe inelastic strain which can be put on it. It is on
                    this account only used in the pressure of olives and of animal fats, where the
                    power necessary is not great. The Dutch or stamper press, which has played an
                    important part in the oil industry, was invented, as its name indicates, in
                    Holland in the 17th century. The invention of the hydraulic press in 1795
                    effected the greatest revolution in the oil industry, bringing a new, easily
                    controlled, and almost unlimited source of power into play, and on the great
                    scale that apparatus has practically superseded all other means of pressing.</p>
                <p>The sequence of operations in treating oil-seeds for the separation of their
                    contained oils is ordinarily as follows :—(1) the crushing and grinding of the
                    seed or other substance, (2) heating the oleaginous meal so prepared, and (3)
                    expression of the oil by mechanical power.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grinding.—</hi> As a preliminary operation oil-seeds are freed
                    from dust, sand, and other impurities by sifting in an inclined revolving
                    cylinder or screening machine, covered with woven wire having meshes varying
                    according to the size and nature of the seed operated upon. In earlier times the
                    seeds were pounded to meal by means of stamper mills. These consisted of a
                    series of heavy wooden stampers or pestles made to rise and fall by the action
                    of cams or wypers fixed on a revolving shaft, a pair of such stampers falling
                    alternately with heavy force into an egg-shaped mortar about two-thirds filled
                    with seed. As the process proceeded the material became heated, and from time to
                    time had to be sprinkled with water. Stampers are now seen only in small
                    old-fashioned establishments. In a modern oil-mill the screened seed is passed
                    through crushing rollers to bruise or open the husk. The crushing rollers
                    consist of a pair of cast-iron rollers horizontally mounted, commonly of unequal
                    size, the larger being 4 feet in diameter, while the smaller is about 1 foot The
                    larger roller is revolved by power and the smaller moves by simple friction
                    against the other. Between these rollers the seed is fed by a hopper, and in
                    passing through it is bruised and broken and so prepared for the thorough
                    grinding it receives under the revolving edge-stones to which it next passes.
                    These are a pair of circular stones having a diameter of about 7 feet with a
                    thickness at their running edge of 16 inches, each weighing from 2⅜ to 3⅜ tons.
                    They are made of very compact limestone, granite, or fine-grained sandstone, and
                    are mounted on a vertical driving shaft, to which they are attached by a
                    horizontal axle passing through their centre. They revolve on a bed of similar
                    hard compact stone, and the compound rubbing and bruising effect of their rotary
                    motion quickly reduces the bruised seeds to a fine meal. The stones are provided
                    with sweepers, which in their revolution bring the material pressed out towards
                    the side again into their path, and there is a separate sweeper for clearing out
                    the finished meal from the bed of the machine by way of a slide or door provided
                    in the side. The edge-stones revolve about twenty times per minute, and a charge
                    of seed which is slightly moistened during the process is sufficiently ground on
                    an average in about twenty-five minutes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Heating.—</hi> In dealing with certain oils which are easily
                    separated, and especially with oils used in cookery and otherwise consumed,
                    where it is desirable to preserve the pleasant, bland, and faint fruity or nutty
                    taste, the ground oleaginous meal is taken direct to the press and pressed for
                    cold-drawn or virgin oil. The cake from such cold pressing, as it still retains
                    a large proportion of oil, is subsequently broken up, reduced to meal, and
                    heated; after which it is again subjected to pressure to obtain a further flow
                    of oil. Ordinarily, however, the meal is artificially heated previous to any
                    pressure, and it depends greatly on the nature of the seed and the individual
                    manufacturer’s method of working whether the material is fully pressed at first
                    or twice submitted to the operation. The warming of the seed meal renders the
                    contained oil more fluid and consequently more readily separable with moderate
                    pressure. It also enables the oil-presser to obtain a larger proportion of the
                    contained oil, coagulates and holds back the albuminous constituents of the
                    seeds, and similarly dries and retains mucilaginous matter. On the other hand,
                    oil from heated meal usually is more highly coloured and harsher to the taste
                    than cold-drawn oil; and the quality is seriously deteriorated if by chance the
                    heat applied should exceed at most 80° C∙ The heat is applied either in open
                    shallow iron kettles or pans heated over a direct fire or through a sand-bath;
                    but preferably, and now generally, the meal is heated by steam circulating
                    freely between the casings of a jacketed or double-walled pan or pans.
                    Mechanical stirrers are kept in continuous rotation within the pan, to ensure a
                    uniform warming effect throughout the mass. A highly-approved and convenient
                    form of heating apparatus consists of a double steam kettle, one pan being
                    placed above the other, each steam-jacketed and provided with mechanical
                    stirrers. In this machine the heating action is continuous. The meal is first
                    heated for ten or fifteen minutes in the upper pan, which is closed over with a
                    sheet-iron cover, after which a slide in the bottom of the pan is opened and the
                    charge is shot down into the lower pan, where it is raised to the full heat,
                    while the upper pan is again recharged and worked up. When fully heated in the
                    lower pan the charge is swept out at a door in the side of the pan by the action
                    of the mechanical stirrers, and falling into a funnel is passed in measured
                    quantities direct into bags, and without delay prepared for and placed in the
                    press. The kettles are of a capacity sufficient to heat seed for charging three
                    single presses at each operation. A form of heating kettle is also now in use in
                    which the object is effected by direct injection of steam into the mass, whereby
                    the meal is not only heated but a beneficial amount of moisture is distributed
                    throughout the material. In mills of the most recent construction such steam
                    kettles are used in connexion with an improved form of crushing
                    rollers,—employment of edge-mills being dispensed with. These rollers consist of
                    a series of four or five chilled iron or steel cylinders mounted in vertical
                    order like the bowls of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0801-0742"/> a calender. The seeds pass in succession between
                    the first and second rollers in the series, then between the second and third,
                    and so on till they are delivered by the lowest, sufficiently bruised, crushed,
                    and ground.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pressing.—</hi> With the least possible delay the meal is
                    transferred from the heating kettles, so that the oil may be pressed out while
                    the material still retains its heat. Measured quantities, say 10 to 12 lb of
                    meal, are filled into woollen bags of strong, thick texture, sufficiently open
                    and porous to allow free flow of the expressed oil, yet having consistency
                    enough to resist rupture by the enormous pressure to which it is subjected. Each
                    bag is further placed within “hairs,” thick mats of horse-hair bound with
                    leather. In some methods of working press-cloths—not bags—are used; and the
                    construction of recent presses is such as to dispense altogether with the use of
                    bags or other coverings. The essentials of proper oil-pressing are a slowly
                    accumulating pressure, so that the liberated oil may have time to flow out and
                    escape, a pressure that increases in proportion as the resistance of the
                    materials increases, and that maintains itself as the volume of material
                    decreases through the escape of the oil. These essentials the Dutch or stamper
                    press and the hydraulic press fulfil perfectly, and the prevalence of hydraulic
                    pressure over the other and older method is only due to the greater convenience
                    and ultimate economy of the power. Previous to the early years of the present
                    century the Dutch press was almost exclusively employed in Europe for pressing
                    oil-seeds. It consists of two principal parts, an oblong rectangular box with an
                    arrangement of plates, blocks, and wedges, and over it a framework with heavy
                    stampers, the fall of which produces the pressure. The press box is made either
                    of cast-iron or, according to the older method, of strongly-bound oaken planks.
                    At each extremity of the box there is placed a bag of oil-meal between two
                    perforated iron plates, under λvhich are a perforated bottom and channels for
                    conducting away the expressed oil. Next are inserted filling-up pieces of wood,
                    two of which—the speering-blocks—are oblique or bevelled on one face, forming
                    ways for the two wedges which press against them. Between the speering-blocks,
                    and separated also by a filling piece, are inserted the two wedges, one being
                    the ordinary or driving wedge by which the pressure is applied to the seed-bags,
                    and the other an inverted or spring wedge, which is only driven down to loosen
                    and free the various parts when the pressing operation is complete. The stamper
                    which drives home the ordinary wedge is a heavy log of wood about 16 feet long
                    by 8 inches square, and it falls about fifteen times a minute through a maximum
                    distance of 22 inches by the action of a pair of cams or wypers fixed on a
                    revolving shaft. As soon as the pressure is complete the stamper suspended over
                    the inverted wedge is brought into action, and by a single heavy blow knocking
                    the wedge out of its key-like position it frees the various parts of the
                    apparatus for the removal of the pressed cakes. In a double stamper press about
                    12 cwt. of finished cake is made per day. Since the introduction of the Bramah
                    press, numerous modifications have been invented with the special object of
                    improving its convenience as an oil-press. The various forms devised for
                    oil-extracting may be comprehended under standing or vertical presses and
                    horizontal or lying presses, with specially-modified seedboxes and press plates
                    in each instance. The most primitive form of upright press, and one which still
                    recommends itself for simplicity where great pressures are not essential, is a
                    drum or box press, so called because on the platen are placed two circular metal
                    tubs, one within the other, the inner perforated throughout for the escape of
                    the oil. At the top of the press is secured a strong metal plate or table the
                    same diameter as the inner box, and the seed is pressed by the working up of the
                    ram carrying the box against the surface of this table. Within the perforated
                    box the seed-bags are deposited with metal plates between them. Experience,
                    however, has demonstrated that the best presses are those provided with separate
                    trays or seed-boxes for each bag, and the ordinary oil-press of the present day
                    is fitted with four seed-boxes, and presses four separate cakes at one working.
                    A convenient form is the double oil-press of Blundell, which admits of
                    continuous working, one division being under pressure, while the other division
                    is being emptied and recharged. The final pressure applied in ordinary practice
                    on the seed-trays in an hydraulic press is equal to a weight of about 300 tons.
                    This weight is allowed to remain on for seven minutes, and the whole operation
                    of charging, pressing, and emptying a press maybe finished in ten minutes. A
                    Blundell double press is capable of working off about 5 cwt of seed per hour. A
                    form of press of the most recent and improved construction, called the “pack
                    press,” dispenses with bags, seed-boxes, and hair-mats. Consolidated cakes of
                    seed enclosed in press-cloths to the number of sixteen for one charge are simply
                    placed between corrugated plates. To enable the press to be charged with
                    sufficient rapidity, and to allow the large number of bags to occupy as small a
                    vertical space as practicable when placed in the press, a moulding or form
                    machine, such as was invented by John Bennie of Glasgow and patented in October
                    1880, or a similar machine, worked on a modified principle, patented by Francis
                    Virtue, is employed. In these machines, by mechanical contrivances, the measured
                    quantity of heated meal is placed in a trapeziform tray enclosed in a cloth and
                    submitted to a pressure which reduces the thickness of the mass from about 3
                    inches to a little more than 1 inch and forms it into a solid cake, in which
                    state it packs in small space in the press. The whole time occupied in filling
                    and forming a cake and placing it in the press is not more than a quarter of a
                    minute, and a set of three pack presses in a day of ten hours will work off
                    nearly 9 tons of seed, yielding in the case of linseed about 108 cwt. of cake,
                    and 54 cwt. of oil. It is claimed for the pack press that it extracts a much
                    larger proportion of oil than that worked -with seed-boxes.</p>
                <p>Horizontal presses are not much in favour in the United Kingdom, but in many
                    Continental mills where two pressings are the rule a set of horizontal presses
                    are kept for the first operation.</p>
                <p>The oil, during the process of pressure, works its way from the centre to the
                    edge of the cake, whence it exudes. For this reason an oblong form is the most
                    favourable for the easy separation of the oil, and the trapeziform shape
                    oil-cakes usually present has been selected on account of the wedge-like
                    steadiness the mass has under pressure, and the readiness with which the entire
                    cake frees itself once it is moved the smallest distance from the thin end of
                    the box or tray in which it is pressed. The edges to which the oil is pressed
                    almost invariably retain a considerable proportion of oil. They are pared off,
                    and the parings are returned to the edge-stones to be ground up and again
                    pressed with fresh meal. The oil from the presses flows into the receiver tanks
                    placed under the level of the floor, from which it is pumped into the storage
                    tanks, where it is permitted to settle and clarify. After mechanical impurities
                    and water, &amp;c., have separated themselves, the oil is in some cases ready
                    for the market, but for the most part it has to undergo a process of
                    refining.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraction by Solvents.—</hi> The only method of obtaining
                    vegetable oils which has come into practical competition with pressing is that
                    in which the solvents bisulphide of carbon (CS <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>),
                    the light spirit of petroleum, and common ether are used. In ordinary pressing
                    about 10 per cent, of oil remains in the finished cake, while by means of
                    solvents practically the whole of the oil may be separated. Solvents might
                    therefore be used for extracting that remaining percentage of oil from any
                    oil-cake were such desirable, or they can be employed for treating fresh
                    unpressed seed. As a matter of fact, it is desirable to leave a proportion of
                    oil in the cake which is used for feeding purposes, because its food value
                    depends to no small extent on the oil it contains, and the perfect separation of
                    oil in the solvent process is a drawback, on account of the poverty in fatty
                    matter of the exhausted meal.</p>
                <p>Extraction by the agency of bisulphide of carbon was first introduced in 1843 by
                    Jesse Fisher of Birmingham. Twelve years later a patent was secured by E. Deiss
                    of Brunswick, but for several years afterwards the process made little advance.
                    The colour of the oil produced was high, and its taste sharp; it retained traces
                    of sulphur, which showed themselves disagreeably in the smell of soaps made from
                    it, and in the blackening of paints in which it was used; and the meal left by
                    the process was so tainted with evil-smelling carbon bisulphide that cattle
                    would not taste it. These drawbacks have now been perfectly surmounted, and the
                    process appears likely to come into extended use on the Continent.</p>
                <p>The seed for treatment with bisulphide of carbon is prepared as for pressing,
                    except that it is not reduced to a fine meal, which would prevent the
                    percolation of the solvent freely through the mass. It is only bruised and
                    placed in a series of four or five upright cylinders, which are hermetically
                    closed and provided with a complicated arrangement of pipes leading to and from
                    each other in various ways,—all being controlled by stop-cocks. Into the first
                    cylinder A bisulphide of carbon is admitted from an overhead reservoir, till the
                    whole mass is saturated with the fluid. After allowing the bisulphide to act on
                    the contents of the cylinder for about fifteen minutes, communication between
                    cylinders A and B is opened, the fluid from A passes into B, and a fresh supply
                    of bisulphide comes from the reservoir into A. Again, after t⅛ lapse of fifteen
                    minutes, the pipe leading into cylinder C is opened, and the fluid contents of B
                    enter C. B is filled from A, which again is replenished from the reservoir. The
                    extraction thus goes on, pure bisulphide of carbon always entering the weakest,
                    most nearly exhausted cylinder, and passing on with gradually increasing
                    percentage of oil to cylinders having more and more oil in their contents, till
                    at the end, in the most recently charged cylinder the bisulphide is fully
                    saturated with oil and passes off to the distilling apparatus, where the oil and
                    the bisulphide are separated. When the contents of a cylinder have been fully
                    extracted that vessel is isolated from the others, the remaining bisulphide of
                    carbon is forced out by the admission of compressed air, and thereafter steam is
                    run through the exhausted meal till not a trace of the solvent remains. The
                    bisulphide, boiling at 46° C., is easily separated from the oil by simple
                    distillation, and the last traces of the sulphur compound are removed by blowing
                    steam through the oil in the distilling apparatus. Careful provision is made for
                    the prevention of escape and for the recovery and proper storing of the
                    bisulphide of carbon in use.</p>

                <p>In addition to the use of bisulphide of carbon claimed under ïiis patent of 1855
                    (English patent 1856), E. Deiss enumerates as solvents chloroform, ether, and
                    benzin or benzol. In 1863 an English patent was secured by Messrs Richardson,
                    Lundy, and Irvine for obtaining oil from crushed seeds, or from refuse pressed
                    cake, by the solvent action of “volatile hydrocarbons from petroleum, earth
                    oils, asphaltum oil, coal oil, or shale oil, such hydrocarbons being required to
                    be volatile under 212° Fahr.” Since that time the development of the American
                    petroleum industry and improvements in the apparatus employed nave raised this
                    system of extraction to the rank of a competing practical method of oil
                    production. The most approved apparatus for this method of extraction at present
                    in use is that of Void. In the separation of oil from oil-seeds by means of
                    light petroleum spirit heat is required. Void uses a light petroleum spirit
                    boiling at not more than 60° C., which he calls canadol, and by a very ingenious
                    arrangement of extractors, boiling and collecting kettle, and condenser, all
                    brought into connexion by a system of pipes, he percolates the crushed seed in
                    the extractor cylinders with heated canadol, which passes down into the kettle
                    laden with extracted oil. Here the volatile canadol is distilled off by steam
                    heat, and passes into the condenser, whence it again goes into the extractors,
                    still further exhausting the seed and carrying an additional portion of fixed
                    oil into the kettle. In this way the original charge of canadol keeps
                    circulating till it completely exhausts the charge of seed in the extractors.
                    The canadol is then distilled off from the fixed oil collected in the kettle,
                    the condensed spirit going this time into a separate receiver, and finally the
                    oil is perfectly freed from canadol by having steam blown through it. As pure
                    petroleum spirit extracts neither resinous nor gummy matters from the oil-seed,
                    and moreover takes up little or no colouring matter, the oil obtained by this
                    solvent is remarkably pure, and the process is quite adapted for extracting even
                    the oils used for food and for pharmaceutical purposes. The extraction of oils
                    by means of ether, although presenting many advantages, has never been
                    successfully undertaken on a commercial scale, chiefly through the apparently
                    insurmountable waste of the costly menstruum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refining.—</hi> The refining of vegetable oils is generally
                    carried on as a separate industry. A kind of clarification of an expressed oil
                    takes place by simple settling in oil-tanks, but the action is too tedious and
                    the result too imperfect for practical purposes. The all but universal method of
                    oil-refining now practised was invented and patented by Charles Gower in 1792.
                    It consists of treating the oil with a small percentage of sulphuric acid,
                    which, owing to the avidity with which it takes up water, acts on the suspended
                    impurities by depriving them of the water they contain, and then carbonizes the
                    substances themselves, which precipitate in darkcoloured flocky masses. To a
                    certain extent also the acid influences the oil itself, liberating fatty acids
                    and combining with the freed glycerin; and these new products remain dissolved
                    in the oil. It is thus of great importance to use no more than that proportion
                    of sulphuric acid which is capable of separating the impurities. The ordinary
                    operations of refining are briefly as follows. The oil is placed in a large
                    tank, within which is a coil of pipe for heating by steam. When the oil is
                    sufficiently hot, sulphuric acid is slowly added to the extent of from ⅜ to 1⅜
                    per cent, of commercial acid, according to the nature and impurities of the oil.
                    After the contents of the tank have been in vigorous agitation for about an
                    hour, it is left at rest for about five hours to allow the charred impurities to
                    collect and precipitate. The oil is then conveyed into a washing vat, where it
                    is mixed with about 20 per cent, of boiling water, with the addition of a little
                    soda, and kept briskly stirred for an hour. From this the mixture passes to
                    clearing tanks, in which the oil is allowed to rest about a week in order to
                    thoroughly separate the remaining water. The addition of about 5 per cent, of
                    common salt, by increasing the specific gravity of the water, considerably
                    hastens this separation. Finally the oil is passed through a filter composed of
                    alternate layers of tow, dried moss, canvas, and similar porous substances.
                    Numerous modifications of the above sequence and other processes of refining
                    have been introduced, and more or less adopted. One of the best distinct
                    processes is that of Bareswil, which consists in heating the oil and adding to
                    it 2 to 3 per cent, of caustic soda. Thereby a corresponding proportion of soap
                    is formed, which, rising to the surface as a strong frothing scum, brings with
                    it the impurities which are rendered insoluble. The scum is subsequently allowed
                    to precipitate, in doing which it perfectly clarifies the oil. The coagulum so
                    formed is used as a lubricant. Rudolph von Wagner proposed the use of
                    concentrated chloride of zinc, instead of sulphuric acid, in refining; and
                    various other mineral acids as well as salts and tannin have also been suggested
                    and tried. The most recent process of refining, and certainly the simplest and
                    most expeditious if experience demonstrates its sufficiency, is that introduced
                    by Mayer of the Hernalser Actien - Oelfabrik. It consists simply in submitting
                    oil direct from the press to the action of a centrifugal machine. Thereby the
                    albuminoid, mucilaginous, and Other impurities are driven against the sides of
                    the drum, on which they deposit as a solid coating, leaving the oil pure and
                    clear. The effect is, of course, due to the difference in density between the
                    oil and its suspended impurities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animal Fat Rendering.—</hi> The animal fats, butter only
                    excepted, are liberated from the cells in which the fatty matter is enclosed by
                    the agency of heat alone. The heat applied melts the fat, and by thereby causing
                    its expansion as well as by acting on the moisture in the tissue it bursts the
                    cell membrane and allows the liquid fat to flow together. The process is a
                    noxious and disagreeable one owing to the intolerable stench given off by the
                    putrefying animal matter while under the influence of heat; and it is
                    practically impossible to have the fatty matter heated on a large scale in its
                    pure and sweet condition. It becomes an object of importance, therefore, to
                    prevent the escape of such disagreeable fumes into the air, and the apparatus
                    used is principally modified with that view. The simplest method of
                    tallow-rendering consists in cutting the fatty matter by hand or machine into
                    small fragments, which are placed in a copper vessel, with a small quantity of
                    water, over an open fire. While the fire is applied the mass is Kept stirring,
                    and gradually the oil exudes and collects as the membraneous matter—greaves or
                    cracklings—becomes shrunken and shrivelled. The fat is then ladled out of the
                    boiler and strained through a sieve or filter, and the greaves, placed in a hair
                    or woollen bag, are submitted to pressure, by which a further portion of tallow
                    is separated. The pressed greaves are useful for dog’s food or for feeding
                    swine, &amp;c., or they may be still a source of tallow, which can be obtained
                    by treating them with bisulphide of carbon or with petroleum spirit. An improved
                    method of rendering tallow consists in crushing the suet under a pair of
                    edge-stones, whereby the cells are ruptured, and heating the product over an
                    open fire with about one-fifth part of water acidified with from two to seven
                    parts of strong sulphuric acid added in the boiler. The means, however, of most
                    effectually separating animal fat and at the same time avoiding the pollution of
                    the air consists in the use of air-tight cylinders or kettles heated by steam.
                    According to certain methods of working, superheated steam is forced into the
                    kettle and acts direct on the shred suet, &amp;c.; in other cases the steam
                    circulates in a coiled pipe within the vessel; and a third way consists in the
                    use of steam-jacketed rendering vessels. Strained tallow, however prepared, is
                    further purified or refined before using by melting and thorough washing with
                    hot water, after which it is allowed to cool slowly, so as to throw down
                    impurities with the separating water. The same effect is also produced by
                    blowing steam through molten tallow (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lard,</hi> vol.

                <p>There is no strictly systematic plan upon which oils and fats can be
                    satisfactorily classified and arranged. The scheme which follows brings the
                    various commercial products into convenient groups, the distinctions of which
                    are of prominent importance.</p>

                    greasy oils, containing chiefly olein. <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Drying oils,
                    containing linolein.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Fish or train oils, containing physetolein.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Fats and Waxes.</hi><hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Solid
                    glycerides, principally palmitin and stearin. <hi rend="italic">b.</hi>
                    Non-glycerides or waxes.</p>
                <p>In a pure condition the non-drying oils undergo little change through the
                    influence of the atmosphere, but by degrees a process of slow fermentation is
                    set up by the agency of the natural impurities they contain, developing an
                    offensive rancid smell, and rendering the oils thick and greasy. Even in very
                    thin layers, however, they never dry. Under the influence of nitrous acid and
                    mercuric nitrate the olein of non-drying oils undergoes a molecular change into
                    elaidin, and the oil becomes solid. Castor oil, the characteristic glyceride of
                    which is ricinolein, occupies an intermediate position between drying and
                    non-drying oils. The influence of nitrous acid on ricinolein changes the
                    molecular constitution of the body forming ricinclaidin, with simultaneous
                    solidification, as in the case of olein. The drying oils are those which contain
                    as principal constituents linolein or analogous glycerides. They absorb oxygen
                    from the atmosphere with much rapidity, giving off at the same time carbonic
                    acid and water, whereby the composition of the oil is modified, the proportion
                    of oxygen much increased, and the physical properties of the oils changed. They
                    do not solidify under the influence of nitrous acid. The fish oils do not dry on
                    exposure to the <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Oil Testing.—</hi> The presence of mineral oils in any fixed
                    oil is easily detected by the process of saponification, as well as by a
                    peculiar fluorescence they impart to the mixture. In the saponification test the
                    oil is made into a soap, with either soda or potash, the product mixed with
                    sand, and the whole treated with light solvent petroleum spirit, which extracts
                    the mineral oil. The increase in quantity of solution over the solvent used is
                    the measure of the proportion of adulterants in the oil. Smell, taste, specific
                    gravity, and viscosity, all to a certain extent give indications of the nature
                    of an oil. The elaidin proof—that is, the solidification or non-solidification
                    of an oil under the influence of nitrous acid, and the length of time required
                    for solidifying when such a change ensues—is a valuable indication of the nature
                    of an oil; and similar trustworthy conclusions may be drawn by observing the
                    heat developed by mixing one part of sulphuric acid with three parts of the oil
                    to be tested, a test first suggested by Maumené, and elaborated by Fehling. The
                    colour reactions which result from treatment with acids of different strengths,
                    mixed acids and alkalis, &amp;c., are the most important tests. The following
                    tabular statement of several such tests is extracted from Schaedler’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Technologie</hi><hi rend="italic">der Fette und Oele</hi> (Berlin,
                    1883). The first column shows the colour reactions produced by nitric acid of
                    sp.gr. 1’18 to 1’20 on equal proportions of oil; the second the effect of fuming
                    nitric acid of sp. gr. 1 ’ 40 to 1’45 on four or five times the amount of oil;
                    the third the colour reaction from the use of sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1 · 60
                    to 1 '70; and the fourth the effect of a diluted mixture of nitric acid and
                    sulphuric acid on equal volume of oils. In the fifth column is given in hours
                    the time a non-drying oil takes to solidify under the influence of nitrous acid,
                    after which comes the appearance of emulsions formed by treatment with alkaline
                    leys of 1 ’ 33 sp. gr. The last two columns are devoted to the effects produced
                    by a solution<pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> As regards the United Kingdom it may be said in
                    general terms that Hull is the centre of the linseed and other seed oil trade,
                    Liverpool the headquarters of that in palm oil and palmnut oil. Tallow and lard
                    and sperm, train, and fish oils are dealt in principally in Dundee, London, and
                    Greenock. In the Mediterranean Marseilles and Trieste are oil-trading centres of
                    great importance, and Hamburg, Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Copenhagen are busy oil
                    marts in northern Europe. Sperm oil, lard, and animal oils come to British
                    markets most largely from the United States, tallow from South America and
                    Russia, castor oil from the East Indies and Italy, olive oil from Italy, the
                    south of France, and Mediterranean ports generally. Palm oil is received
                    exclusively from the west coast of Africa, and cocoa-nut oil from the East
                    Indies and Ceylon. Of seeds imported as sources of oil, linseed is principally
                    derived from the East Indies and Russia, cotton seed from Egypt, and rape from
                    Russia and the East Indies. The following table, from the Board of Trade
                    Returns, gives the imports and exports of oils and fats into the United Kingdom
                    for 1882 :—-</p>

                <p>Subjoined are notices of various oils and fats of considerable commercial
                    importance to which special articles are not devoted in other parts of this
                    work. In several cases notices of oils will be found under special headings,
                    incorporated with descriptions of other products of the plants and animals
                    whence they are obtained. Here drying and non-drying oils are dealt with
                    together in alphabetical order, after which vegetable fats and animal oils and
                    fats are noticed in groups.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Liquid Vegetable Oils.—Almond oil,</hi> the produce of both
                    the sweet and the bitter almond, is a pale straw-coloured oil, having a pleasant
                    nutty taste and sometimes—when pressed from bitter almonds—an odour of the
                    essential oil of bitter almonds. The oil consists almost entirely of olein,
                    remains fluid to -15° C., and solidifies at 20° C. It is used in food, and in
                    medicine is employed as a demulcent and mild laxative; but the readiness with
                    which it becomes rancid interferes with its free use in these capacities. It
                    produces a fine firm soap, and is also largely used by perfumers. The oil is
                    much adulterated with the allied peach-kernel oil, and sesame oil, nut oil,
                    &amp;c. It is chiefly expressed in England from almonds imported from the
                    Mediterranean and the East Indies. <hi rend="italic">Peach-kernel oil</hi> (from
                    <hi rend="italic">Amygdalus</hi><hi rend="italic">persica), Apricot oil</hi>

                    >domestica),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cherry oil</hi> (from the kernels of
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Cerasus)</hi> are a series of oils allied both in
                    sources and properties frequently mixed with or sold as almond oil. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ben oil</hi> is obtained from the seeds of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moringa pterygosperma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ. aptera,</hi> trees native
                    of Egypt, Syria, and the East Indies, and cultivated in America. The oil,
                    cold-drawn, is clear, bland, and odourless, with little tendency to rancidity,
                    but the product of final hot pressing is coloured, and has a bitter taste and
                    purgative properties. The oil contains, in addition to palmitin, stearin, and
                    olein, the glycerides of behenic acid C <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 44</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and myristic acid C

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Ben oil is used by perfumers for obtaining essential
                    oils by enfleurage, as a hair oil and ointment, as a salad oil in the West
                    Indies, and as a lubricant for watches and small machinery. It is, however,
                    principally consumed in the regions of its production. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Candle-nut oil</hi> is obtained from the nuts of <hi rend="italic">Aleurites
                    triloba,</hi> a tree native of the South Sea Islands, but grown also generally
                    throughout tropical countries. The nuts are about the size of a horse-chestnut,
                    with kernels which yield as much as from 60 to 66 per cent, of oil. The name
                    given to these fruits is due to the fact that they are used in the Sandwich
                    Islands, spitted on a stick, as lamps or candles, in which condition they burn
                    with a clear steady light. The oil, cold-pressed, is a clear, almost colourless,
                    rather viscid fluid, with a pleasant taste and smell, and medicinal properties
                    akin to those of castor oil. Hot-pressed, it has a brown colour and a rather
                    disagreeable odour and taste. It contains glycerides of linoleic acid and
                    myristic acid in addition to those of palmitic acid and oleic acid, and
                    possesses strong drying properties which make it useful for varnishes, and
                    otherwise as a substitute for linseed oil; it is also an excellent illuminant
                    and a valuable soap-making material. On account of the cheapness of linseed oil,
                    and the superior value of linseed cake, candle-nut oil does not find a very
                    extensive market in Europe, but it is the basis of an industry of some
                    importance in the South Sea Islands, whence a large quantity of the oil is
                    annually exported to the west coast of America. The nuts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aleurites</hi><hi rend="italic">cordata</hi> yield <hi rend="italic">Wood
                    oil,</hi> a powerfully drying oil, of much importance in China and Japan for use
                    as a natural varnish and in medicine. It does not enter into Western commerce.
                    <hi rend="italic">Cotton-seed oil,</hi> obtained from the decorticated seed of
                    the varieties of cultivated cotton, is now, on account of the enormous extent of
                    its production, one of the most important of the fluid vegetable oils. Its
                    preparation is quite a recent industry, dating only from 1852, when the first
                    importation of the material was made from Egypt. Since that period the trade has
                    developed with extraordinary rapidity. Egyptian seed, containing about 25 per
                    cent, of oil, is chiefly pressed in European countries (England, France,
                    Germany); the American seed pressed in the United States shows not more than 20
                    per cent, of oil. The oil as expressed has a dark - brown turbid appearance,
                    owing to the presence of a resin with albuminous impurities, and in the early
                    days of the industry much difficulty was experienced in refining the product
                    sufficiently for commercial purposes. It is now purified by as far as possible
                    coagulating and separating the impurities by treatment with boiling water and
                    steam. After the coagulum so formed has f&gt;recipitated and been separated, the
                    oil is treated with weak alka-ine ley, briskly agitated, and alloλved to settle,
                    when the coloured resinous matter goes to the bottom; over that comes a
                    proportion of saponified oil, and the clear refined oil forms the upper portion.
                    The refined oil has a clear straw-yellow colour, a faint earthy odour, and a
                    pleasant nut-like flavour. It consists entirely of a mixture of palmitin and
                    olein, the former beginning to solidify and separate out between 12° C. and 6°
                    C. There is no doubt that cotton-seed oil is very extensively and generally used
                    to adulterate other and more costly oils, especially olive oil. It also is
                    largely used in soap-making, and it constitutes a principal ingredient in
                    compound lubricating oils. The quantity of cotton seed available for pressing
                    annually is estimated to be not less than 800,000 tons, from which about 120,000
                    tons of oil and 250,000 tons of oil-cake may be produced. <hi rend="italic"

                    >sativa,</hi> a plant native of Chili, but introduced into Europe within this
                    century on account of its oil-yielding properties. The seeds contain from 35 to
                    40 per cent, of a dark-yellow oil, of peculiar smell and mild taste, which has a
                    tendency to become rancid. It has only faint drying properties, and occupies a
                    place intermediate between drying and non-drying oils. When cold-pressed, madia
                    oil may be used for food purposes, but it is principally consumed in lamps, or
                    employed as a lubricant and in soap-making. <hi rend="italic">Maize oil</hi> is
                    a product of the seed-germs, which, in the preparation of maize meal and starch
                    and fermented and distilled liquors from maize, have to be removed as carrying
                    in them a disagreeable acrid substance. The germ contains about 15 per cent, of
                    a clear golden-yellow oil, useful for burning, or oiling wool, and for
                    lubricating machinery. <hi rend="italic">Niger -oil</hi> is the produce of the
                    seeds (properly achenes) of <hi rend="italic">Guizotia oleifera,</hi> a plant
                    native of the east coast of Africa, but cultivated throughout India and to some
                    extent in Germany. The fruits, which are small, tooth-like in form, and shining
                    black in colour, contain from 40 to 45 per cent, of oil, which first came into
                    the English market about 1851. The oil is limpid, clear, paleyellow in colour,
                    with a pleasant nutty mild flavour. It possesses little drying property, and is
                    not fitted for use either in paints or varnishes. It is much used in India—in
                    the Deccan especially— as a substitute for ghee with the poorer sections of the
                    population, and in other parts of the country both as a culinary oil and for
                    burning. In Western countries niger oil is principally employed in soap-making
                    and as a lubricant. <hi rend="italic">Nut oil</hi> is the produce in Europe of
                    the nuts of the walnut tree, <hi rend="italic">Juglans</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regia,</hi> and in America a similar oil is obtained from hickory nuts, <hi
                    rend="italic">Carya alba.</hi> The European walnut kernels yield from 40 to 50
                    per cent, of a fine limpid oil, which when cold-pressed is almost colourless,
                    with a sweet nutty taste and pleasant odour, but the hot-pressed oil has a
                    greenish-yellow colour and a rather sharp taste. Nut oil consists in large
                    proportion of linolein, with olein and the glycerides of myristic and lauric
                    acid. It is one of the most fluid of all oils, and, as it possesses with
                    colourlessness strong drying properties, it is much valued by artists for
                    oil-painting; it also yields a fine transparent varnish. In the hilly districts
                    of northern India and Persia—the native regions of the walnut—the oil is used
                    for culinary purposes and for lighting. Several closely-allied nuts, both in
                    Europe and in America, yield oil, similar in quality to that of the walnut. <hi

                    a limited extent it is also pressed in England and Germany from nuts which
                    become unfit for table use. The oil becomes rapidly rancid. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sapucaia oil,</hi> yielded by <hi rend="italic">Lecythis ollaria,</hi> also a

                    analogous in properties and uses. <hi rend="italic">Pine oils</hi> are got from
                    the seeds of various species of pine and fir trees containing some proportion of
                    resinous matter; they have a turpentine odour and possess powerful drying
                    properties. They are useful for mixing painters’ colours, for making varnishes,
                    and for burning in lamps. <hi rend="italic">Pappy oil</hi> is yielded by the
                    seeds of the opium poppy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Opium).</hi> In the valley of
                    the Ganges, the great region of opium culture, the poppy seed is consumed as an
                    article of food by the native population, anξ is their principal source of oil.
                    The exceedingly minute seeds contain as much as 60 per cent, of a fine
                    transparent, nearly colourless limpid oil, of pleasant taste and faint
                    characteristic odour. The qualities obtained by cold and hot pressing
                    respectively are distinguished from each other, the former being an esteemed
                    salad oil, while the latter, of yellow colour, sharp taste, and linseed-oil-like
                    odour, is used for soap-making, &amp;c. Poppy oil consists principally of the
                    glyceride of linoleic acid, linolein, and has therefore powerful drying
                    properties, on which account it is much used by artists. To some extent the
                    finer qualities are used for adulterating olive oil. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purging-nut oil</hi> is obtained from the seeds of <hi rend="italic">Jatropha
                    Curcas,</hi> a small tree native of India, but cultivated in tropical countries.
                    It is a violent purgative, and contains, like castor oil, ricinoleic acid. It is
                    comparatively limpid and odourless, and forms an excellent lamp oil. It is also
                    used in the soap trade and as a lubricant. <hi rend="italic">Safflower oil</hi>
                    is yielded by the seeds (achenes) of the composite plant <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carthamus tinctorius,</hi> which contain from 30 to 35 per cent, of a
                    light-yellow clear limpid oil. It is extensively used in Egypt, the East Indies,
                    and China (where the plant is cultivated as a source of the dye-stuff
                    safflower), its principal applications being for culinary purposes and burning,
                    and also as an ointment in paralytic affections and ulcers. A thick sticky
                    charred oil is obtained from the seed in India by a process partly of burning
                    and partly of distillation. The dark fluid so obtained is used by the native
                    agriculturist for greasing leather-work exposed to the action of water. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sesame</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gingelly oil,</hi> one of the
                    most highly esteemed of vegetable oils, is the produce of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sesamum orientale.</hi> The plant is grown especially in India as an annual; it
                    ripens in about three months, and two crops are reaped yearly. The seeds are
                    very small, weighing not more than one-tenth of a grain, and they vary in colour
                    from a dirty white through brown to nearly black. They are highly oleaginous,
                    containing as much as from 50 to 56 per cent, of a clear limpid oil of a
                    pale-yellow colour, inodorous, bland and sweet of taste, and not liable to
                    rancidity. It consists of about three parts of olein to one part of stearin and
                    palmitin, with a small proportion of the glyceride of myristic acid; and it does
                    not solidify till it reaches 5° C. Both seed and oil are of much importance in
                    the East Indies and China as food substances. The seed itself is used directly
                    as food; the oil comes next to cocoa-nut fat in the variety and extent of its
                    applications for food, personal use, and soapmaking; and the pressed cake is
                    even an article of food among the poorer classes. As a salad oil the
                    cold-pressed qualities are in every respect equal to the finest olive oil, its
                    mild piquancy of taste causing it to be preferred by many. Indeed sesame oil may
                    be used with advantage for every purpose to which olive oil is applied,
                    excepting, probably, the Turkey-red dyeing, and it is in extensive consumption
                    in food, lighting, soap-making, and as a lubricant. The oil is the subject of
                    much adulteration, especially with the cheaper ground-nut oil. It can by itself,
                    or as an adulterant of olive oil, be readily recognized by a peculiar green
                    coloration it takes when shaken up with mixed sulphuric and nitric acids, a
                    reaction peculiar to sesame oil. Sesame seed is principally crushed at
                    Marseilles and Trieste, to which ports it comes partly from the Levant, but more
                    largely from the East Indies and Java. The quantity of seed imported into France
                    alone yearly is not less than from 70,000 to 80,030 tons. <hi rend="italic"

                    Russia as an article of food, the sunflower being extensively cultivated in the

                    bread, and they contain more, than 60 per cent, of solid oil, which can be
                    separated either by boiling or by pressure with heat. It consists principally of
                    glycerides of lauric and myristic acids, with only a little palmitin. Dika fat
                    is used in soap and candle making. <hi rend="italic">Chinese tallow</hi> is a

                    through hot sieves. The fat melts at 44 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 5 C.,
                    and consists principally of palmitin with only a little olein. Chinese tallow
                    has long been valued in China for making candles used in Buddhist worship, and
                    it is now an article in English commerce, being imported for candle and soap
                    making. The seeds themselves, after separation of the fat, yield an oil fluid at
                    ordinary temperatures. <hi rend="italic">Carapa</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"

                    pomades. <hi rend="italic">Ghee</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian butter,</hi>
                    the solid fat obtained from the seeds of <hi rend="italic">Bassia
                    butyracea,</hi> an allied tree native of the sub-Himalayan ranges of northern
                    India, is a most important food substance among the natives of the North-West
                    Provinces, possessing a delicate white colour, the consistency of lard, and a
                    pleasant odour and taste. In the hot climate of India it will keep many months
                    without acquiring bad odour or taste, on which account it is highly valued not
                    only for food but also as an ointment, when perfumed, by the wealthier classes.
                    It makes excellent soap and candles. <hi rend="italic">Mahwa butter,</hi>

                    >latifolia,</hi> a tree cultivated generally throughout India, is used as a
                    substitute for or as an adulterant of ghee. It possesses a greenish-yellow
                    tinge, and becomes rancid more readily than genuine ghee. The fat is imported
                    into England for soap and candle making. The seeds of <hi rend="italic">Bassia

                    natives of India, yield similar fats. <hi rend="italic">Bayberry oil</hi> is the
                    fat obtained from the seeds of the common bay or sweet laurel. It possesses a
                    buttery granular consistence, a yellowish - green colour, a strong aromatic
                    flavour, and a sharp bitter taste, due to the presence of an aromatic oil. It is
                    pressed from the seeds principally in the south of Europe, Switzerland, and
                    Holland, and finds its chief application in veterinary practice. <hi
                    rend="italic">Avocado oil</hi> is the produce of the fruit of the avocado pear
                    tree, <hi rend="italic">Persea gratissima,</hi> an edible fruit, native of the
                    West Indies, but transported to other tropical regions. The fat consists of 30
                    per cent, of olein and 70 per cent, of lauro-stearin and palmitin, and is
                    largely used in America for soap-making. In addition to the cocoa-nut palm and
                    the oil palm, a large number of trees belonging to the same order, <hi

                    known in ordinary commerce.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Animal Oils.—</hi> The only liquid animal oil of
                    considerable importance other than the marine oils is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neat's-foot oil,</hi> a preparation from the feet of the common ox. For
                    obtaining it the feet are split up and boiled in water over an open fire, or,
                    preferably, treated with superheated steam in a closed cylinder. The oil is
                    skimmed from the surface of the decoction, and after some time it deposits a
                    thick greasy fat, from which the liquid portion is separated. Neat’s-foot oil
                    has a brownish colour and a mild animal taste and odour, and does not readily
                    become rancid. It is very valuable for watchmakers’ purposes, and for oiling
                    fine machinery generally, and is in great demand in connexion with the tools and
                    machines of engineers. It is much adulterated, generally with fish oils. A large
                    quantity of ox-foot oil is prepared in and exported from the River Plate region
                    in South America. <hi rend="italic">Sheep's-foot oil</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horse-foot oil</hi> are made to a limited extent, and sold as neat’s-foot oil.
                    <hi rend="italic">Egg oil</hi> is obtained as a by-product of the preparation of
                    egg albumen from the yolk or yellow of hens’ and ducks’ eggs. It is extracted
                    either by pressure or by ether from the hard-boiled yolks, and has a fine
                    brownish-yellow colour and a mild taste, except when extracted by ether, which
                    brings with it a disagreeable fatty constituent. It is now being used to a
                    considerable extent in place of olive oil in the manufacture of chamois or
                    shamoy leather. The <hi rend="italic">Seal oil of</hi> commerce is obtained from
                    the bodies of nearly thirty species of <hi rend="smallcaps">Seal</hi><hi

                    between the skin and the muscular tissue. Skin and blubber are first removed
                    together from the carcases of the animals, and when the products are landed the
                    fat is removed li·om the skin and reduced to oil, either by slow maceration and
                    exudation in large vats or by rendering with steam. When heaped up in great
                    wooden vats the mere pressure of the mass causes a flow at first of a fine clear
                    oil, which is saved as a separate commercial quality known as “pale seal.”
                    Fermentation and putrefaction meantime progress in the mass, which begins to
                    give off an almost unbearable stench, and the exuding oil gradually assumes a
                    darkbrown colour, with a disagreeable animal odour and taste. By degrees the
                    exudation of oil ceases, and finally the remaining oil is obtained by boiling up
                    the mass with fatty muscular scraps, the product of which also forms a separate
                    class of seal oil. The oil rendered by the action of steam heat on the fat has
                    the advantage of being promptly obtained, free from the disagreeable odour of
                    the greater portion of the seal oil obtained in open vats. According to its
                    quality seal oil varies in specific gravity from 0 ’915 to 0’930; at a
                    temperature of 5° C. a proportion of stearin solidifies out, and at - 2° to - 3°
                    C. it entirely solidifies. In chemical composition it consists principally of a
                    glyceride of physetoleic acid with proportions of the glycerides of stearic
                    acid, palmitic acid, a little oleic acid, and traces of some of the volatile
                    acids. The oil is only very slightly soluble in alcohol, a circumstance which
                    affords a means of detecting adulterations. It is used for the various purposes
                    to which the allied whale oils are applied; regarding these see <hi

                    oil is distinguished from all others by its low specific gravity, which ranges
                    from 0’870 to 0’880. It contains, but in different proportions, the same
                    constituents as cod-liver oil; particularly it is rich in iodine; and it
                    possesses a peculiar, highly-disagreeable odour and a very acrid taste. Under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Fish oil</hi> may be embraced the oil obtainable
                    by boiling from the refuse of various fish as well as from the entire fish which
                    may for any reason be unfit or not applicable for human food. Such oils have a
                    fishy odour and taste, a brownish colour, and a specific gravity ranging from
                    0’925 to 0’930. The most important of these products is <hi rend="italic"

                    into commerce are articles of such importance that they have special articles
                    devoted to them (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lard,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 312, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tallow),</hi> or of so little consequence that they do not
                    demand special notice. Bear’s grease, beef marrow, and goose fat are highly
                    valued for use in pomades for the hair, but comparatively little of what passes
                    under these names is obtained from the sources to which they are attributed.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Essential Oils.</hi></p>
                <p>The essential or volatile oils constitute a very extensive class of bodies which
                    possess in a concentrated form the odour characteristic of the plants or
                    vegetable substances whence they are obtained. The oils are usually contained in
                    special cells, glands, cavities, or canals within the plants, either in a
                    separate condition or intermixed with resinous substances, and in the latter
                    case the mixtures form oleo-resins, balsams, or resins, according as the product
                    is viscid or solid and hard. A few do not exist ready formed in the plants
                    whence they are obtained, but result from chemical change of inodorous
                    principles,—examples of this class being oil of bitter almonds and essential oil
                    of mustard. EsserΛ^l oils are for the most part insoluble, or only with
                    difficulty and sparingly soluble, in water; but in alcohol, ether, the fatty
                    oils, and mineral oils they dissolve freely. They ignite with great ease, and
                    burn with a fierce smoky flame, depositing a large amount of carbon. In many
                    important respects they differ from the fatty oils: they are not oleaginous to
                    the touch, and make no permanent grease spot; they distil at various
                    temperatures unchanged; they have an aromatic smell and hot burning taste; and
                    in chemical constitution they present no relationship to the fats and oils.</p>
                <p>Crude essential oils are at ordinary temperatures nearly all limpid liquids, but
                    some are viscid; and the essential oil or otto of roses is solid. Many on
                    exposure to low temperatures separate into two portions, one solid, called
                    “stearoptene,” the other liquid, called “elaeoptene.” The essential oils possess
                    high refractive power. Their influence on the plane of polarized light is
                    various: some rotate to the right, others give left-handed rotation, while with
                    several no effect is visible. In their fresh condition many are colourless, but
                    some are yellow or brown, others become brown by exposure, and in exceptional
                    instances oils are green or blue in colour. They are all powerfully acted on by
                    oxygen, which affects their colour, consistency, odour, and constitution. In
                    specific gravity they range from about 0’850 to 1Ί42, most of them being
                    specifically lighter than water, and averaging 0’90. In chemical constitution
                    the essential oils are diverse, but they are invariably rich in carbon. They
                    consist, first and principally, of hydrocarbons, associated with which generally
                    are, secondly, oxygenated compounds, sometimes the product of oxidation of the
                    hydrocarbons, although in many <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"

                    the bodies. A third class of essential oils, limited in number, consists of
                    those into the composition of which sulphur enters. Of the hydrocarbons which
                    constitute the principal proportion of essential oils terpene, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">C</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 10</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hj</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 6</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">,</hi> is the most important. Terpene is the chief constituent
                    of the various kinds of oil of turpentine; and a hydrocarbon of precisely the
                    same composition is contained in the oils of bergamot, orange, and other species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Citrus,</hi> and in a great number of other essential oils.
                    But although agreeing in chemical formula these terpenes differ considerably in
                    physical properties, such as specific gravity, boiling point, and rotatory
                    influence on the plane of polarization. Under the name of terpenes are also
                    included two series of hydrocarbons, polymeric with the C <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> series, having respectively the formulae
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 24</hi> and C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 32</hi>. The former of these,
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 24</hi>, is of
                    comparatively frequent occurrence, being found in the essential oils of cloves,
                    cubebs, patchouli, and several others. The terpenes of formula C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> θ, by their oxidation
                    in presence of water, give off indirectly peroxide of hydrogen, H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and yield cymene, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi>, a hydrocarbon found
                    naturally in the essential oils of cumin, thyme, and some others. The property
                    of evolving peroxide of hydrogen, possessed by cymene in common with terpene,
                    explains the well-known oxidizing and antiseptic influence of common turpentine
                    oil, and has been turned to account in the preparation called “sanitas,” a
                    disinfectant and antiseptic agent, consisting of an aqueous solution of oxidized
                    turpentine oil prepared by blowing air into a mixture of turpentine oil and
                    water. The oxygenated bodies in essential oils when formed by direct oxidation
                    of the hydrocarbon generally have feebly acid properties developing through
                    viscid oleo-resins and balsams into solid resins. The oxygenated compounds are
                    very varied in their constitution, some being of the nature of acids or
                    aldehydes, while others exhibit the characters of alcohols or of ethers. The
                    most characteristic oxygenated compounds in essential oils are camphors, the
                    type of which is common or Japan camphor, C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> O. Compounds isomeric with common camphor occur in the
                    volatile oil of <hi rend="italic">Pyrethrum parthenium,</hi> wormwood, mint, and
                    other labiate plants, and in chamomile and galbanum. Camphors isomeric with
                    Borneo camphor, C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi>
                    O, are found in coriander oil, cajeput oil, and Indian geranium oil. Isomeric
                    camphors having the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> O form the menthol of peppermint and the eucalyptol of
                    <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus Globulus,</hi> and patchouli camphor has the
                    composition C <hi rend="subscript"> 15</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 28</hi> O.
                    The other oxygenated bodies in crude essential oils mostly ally themselves with
                    compounds of the aromatic series, so called on account of the large proportion
                    of its members that are represented by natural products obtained in essential
                    oils, balsams, and resins. The essential oils which contain sulphur, of which
                    the allyl sulphide, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> S, or oil of garlic is a type, have generally a pungent, penetrating,
                    and disagreeable odour.</p>
                <p>The essential oils are obtained from their sources in four principal ways,—by
                    distillation, by expression, by enfleurage or absorption, and by maceration. The
                    process of <hi rend="italic">distillation</hi> is the most important, and is
                    applicable to a large number of substances owing to the ease with which
                    essential oils distil unchanged. Their general insolubility in water is turned
                    to account in the process, the odoriferous materials being placed in a simple
                    still with a small quantity of water, the steam from which carries over with it
                    the vapour of the essential oil. In distilling from certain bodies it is
                    necessary to cohobate or return into the still the first distillate, and that
                    operation may require to be repeated more than once before the raw material is
                    quite exhausted. Again, in dealing with some substances, solutions of common
                    salt or of chloride of calcium must be used in place of pure water, and these,
                    by raising the boiling point, send over the vapour more richly laden with
                    essential oil. After condensation and resting a sufficient time, the distillate
                    separates into two portions, the oil floating or sinking according to its
                    specific gravity. The process of <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> is applicable
                    to the obtaining of the essential oils which reside in the rind of the orange,
                    lemon, and other citric fruits. <hi rend="italic">Enfleurage</hi> is a method by
                    which the odours of several substances are dealt with. The aroma in such cases
                    is present to a small extent, and is too tender and liable to loss and
                    deterioration to permit of being separated by way of distillation. The process
                    consists of exposing the flowers in contact with purified lard or with fine
                    olive oil in suitable frames, whereby the fatty substances take up and become
                    impregnated with the essential oil. The process is principally employed in
                    preparing pomades and perfumed oils (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Perfumery),</hi>
                    as is also the analogous method of <hi rend="italic">maceration,</hi> which
                    consists in extracting the aromatic principles by macerating the raw materials
                    in heated oil or molten fat, whereby the essential oils dissolve out into the
                    fat. By subsequently digesting the impregnated fats and oils prepared either by
                    enfleurage or maceration with spirit 60° over proof the essential oils are
                    obtained as alcoholic essences, in which form they are much used for perfumery
                    and flavouring purposes, &amp;c. Alcoholic solutions of essential oils prepared
                    by macerating the raw materials in alcohol also form a part of the tinctures of
                    pharmacy.</p>
                <p>Essential oils have a wide range of uses, of which the principal are their
                    various applications in perfumery. Next to that in many ways they play an
                    important part in connexion with food. The value of flavouring herbs,
                    condiments, and spices is due in largest measure to the essential oils they
                    contain; and, further, the commercial value of tea, coffee, wine, and other
                    beverages is largely dependent on the delicate aroma which they owe to minute
                    quantities of such oils. For the flavouring of liqueurs, of aerated beverages,
                    and of other drinks essential oils are extensively used, and their employment is
                    not less considerable in the manufacture of confectionery and in the preparation
                    of many dietetic articles. In the cheaper kinds of confectionery a large
                    quantity of artificial oils called fruit essences are now employed, although the
                    flavours as such are distinctly crude, and the wholesomeness of the preparations
                    is more than doubtful. The acetate of amyl gives an imitation jargonelle-pear
                    flavour; valerate of amyl yields apple flavour; a mixture of butyrate of ethyl
                    and butyrate of propyl gives the so-called pine-apple flavour. Formic ether has
                    a peach-like odour, and is used for flavouring factitious rum, and there are
                    numerous other artificial compounds used in flavouring and in perfumery. Many of
                    the essential oils form most important medicinal agents. In the arts the cheaper
                    oils, such as oil of turpentine, are used in the manufacture of varnishes; the
                    reducing influence of the oil of cloves is utilized in the silvering of mirror
                    glass; and oils of turpentine, lavender, and spike are used as vehicles for
                    painting, more particularly for the painting of pottery and glass.</p>
                <p>The essentials oils are subject to extensive adulteration. The presence of fatty
                    oil is easily detected by the formation of a permanent grease spot on paper on
                    which the suspected mixture is dropped. The admixture of fixed oil may also be
                    demonstrated by distillation, when the volatile portion goes over, leaving the
                    fatty oil, or by treatment of the suspected sample with strong spirit, which
                    dissolves out the essential oil, and leaves the fatty oil as a separate layer.
                    The presence of spirit of wine in an essential oil may be readily proveα by
                    shaking up a specimen of the oil with a measured quantity of water in a
                    graduated glass. If the oil is pure there will be little or no change in the
                    volume of the water layer after the complete separation of the oil and water by
                    repose; but if, on the other hand, the oil has been mixed with spirit, the water
                    will have extracted the spirit and decreased the apparent amount of essential
                    oil, and increased the watery layer in proportion to the extent of the
                    falsification. In dealing with very small samples a test by sight is obviously
                    inapplicable, and in such cases the existence of alcohol in the watery solution
                    may be demonstrated by the molybdenum test. This consists of treating a drop or
                    two of water separated from the oil under examination with a solution of
                    molybdic acid in ten parts of sulphuric acid. If the water contains alcohol, a
                    characteristic intense blue reaction at once exhibits itself. The behaviour of
                    essential oils towards alcohol is also made the basis of a test of their purity.
                    The test is effected by mixing the essential oil with two volumes of absolute
                    alcohol, and thereafter observing the volume of diluted alcohol sp. gr. 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 889 required to render the clear solution opalescent.
                    The falsification of a costly essential oil with one of inferior value is a
                    fraud which can only be detected with much difficulty. In practice a fair
                    estimate of the purity of an essential oil and of its individual character may
                    be made by some experience of its smell as rubbed on the hands; colour, boiling
                    point, specific gravity, and other physical properties may also be usefully
                    observed in aiding to form an estimate of the genuineness and value of a sample.
                    Colour tests with various reagents are also used for the identification of the
                    various essential oils. Among these are Fröhde’s test (a solution of molybdate
                    of sodium in sulphuric acid), sulphuric acid itself, fuming nitric acid,
                    alcoholic solution of hydrochloric acid and picric acid, &amp;c.</p>

                    their sources, general applications whether in medicine, in perfumery, in the

                <p>Apart from the oil of turpentine, commerce in essential oils is limited as
                    regards bulk, although the value of the various articles is considerable. The
                    cultivation of plants for their odoriferous principles and the extraction of
                    essential oils are characteristic industries of Grasse, Nice, and Cannes, in the
                    south of France. About Mitcham in Surrey, and in Herefordshire and Bedfordshire,
                    several plants, principally lavender and other labiates, are largely cultivated
                    as sources of essential oils; but the localities whence the greater bulk of oils
                    are drawn are widespread and as numerous as are the materials themselves. (J.
