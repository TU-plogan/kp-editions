                <p><label type="entry">OHIO</label>, the third of the States of the American Union
                    in point of wealth and population, is situated between 38° 27' and 41° 57' N.
                    lat. and between 80° 34' and 84° 49' W. long., and is bounded on the N. by
                    Michigan and Lake Erie, on the E. by Pennsylvania, on the E. and S. by the Ohio
                    river, which separates it from the States of West Virginia and Kentucky, and on
                    the W. by Indiana. The greatest length from north to south is about 210 miles,
                    the greatest breadth from east to west about 225 miles and the area 40,760
                    square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> The surface consists of an undulating
                    plain, generally ranging in elevation between 1550 and 430 feet above sea-level,
                    the portions below 500 feet or above 1400 being comparatively insignificant. The
                    largest connected areas of high land extend from east to west across the central
                    and northern central districts. In some limited districts of central Ohio,
                    especially along the ridge of high land just referred to, and also in a few
                    thousand square miles of north-western Ohio, the natural drainage is somewhat
                    sluggish, and, while the land is covered with its original forest growth, it
                    inclines to swampy conditions; but when the forests are removed and the
                    waterways opened most of it becomes arable, and all of it can be made so without
                    excessive outlay by means of open ditches.</p>
                <p>The chief feature in the topography of Ohio is the watershed, which extends
                    across the State from north-east to south-west, and divides its surface into two
                    unequal slopes, the northern, which is much the smaller, sending its waters into
                    Lake Erie and the Gulf of St Lawrence, while the drainage of the other is to the
                    Gulf of Mexico by the Ohio river. The average height of the ridge is about 1100
                    feet, but it is cut by several gaps, in which the elevation is reduced to about
                    950 feet. The relief of the State is chiefly due to erosive agencies. The entire
                    drainage area of such a river as, for example, the Muskingum or the Scioto, may
                    be conceived as originally a plain, all portions of which were at approximately
                    the same elevation above the sea. Across this area one main furrow has been
                    drawn, deepening and widening as it advances, and a countless number of narrower
                    and shallower valleys are tributary to it. Fragments of the old plain still
                    remain in the isolated “hills” or tablelands that bound the valleys, and which,
                    though often separated by intervals of miles, still answer to each other with
                    perfect correspondence of altitude and stratification. They rise to a maximum
                    height of 600 feet above the river-channels in the main valleys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The rocky floor is entirely composed of
                    unaltered stratified rocks of Palaeozoic age. Not a single trap dyke or volcanic
                    vent intersects them, and not a trace of igneous metamorphism is shown in any
                    portion of their extent. These strata are disposed in plains so nearly
                    horizontal that the dip is nowhere heavy enough to be safely determined by a
                    clinometer. Not only are sharp flexures wanting, but faults deserving the name
                    are found in but a single corner of a single county. A few low folds, one of
                    which is of preponderating importance, traverse the State and redeem its surface
                    from geological monotony. The only structural irregularity is an occasional case
                    of overlap, but even this is seldom of such a character as to interfere with the
                    easy reading of the record. The aggregate thickness of the entire series will
                    reach 5000 feet if the maximum of each stratum is taken into the account, but if
                    the average measurements are used the thickness does not exceed 3500 feet. The
                    main elements of the scale, which extends from the Lower Silurian (upper
                    portion) to the Upper Coal-measures inclusive, are given below, and the
                    geological sketch-map shows how the surface of the State is distributed among
                    the principal formations.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cincinnati</hi> group, which constitutes the surface rock
                    for about 4000 square miles in the south-western corner of the State, consists
                    of alternating layers of blue limestone and calcareous shale, both of which
                    contain great numbers of admirably-preserved fossils. The group is undoubtedly
                    equivalent in part to the Hudson River group of the general scale, and by some
                    geologists the name is counted a synonym, but it has not been proved that the
                    Lower Silurian deposits of south-western Ohio can be definitely correlated with
                    the subdivisions of the series in New York. The formation everywhere yields a
                    cheap and excellent supply of building stone, which is also burned into a dark
                    lime, valued for its hydraulic properties. The shales contain notable quantities
                    of alkalis and phosphates, and the soils into which they very readily weather
                    are proverbial for their fertility. The water-supply of the formation is poor,
                    or rather wanting, the impervious shales refusing admission to the rainfall.</p>
                <p>The Cincinnati axis, a low fold which traverses the State from south-west to
                    north-east, constitutes its most influential geological feature. It entered Ohio
                    from Kentucky at the close of Lower Silurian time, and gradually extended itself
                    to the northward, until it had converted the western half of the State into dry
                    land. It has left a clear record of its successive stages in the strata which
                    compose it. It did not advance steadily and equally, and the occasional relapses
                    which it experienced have given rise to cases of overlap. It has a low, flat
                    summit, and, on account of the soluble and easily-eroded materials of which it
                    consists, it has suffered more from denuding agencies than the Upper Silurian
                    strata that enclose <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0794-0735"/> it, and consequently is now cut down to a lower
                    level than they. In other words, the axis has been converted into a basin.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Clinton Limestone</hi> generally rises in a terrace-like
                    outcrop around the margin of the eroded Cincinnati beds, and its base is marked
                    by the finest line of springs in the State. In its most characteristic phases it
                    is a crystalline limestone that takes a good polish. In very many localities it
                    yields small quantities of petroleum, which seems to be indigenous. The supply
                    is too limited to be valuable.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Niagara</hi> group, also of Upper Silurian age, is of much
                    greater thickness and of proportionally greater economic and scientific
                    importance than the Clinton limestone. As at the Falls, it here consists of a
                    stratum of shale overlain by a massive limestone. It forms the surface rock for
                    about 3000 square miles, but through much of this area it is concealed by heavy
                    beds of Glacial Drift, by which its importance as a factor in the topography and
                    the economic geology of the district is much reduced. In composition the
                    limestone is almost a typical dolomite, but it is still fossiliferous, the
                    fossils occurring as internal casts. It contains a large and interesting fauna.
                    From near the base of the Niagara beds the “Dayton” stone, one of the most
                    valuable building stones of the State, is derived. The formation yields
                    excellent building stones at other horizons also, and its upper beds furnish
                    lime.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lower Helderberg Limestone</hi> occupies even a wider area
                    as a surface formation than the last-named, but is largely covered with Drift
                    deposits. There are whole counties of which it is known to constitute the rocky
                    floor, in λvhich it does not once rise to the surface. It is seen to the best
                    advantage in the north of Highland county, where it yields a remarkably even -
                    bedded building stone. Like the Niagara Limestone, it is a dolomite in
                    composition. It is poor in fossils, but the few that it contains are highly
                    characteristic.</p>
                <p>The transition from Upper Silurian to Devonian time which is made in ascending to
                    the next stratum in the scale, the <hi rend="italic">Corniferous Limestone,</hi>
                    is accomplished without any structural break or irregularity, but there is an
                    abrupt lithological change, the latter stratum being a true carbonate of lime,
                    and an abundant and pronounced Devonian fauna appears in its very lowest beds.
                    The Corniferous Limestone forms a narrow belt on each side of the axis, from
                    central Ohio northward, but by the overlap of the next succeeding formations it
                    is entirely lost in southern Ohio. Even where it constitutes the highest bedded
                    rock it is largely obscured by Drift deposits. At Kelly’s Island, Sandusky,
                    Marion, Delaware, and Columbus it is largely worked for building stone, lime,
                    and furnace flux. The earliest vertebrate remains of the Ohio scale are found in
                    this stratum. The box-like skull of a large ganoid fish, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macropetalichthys sulliυanti,</hi> Newberry, occurs near the base of the
                    series, and the teeth and bones of other ganoids and selachians are frequently
                    met with in the higher beds. In the State quarries at Columbus these remains
                    constitute a veritable bone bed, a layer 4 to 6 inches in thickness being in
                    large part composed of them.</p>
                <p>A heavy deposit of black shale, the <hi rend="italic">Ohio Shale</hi> of the
                    table, and the Huron shale of Newberry, directly overlies the Corniferous
                    Limestone in northern and central Ohio, and extends across the State from north
                    to south. It is composed of two black shales, the Cleveland and the Huron,
                    including a blue shale, the Erie, between them. The latter is 1200 feet thick in
                    north-eastern Ohio, but rapidly wedges out as it is followed westward to the
                    axis, and the Cleveland and Huron seem here to be welded into one mass. The
                    black shale contains an average of 8 or 10 per cent, of bituminous matter, a
                    chief source of which is found in a resinous disk of microscopic size that
                    exists in the shale in immense numbers, which Dawson has named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sporangites huronensis.</hi> Apart from this minute form the shale is almost
                    barren of fossils, but a few have been discovered in it, mostly at the centres
                    of the great concretions which it contains. The gigantic placoderm, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinichthys herzcri,</hi> Newberry, was first found in these
                    concretions. Though dating back almost to the first appearance of fishes,
                    Newberry has shown that its nearest relationship is with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidosiren</hi> of the present day, which zoologists unite in counting as the
                    highest of the entire class. The shale is undoubtedly the source of the natural
                    gas and petroleum of north-eastern Ohio.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Waverly</hi> group, which occupies about 7000 square miles
                    of the surface of the State, is in all respects an important formation. It
                    consists of the Bedford shale, the Berea grit, the Berea shale, the Cuyahoga
                    shale, and the Logan group. The Berea grit has unusual geological interest. Its
                    outcrop is a shore-line across the entire State, and it marks with perfect
                    distinctness the eastern limit of the Cincinnati axis at this date. It is
                    everywhere a quarry stone. The Berea stone and the Amherst stone of northern
                    Ohio and the original Waverly stone of the lower Scioto valley belong to this
                    horizon. In strength, durability, beauty, and the economy with which they can be
                    worked, they stand at the head of the building stones of the State, the value of
                    the annual products of these quarries exceeding $1,000,000. The stone is
                    distributed as far east as the seaboard, and as far west as Duluth. Some of it
                    has even found market in England. The Berea grit is the reservoir of the gas and
                    oil distilled from the underlying shales, and it is also the great source of
                    salt water for Ohio. Another building stone of great excellence and beauty comes
                    from the base of the Cuyahoga shale in southern Ohio,—the Buena Vista stone of
                    the Ohio valley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    total value of quarry products Ohio ranks first among the States, more than
                    $2,500,000 being reported in the census of 1880.</p></note></p>

                <p>All these coals belong to the bituminous division. Thus far they are almost
                    entirely worked in level free mines, and very little is taken from seams less
                    than 3 feet in general thickness. The average thickness in·the important fields
                    is 5 feet, and the maximum (a small area of a single district) 13 feet. All of
                    the seams enumerated above are worked, but they have very unequal values. The
                    Middle Kittanning seam is by far the first. The Upper Freeport ranks next in
                    value. The Sharon coal is the most valuable in proportion to its area,
                    furnishing, in fact, the standard of comparison for the open-burning coals of
                    the entire Alleghany field. Both it and the Middle Kittanning seam are used in
                    the raw state in the manufacture of iron, a fact which sufficiently attests
                    their purity and general excellence. In the remaining divisions of the
                    Coal-measures there are 10 or 12 additional seams that are of workable thickness
                    at some of the localities in which they occur, but, with one notable exception,
                    these seams are less steady and reliable than those of the lower measures. The
                    exception is the Pittsburg coal, which is, all things considered, the most
                    important seam of the entire coal-field to which it belongs. It is especially
                    valued as a gas coal, and for the production of steam. Its northern outcrop
                    passes through nine counties, with an approximate length of 175 miles, not
                    counting the sinuosities. The area commonly assigned to it in Ohio exceeds 3000
                    square miles, but the seam has been proved for only a small fraction of the area
                    claimed. In the production of bituminous coal in the United States Ohio ranked
                    third in 1880, the output for that year being about 6,000,000 tons, but the
                    production is rapidly increasing, and the State inspector of mines reckoned the
                    output in 1882 at 8,000,000 tons.</p>
                <p>Iron ore is worked at many horizons in the Coal-measures, in seams ranging from 6
                    inches to 19 feet in thickness. The charcoal iron of the Hanging Rock district
                    of southern Ohio is chiefly applied to the highest uses, as the manufacture of
                    car-wheels and castings for agricultural and other machinery. Of the 99
                    furnace-stacks that now stand in Ohio, almost all depend in part, and about half
                    depend entirely, on native ore. The amount mined annually exceeds 500,000 tons.
                    In iron and steel industries Ohio ranks next to Pennsylvania, the value of the
                    annual product being $35,000,000. The clays of the Coal-measures are the basis
                    of a large and rapidly growing manufacture of stone and earthen ware. Ohio now
                    produces one-third of the total product of the. United States. In connexion with
                    the salt production, which is large, about half of the bromine of the world is
                    produced in Ohio. The brine of the Tuscarawas valley yields nearly I lb of
                    bromine to 1 barrel of salt.</p>
                <p>Three-fourths of Ohio are covered with the various deposits of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Drift period,</hi> which consists of “till” or boulder clay, and
                    of the stratified sands and clays of the later stages of the period. These
                    deposits sometimes have a thickness of 300 feet,—their average in north-western
                    Ohio being not less than 50, and in central Ohio not less than 25 feet. In the
                    regions which they cover they exercise a controlling influence upon the relief,
                    drainage, soils, and water-supply. They have filled the valleys of earlier
                    drainage systems, and in many cases have obliterated all traces of their
                    existence. The till is filled with boulders of northern origin derived from the
                    highlands of Canada and from intervening districts. Blocks of large size are
                    sometimes found, some of them showing 2000 cubic feet above ground. In many
                    instances they can be referred by their mineralogical characters to particular
                    localities, or even to particular ledges, from a score of miles to 400 miles
                    distant. The stratified Drift contains vast accumulations of sand, gravel, and
                    clay, all of great economic value. Brick clays of good quality are everywhere
                    accessible. The terminal moraine that forms the boundary of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n795/mode/1up"

                    conspicuous as in the States to the east of Ohio, but even where it is least
                    distinct soil and vegetation unite to mark the limit of glacial advance very
                    plainly. The moraine passes through the counties of Columbiana, Stark, Wayne,
                    Richland, Holmes, Licking, Fairfield, Ross, Highland, Adams, and Brown, as
                    recently determined by Professor G. F. Wright.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soils, Forests.—</hi> The division of the State into a
                    drift-covered and driftless region coincides with the most important division of
                    the soils. Below the line of the terminal moraine these are “native,” or, in
                    other words, they are derived from the rocks that underlie them, or that rise
                    above them in the boundaries of the valleys and uplands. They consequently share
                    the varying constitution of these rocks, and are characterized by considerable
                    inequality and by abrupt changes. All are fairly productive, and some,
                    especially those derived from the abundant and easily-soluble limestones of the
                    Upper Coal-measures, are not surpassed in fertility by any soils of the State.
                    Large tracts of these excellent native soils are found in Belmont, Monroe,
                    Noble, and Morgan counties. Among the thinner and less productive soils, which
                    occupy but a small area, are those derived from the Devonian shales. They are,
                    however, well adapted to forest and fruit production. The chestnut and the
                    chestnut oak, both valuable timber trees, are partial to them, and vineyards and
                    orchards thrive remarkably. The native soils of the Waverly group and of the
                    Lower Coal-measures agree in general characters. They are especially adapted to
                    forest growth, reaching the highest standard in quality of timber product. When
                    these lands are brought under the exhaustive tillage that has mainly prevailed
                    in Ohio thus far, they do not hold out well, but the farmer who raises cattle
                    and sheep, keeps to a rotation between grass and small grains, and does not
                    neglect fruit can do well upon them. The cheap lands of Ohio are found in this
                    belt. The other great division of the soils of Ohio—viz., the Drift soils—are by
                    far the most important, alike from their greater area and their intrinsic
                    excellence. Formed by the commingling of the Glacial waste of all the formations
                    to the north of them, over which the ice has passed, they always possess
                    considerable variety of composition, but still in many cases they are strongly
                    coloured by the formation underneath them. When any stratum of uniform
                    composition has a broad outcrop across the line of Glacial advance, the Drift
                    beds that cover its southern portions will be found to have been derived in
                    large part from the formation itself, and will thus resemble native or sedentary
                    soils. Western Ohio is underlain with Silurian limestones, and the Drift is
                    consequently limestone Drift. The soil is so thoroughly that of limestone land
                    that tobacco, a crop which rarely leaves native limestone soils, is grown
                    successfully in several counties of western Ohio, 100 miles or more north of the
                    terminal moraine. The native forests of the Drift regions were, without
                    exception, hard-wood forests, the leading species being oaks, maples, hickories,
                    the walnut, beech, and elm. The walnut, sugar maple, and white hickory are
                    limited to warm, well-drained limestone land; the white oak characterizes the
                    upland clays, while the red maple, the elm, and several of the oaks stand for
                    the regions of sluggish drainage. This noble growth is rapidly disappearing, but
                    several million acres still remain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> There is a difference of at least 40° Fahr,
                    between the average summer and winter temperatures. A central east-and-west belt
                    of the State is bounded by the annual isotherms of 51° and 52°, the average
                    winter temperature being 30° and the average summer temperature 73°. Southern
                    Ohio has a mean annual temperature of 54°, and northern Ohio 49°. The annual
                    range is not less than 100°, and sometimes 130°, the extreme of summer heat
                    reaching 100° in the shade, while “cold waves” in winter may depress the mercury
                    to 30° below zero. Extreme changes are liable to occur in the course of a few
                    hours, especially in winter, when the return trades are violently displaced by
                    north-west winds. In such cases the temperature sometimes falls 60° Fahr, in
                    twenty-four hours; changes of 20° or 30° in a day are not unusual. Still the
                    climate proves itself excellently adapted to the finer growths of vegetation,
                    while its effects on human life and on the domestic animals favour a symmetrical
                    development and a high degree of vigour. The rainfall varies between an average
                    of 46 inches in the Ohio valley and an average of 32 inches on the shore of Lake
                    Erie (spring 10 to 12 inches, summer 10 to 14 inches, autumn 8 to 10 inches,
                    winter 7 to 10 inches). The annual range is considerable. In some years there is
                    an insufficient supply and in some there is a troublesome excess, but disastrous
                    droughts on the large scale are unknown, and disastrous floods are rare.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quite recently, however, the
                    Ohio river has twice attained a height unprecedented in its former recorded
                    history. In February 1883 the water rose to a height of 66 feet 4 inches, and in
                    February 1884 to 71 feet 0∣ inch above the channel bar at Cincinnati, the last
                    rise being nearly 7 feet in excess of the highest mark recorded previous to
                    1883. These great floods covered the sites of large and prosperous towns, swept
                    away hundreds of dwellings, and inflicted deplorable losses on the residents in
                    the great valley.</p></note> The vast body of water in Lake Erie favourably
                    modifies the climate of the northern margin of the State. The belt immediately
                    adjoining is famous for the fruits that it produces. Extensive vineyards and
                    orchards have been planted along the shore and on the islands adjacent, and have
                    proved very successful. The Catawba wine here grown ranks first among the native
                    wines of eastern North America. Melons of excellent quality are raised in almost
                    every section of the State. The peach is the least certain of all the fruits
                    that are largely cultivated; there is rarely, however, a complete failure on the
                    uplands of southern Ohio. The winters of Ohio are very variable. Snow seldom
                    remains for thirty days at a time over the State at large, but an ice crop
                    rarely fails in northern Ohio, and not oftener than once in three or four years
                    in other portions of the State. In the southern counties cattle, sheep, and
                    horses often thrive on pasture grounds through the entire winter.</p>

                    supplied with the best breeds of sheep, and the wool of south-eastern Ohio has
                    long been famous for unusual strength of fibre. The annual production of wool
                    exceeds 20,000,000 ft&gt;, Ohio holding the first rank in this respect among the
                    States of the Union. In the origination of agricultural machinery Ohio has taken
                    a leading part, and in the present manufacture it easily holds the first rank,
                    the value of the annual product exceeding $15,500,000, or one-fourth of the
                    entire product of the United States. The average yield of wheat in the State has
                    been doubled within the last ten years through the use of artificial fertilizers
                    and improved methods of cultivation. An efficient system of crop reports is
                    carried on by a State board of agriculture, and thorough control of the
                    artificial manures sold in the State is maintained by constantly repeated

                    the farm products, reaching an aggregate of nearly $350,000,000. As a necessary
                    result of the recent development of mining and manufacturing in Ohio, its cities
                    and villages are gaining rapidly in population and wealth. Cincinnati, the
                    largest city of the State and the eighth in the Union, had a population of
                    255,139 by the census of 1880. The same census credits it with about 30 per
                    cent, of the manufactures of the State, but the reports of its chamber of
                    commerce give it a much greater total than the census tables. Cleveland, the
                    second city of Ohio and the eleventh of the United States, had 160,146

                <p><hi rend="italic">Government and Administration.—AH</hi> legislative power is
                    vested in a general assembly consisting of a senate and house of
                    representatives. Senators and representatives are elected biennially. The
                    executive department consists of a governor, a lieutenant-governor, a secretary
                    of state, a treasurer, and an attorney-general, all elected for a term of two
                    years, with an auditor, elected for four years. The supreme executive power is
                    vested in the governor, who is commander-in-chief of the militia, and may grant
                    reprieves and partions. The lieutenant-governor is president of the senate.
                    There is also elected triennially a State commissioner of common schools. For
                    the control and superintendence of all public works a board of public works is
                    created, consisting of three members, each elected for three years. There are
                    appointed by the governor, by and with the consent of the senate, a commissioner
                    of railroads and telegraphs for two years, a superintendent of insurance for
                    three years, an inspector of mines for four years, a commissioner of statistics
                    of labour for two years; also a supervisor of public printing, a State
                    librarian, an inspector of leaf tobacco, and a State inspector of oils for two
                    years each, and three commissioners of fisheries for three years each. To
                    investigate the whole system of public charities and the correctional and penal
                    institutions of the State, eight persons, four from each of the leading
                    political parties, are appointed by the governor for four years each to
                    constitute a board of State charities. The judicial power is vested in a supreme
                    court, district courts, common pleas courts, probate courts, and justices of the
                    peace; and the legislature may create courts inferior to the supreme court in
                    one or more counties. The supreme court consists of five judges, elected for
                    five ÿears each. There are nine common pleas districts with three judges each,
                    holding office for five years; each district is divided into three parts, with
                    one judge (and more if the legislature so provide) for each part. The district
                    court is composed of the judges of the common pleas district together with one
                    of the supreme court judges, any three forming a quorum. The original
                    jurisdiction of the district court is concurrent with that of the supreme court;
                    each county has a probate court for probate and testamentary matters. Townships
                    are supplied with justices of the peace. All judges and justices are elected by
                    the people. Clerks of the courts are elected by the people also. The State is
                    divided into two United States districts, a northern and a southern. Each
                    district is divided into an eastern and western division. All elections are by
                    ballot, and every sane male citizen, twenty-one years old and a resident of the
                    State for one year next preceding election, may vote. Education is provided for
                    by taxation and funds arising from the sale of public lands. The insane, blind,
                    and deaf and dumb are supported by the State. A sinking fund, sufficient for
                    discharging annually the interest of the public debt and not less than $100,000
                    of the principal thereof, is provided from the proceeds of the public works,
                    sale of canal, school, and ministerial lands, and taxation. The State at present
                    is represented in the Congress of the United States by two senators and
                    twenty-one representatives. The legislature of the State is empowered to lay off
                    new or change existing counties. The electors in each county elect three
                    commissioners, for three years each, who constitute the county board. They have
                    the care of the county property, fix the taxes, regulate roads, and provide for
                    idiots, lunatics, and paupers. The other officers are three infirmary directors,
                    an auditor, a secretary of the commissioners, a recorder, a surveyor, a clerk of
                    the court of common pleas, who is also clerk of the district court, each elected
                    for three years; also a treasurer, a sheriff, a coroner, and a prosecuting
                    attorney, each elected for two years. In a county that has in it a city of over
                    180,000 population there is a board of control, consisting of five members, each
                    elected for three years, which has a final action and jurisdiction in all
                    matters involving expenditure of money. Each county must contain at least 400
                    square miles of territory. Counties are subdivided into townships, the power to
                    do which resides in the county commissioners. Each township must contain at
                    least 22 square miles, and be at least one election precinct. The officers are
                    three trustees, a clerk, a treasurer, such constables as the trustees may
                    designate, and an assessor, elected annually. The trustees oversee elections,
                    provide for the repairing of roads, make regulations preventing the spread of
                    diseases, provide for cemeteries and libraries if the voters determine to have
                    them, and afford relief to the poor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The Continental Congress in 1785, in an
                    ordinance for the survey of the lands north-west of the Ohio, reserved lot
                    number 16 in every township, equivalent to one-thirty-sixth of the township, for
                    the support of public schools. These provisions did not apply to the Virginia
                    military and Connecticut reserves, equal in area to about one-fourth of the
                    entire State, nor to the United States military reservation, embracing nearly
                    4000 square miles. The convention that framed the State constitution in 1802
                    requested and obtained of Congress a concession of one-thirty-sixth of the lands
                    in the Virginia and United States military reservations, and a like proportion
                    for education in the Connecticut reserve,—a portion of the latter, however,
                    being set apart in the United States military reservation, the remainder from
                    the public lands in the northwestern part of the State (1834). Prior to 1827 the
                    only revenues obtained from such lands were of the nature of rents, and were
                    wholly inadequate. In the year named a law was passed providing for the sale of
                    the school lands, other laws also being enacted for the establishment of a fund
                    for the support of common schools. The result of the sales is somewhat
                    disappointing, since the entire proceeds realized up to 15th November 1882
                    amount to but $3,686,511·56. This is known as the common school irreducible
                    fund. The State early undertook to supplement the revenue thus acquired by a
                    general tax; the present law provides for a tax of one mill on the dollar.
                    Opportunity for special levies was given as early as 1821 to district officers.
                    At present the law authorizes every board of education to determine the amount
                    of tax to be levied as a contingent fund for all school expenses, not exceeding
                    seven mills on the dollar. As early as 1827 the legislature adopted the policy
                    of making offenders against the laws contribute to the support of the schools by
                    appropriating fines .collected to the school funds. This policy still continues.
                    The receipts for school purposes in 1882 exceed $12,000,000 :—</p>

                    daily attendance. The school sessions average 31 weeks in the year, and 24,135
                    teachers are employed; the illiterates above ten years of age form only 4 per
                    cent, of the total population. The total expenses for the common schools in 1882
                    were $8,820,914'95.</p>
                <p>Higher education was not neglected by the first settlers of the State. In the
                    Ohio Company’s purchase two entire townships were granted, upon which the Ohio
                    university was established. In the Symmes ’ s purchase a township of land was
                    granted, which when located served as the foundation for the Miami university.
                    There are now 62 such institutions for learning in the State, employing 457
                    teachers, having 11,314 students, receiving $411,309 and expending $405,573,
                    with a property valued at $6,203,691.</p>

                <p>Of these, 25 are enabled by their charters to confer collegiate degrees. Among
                    the oldest and most prominent of the colleges are Antioch, Denison, Kenyon,
                    Marietta, Oberlin, Ohio Wesleyan, Otterbein, St Xavier’s, Western Reserve, and
                    Wittenberg; of those more recently founded three deserve special mention, viz.,
                    the university of Cincinnati, the Case School of Applied Science at Cleveland,
                    and the Ohio State university at Columbus. The first two are founded upon
                    private munificence, and each is entering upon a career of great promise. The
                    third, established upon a gift of public lands from the general Government, is
                    specially charged with instruction in the sciences relating to agriculture and
                    the mechanic arts, and is also required to include military training. In
                    addition, therefore, to the ordinary courses of an American college, this
                    institution is obliged to provide full facilities in applied science, and the
                    State makes use of its faculty and equipment for all its official scientific
                    work. The chemical work of the State Board of Agriculture and also of the State
                    Geological Survey is performed here. The Agricultural Experiment Station and the
                    State Meteorological Bureau are both at the university.</p>

                    $6,270,396'22, and the disbursements $5,630,219'29. The funded State debt at
                    15th November 1882 was $4,901,665, all at 4 per cent., and the irreducible debt
                    (trust) was $4,393,014'71, making a total State debt of $9,294,679'71, while the

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Ohio was discovered by La Salle, probably as
                    early as 1670, and the French took formal possession of the whole northwest in
                    1671. In 1749 all English settlers were warned by the French commandant at
                    Detroit to retire from the region north of the Ohio. The settlements had been
                    made under the third charter granted by King James I. to Virginia (12th March
                    1611), which ceded to the colony all of the present State of Ohio lying south of
                    41° N. lat., and that granted by Charles II. to Connecticut (23d April 1662),
                    which ceded to the colony all the territory of the present State lying north of
                    41° N. lat. The conflicting claims were set at rest by the treaty of Paris in
                    1763, by which France surrendered to Great Britain all her lands in the north
                    and west as far as the Mississippi. During the progress of the American
                    Revolution, and while the States were struggling to form a union on the basis of
                    the articles of confederation submitted for ratification in 1777, a controversy
                    arose as to the rightful ownership of unoccupied lands. The States appealed to
                    their charters, as did Virginia and Connecticut, for their title to the lands
                    north-west of the Ohio. The opposing States claimed that the unoccupied lands,
                    though charter lands, should be surrendered for the common benefit, to become
                    the property of the new union. The controversy was settled in some cases, as in
                    that of New York, by the abandonment of all claims by the State; in others,
                    among them Virginia and Connecticut, compromises were entered into by which the
                    States made large reservations in the acts of surrender. Virginia reserved for
                    military bounty lands about 3,710,000 acres, lying between the Scioto and Little
                    Miami rivers, and bounded on the south by the Ohio river. Connecticut reserved
                    as a foundation for her school fund a tract extending 120 miles westward of the
                    Pennsylvania line, bounded on the south by 41° N. lat., and by the Connecticut
                    line on the north. The land area extended to about 3,667,000 acres. In 1800
                    Connecticut surrendered all jurisdictional right over these lands to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Among the last and most important acts of the Congress of the old confederation
                    was its passing the ordinance of 1787, providing a government for the territory
                    north-west of the Ohio. The ordinance is a remarkable document ^ in many
                    particulars, and especially for the clause in its sixth article, which reads:
                    “There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in said territory,
                    otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been
                    duly convicted,”—a clause which, after appearing in many State documents, at
                    last became the property of the nation when it was adopted as the thirteenth
                    amendment of the constitution of the United States. The passing of the ordinance
                    was closely connected with the purchase of a million and a half of acres upon
                    the Ohio, and in the Muskingum valley, by the Ohio Company. On 9th July 1788
                    General St Clair, the governor, and his associates, Judges Parsons, Varnum, and
                    Symmes, formally established the government of the Territory at Marietta, the
                    newly-formed settlement of the company, situated on the Ohio at the mouth of the
                    Muskingum, and named after Marie Antoinette. The next considerable purchase of
                    land was made by Judge Symmes, who secured upwards of 311,000 acres on the Ohio,
                    between the Great and Little Miami rivers. The site of Cincinnati was purchased
                    from Judge Symmes by Mathias Denman of New Jersey, whose surveys marked out in
                    the winter of 1788-89 the town that has since grown to be the leading city of
                    the State. Two expeditions sent against hostile Indians at the head-waters of
                    the Miamis in 1790 and 1791 resulted in such disastrous failure that the
                    settlers began to despair of protection. However, in 1794 General Wayne won a
                    decisive victory over the united tribes near the rapids of the Maumee, and at
                    the treaty of Greenville, contracted a year later with eleven chiefs, secured
                    peace. As a result, the rapid immigration which followed enabled the residents
                    of the Territory to avail themselves of the provisions of the ordinance in
                    organizing a representative government for the Territory by electing a
                    legislature, which held its first session in Cincinnati 24th September 1799. By
                    authority of Congress a convention which met at Chillicothe in November 1802
                    drafted and on the 29th day of the month signed and ratified for the people the
                    first constitution of Ohio. Several stipulations relative to school lands were
                    made by the convention in the constitution submitted to Congress, which were
                    conceded, and the State was admitted 19th February 1803 as the fourth under the
                    constitution of the United States, and the seventeenth in the roll of the
                    States. Chillicothe, which in 1800 had been made the seat of government for the
                    North -West Territory, continued to be the capital of the State until 1810, when
                    the Government removed to Zanesville for two years. Returning to Chillicothe, it
                    chose Columbus in 1816 as the permanent capital of the State.</p>
                <p>In 1821 a movement for internal improvements was inaugurated, which culminated in
                    the construction of a canal from the Ohio to Lake Erie through the valleys of
                    the Scioto and the Muskingum, and another from Cincinnati to Dayton. Fortunately
                    the movement for common schools began at the same period. The canals set free
                    the locked-up produce of the interior, and the State entered upon a new life.
                    The completion of the Cumberland road in 1825, as far as Wheeling on the Ohio,
                    gave the State an outlet to the seaboard. While the canals were yet incomplete
                    the construction of railroads was undertaken. The Mad River and Lake Erie
                    Railroad from Dayton to Sandusky was the first, being chartered in 1832 and
                    actively begun in 1835. In 1852 three through lines had been opened across the
                    State; and its whole social and economic history thenceforward assumed a new
                    character. Since 1840 Ohio has been the third State in the Union in point of
                    population.</p>
                <p>The present constitution of the State is the result of a revision of that of 1802
                    by a convention which assembled in Columbus 6th May 1850, and sat during part of
                    its session at Cincinnati. It completed its work 10th March 1851, and the people
                    ratified the revised constitution 17th June 1851. A second convention of
                    revision was assembled in Columbus 14th May 1873, which, like its predecessor,
                    sat also in Cincinnati. The constitution submitted, practically a new one, was
                    rejected by the people at the October election of 1874. (E. O.—J. T. S.)</p>
