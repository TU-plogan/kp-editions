                <p><label type="entry">ODDFELLOWS</label>, a name adopted by the members of certain
                    social institutions having mystic signs of recogni tion, initiatory rites and
                    ceremonies, and various grades of dignity and honour. The objects the
                    associations have in view are purely social and benevolent; the sphere of their
                    operations is confined wholly to their own members, and secrecy is enjoined in
                    regard to all benevolent acts. As in the case of most other institutions of a
                    similar kind, a claim of venerable antiquity has been set up for the order of
                    Oddfellows,—the most common account of its origin ascribing it to the Jewish
                    legion under Titus, who, it is asserted, received from that emperor its first
                    charter written on a golden tablet. Statements even more improbable and
                    fantastic have been made regarding its foundation, but Oddfellows themselves now
                    generally admit that the institution cannot be traced to an earlier period than
                    the first half of the 18th century, and explain the name as adopted at a time
                    when the severance into sects and classes was so wide that persons aiming at
                    social union and mutual help were a marked exception to the general rule.
                    Mention is made by Defoe of the society of Oddfellows, but the oldest lodge of
                    which the name has been handed down is the Loyal Aristarcus, No. 9, which met in
                    1745 “at the Oakley Arms, Borough of Southwark; Globe Tavern, Hatton Garden; or
                    the Boar’s Head in Smithfield, as the noble master may direct.” The earliest
                    lodges were supported by each member and visitor paying a penny to the secretary
                    on entering the lodge, and special sums were voted to any brother in need. If
                    out of work he was supplied with a card and funds to reach the next lodge, and
                    he went from lodge to lodge until he found employment. Now there is a regular
                    system of periodical dues and collections, with occasional fees proportioned to
                    the dignities or degrees conferred in the lodges. At first each lodge was
                    practically independent of the others, and had its own special rules and
                    government, but a close bond of unity gradually grew up between the large
                    majority of the lodges until they adopted a definite common ritual and became
                    confederated under the name of the Patriotic Order. Towards the end of the
                    century many of the lodges were broken up by State prosecutions on the suspicion
                    that their purposes were “seditious,” but the society, changing its name and
                    location, continued to exist in a sort of moribund condition, as the Union Order
                    of Oddfellows, until in 1809 several of the members endeavoured to resuscitate
                    its dormant energies. Finding, however, that it was impossible to excite an
                    interest in anything higher than convivial meetings, they in 1813, at a
                    convention in Manchester, formally seceded from the Union Order and formed the
                    Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Unity, which increased with enormous
                    rapidity, and now overshadows all the minor societies in England. According to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oddfellows' Magazine</hi> for October 1883, the membership
                    of the order in 1834 was 32,832, which in 1837 had increased to 80,570 and in
                    1845 to 239,374, while in January 1883 the numbers had risen to 565,368, the
                    lodges amounting to 4251. In 1881 the receipts were £761,695, the payments
                    £531,335, and the capital £5,291,891. In 1850 the society was legalized and
                    recognized by the state in a corporate capacity. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oddfellows' Magazine,</hi> issued by the society, and up to October 1883
                    published quarterly, now appears monthly. In England there are a large number of
                    minor orders of Oddfellows, which either existed before the Manchester Unity,
                    have seceded from it, or have had an independent origin. Among them are the
                    Ancient Independent Order or Kent Unity, Woolwich, 1805, revived 1861; the
                    Nottingham Ancient Imperial Order, 1812; the London Unity, 1820; the Boston
                    Unity, 1832; the Kingston Unity, 1840; the Norfolk and Norwich Unity, 1849; and
                    the Derby Midland United Order, 1856.</p>

                    be supposed from the social characteristics and proclivities of the Americans,
                    as soon as it had gained a firm hold its principles spread with great rapidity,
                    and it now rivals in membership and influence the Manchester Unity, from which
                    it severed its connexion in 1842. In 1843 it issued a dispensation for opening
                    the Prince of Wales Lodge No. 1 at Montreal, Canada. The American society,
                    including Canada and the United States, has its headquarters at Baltimore. In
                    1882 the membership was said to be 500,000, the income 6,000,000 dollars, and
                    the annual sum disbursed for the relief of members of the order 2,000,000
                    dollars. Organizations, connected either with the United States or England, have
                    been founded in Germany, Switzerland, Gibraltar and Malta, Australia, New
                    Zealand, the Fiji Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, South Africa, South America,
                    the West Indies, and Barbados.</p>
