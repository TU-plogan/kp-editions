                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0818-0759"/> streets and a number of imposing public
                    buildings. Among these the principal are the town-hall, a fine structure in the
                    Grecian style, with a tetrastyle portico copied from the Ionic temple of Ceres
                    near Athens, enlarged by a new wing erected in 1880 at a cost of £24,000, the
                    nucleus of much more extensive municipal buildings; the lyceum, in the Italian
                    style, erected in 1854 and enlarged in 1880; the public baths, erected in
                    1854—partly by money raised for a memorial to Sir Robert Peel—and enlarged in
                    1880; the workmen’s hall, erected in 1844 and enlarged in 1854; the Werneth
                    mechanics’ institute, 1867; the infirmary, erected in 1870 and enlarged in 1877;
                    and the new post-office, 1877. There is a grammar school, founded in 1611; but a
                    more important educational endowment is the blue-coat school, for which a sum of
                    £40,000 was left in 1808. On account of a legal dispute the money was allowed to
                    accumulate for over twenty years, so that the school started with an endowment
                    of £100,000. The town possesses a commodious general market, opened in 1856, and
                    also a fish market, opened in 1873. Both the gasworks and waterworks have since
                    1853 been in the hands of the corporation. Additional reservoirs have been added
                    to meet the increasing needs of the town, their total capacity being now
                    1,233,500,000 gallons. During the cotton famine occupation was given to many of
                    the distressed operatives in laying out 72 acres as a public park, which, under
                    the name of the Alexandra Park, was opened in 1865, at a cost of about £37,000.
                    The town, which is one of the most important seats of the cotton manufacture in
                    the world, owes its prosperity in great part to its situation on the edge of the
                    Lancashire coal-field, where the mineral is very easily wrought. There are many
                    valuable seams of coal in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, those in
                    highest repute being the Black Mine and Bent Mine coals. From entries in the
                    church registers it would appear that linens were manufactured in Oldham as
                    early as 1630. Watermills were introduced in 1770, and with the adoption of
                    Arkwright’s inventions the cotton industry spread with great rapidity. After the
                    introduction of steam power the town, owing to its proximity to the coal-beds,
                    soon assumed a leading place in the manufacture of cotton. The total number of
                    persons engaged in the industry is over 30,000, the annual consumption of cotton
                    being over 700,000 bales, or about one-fourth of the whole quantity of cotton
                    imported into the United Kingdom. The principal manufactures are fustians,
                    velvets, cords, hats, shirtings, sheetings, and nankeens. There are also large
                    foundries and mill and cotton machinery works, the most extensive establishment
                    being that of Platt and Co. The gas-meters made at Oldham have a high
                    reputation, and there are also several large manufactories of sewing-machines.
                    The town is divided into eight wards, and is governed by a mayor, eight
                    aidermen, and twenty-four councillors. The area of the township is coextensive
                    with that of the municipal borough, and comprehends 4730 acres, of which 13 are
                    water. The parliamentary borough has an area of 12,310 acres, and, in addition
                    to Oldham, includes the townships of Crompton, Royton, and Chadderton, and part
                    of the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne. Within the present century the growth of
                    Oldham has been very rapid. In 1714 the population numbered only 1750, which in
                    1801 had increased to 12,024, in 1841 to 42,595, in 1861 to 72,333, in 1871 to
                    82,633, and in 1881 to 111,343. The population of the parliamentary borough in
                    1871 was 113,100, and in 1881 it was 152,513.</p>
                <p>The name Oldham is of Saxon origin. A Roman road, of which some traces are still
                    left, passes through the township, but it does not appear to have been a Roman
                    station. It is not mentioned in Domesday; but in the reign of Henry III.
                    Alwardus de Aidholme is referred to as holding “two bovats of land in Vernet
                    (Werneth).” A daughter and co-heiress of this Alwardus conveyed Werneth Hall and
                    its manor to the Cudworths, a branch of the Yorkshire family, with whom it
                    remained till the early part of last century. From the Oldhams was descended
                    Hugh Oldham, who died bishop of Exeter in 1519. In 1826 the town was placed
                    under the care of a board of commissioners, and in 1849 it received municipal
                    government. Since 1832 it has returned two members to parliament.</p>
