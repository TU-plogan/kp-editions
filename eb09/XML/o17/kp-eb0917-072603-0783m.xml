                    crowd of German tribes, among whom we discern four, who seem to have hovered
                    over the Danube from Passau to Pesth, namely, the Rugii, Scyrri, Turcilingi, and
                    Heruli. With all of these Odoacer was connected by his subsequent career, and
                    all seem, more or less, to have claimed him as belonging to them by birth; the
                    evidence slightly preponderates in favour of his descent from the Scyrri.</p>
                <p>His father was Aedico or Idico, a name which suggests Edeco the Hun, who was
                    suborned by the Byzantine court to plot the assassination of his master Attila.
                    There are, however, some strong arguments against this identification. A certain
                    Edica, chief of the Scyrri, of whom Jordanes speaks as defeated by the
                    Ostrogoths, may more probably have been the father of Odoacer, though even in
                    this theory there are some difficulties, chiefly connected with the low estate
                    in which he appears before us in the next scene of his life, when as a tall
                    young recruit for the Roman armies, dressed in a sordid vesture of skins, on his
                    way to Italy, he enters the cell of Severinus, a noted hermit-saint of Noricum,
                    to ask his blessing. The saint had an inward premonition of his future
                    greatness, and in blessing him said, “Fare onward into Italy. Thou who art now
                    clothed in vile raiment wilt soon give precious gifts unto many.”</p>
                <p>Odoacer was probably about thirty years of age when he thus left his country and
                    entered the imperial service. By the year 472 he had risen to some eminence,
                    since it is expressly recorded that he sided with the patrician Ricimer in his
                    quarrel with the emperor Anthemius. In the year 475, by one of the endless
                    revolutions which marked the close of the Western empire, the emperor Nepos was
                    driven into exile, and the successful rebel Orestes was enabled to array in the
                    purple his son, a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen, who was named Romulus
                    after his grandfather, and nicknamed Augustulus, from his inability to play the
                    part of the great Augustus. Before this puppet emperor had been a year o∏ the
                    throne the barbarian mercenaries, who were chiefly drawn from the Danubian
                    tribes before mentioned, rose in mutiny, demanding to be made proprietors of
                    one-third of the soil of Italy. To this request Orestes returned a peremptory
                    negative. Odoacer now offered his fellow-soldiers to obtain for them all that
                    they desired if they would seat him on the throne. On the 23d August 476 he was
                    proclaimed king; five days later Orestes was made prisoner at Placentia and
                    beheaded; and on the 4th September his brother Paulus was defeated and slain in
                    the pine-wood near Ravenna. Rome at once accepted the new ruler. Augustulus was
                    compelled to descend from the throne, but his life was spared.</p>
                <p>Odoacer was forty-two years of age when he thus became chief ruler of Italy, and
                    he reigned thirteen years with undisputed sway. Our information as to this
                    period is very slender, but we can perceive that the administration was
                    conducted as much as possible on the lines of the old imperial government. The
                    settlement of the barbarian soldiers on the lands of Italy probably affected the
                    great landowners rather than the labouring class. To the herd of <hi
                    rend="italic">coloni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">servi,</hi> by whom in their
                    various degrees the land was actually cultivated, it probably made little
                    difference, except as a matter of sentiment, whether the master whom they served
                    called himself Roman or Rugian. We have one most interesting example, though in
                    a small way, of such a transfer of land with its appurtenant slaves and cattle,
                    in the donation made by Odoacer himself to his faithful follower Pierius.<note

                    perusal of such a record.</p>
                <p>The same fact, from a slightly different point of view, is illustrated by the
                    curious history (recorded by Malchus) of the embassies to Constantinople. The
                    dethroned emperor Nepos sent ambassadors (in 477 or 478) to Zeno emperor <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0784-0727"/> of the East, begging his aid in the reconquest of
                    Italy. These ambassadors met a deputation from the Roman senate, sent nominally
                    by the command of Augustulus, really no doubt by that of Odoacer, the purport of
                    whose commission was that they did not need a separate emperor. One was
                    sufficient to defend the borders of either realm. The senate had chosen Odoacer,
                    whose knowledge of military affairs and whose statesmanship admirably fitted him
                    for preserving order in that part of the world, and they therefore prayed Zeno
                    to confer upon him the dignity of patrician, and entrust the “diocese” of Italy
                    to his care. Zeno returned a harsh answer to the senate, requiring them to
                    return to their allegiance to Nepos. In fact, however, he did nothing for the
                    fallen emperor, but accepted the new order of things, and even addressed Odoacer
                    as patrician. On the other hand, the latter sent the ornaments of empire, the
                    diadem and purple robe, to Constantinople as an acknowledgment of the fact that
                    he did not claim supreme power. Our information as to the actual title assumed
                    by the new ruler is somewhat confused. He does not appear to have called himself
                    king of Italy. His kingship seems to have marked only his relation to his
                    Teutonic followers, among whom he was “king of the Turcilingi,” “king of the
                    Heruli,” and so forth, according to the nationality with which he was dealing.
                    By the Roman inhabitants of Italy he was addressed as “dominus noster,” but his
                    right to exercise power would in their eyes rest, in theory, on his recognition
                    as patricius by the Byzantine Augustus. At the same time, he marked his own high
                    pretensions by assuming the prefix Flavius, a reminiscence of the early
                    emperors, to which the barbarian rulers of realms formed out of the Roman state
                    seem to have been peculiarly partial. His internal administration was probably,
                    upon the whole, wise and moderate, though we hear some complaints of financial
                    oppression, and he may be looked upon as a not altogether unworthy predecessor
                    of Theodoric.</p>
                <p>In the history of the papacy Odoacer figures as the author of a decree
                    promulgated at the election of Felix II. in 483, forbidding the pope to alienate
                    any of the lands or ornaments of the Roman Church, and threatening any pope who
                    should infringe this edict with anathema. This decree, a strange one to proceed
                    from an Arian sovereign, was probably suggested by some of the Roman counsellors
                    of the king, and seems to have been accepted at the time without protest. It
                    was, however, loudly condemned in a synod held by Pope Symmachus (502) as an
                    unwarrantable interference of the civil power with the concerns of the
                    church.</p>
                <p>The chief events in the foreign policy of Odoacer were his Dalmatian and Rugian
                    wars. In the year 480 the ex-emperor Nepos, who ruled Dalmatia, w*as
                    traitorously assassinated in Diocletian’s palace at Spalato by the counts Viator
                    and Ovida. In the following year Odoacer invaded Dalmatia, slew the murderer
                    Ovida, and reannexed Dalmatia to the Western state. In 487 he appeared as an
                    invader in his own native Danubian lands. War broke out between him and
                    Feletheus, king of the Rugians. Odoacer entered the Rugian territory, defeated
                    Feletheus, and carried him and “his noxious wife” Gisa prisoners to Ravenna. In
                    the following year Frederick, son of the captive king, endeavoured to raise
                    again the fallen fortunes of his house, but was defeated by Onulf, brother of
                    Odoacer, and, being forced to flee, took refuge at the court of Theodoric the
                    Ostrogoth, at Sistova on the lower Danube.</p>
                <p>This Rugian war was probably an indirect cause of the fall of Odoacer. His
                    increasing power rendered him too formidable to the Byzantine court, with whom
                    his relations had for some time been growing less friendly. At the same time,
                    Zeno was embarrassed by the formidable neighbourhood of Theodoric and his
                    Ostrogothic warriors, who were almost equally burdensome as enemies or as
                    allies. In these circumstances arose the plan of Theodoric’s invasion of Italy,
                    a plan by whom originated it would be difficult to say. Whether the land when
                    conquered was to be held by the Ostrogoth in full sovereignty, or administered
                    by him as lieutenant of Zeno, is a point upon which our information is
                    ambiguous, and which was perhaps intentionally left vague by the two contracting
                    parties, whose chief anxiety was not to see one another’s faces again. The
                    details of the Ostrogothic invasion of Italy belong properly to the life of
                    Theodoric. It is sufficient to state here that he entered Italy in August 489,
                    defeated Odoacer at the Isontius (Isonzo) on the 28th of August, and at Verona
                    on the 30th of September. Odoacer then shut himself up in Ravenna, and there
                    maintained himself for four years, with one brief gleam of success, during which
                    he emerged from his hiding-place and fought the battle of the Addua (llth August
                    490), in which he was again defeated. A sally from Ravenna (10th July 491) was
                    again the occasion of a murderous defeat. At length, the famine in Ravenna
                    having become almost intolerable, and the Goths despairing of ever taking the
                    city by assault, negotiations were opened for a compromise (25th February 493).
                    John, archbishop of Ravenna, acted as mediator. It was stipulated that Ravenna
                    should be surrendered, that Odoacer’s life should be spared, and that he and
                    Theodoric should be recognized as joint rulers of the Roman state. The
                    arrangement was evidently a precarious one, and was soon terminated by the
                    treachery of Theodoric. He invited his rival to a banquet in the palace of the
                    Lauretum on the 15th of March, and there slew him with his own hand. “Where is
                    God <hi rend="italic">1</hi>” cried Odoacer when he perceived the ambush into
                    which he had fallen. “Thus didst thou deal with my kinsmen,” shouted Theodoric,
                    and clove his rival with the broadsword from shoulder to flank. Onulf, the
                    brother of the murdered king, was shot down while attempting to escape through
                    the palace garden, and Thelan, his son, was not long after put to death by order
                    of the conqueror. Thus perished the whole race of Odoacer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The chief authorities for the life of Odoacer
                    are the so-called “Anonymus Valesii,” generally printed at the end of Ammianus
                    Marcellinus; the <hi rend="italic">Life of Severinus,</hi> by Eugippius; the
                    chroniclers, Cassiodorus and “Cuspiniani Anonymus” (both in Roncalli’s
                    collection); and the Byzantine historians, Malchus and John of Antioch. A
                    fragment of the latter historian, unknown when Gibbon wrote, is to be found in
                    the fifth volume of Midler’s <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta Historicorum</hi><hi
