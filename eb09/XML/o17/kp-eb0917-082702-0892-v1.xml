                <p><label type="entry">ORESTES</label>, son of Agamemnon and Clytaemnestra.
                    According to the legend in Homer, he was absent from Mycenae when his father
                    returned from the Trojan War, and was murdered by Aegisthus. Eight years later
                    Orestes returned, and revenged his father’s death by slaying his mother and her
                    paramour. Pindar mentions that his nurse saved him and conveyed him out of the
                    country when Clytaemnestra wished to kill him. The tale is told much more fully
                    and with many variations in the tragedians. He was preserved by his sister
                    Electra, and conveyed to Phanote on Mount Parnassus, where king Strophius took
                    charge of him. In his twentieth year he was ordered by the oracle to return home
                    and revenge his father’s death. According to Aeschylus, he met his sister
                    Electra before the tomb of Agamemnon, whither both had gone to perform rites to
                    the dead; a recognition takes place, and they arrange how Orestes shall
                    accomplish his revenge. Orestes, after the deed, goes mad, and is pursued by the
                    Erinnyes, whose duty it is to punish any violation of the ties of family piety.
                    He takes refuge in the temple at Delphi; but, though Apollo had ordered him to
                    do. the deed, he is powerless to protect his suppliant from the consequences. At
                    last Athena receives him on the acropolis of Athens and arranges a formal trial
                    of the case before twelve Attic judges. The Erinnyes demand their victim; he
                    pleads the orders of Apollo; the votes of the judges are equally divided, and
                    Athena gives her casting vote for acquittal. The Erinnyes are propitiated by a
                    new ritual, in which they are worshipped as Eumenides (the Kindly), and Orestes
                    dedicates an altar to Athena Areia. Such is the account in which authorities
                    generally agree, but Euripides introduces a different series of adventures after
                    Orestes has taken refuge at Delphi. Apollo orders him to go to Tauris, carry off
                    the statue of Artemis which had fallen from heaven, and bring it to Athens. He
                    repairs to Tauris with Pylades, and the pair are at once imprisoned by the
                    people, among whom the custom is to sacrifice all strangers to Artemis. The
                    priestess of Artemis, whose duty it is to perform the sacrifice, is Iphigeneia,
                    the daughter of Agamemnon, who had been transported hither by the goddess when
                    her father was about to offer her (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Iphigeneia).</hi>
                    She offers to release Orestes if he will carry home a letter from her to Greece;
                    he refuses to go, but bids Pylades take the letter while he himself will stay
                    and be slain. After a conflict of mutual affection, Pylades at last yields, but
                    the letter brings about a recognition between brother and sister, and all three
                    escape together, carrying with them the image of Artemis.</p>
                <p>Orestes appears also as a central figure in the legends of many other places. In
                    Cappadocia he introduced the worship of Artemis Tauropolos at Comana and
                    Castabala. Near Gythium in Laconia was a stone called Zeus Cappotas; here the
                    madness left Orestes. In Trcezen there was before the temple of Artemis a stone
                    on which Orestes was purified, and a hut in front of the temple of Apollo
                    Thearius in which he stayed till the purification was accomplished. Seven stadia
                    from Megalopolis, on the left of the road to Messene, was a shrine of the
                    Maniae, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Erinnyes. Immediately beyond it was a
                    tumulus, on the summit of which was an upright stone like a finger, <hi
                        rend="italic">Δακτύλου Κίνημα,</hi> where Orestes bit off his own finger in
                    his madness. Beyond the mound was another shrine of the Erinnyes, worshipped now
                    as Eumenides in association with the Charites (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Graces).</hi> Here the Erinnyes, who had hitherto appeared black to
                    Orestes, appeared white to him, and the madness left him. Then he cut off his
                    hair as an offering at a place <hi rend="italic">'K.oυρeiov.</hi> The name of
                    the tumulus is clearly connected with the belief still frequently occurring that
                    a hand appears out of the tomb of any person who has murdered a mother or been
                    murdered by her. The tumulus itself was obviously one of those graves, which
                    were especially common in Lydia, a tumulus with a pillar on the apex; such
                    tumuli were found in Laconia, where, as Athenaeus says, they were called "the
                    graves of the Phrygians who came with Pelops.” <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0893-0828"/> In these legends it is apparent that Orestes
                    is the guilt - laden mortal who is purified from his sin by the grace of the
                    gods; his purification is a type of the merciful justice which the gods intend
                    should be shown to all persons whose crime is mitigated by extenuating
                    circumstances. These legends belong to an age when higher ideas of law and of
                    social duty were being established; the implacable blood-feud of primitive
                    society gives place to a fair trial of the culprit, and in Athens, when the
                    votes of the judges are evenly divided, mercy prevails. In the religion of
                    Delphi similar ideas underlie the ancient festival Septerion: in it Apollo
                    himself is the murderer, and his example sets forth to mankind the method of
                    purification which heaven opens to such sinners, if they are not entirely and
                    wilfully guilty. Orestes is not a figure of the Apollo religion, but is clearly
                    connected with the cultus of the Erinnyes; and his relation to these goddesses,
                    and the intention of the myth, are very plain in the Megalopolitan legend above
                    mentioned. The Troezenian legend has no appearance of being really ancient, just
                    as the tales that connect Orestes with the district Orestea in Arcadia, or
                    Orestias in Epirus, are obviously fictions of a later time. On the other hand,
                    the Orestes of Tauric and Cappadocian legend is a different person, connected
                    with the spread of Artemis-worship; it is not improbable that a similarity of
                    name caused the identification of two heroes belonging respectively to the
                    cultus of Artemis and of the Erinnyes.</p>
                <p>Orestes had an historic part assigned to him as Greek mythology became
                    systematized. Phocian auxiliaries restored him to the throne of his father, and,
                    according to Hellanicus, he began the Aeolic migration to Asia Minor. He was
                    buried on the road from Tegea to Thyrea, and Herodotus (it 67) tells a quaint
                    story of the manner in which the Spartans discovered his bones and, in obedience
                    to an oracle, carried them to Sparta.</p>
