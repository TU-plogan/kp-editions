                <p><label type="entry">ODORIC</label> (c. 1286-1331), styled of Pordenone, one of
                    the notable travellers to the farther East in the Middle Ages, and a <hi
                    rend="italic">Beatus</hi> of the Roman Church, was born at Villa Nuova, a hamlet
                    near the town of Pordenone in Friuli, in or about 1286, and, according to
                    ecclesiastical biographers, in early years took the vows of the Franciscan order
                    and joined their convent at Udine, the capital of Friuli. Under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">China</hi> (vol. v. p. 628) the remarkable opening of
                    communication, both commercial and ecclesiastical, with that country during the
                    first half of the 14th century has been spoken of. There had arisen also during
                    the latter half of the 13th century an energetic missionary action, extending
                    all over the East, on the part of both the new orders of Preaching and Minorite
                    (or Dominican and Franciscan) Friars, and houses of those orders, of the last
                    especially, became established in Persia, in what is now southern Russia, in
                    Tartary, and in China.</p>
                <p>Friar Odoric was despatched to the East about 1316-18, and did not return till
                    near 1330, but, as regards intermediate dates, all that we can deduce from his
                    narrative or other evidence is that he was in western India soon after 1321, and
                    that he spent three years in China between 1322 and 1327. His route to the East
                    lay by Constantinople and Trebizond to Erzeroum, and thence to Tabriz and
                    Sultâniya, in all of which places the order had houses. From Sultâniya he
                    proceeded by Kashân and Yezd, and turning thence followed a somewhat devious
                    route by Persepolis, Shirâz, and Baghdâd to the Persian Gulf. At Ormuz he
                    embarked for India, landing at Tana, still the chief station of the island of
                    Salsette, and which was then one of the chief ports of western India. At this
                    city four brethren of his order, three of them Italians and the fourth a
                    Georgian, had shortly before met death at the hands of the Mohammedan governor,
                    who held the place under the dominion of the sovereign of Delhi (then
                    Ghaiâs-suddin Tughlak). The bones of the martyred friars had been collected by
                    Friar Jordanus of Severae, a Dominican, who carried them to Supera—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Suppara</hi> of the ancient geographers, near the modern Bassein,
                    about 26 miles north of Bombay—and buried them there. Odoric tells that he
                    disinterred these relics and carried them with him on his farther travels. In
                    the course of these he visited Malabar, touching at Pandarâni (20 miles north of
                    Calicut), at Cranganore, and at Quilon, proceeding thence, apparently, to Ceylon
                    and to the shrine of St Thomas at Mailapur near Madras. From India he sailed in
                    a Chinese junk to Sumatra, visiting various ports on the northern coast of that
                    island, then Java, the coast (it would seem) of Borneo, Champa (South Cochin
                    China), and Canton, at that time known to western Asiatics as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chin-Kalan</hi> or Great China (Mahâchin). Thence he went on to the great ports
                    of Fuhkeen, at one of which, Zayton or Chwanchow (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chinchew,</hi> vol. v. p. 673), he found two houses of his order; in one of
                    these he deposited the bones of the brethren who had suffered in India. From
                    Fu-chau he struck across the mountains into Che-keang and visited Hang-chow,
                    then renowned under the name of <hi rend="italic">Cansay (“</hi> King-sze,” or
                    royal residence) as one of the greatest cities in the world, of the splendours
                    of which Marco Polo, Ibn Batuta, and others have given such notable details.
                    Passing northward by Nan-king and crossing the Great Kiang, Odoric embarked on
                    the Great Canal and travelled to <hi rend="smallcaps">Cambaluc</hi> or Peking,
                    where he remained for three years, attached, no doubt, to one of the churches
                    founded by Archbishop John of Monte Corvino, at this time in extreme old age.
                    Turning westward in the neighbourhood of the Great Wall and through Shensi, the
                    adventurous traveller entered Tibet, and appears to have visited Lhasa. But no
                    distinct indication of his homeward route is given, though it may be gathered
                    from fragmentary notices that he passed through Khorasan, and so probably by
                    Tabriz to Europe, reaching Venice in the end of 1329 or beginning of 1330.
                    During a part at least of these long journeys the companion of Odoric was Friar
                    James, an Irishman, as appears from a record in the public books of Udine,
                    showing that shortly after Odoric’s death a present of two marks was made to
                    this Irish friar, <hi rend="italic">Socio</hi><hi rend="italic">beati</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Odorici,</hi><hi rend="italic">amore</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dei</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Odorici.</hi> Shortly after
                    his return Odoric betook himself to the Minorite house attached to St Antony’s
                    at Padua, and it was there that in May 1330 he related the story of his travels,
                    which was taken down in homely Latin by Friar William of Solagna. Travelling
                    towards the papal court at Avignon, Odoric fell ill at Pisa, and, turning back
                    to Udine, the capital of his native province, died in the convent there, 14th
                    January 1331. The fame of his vast journeys appears to have made a much greater
                    impression on the laity of his native territory than on his Franciscan brethren.
                    The latter were about to bury him without delay or ceremony, but the “gastald”
                    or chief magistrate of the city interfered and appointed a public funeral;
                    rumours of his wondrous travels, and of posthumous miracles were diffused, and
                    excitement spread like wildfire over Friuli and Carniola; the ceremony had to be
                    deferred more than once, and at last took place in presence of the patriarch of
                    Aquileia and all the local dignitaries. The sanctity of Odoric was now fully
                    recognized, and was taken up at last by his own community, who employed an
                    eminent preacher to declaim to the people the history and pious deeds of this
                    brother, whom they probably had regarded till now only as an eccentric, who told
                    questionable stories about the Grand Cham and islands of the anthropophagi.
                    Popular acclamation made him an object of devotion, the municipality erected a
                    noble shrine for his body, his fame as saint and traveller had spread far and
                    wide before the middle of the century, but it was not till four centuries later
                    (1755) that the papal authority formally sanctioned his beatification. A bust of
                    Odoric was set up at Pordenone in 1881.</p>
                <p>The numerous MSS. of Odoric’s narrative that have come down to our time (upwards
                    of forty are known), and chiefly from the 14th century, show how speedily and
                    widely it acquired popularity. It does not deserve the charge of general
                    mendacity brought against it by some, though the language of other writers, who
                    have spoken of the traveller as a man of learning, is still more injudicious.
                    Like most of the mediaeval travellers, he is indiscriminating in accepting
                    strange tales; but, whilst some of these are the habitual stories of the age,
                    many particulars which he relates attest the genuine character of the narrative,
                    and some of those which Tiraboschi and others have condemned as mendacious
                    interpolations are the very seals of truth. Odoric’s creφt was not benefited by
                    the liberties which Sir John Mandeville took with it. The substance of that
                    knight’s alleged travels in India and Cathay is stolen in bulk from Odoric,
                    though largely amplified with fables from other sources and from his own
                    invention, and garnished with his own unusually clear astronomical notions. We
                    may indicate a few passages which stamp Odoric as a genuine and original
                    traveller. He is the first European who distinctly mentions the name of Sumatra.
                    The cannibalism and community of wives which he attributes to certain races of
                    that island do certainly belong to it, or to islands closely adjoining. His
                    description of sago in the archipelago is not free from errors, but they are the
                    errors of an eye-witness. In China his mention of Canton by the name of
                    Chin-Kalân, his description of the custom of fishing with tame cormorants, of
                    the habit of letting the finger-nails grow extravagantly, and of the compression
                    of women’s feet, as well as of the division of the empire into twelve <pb

                    peculiar to him among the travellers of that age; Marco Polo omits them all.</p>
                <p>The narrative was first printed at Pesaro in 1513, in what Apostolo Zeno calls

                    first contains it in the 2d vol. of the 2d edition (1574), in which are given
                    two versions, differing curiously from one another, but without any prefatory
                    matter or explanation. Another (Latin) version is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta Sanctorum</hi> (Bollandist) under 14th January. The curious discussion
