                    1668/9, aged 18.” Upon very doubtful authority he is stated to have been also at
                    Westminster School before going to the university. On leaving the university he
                    apparently took Anglican orders, and officiated in several parishes, Hastings
                    among them. Having brought malicious charges in which his evidence was rejected,
                    he narrowly escaped prosecution for peιjury. He next obtained a chaplaincy in
                    the navy, from which he appears to have been speedily dismissed for bad conduct
                    and with the reputation of worse. He now, it is said, applied for help to Dr
                    Tonge, rector of St Michael’s in Wood Street, an honest half-crazy man, who even
                    then was exciting people’s minds by giving out quarterly “treatises in print to
                    alarm and awake his majesty’s subjects.” Oates offered his help, and it was
                    arranged that he should pretend to be a Roman Catholic so as the better to
                    unearth the Jesuit plots which possessed Tonge’s brain (Lingard). Accordingly he
                    was received into the church by one Berry, himself an apostate, and entered the
                    Jesuit College of Valladolid as Brother Ambrose. Hence he was soon expelled. In
                    October 1677 he made a second application, and was admitted to St Omer on 10th
                    December. So scandalous, however, was his conduct that he was finally dismissed
                    in 1678. Returning in June 1678 to Tonge, he set himself to forge a plot by
                    piecing together things true and false, or true facts falsely interpreted, and
                    by inventing treasonable letters and accounts of preparations for military
                    action. The whole story was written by Oates in Greek characters, copied into
                    English by Tonge, and finally told to one of Charles II.’s confidential servants
                    named Kirkby (Lingard). Kirkby having given the king his information, Oates was
                    sent for (13th August), and in a private interview gave details, in forty-three
                    articles, of the plot and the persons who had engaged to assassinate Charles.
                    The general improbability of the story was so manifest, and the discrepancies
                    were so glaring, that neither then nor at any subsequent time did Charles
                    express anything but amused incredulity. To bolster up the case a fresh packet
                    of five forged letters was concocted (31st August); but the forgery was
                    transparent, and even Sir William Jones, the attorney-general, though a violent
                    upholder of the plot, dared not produce them as evidence.</p>
                <p>Oates now (6th September) made an affidavit before Sir Edmondbury Godfrey to an
                    improved edition of his story, in eighty-one articles. Among the persons named
                    was Coleman, secretary to the duchess of York, whom Godfrey knew, and to whom he
                    sent word of the charges. Coleman in turn informed the duke, and he, since the
                    immediate exposure of the plot was of the utmost consequence to him, induced
                    Charles to compel Oates to appear (28th September) before the privy council.
                    Here Oates delivered himself of a story the falsehood of which was so obvious
                    that the king was able to expose him by a few simple questions. At this moment
                    an accident most fortunate for Oates took place. Amongst the papers seized at
                    his request were Coleman’s, and in them were found copies of letters written by
                    the latter to Père la Chaise, suggesting that Louis should furnish him with
                    money, which he would use in the French and Catholic interest among members of
                    parliament. Among them, too, were these passages: “Success will give the
                    greatest blow to the Protestant religion that it has received since its birth”;
                    “we have here a mighty work upon our hands, no less than the conversion of three
                    kingdoms, and by that perhaps the utter subduing of a pestilent heresy, which
                    has so long domineered over great part of the northern world.” The credit of
                    Oates was thus, in the eyes of the people, re-established, and Coleman and
                    others named were imprisoned. Charles was anxious for his brother’s sake to
                    bring the matter to a conclusion, but he dared not appear to stifle the plot;
                    so, when starting for Newmarket, he left orders with Danby that he should finish
                    the investigation at once. But Danby purposely delayed; an impeachment was
                    hanging over his head, and anything which took men’s minds off that was welcome.
                    Possibly, too, he was sincerely desirous of frustrating Charles’s Catholic
                    sympathies and secret dealings with France. Shaftesbury, with very different
                    views, was eager in his patronage of the plot and its founder.</p>
                <p>On 12th October occurred the murder of Godfrey, and the excitement was at its
                    highest pitch. That Oates could ever have induced any one to believe in his
                    tales is incredible to one who does not recollect the victories of Catholic
                    France, the relaxing of the penal laws, the activity of the Jesuits, the fear of
                    a standing army and of James, the agitation of the opposition led by
                    Shaftesbury, and the ignorance and apprehension of the designs of the court. On
                    21st October parliament met, and, though Charles in his speech had barely
                    alluded to the plot, all other business was put aside and Oates was called
                    before the House. Here he gave details of a pretended apportioning by Oliva, the
                    general of the Jesuit order, of all the chief posts to leading Roman Catholics
                    in the country. The proceedings which followed are best read in the
                    parliamentary history. A new witness was wanted to support Oates’s story, and in
                    November Bedloe came forward. At first he remembered little; by degrees he
                    remembered everything that was wanted. Not even so, however, did their witness
                    agree together, so, as a bold stroke, Oates, with great circumstantiality,
                    accused the queen before Charles of high treason. Charles both disbelieved and
                    exposed him, whereupon Oates carried his tale before the House of Commons. The
                    Commons voted for the queen’s removal from court, but, the Lords refusing to
                    concur, the matter dropped. It was not, however, until 18th July 1679 that the
                    slaughter of Jesuits and other Roman Catholics upon Oates’s testimony and that
                    of his accomplices was to some extent checked. Sir George Wakeman, the queen’s
                    physician, was accused of purposing to poison the king, and the queen was named
                    as being concerned in the plot. The refusals of Charles to credit or to
                    countenance the attacks on his wife are the most creditable episodes in his
                    life. Scroggs had intimation that he was to be lenient. Sir Philip Lloyd proved
                    Oates to have perjured himself in open court, and Wakeman was acquitted. On 26th
                    June 1680, upon Oates’s testimony, the duke of York was presented as a recusant
                    at Westminster, and in November the informer gave evidence in the trial of
                    Strafford. But the panic had now worn itself out, and the importance .of Oates
                    rapidly declined; so much so that after the dissolution in 1682 he was no more
                    heard of during Charles’s reign, but enjoyed his pension of &lt;£600 or
                    &lt;£900, it is uncertain which, in quiet. Shortly before the death of Charles,
                    James brought, and won, a civil action against Oates, with damages of £100,000;
                    in default of payment Oates was taken to prison; while there he was indicted for
                    perjury, and was tried in May 1685, soon after the accession of James II. He was
                    convicted, and received an awful sentence, the execution of which was expected
                    to kill him, and which was rigorously carried out; but to the astonishment of
                    all he survived.</p>
                <p>Oates was in prison for three and a half years. Upon <pb break="no"

                    against the Catholics, he partially gained his liberty, and brought an appeal
                    against his sentence before the Lords, who, while admitting the sentence to bè
                    unjust, confirmed it by a majority of thirty-five to twenty-three. The Commons,
                    however, passed a bill annulling the sentence; and a conference was held in
                    which the Lords, while again acknowledging that legally they were wrong, adhered
                    to their former determination. The matter was finally settled by Oates receiving
                    a royal pardon, with a salary of £300 a year. In November 1689 he was again seen
                    in Westminster Hall, when Peterborough, Salisbury, and others were impeached. In
                    1690, finding that there was no hope of preferment in the English Church, he
                    became a Baptist, but in less than a year was ejected from their body. In 1691
                    he became acquainted with William Fuller, whom he induced to forge another plot,
                    though not with the success he had himself attained. He appears to have lived
                    after this chiefly in retirement, though we read in Evelyn that in 1696 he
                    dedicated to William a book against James. He died 13th July 1705.</p>
