                    medical classes in the university of Würzburg, whence he proceeded to that of
                    Göttingen, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0809-0750"/> where he became a privat-docent, and abridged his
                    name to Oken. As Lorenz Oken he published in 1802 his small work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundriss der Naturphilosophie, der Theorie der Sinne, und der
                    darauf gegründeten Classification der Thiere,</hi> the first of the series of
                    works which placed him at the head of the “natur-philosophie” or
                    physio-philosophical school of Germany. In it he extended to physical science
                    the philosophical principles which Kant had applied to mental and moral science.
                    Oken had, however, in this application been preceded by Fichte, who,
                    acknowledging that the materials for a universal science had been discovered by
                    Kant, declared that nothing more was needed than a systematic co-ordination of
                    these materials; and this task Fichte undertook in his famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctrine of Science</hi> (Wissenschaftslehre), the aim of which was to
                    construct <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> all knowledge. In this attempt,
                    however, Fichte did little more than indicate the path; it was reserved for
                    Schelling fairly to enter upon it, and for Oken, following him, to explore its
                    mazes yet farther, and to produce a systematic plan of the country so
                    surveyed.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der Naturphilosophie</hi> of 1802 Oken
                    sketched the outlines of the scheme he afterwards devoted himself to perfect.
                    The position he advanced in that remarkable work, and to which he ever after
                    professed adherence, is this,—“that the animal classes are virtually nothing
                    else than a representation of the sense-organs, and that they must be arranged
                    in accordance with them.” Agreeably with this idea, Oken contends that there are
                    only five animal classes (1) the <hi rend="italic">Dermatozoa,</hi> or
                    Invertebrates; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Glossozoa,</hi> or Fishes, as being
                    those animals in which aTτue tongue makes, for the first time, its appearance;
                    (3) the <hi rend="italic">Rhinozoa,</hi> or Reptiles, wherein the nose opens for
                    the first time into the mouth and inhales air; (4) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otozoa,</hi> or Birds, in which the ear for the first time opens externally;
                    and (5) the <hi rend="italic">Ophthalmozoa,</hi> or Mammals, in which all the
                    organs of sense are present and complete, the eyes being movable and covered
                    with two lids.</p>
                <p>In 1805 Oken made another characteristic advance in the application of the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> principle, by a book on generation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeugung,</hi> Frankfort), wherein he maintained the
                    proposition that “all organic beings originate from and consist of <hi
                    rend="italic">vesicles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cells.</hi> These vesicles,
                    when singly detached and regarded in their original process of production, are
                    the infusorial mass or protoplasma <hi rend="italic">(ur-schleim)</hi> whence
                    all larger organisms fashion themselves or are evolved. Their production is
                    therefore nothing else than a regular agglomeration of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Infusoria,—</hi> not, of course, of species already elaborated or perfect, but
                    of mucous vesicles or points in general, which first form themselves by their
                    union or combination into particular species.” This doctrine is strikingly
                    analogous to the generalized results of the ablest microscopical observations on
                    the development of animal and vegetable tissues which have been prosecuted of
                    late years.</p>
                <p>One year after the production of this remarkable treatise, Oken advanced another
                    step in the development of his system, and in a volume published in 1806, in
                    which Kieser assisted him, entitled <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur
                    vergleichenden Zoologie, Anatomie, und Physiologie,</hi> he demonstrated that
                    the intestines originate from the umbilical vesicle, and that this corresponds
                    to the vitellus or yolk-bag. Caspar Friedrich Wolff had previously proved this
                    fact in the chick <hi rend="italic">(Theoria Generationis,</hi> 1774), but he
                    did not see its application as evidence of a general law. Oken showed the
                    importance of the discovery as an illustration of his system. In the same work
                    Oken described and recalled attention to the <hi rend="italic">corpora
                    Wolffi,ana,</hi> or “primordial kidneys,” as they are now termed and
                    recognized.</p>
                <p>The reputation of the young privat-docent of Göttingen had meanwhile reached the
                    ear of Goethe, and in 1807 Oken was invited to fill the office of professor
                    extraordinarius of the medical sciences in the university of Jena. He accepted
                    the call, and selected for the subject of his inaugural discourse his ideas on
                    the “Signification of the Bones of the Skull,” based upon a discovery he had
                    made in the previous year. This famous lecture was delivered in the presence of
                    Goethe, as privy-councillor and rector of the university, and was published in
                    the same year, with the title, <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bedeutung der Schädelknochen.</hi></p>
                <p>With regard to the origin of the idea, Oken narrates in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isis</hi> that, walking one autumn day in 1806 in the Harz forest, he stumbled
                    upon the blanched skull of a deer, picked up the partially dislocated bones, and
                    contemplated them for a while, when the truth flashed across his mind, and he
                    exclaimed, “It is a vertebral column !” At a meeting of the German naturalists
                    held at Jena some years afterwards Professor Kieser gave an account of Oken’s
                    discovery in the presence of the grand-duke, which account is printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tageblatt,</hi> or “proceedings,” of that meeting. The professor
                    states that Oken communicated to him his discovery when journeying in 1806 to
                    the island of Wangeroog. On their return to Göttingen Oken explained his ideas
                    by reference to the skull of a turtle in Kieser’s collection, which he
                    disarticulated for that purpose with his own hands. “It is with the greatest
                    pleasure,” writes Kieser, “that I am able to show here the same skull, after
                    having it thirty years in my collection. The single bones of the skull are
                    marked by Oken’s own handwriting, which may be so easily known.” There was a
                    cause, as we shall presently see, for this circumstantial testimony.</p>
                <p>Oken, having delivered and printed his introductory lecture in 1807, informs us
                    <hi rend="italic">(Isis,</hi> No. 7) that he presented copies to Goethe and to
                    other members of the grand-duke’s Government. “Goethe was so pleased with my
                    discovery as to invite me to stay with him during the Easter week of 1808 in his
                    house at Weimar, which invitation I accepted.”</p>
                <p>The range of Oken’s lectures at Jena was a wide one, and they were highly
                    esteemed. They embraced the subjects of natural philosophy, general natural
                    history, zoology, comparative anatomy, the physiology of man, of animals, and of
                    plants. The spirit with which he grappled with the vast scope of science is
                    characteristically illustrated in his essay <hi rend="italic">Heber das
                    Universum als Fortsetzung des Sinnensystems,</hi> 1808. In this work he lays it
                    down that “organism is none other than a combination of all the universe’s
                    activities within a single individual body.” This doctrine led him to the
                    conviction that “world and organism are one in kind, and do not stand merely in
                    harmony with each other.”</p>
                <p>In the same year he published his <hi rend="italic">Erste</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ideen zur Theorie des Lichts,</hi> &amp;c., in which he advanced the
                    proposition that “light could be nothing but a polar tension of the ether,
                    evoked by a central body in antagonism with the planets, and heat was none other
                    than a motion of this ether,”—a sort of vague anticipation of the doctrine of
                    the “correlation of physical forces.”</p>
                <p>In 1809 Oken extended his system to the mineral world, arranging the ores, not
                    according to the metals, but agreeably to their combinations with oxygen, acids,
                    and sulphur. In 1810 he summed up his views on organic and inorganic natures
                    into one compendious system. The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch
                    der Naturphilosophie</hi> appeared in that and the following years, in which he
                    sought to bring his different doctrines into mutual connexion, and to “show that
                    the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms are not to be arranged arbitrarily
                    in accordance with single and isolated characters, but to be based upon tfie
                    cardinal organs or anatomical systems, from which a firπβy established number of
                    classes would necessarily be evol⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ed; that each
                    class, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0810-0751"/> moreover, takes its starting-point from below,
                    and consequently that all of them pass parallel to each other ·” and that, “as
                    in chemistry, where the combinations follow a definite numerical law, so also in
                    anatomy the organs, in physiology the functions, and in natural history the
                    classes, families, and even genera of minerals, plants, and animals present a
                    similar arithmetical ratio.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch</hi> procured for Oken the title of Hofrath, or
                    court-councillor. In 1812 he was appointed ordinary professor of the natural
                    sciences.</p>
                <p>In 1816 he commenced the publication of his well-known periodical, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Isis, eine encyclopädische Zeitschrift, vorzüglich für
                    Naturgeschichte, vergleichende Anatomie, und Physiologie.</hi> In this journal
                    appeared essays and notices not only on the natural sciences but on other
                    subjects of interest; poetry, and even comments on the politics of other German
                    states, were occasionally admitted. This led to representations and
                    remonstrances from the Governments criticized or impugned, and the court of
                    Weimar called upon Oken either to suppress the <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> or
                    resign his professorship. He chose the latter alternative. The publication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> at Weimar was prohibited. Oken made arrangements
                    for its issue at Rudolstadt, and this continued uninterruptedly until the year
                    1848.</p>
                <p>The independent spirit manifested by Oken excited his courtly enemies to harsher
                    measures. An accusation was preferred against him as a member of a forbidden
                    “secret democratic society”; he stood his trial and was acquitted. He thereupon
                    retired for a while into private life, occupying himself with the editorship of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> and with a series of natural-history manuals in
                    which he considered that he had arranged for the first time the genera and
                    species in accordance with the only true or physio-philosophical principles,
                    stating briefly everything of vital importance respecting them, and maintaining
                    that it was the first attempt to frame a truly scientific history of nature.</p>
                <p>In 1821 Oken promulgated in his <hi rend="italic">Isis</hi> the first idea of the
                    annual general meetings of the German naturalists and medical practitioners,
                    which happy idea was realized in the following year, when the first meeting was
                    held at Leipsic. They have been continued ever since in Germany; and similar
                    annual scientific gatherings have been originated in other countries. The
                    British Association for the Advancement of Science was at the outset avowedly
                    organized after the German or Okenian model.</p>
                <p>In 1828 Oken resumed his original humble duties as privat - docent in the newly -
                    established university of Munich, and soon afterwards he was appointed ordinary
                    professor in the same university. In 1832, on the proposal by the Bavarian
                    Government to transfer him to a professorship in a provincial university of the
                    state, he resigned his appointments and left the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Switzerland has the honour of affording the final place of refuge, with means of
                    an independent pursuit of science, to this philosophic and patriotic naturalist.
                    Oken was appointed in 1833 to the professorship of natural history in the then
                    recently-established university of Zurich. There he continued to reside,
                    fulfilling his professional duties and promoting the progress of his favourite
                    sciences, until his death in the seventy-second year of his age (llth August
                    1851).</p>
                <p>All Oken’s writings are eminently deductive illustrations of a foregone and
                    assumed principle, which, with other philosophers of the transcendental school,
                    he deemed equal to the explanation of all the mysteries of nature. According to
                    him, the head was a repetition of the trunk—a kind of second trunk, with its
                    limbs and other appendages; this sum of his observations and comparisons —few of
                    which he ever gave in detail—ought always to be borne in mind in comparing the
                    share taken by Oken in homological anatomy with the progress made by other
                    cultivators of that philosophical branch of the science.</p>
                <p>The idea of the analogy between the skull, or parts of the skull, and the
                    vertebral column had been previously propounded and ventilated in their lectures
                    by Autenreith and Kielmeyer, and in the writings of J. P. Frank. By Oken it was
                    applied chiefly in illustration of the mystical system of Schelling—the
                    “all-in-all” and “all-in-every-part.” From the earliest to the latest of Oken’s
                    writings on the subject, “the head is a repetition of the whole trunk with all
                    its systems: the brain is the spinal cord; the cranium is the vertebral column;
                    the mouth is intestine and abdomen; the nose is the lungs and thorax; the jaws
                    are the limbs; and the teeth the claws or nails.” Spix, in his folio <hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalogcnesis</hi> (1818), richly illustrated comparative
                    craniology, but presented the facts under the same transcendental guise; and
                    Cuvier ably availed himself of the extravagances of these disciples of Schelling
                    to cast ridicule on the whole inquiry into those higher relations of parts to
                    the archetype which Professor Owen has called “general homologies.”</p>
                <p>The vertebral theory of the skull had practically disappeared from anatomical
                    science when the labours of Cuvier drew to their close. In Owen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton</hi> the idea
                    was not only revived but worked out for the first time inductively, and the
                    theory rightly stated, as follows :—“The head is not a virtual equivalent of the
                    trunk, but is only a portion, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> certain modified
                    segments, of the whole body. The jaws are the ’ haemal arches ’ of the first two
                    segments; they are not limbs of the head” (p. 176).</p>
                <p>Vaguely and strangely, however, as Oken had blended the idea with his <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> conception of the nature of the head, the chance of
                    appropriating it seems to have overcome the moral sense of Goethe,—unless indeed
                    the poet deceived himself. Comparative osteology had early attracted Goethe’s
                    attention. In 1786 he published at Jena his essay <hi rend="italic">lieber den
                    Zwischenkieferknochen</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Menschen
                    und der</hi><hi rend="italic">Thiere,</hi> showing that the intermaxillary bone
                    existed in man as well as in brutes. But not a word in this essay gives the
                    remotest hint of his having then possessed the idea of the vertebral analogies
                    of the skull. In 1820, in his <hi rend="italic">Morphologie,</hi> he first
                    publicly stated that thirty years before the date of that publication he had
                    discovered the secret relationship between the vertebrae and the bones of the
                    head, and that he had always continued to meditate on this subject. The
                    circumstances under which the poet, in 1820, narrates having become inspired
                    with the original idea are suspiciously analogous to those described by Oken in
                    1807, as producing the same effect on his mind. A bleached skull is accidentally
                    discovered in both instances: in Oken’s it was that of a deer in the Harz
                    forest; in Goethe’s it was that of a sheep picked up on the shores of the Lido,
                    at Venice.</p>
                <p>It may be assumed that Oken, when a privat-docent at Göttingen in 1806, knew
                    nothing of this unpublished idea or discovery of Goethe, and that Goethe first
                    became aware that Oken had the idea of the vertebral relations of the skull when
                    he listened to the introductory discourse in which the young professor, invited
                    by the poet to Jena, selected this very idea for its subject. It is incredible
                    that Oken, had he adopted the idea from Goethe, or been aware of an anticipation
                    by him, should have omitted to acknowledge the source—should not rather have
                    eagerly embraced so appropriate an opportunity of doing graceful homage to the
                    originality and genius of his patron.</p>
                <p>The anatomist having lectured for an hour plainly unconscious of any such
                    anticipation, it seems hardly less incredible that the poet should not have
                    mentioned to the young lecturer his previous conception of the vertebro-cranial
                    theory, and the singular coincidence of the accidental circumstance which he
                    subsequently alleged to have produced that discovery. On the contrary, Goethe
                    permits Oken to publish his famous lecture, with the same unconsciousness of any
                    anticipation as when he delivered it; and Oken, in the same state of belief,
                    transmits a copy to Goethe, who thereupon honours the professor with special
                    marks of attention and an invitation to his house. No hint of any claim of the
                    host is given to the guest; no word of reclamation in any shape appears for some
                    years. In Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Tages-und Jahres-Hefte,</hi> he refers to
                    two friends, Reimer and Voigt, as being cognizant in 1807 of his theory. Why did
                    not one or other of these make known to Oken that he had been so anticipated? “I
                    told my friends to keep quiet,” writes Goethe in 1825! Spix, in the meanwhile,
                    in 1815, contributes his share to the development of Oken’s idea in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalogcnesis.</hi> Ulrich follows in 1816 with his <hi
                    rend="italic">Schildkrötenschädel</hi>; next appears the contribution, in 1818,
                    by Bojanus, to the vertebral theory of the skull, amplified in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Paragon</hi> to that anatomist’s admirable <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatome</hi><hi rend="italic">Testudinis</hi><hi rend="italic">Europaeae</hi>
                    (1821). And now for the first time, in 1818, Bojanus, visiting some friends at
                    Weimar, there hears the rumour that his friend Oken had been anticipated by the
                    great poet. He communicates it to Oken, who, like an honest man, at once
                    published the statement made by Goethe’s friends in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isis</hi> of that year, offering no reflexion on the poet, but restricting
                    himself to a detailed and interesting account of the circumstances under which
                    he himself had been led independently to make his discovery, when wandering in
                    1806 through the Harz. It was enough for him thus to vindicate his own claims;
                    he abstains from any comment reflecting on Goethe, and maintained the same
                    blameless<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n811/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0811-0752"/> silence when Goethe ventured for the first time
                    to claim for himself, in 1820, the merit of having entertained the same idea, or
                    made the discovery, thirty years previously.</p>
                <p>The German naturalists held their annual meeting at Jena in 1836, and there
                    Kieser publicly bore testimony, from personal knowledge, to the circumstances
                    and dates of Oken’s discovery. However, in the edition of Hegel’s works by
                    Michelet, Berlin, 1842, there appeared the following paragraph :—“The type-bone
                    is the dorsal vertebra, provided inwards with a hole and outwards with
                    processes, every bone being only a modification of it. This idea originated with
                    Goethe, who worked it out in a treatise written in 1785, and published it in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Morphologie,</hi> 1820, p. 162. <hi rend="italic">Oken, to
                    whom the treatise was communicated., has pretended, that the idea was his own
                    property, and has reaped the honour of it."</hi> This accusation again called
                    out Oken, who thoroughly refuted it in an able, circumstantial, and temperate
                    statement, in part vit of the <hi rend="italic">Isis,</hi> 1847. Goethe’s
                    osteological essay of 1785, the only one he printed in that century, is on a
                    different subject. In the <hi rend="italic">Morphologie</hi> of 1820-24 Goethe
                    distinctly declares that he had never published his ideas on the vertebral
                    theory of the skull. He could not, therefore, have sent any such essay to Oken
                    before the year 1807. Oken, in reference to his previous endurance of Goethe’s
                    pretensions, states that, “being well aware that his fellow-labourers in natural
                    science thoroughly appreciated the true state of the case, he confided in quiet
                    silence in their judgment. Meckel, Spix, Ulrich, Bojanus, Carus, Cuvier,
                    Geoffroy St Hilaire, Albers, Straus - Durckheim, Owen, Kieser, and Lichtenstein
                    had recorded their judgment in his favour and against Goethe. But upon the
                    appearance of the new assault in Michelet’s edition of Hegel he could no longer
                    remain silent.”</p>
                <p>Oken’s bold axiom that heat is but a mode of motion of light, and the idea
                    broached in his essay on generation (1805) that “all the parts of higher animals
                    are made up of an aggregate of <hi rend="italic">Infusoria</hi> or animated
                    globular monads,” are both of the same order as his proposition of the head
                    being a repetition of the trunk, with its vertebra and limbs. Science would have
                    profited no more from the one idea without the subsequent experimental
                    discoveries of Oersted and Faraday, or from the other without the microscopical
                    observations of Brown, Schleiden, and Schwann, than from the third notion
                    without the inductive demonstration of the segmental constitution of the skull
                    by Owen. It is questionable, indeed, whether in either case the discoverers of
                    the true theories were excited to their labours, or in any way influenced, by
                    the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> guesses of Oken; more probable is it that
                    the requisite researches and genuine deductions therefrom were the results of
                    the correlated fitness of the stage of the science and the gifts of its true
                    cultivators at such particular stage.</p>
                <p>Oken’s real claims to the support and gratitude of naturalists rest on his
                    appreciation of the true relations of natural history to intellectual progress,
                    of its superior teachings to the mere utilitarian applications of observed
                    facts, of its intrinsic dignity as a science.</p>
