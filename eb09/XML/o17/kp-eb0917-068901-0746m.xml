                <p><label type="entry">O</label> The history of the symbol O is parallel to that of
                    E. Each represents several sounds which are distinguished habitually in speech
                    without any difficulty, but for which, owing to the imperfection of the English
                    alphabet, there are no separate symbols. Probably the confusion is worst in
                    English; but French and Italian also have more sounds for each of these symbols
                    than can be properly included under them, and so they distinguish these
                    sometimes by diacritical marks, as <hi rend="italic">ô</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ô,</hi> and sometimes they do not distinguish at all.</p>
                <p>The different sounds which O is used to denote in English lie, with one
                    exception, on the line between the pure <hi rend="italic">a-</hi> sound and the
                    pure <hi rend="italic">u-</hi> sound. We have already seen that <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> denotes several different sounds on the other line—that
                    between pure α and pure <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The difference between the
                    sounds on these two lines is this. In the <hi rend="italic">a—i</hi> line only
                    the tongue is employed; it is raised more and more for each successive sound.
                    But in the <hi rend="italic">a—u</hi> line the tongue is not the only agent; the
                    cavity of the mouth is also contracted, so that the passage is narrowed, and the
                    lip-aperture is lessened more and more for each sound; in technical phrase the
                    lips are “rounded,” so that for <hi rend="italic">u</hi> the aperture is the
                    smallest possible to allow of the utterance of a true vowel, hence the great
                    ease with which the Ή-sound passes into a w, in which there is friction caused
                    by the still greater closing of the lips, and therefore we have a consonant not
                    a vowel sound.</p>
                <p>The following different sounds—denoted by 0 in English—are readily discriminated.
                    Beginning from the «-end of the line, we come first to the sounds heard in “not”
                    and in “lord”; for both of these the back of the tongue is much depressed and
                    the lips are only slightly rounded. The difference between the two sounds
                    consists in this—for the first the back of the tongue is more convex than for
                    the second; the passage is therefore somewhat narrowed, and the two
                    corresponding sounds are therefore (here and in all the other similar pairs)
                    known technically as “narrow’’and “wide,” or as “open’’and “close.” The narrow
                    sound is written by <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in English when <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I</hi> follows, and the wide is written <hi
                    rend="italic">aw</hi> as in “law,” or <hi rend="italic">au</hi> as in “Paul,” or
                    even <hi rend="italic">a</hi> as in “pall.” The next pair may be exemplified by
                    “pole” and “pour,” narrow and wide respectively; for these the tongue is higher
                    and the rounding greater. Here again several digraphs represent the same sound,
                    as in “foal,” “soul,” “hoe,” “grow.” Next the doubled <hi rend="italic">o</hi>
                    is generally used to represent the last sound in the scale, the close <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> for which the tongue is highest and the “rounding”
                    greatest, as in “pool”; but in “rule” and others the same symbol is used for
                    this sound as would be used in other Europeah languages. Lastly—the exception
                    mentioned above— <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is one of the symbols employed to
                    denote the neutral vowel, as in “son,” as well as <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in
                    “sun” and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in “final.”</p>
                <p>The modified German <hi rend="italic">o—</hi> written <hi rend="italic">ö</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or oe—</hi> is a sound unknown in English. It is produced by
                    putting the tongue into the position for the sound denoted by <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> in “fate” or <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in “fête ”—a middle sound in the
                    line between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i—</hi> and then by
                    rounding the lips. It thus combines the specialities of the two scales of
                    vowelsound— the <hi rend="italic">i-</hi> scale and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ή</hi>-scale.</p>
                <p>In Italian there are an “open” <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (marked o) and a “close”
                    o (marked <hi rend="italic">o).</hi> The “open” o corresponds to the open or
                    wide sound described above. The “close ”o is not quite the same as the “narrow”
                    o of English, but comes a little nearer to <hi rend="italic">u.</hi></p>
                <p>In the form of the symbol there is no recorded variation, except that in old
                    Latin it was sometimes square, as O. In Greek two symbols were employed—O and
                    Ω—for short and long o respectively. But it is not improbable that the second of
                    these denoted at first not merely long <hi rend="italic">o</hi> but a more open
                    sound, more near to the sound of “law” in English.</p>
