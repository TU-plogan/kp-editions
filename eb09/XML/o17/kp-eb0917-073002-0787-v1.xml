                        Gottlob</hi></label> (1779-1850), the greatest of modern Danish poets, was
                    born in Vesterbro, a suburb of Copenhagen, on the 14th of November 1779. His
                    father, a Schleswiger by birth, was at that time organist to, and later on
                    became keeper of, the royal palace of Frederiksberg; he was a very brisk and
                    cheerful man. The poet’s mother, on the other hand, who was partly German by
                    extraction, suffered from depressed spirits, which afterwards deepened into
                    melancholy madness. Adam and his sister Sofia were allowed their own way
                    throughout their childhood, and were taught nothing, except to read and write,
                    until their twelfth year. At the age of nine Adam began to make fluent verses.
                    Three years later, while walking in Frederiksberg Gardens, he attracted the
                    notice of the poet Edvard Storm, and the result of the conversation was that he
                    received a nomination to the college called “Posterity’s High School,” an
                    important institution of which Storm was the principal. Storm himself taught the
                    class of Scandinavian mythology, and thus Oehlenschläger received his earliest
                    bias towards the poetical religion of his ancestors. Most other branches of
                    study the boy continued to neglect, and thought most about the romances and
                    dramas which he proposed to write. He was confirmed in 1795, and was to have
                    been apprenticed to a tradesman in Copenhagen. To his great delight there was a
                    hitch in the preliminaries, and he returned to his father’s house. He now, in
                    his eighteenth year, suddenly took up study with great zeal, but soon again
                    abandoned his books for the stage, where a small position was offered him. In
                    1797 he actually made his appearance on the boards in several successive parts,
                    but soon discovered that he possessed no real histrionic talent, even though he
                    was trained by the great actor Michael Rosing. The brothers Oersted, the eminent
                    savants, with whom he had formed an intimacy fruitful of profit to him,
                    persuaded him to quit the stage, and in 1800 he entered the university of
                    Copenhagen as a student. He was doomed, however, to disturbance in his studies,
                    first from the death of his mother, next from his inveterate tendency towards
                    poetry, and finally from the attack of the English upon Copenhagen in April
                    1801, which, however, inspired a dramatic sketch which is the first thing of the
                    kind by Oehlenschläger that we possess. His promise was already widely felt,
                    and, even in 1800, Baggesen, in departing for Germany, had publicly invested the
                    youth with the laurel that he himself was resigning. It was in the summer of
                    1802, when Oehlenschläger had an old Scandinavian romance, as well as a volume
                    of lyrics, in the press, that the young Norse philosopher, Henrik Steffens, came
                    back to Copenhagen after a long vi∣it to Schelling in Germany full of new
                    romantic ideas. · His lectures at the university, in which Goethe and Schiller
                    were for the first time revealed to the Danish public, created a great
                    sensation. Steffens and Oehlenschläger met one day at Dreier’s Club, and after a
                    conversation of sixteen hours, which has become famous in the history of
                    anecdote, the latter went home, suppressed his two coming volumes, and wrote at
                    a sitting his splendid poem <hi rend="italic">Guldhomene,</hi> in a manner
                    totally new to Danish literature. The result of his new enthusiasm speedily
                    showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems, published in 1803, now
                    chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sanct-Hansaften-Spil.</hi> The next two years saw the production of several
                    exquisite works, in particular <hi rend="italic">Thors</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Reise</hi><hi rend="italic">til Jotunheim,</hi> the charming poem in
                    hexameters called <hi rend="italic">Langelandsreisen,</hi> and the bewitching
                    piece of fantasy <hi rend="italic">Aladdin’s Lampe.</hi> At the age of
                    twenty-six Oehlenschläger was now universally recognized, even by the opponents
                    of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of Denmark. He found no difficulty
                    in obtaining <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0788-0731"/> a grant for foreign travel from the
                    Government, and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens
                    at Halle in August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Hakon Jarl,</hi> which he sent off to Copenhagen,
                    and then proceeded for the winter months to Berlin, where he associated with
                    Humboldt, Fichte, and the leading men of the day. In the spring of 1806 he went
                    on to Weimar, where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe.
                    The autumn of the same year he spent with Tieck in Dresden, and proceeded in
                    December to Paris. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous
                    masterpieces, <hi rend="italic">Baldur hin</hi><hi rend="italic">Gode,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Palnatoke</hi> (1807), and <hi rend="italic">Axel og
                        Valborg</hi> (1808). In July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and
                    winter in Switzerland as the guest of Madame de Staël-Holstein at Coppet, in the
                    midst of her famous circle of wits. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschläger went to
                    Rome to visit Thorwaldsen, and in his house wrote his tragedy of <hi
                        rend="italic">Correggio,</hi> in German; he translated this into Danish the
                    following year. After an absence of nearly five years he hurriedly returned to
                    Denmark in the spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of aesthetics at the
                    university of Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in -law of Rahbek, to whom
                    he had been long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish
                    predecessor Evald, the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary
                    activity became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of <hi
                        rend="italic">AU og Gulhyndi,</hi> and in 1812 the last of his great
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Staerkodder.</hi> From 1814 to 1819 he, or rather
                    his admirers, were engaged in a long and angry controversy with Baggesen, who
                    represented the old didactic school. This contest seems to have disturbed the
                    peace of Oehlenschläger’s mind, and to have undermined his genius. His talent
                    may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called
                        <hi rend="italic">Helge,</hi> published in 1814. The tragedy of <hi
                        rend="italic">Hagbarth og Signe,</hi> 1815, showed a distinct falling-off in
                    style. In 1817 he went back to Paris, and published <hi rend="italic">Hroars
                        Saga</hi> and the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Fostbrödrene.</hi> In 1818 he
                    was again in Copenhagen, and wrote the idyll of <hi rend="italic">Den lille
                        Hyrdedreng</hi> and the Eddaic cycle called <hi rend="italic">Nordens
                        Guder.</hi> His next productions were the tragedies of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Erik og Abel</hi> (1820) and <hi rend="italic">Vaeringeme</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">i Miklagaard</hi> (1826), and the epic of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hrolf</hi><hi rend="italic">Krake</hi> (1829). It was in the last-mentioned
                    year that, being in Sweden, Oehlenschläger was publicly crowned with laurel in
                    front of the high altar in Lund cathedral by Bishop Esaias Tegnér, as the
                    “Scandinavian King of Song.” His last volumes were <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tordenskjold</hi> (1833), <hi rend="italic">Dronning Margrethe</hi> (1833),
                        <hi rend="italic">Sokrates</hi> (1835), <hi rend="italic">Olaf den
                        Heilige</hi> (1836), <hi rend="italic">Knud den Store</hi> (1838), <hi
                        rend="italic">Dina</hi> (1842), <hi rend="italic">Erik Clipping</hi> (1843),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Kiartan og Gudrun</hi> (1847), none of which, with the
                    exception, perhaps, of <hi rend="italic">Dina,</hi> can in any way be said to be
                    worthy of his early reputation. On his seventieth birthday, 14th November 1849,
                    a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king
                    of Denmark under circumstances of great pomp. Just two months later, on the 20th
                    of January 1850, he sank, conscious to the last, and was buried in the cemetery
                    of Frederiksberg.</p>
                <p>With the exception of Holberg, there has been no Danish writer who has exercised
                    so wide an influence as Oehlenschläger. His great work was to awaken in the
                    breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their
                    ancestors, and this he performed to so complete an extent that his name remains
                    to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance. He supplied his countrymen
                    with romantic tragedies at the very moment when all eyes were turned to the
                    stage, and when the old-fashioned pieces were felt to be inadequate. His plays,
                    partly, no doubt, in consequence of his own early familiarity with acting,
                    fulfilled the stage-requirements of the day, and were popular beyond all
                    expectation. Several of them still keep the stage in spite of their rhetoric.
                    The earliest are the best,—Oehlenschläger’s dramatic masterpiece being, without
                    doubt, his first tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Hakon Jarl.</hi> In his poems and
                    plays alike his style is limpid, elevated, profuse; his flight is sustained at a
                    high pitch without visible excitement.</p>
                <p>His fluent tenderness and romantic zest have been the secrets of his extreme
                    popularity. Although his inspiration came from Germany, he is not much like a
                    German poet, except when he is consciously following Goethe; his analogy is much
                    rather to be found among the English poets, his contemporaries. His mission
                    towards antiquity reminds us of Scott, but he is, as a poet, a better artist
                    than Scott; he has sometimes touches of exquisite diction and of overwrought
                    sensibility which recall Coleridge to us. In his wide ambition and profuseness
                    he possessed some characteristics of Southey, although his style has far more
                    vitality. With all his faults he was a very great writer, one of the principal
                    pioneers of the romantic movement in Europe, and he will probably not cease to
                    retain the position which he won so easily at the summit of the Scandinavian
                    Parnassus. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi> yy <hi rend="smallcaps">qj</hi></p>
