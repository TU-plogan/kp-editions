                    (1487-1564), Italian Reformer, was born at Siena in 1487. At an early age he
                    entered the order of Observantine Friars, and rose to be its general, but,
                    craving a stricter rule, transferred himself in 1534 to the newly-founded order
                    of Capuchins. He had already become famous for zeal and eloquence, and was the
                    intimate friend of the noble Spaniard Juan de Valdès, of Bembo, Vittoria
                    Colonna, Pietro Martire, Carnesecchi, and others destined to incur the suspicion
                    of heresy, either from the moderation of their characters or from the
                    evangelical tincture of their theology. In 1538 he was elected vicargeneral of
                    his order; in 1539, urged by Bembo, he visited Venice and delivered a remarkable
                    course of sermons, showing a decided tendency to the doctrine of justification
                    by faith, which appears still more evidently in his dialogues published the same
                    year. He was suspected and denounced, but nothing ensued until the establishment
                    of the Inquisition in Rome in June 1542, at the instigation of the austere
                    zealot Caraffa. Ochino almost immediately received a citation to Rome, and set
                    out to obey it about the middle of August. According to his own statement, he
                    was deterred from presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of Cardinal
                    Contarini, whom he found at Bologna, dying of poison administered by the
                    reactionary party. He turned aside to Florence, and after some hesitation
                    escaped across the Alps to Geneva. He was cordially received by Calvin, and
                    published within two years several volumes of <hi rend="italic">Prediche,</hi>
                    controversial tracts rather than sermons, explaining and vindicating his change
                    of religion. He also addressed replies to Vittoria Colonna, Tolomei, and other
                    Italian sympathizers who were reluctant to go to the same length as himself. His
                    own breach with the Roman Church was decisive and irreparable, and illustrated
                    the justice of Luther’s description of justification by faith alone as the <hi
                    rend="italic">articulus stantis vel cadentis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ecclesiae,</hi> the vital point whose acceptance or rejection drew everything
                    else along with it. In 1545 he became minister of the Italian Protestant
                    congregation at Augsburg, which he was compelled to forsake when, in January
                    1547, the city was occupied by the imperial forces. He found an asylum in
                    England, where he was made a prebendary of Canterbury, received a pension from
                    Edward VI.’s privy purse, and composed his capital work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragedy.</hi> This remarkable performance, originally written in Latin, is
                    extant only in the translation <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0777-0720"/> of Bishop Ponet, a splendid specimen of nervous
                    English. The conception is highly dramatic; the form is that of a series of
                    dialogues. Lucifer, enraged at the spread of Christ’s kingdom, convokes the
                    fiends in council, and resolves to set up the pope as Antichrist. The state,
                    represented by the emperor Phocas, is persuaded to connive at the pope’s
                    assumption of spiritual authority; the other churches are intimidated into
                    acquiescence; Lucifer’s projects seem fully accomplished, when Heaven raises up
                    Henry VIII. and his son for their overthrow. The conception bears a remarkable
                    resemblance to that of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost;</hi> and it is nearly
                    certain that Milton, whose sympathies with the Italian Reformation were so
                    strong, must have been acquainted with it. Several of Ochino’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prediche</hi> were also translated into English by a lady, Anna Cook,
                    afterwards wife of Sir Nicholas Bacon; and he published numerous controversial
                    treatises on the Continent. In 1553 the accession of Mary drove him from
                    England. He became pastor of the Italian congregation at Zurich, composed
                    principally of refugees from Locarno, and continued to write books which,
                    repeating the history of his early works, gave increasing evidence of his
                    alienation from the strict orthodoxy around him. The most important of these was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Labyrinth,</hi> a discussion of the freedom of the will,
                    covertly assailing the Calvinistic doctrine of predestination. In 1563 the
                    long-gathering storm of obloquy burst upon the occasion of the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Thirty Dialogues,</hi> in one of which his adversaries
                    maintained that he had justified polygamy under colour of a pretended
                    refutation. His dialogues on divorce and the Trinity were also obnoxious. No
                    explanation was allowed. Ochino was banished from Zurich, and, after being
                    refused a shelter by other Protestant cities, directed his steps towards Poland,
                    at that time the most tolerant state in Europe. He had not resided there long
                    when an edict appeared banishing all foreign dissidents. Flying from the
                    country, he encountered the plague at Pinczoff; three of his four children were
                    carried off; and he himself, worn out by misfortune, expired in solitude and
                    obscurity at Schlakau in Moravia, about the end of 1564. His reputation among
                    Protestants was at the time so bad that he was charged with the authorship of
                    the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">tribus
                    Impostoribus,</hi> as well as with having carried his alleged approval of
                    polygamy into practice. It was reserved for his recent biographer Dr Benrath to
                    justify him, and to represent him as a fervent evangelist and at the same time
                    as a speculative thinker with a passion for free inquiry, always learning and
                    unlearning and arguing out difficult questions with himself in his dialogues,
                    frequently without attaining to any absolute conviction. The general tendency of
                    his mind, nevertheless, was counter to tradition, and he is remarkable as
                    resuming in his individual history all the phases of Protestant theology from
                    Luther to Socinus. He is especially interesting to Englishmen for his residence
                    in England, and the probable influence of more than one of his writings upon
                    Milton.</p>
