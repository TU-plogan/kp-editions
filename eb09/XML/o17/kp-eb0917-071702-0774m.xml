                    county of Surrey in the end of the 13th century. Scarcely any traces of his
                    early life remain. Unattested tradition says that the Franciscans persuaded him
                    while yet a boy to enter their order, sent him to Oxford to Merton College, and
                    to Paris, where he was first the pupil, then the successful rival, of the
                    celebrated John Duns Scotus. He was at the height of his fame as a lecturer in
                    the university of Paris when the famous quarrel arose between Philip the Fair
                    and Pope Boniface VIII., but it does not appear that he took any part in the
                    strife.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The famous <hi

                    obscure traces of his presence in Germany, in Italy, and in England during the
                    following seven years. We only know that in 1322 he appeared as the provincial
                    of England at the celebrated assembly of the Franciscan order at Perugia, and
                    that there he headed the revolt of the Franciscans against Pope John XXII. His
                    share in this revolt and his writings to justify his position gave rise to his
                    trial for heresy before the bishops of Ferrara and Bologna, which resulted in
                    his imprisonment for seventeen weeks in the dungeons of the papal palace at
                    Avignon. He and his companions—Michael of Cesena, general of the order, and
                    Bonagratia—managed to escape, and found their way to Munich, where they formed
                    the most conspicuous members of that band of Franciscans who aided Louis of
                    Bavaria in his long contest with the papal curia. “Defend me with the sword and
                    I will defend you with the pen,” was Occam’s proposal to Louis; and from their
                    haven of refuge at Munich the recusant Franciscans sent forth books and
                    pamphlets refuting the extravagant pretensions of papal authority. Michael of
                    Cesena died in 1342, and Occam, who had received from him the official seal of
                    the order, was recognized as general by his party. The date of his death and the
                    place of his burial are both uncertain. He probably died at Munich in 1349, and
                    was buried in the graveyard of the Franciscan convent. Some writers assert that
                    he was reconciled to Rome, and in proof of submission sent the official seal to
                    William Farinerius, who had been appointed general of the order by the pope;
                    others declare that, like Cesena and Bonagratia, he died excommunicate.</p>

                    theological scepticism of the later Middle Ages, the great contest between pope
                    and emperor which laid the foundations of modern theories of government, and the
                    quarrel between the Roman curia and the Franciscans which showed the
                    long-concealed antagonism between the theories of Hildebrand and Francis of
                    Assisi; and he shared in all these movements.</p>
                <p>The common account of his philosophical position, that he reintroduced
                    nominalism, which had been in decadence since the days of Roscellinus and
                    Abelard, by teaching that universals were only <hi rend="italic">flatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocis,</hi> is scarcely correct. The expression is nowhere found
                    in his writings. He revived nominalism by collecting and uniting isolated
                    opinions upon the meaning of universals into a compact system, and popularized
                    his views by associating them with the logical principles which were in his day
                    commonly taught in the universities. He linked the doctrines of nominalism on to
                    the principles of the logic of Psellus, which had been introduced into the West
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Summulεe</hi> of Peter of Spain, and made them
                    intelligible to common understandings. His philosophical teaching contains
                    little that was new; and all the details of nominalism had been taught by
                    writers who preceded him. The problem of mediaeval philosophy, however
                    differently stated, was the same question which faces modern thinkers. How comes
                    it that things which are seen as separate individual objects can be thought of
                    in classes, and so science created? What underlies the possibility of using
                    common nouns when everything apprehended by the senses is a separate subsisting
                    phenomenon? Realism solved the problem by supposing something <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">rerum natura</hi> which actually corresponded to the
                    class, and whose proper name was the common noun; nominalism explained that the
                    logical faculties of the mind grouped individuals by its own powers, and that
                    universals were creations of the mind which thought. The three chief positions
                    in the nominalist solution of the possibility of a common knowledge were all the
                    common property of scholastic thinkers before Occam’s day. It had been currently
                    taught (by Aegidius and by Antonius Andreas) that the principal use of
                    universals, whatever they were in themselves, was to serve as logical
                    predicates, and in this way bring a variety of subjects together, or, in other
                    words, group individual things in a class. Many of the schoolmen (Walter
                    Burleigh, Durandus, &amp;c.) declared that this logical function of universals
                    was the one thing about them that deserved notice and constituted their
                    essential nature. Durandus and others had asserted that all that universals did
                    was in this logical fashion to bring together several individual objects in such
                    a way that they could be denoted by the same common term. These propositions
                    really exhaust the essential doctrines of nominalism, and they were all stated
                    and were the common property of scholastic philosophy before Occam’s time. What
                    he did was to make nominalism simpler by introducing a way of putting the theory
                    suggested by the Byzantine logic. Psellus and his followers explained many
                    difficulties in logic by showing that in speech words were used like the figures
                    of arithmetic or the signs of algebra. There is no reason why <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> should mean four sheep except the will of the algebraist who starts with
                    that assumption. In the same way, there is no reason why the word “triangle”
                    should stand for the thought it expresses, or the thought for the infinitude of
                    individual triangles; but by <hi rend="italic">suppositio</hi> the one is used
                    for the other, and we can reason with word or thought just as the algebraist can
                    do with his signs. Universals, said Occam, bore the same relation to the
                    infinite number of individuals that signs do to the things signified. The
                    universal, be it a thought or a word, is nothing but a sign which by <hi
                    rend="italic">suppositio</hi> is beforehand taken to denote a number of
                    individual things, and is thus the common noun denoting them all.</p>
                <p>This way of explaining community of knowledge and of defending nominalism went a
                    good deal deeper, and became a theory of knowledge which led Occam into what was
                    called theological scepticism. Most of the adherents of the mystical schools of
                    the Middle Ages held that the doctrines of the church were isolated truths, each
                    of which was to be received by a species of enthusiastic intuition, and were
                    incapable either of systematic arrangement in a body of divinity or of being
                    intelligibly comprehended by the mind. Before Occam appeared, mystics taught a
                    theory of theological scepticism which declared that the truths of the Christian
                    faith were to be taken on trust, although the reason might find logical flaws in
                    each one of them. Occam made this theological scepticism almost a commonplace by
                    basing it on his theory of knowledge. All knowledge, he taught, contained a
                    double inadequacy, which arose from the needs of thinking and of expressing
                    thought in language. Words were but signs, inadequate representations of the
                    thoughts they stood for, and the thoughts themselves were inadequate symbols
                    used by <hi rend="italic">suppositio</hi> instead of the individual objects
                    which they represented. The real individual thing was apprehended by a <hi
                    rend="italic">vis intuitiva,</hi> in sense, vision, or touch, &amp;c., but, when
                    the mind begins to think or to argue, error may creep in, for thoughts are
                    inadequate expressions, stereotyped aspects, and words are only signs of signs.
                    Theological knowledge is like all other knowledge, theological argumentation has
                    the inadequacy that belongs to every process of thought. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centilogium</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologicum</hi> usually appended to Occam’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the Sentences</hi> of Peter the Lombard contains
                    a consistent application of this theory of knowledge to theological dogmas,
                    every one of which is shown to be irrational, but at the same time true in the
                    vision of faith. The most interesting application of his method, however, is to
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Sacramento</hi><hi rend="italic">Altaris,</hi> in which, while accepting as a
                    matter of faith the mediaeval doctrine of the real presence, Occam shows that a
                    much more rational theory might be propounded, and actually sets forth a theory
                    of the Eucharist which was afterwards adopted almost verbatim by Luther, and
                    which is now known as consubstantiation.</p>
                <p>Occam was best known during his lifetime and in the succeeding centuries for the
                    part he took in the prolonged contest between Louis of Bavaria and the papal
                    curia. Louis had been legally elected emperor of Germany, but the pope, who
                    claimed that his power to crown gave him the right to veto any election, refused
                    to acknowledge Louis, and espoused the cause of his rival. The contest was
                    prolonged during more than a quarter of a century, and its interest lies chiefly
                    in the writings of a group of men who, sheltered at Munich, published their
                    views on the relations between civil and religious authority, and on the rights
                    of nations. The most remarkable of the many publications which this controversy
                    called forth was undoubtedly the <hi rend="italic">Defensor Pads</hi> of
                    Marsilius of Padua, which appeared in 1324 or 1326, and which was the prediction
                    of the modern, as Dante’s <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monarchia</hi> (1311- 13) was the epitaph of. the mediaeval state. Occam
                    published several treatises in which, while he confines himself more to the
                    details of the controversy going on before him, there are evident traces of
                    sympathy with the opinions of Marsilius. Pope Clement VI. has left on record
                    that Marsilius “was taught his errors by and got them from” William of Occam; if
                    this be true, the Italian jurist must have had private intercourse with the
                    great English schoolman, for all Occam’s genuine writings on the controversy
                    appeared after the <hi rend="italic">Defensor Pads.</hi> In the <hi

                    incidentally expounds his views as a publicist; the books are mainly, some of
                    them entirely, theological, but they served the purpose of the emperor and of
                    his party, because they cut at the root of the spiritual as well as of the
                    temporal supremacy of the pope. In his writing <hi rend="italic">Super</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">potestate summi</hi><hi rend="italic">pontifiais</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">octo</hi><hi rend="italic">quaestio-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >num</hi><hi rend="italic">decisiones</hi> (1339-42) Occam attacks the temporal
                    supremacy of the pope, insists on the independence of kingly authority, which he
                    maintains is as much an ordinance of God as is spiritual rule, and discusses
                    what is meant by the state. His views on the independence of civil rule were
                    even more decidedly expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">jurisdictione imperatoris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">causis matrimonialibus,</hi> in which, in
                    spite of the mediaeval idea that matrimony is a sacrament, he demands that it
                    belongs to the civil power to decide cases of affinity and to state the
                    prohibited degrees. His last work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Electione</hi><hi rend="italic">Caroli VI.,</hi> restates his opinions upon
                    temporal authority and adds little that is new.</p>
                <p>In all his writings against Pope John XXII. Occam inveighs against the pope’s
                    opinions and decisions on the value of the life of poverty in the practice of
                    religion. The <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi><hi rend="italic">errorum</hi>
                    selects four papal constitutions which involved a declaration against
                    evangelical poverty, and insists that they are full of heresy. Occam was a
                    sincere Franciscan, and believed with his master that salvation was won through
                    rigid imitation of Jesus in His poverty and obedience, and up to his days it had
                    always been possible for Franciscans to follow the rules of their founder within
                    his order. But Pope John XXII. took advantage of a dispute between the more
                    zealous Franciscans and others who had departed from the strict rule of their
                    founder to condemn the doctrine of evangelical poverty, and to excommunicate
                    those who held it. This made many Franciscans question whether, when the pope
                    set his opinion against that of Francis their founder, the pope could be
                    infallible; and some of them were so convinced of the necessity of evangelical
                    poverty for a truly Christian life that they denounced the pope when he refused
                    them leave to practise it as Antichrist, or the being who stood between
                    Christians and the means of holy living. After Occam’s days the opinions of
                    Francis prevailed in many quarters, but the genuine Franciscans had no place
                    within the church. They were Fraticelli, Beghards, Lollards, or other
                    confraternities unrecognized by the church, and in steady opposition to her
                    government.</p>
