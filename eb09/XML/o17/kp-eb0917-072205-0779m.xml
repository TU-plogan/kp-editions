                    >Ocydromus,</hi> meaning “swift-runner,” and suggested by Wagler in 1830 as a
                    generic term for the New-Zealand bird called in the then unpublished manuscripts
                    of the elder Forster <hi rend="italic">Rallus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >troglodytes,</hi> and so designated in 1788 by Gmelin, who knew of it through
                    Latham’s English description. Wagler’s suggestion has since been generally
                    adopted, and the genus <hi rend="italic">Ocydromus</hi> is accepted by most
                    ornithologists as a valid group of <hi rend="italic">Rallidae</hi>; but the
                    number of species it contains is admittedly doubtful, owing to the variability
                    in size and plumage which they exhibit, and their correct nomenclature must for
                    the present be considered uncertain. Mr Buller in his <hi rend="italic">Birds of
                    New Zealand</hi> identifies the “Woodhen,” observed in great abundance on the
                    shores of Dusky Bay in 1773 by Cook and his companions on his second voyage,

                    described and figured by Du Bus in 1847, and accordingly calls it <hi

                    in Stewart Island, and singularly enough on the more distant group known as the

                    which the typical (and unique ?) specimen from an unknown locality is in the
                    Caen Museum, has also been referred to this species, but the propriety of the

                    where it lives wholly on crustaceans and other marine animals—is identical with
                    that of the older authors just mentioned. In 1786 Sparrman, who had also been of
                    Cook’s company, figured and described as <hi rend="italic">Rallus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">australis</hi> a bird which, though said by him to be that of the

                    with the common <hi rend="italic">“Weeka</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,,</hi> of the Maories of the Middle Island, which can scarcely be the case if
                    his statement is absolutely true, since the latter does not appear to reach so
                    far to the southward, or to affect the sea-shore. It may therefore be fairly
                    inferred that his subject was obtained from some other locality. The North
                    Island of New Zealand has what is allowed to be a third species, to which the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Ocydromus earli</hi> is attached, and this was
                    formerly very plentiful; but its numbers are rapidly decreasing, and there is
                    every chance of its soon being as extinct as is the species which tenanted
                    Norfolk Island on its discovery by Cook in 1774, and was doubtless distinct from
                    all the rest, but no specimen of it is known to exist in any museum.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As before stated <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Nestor,</hi> p. 354 <hi rend="italic">ants'),</hi> the younger
                    Forster remarked that the birds of Norfolk Island, though believed by the other
                    naturalists of Cook’s ship to be generally the same as those of New Zealand,
                    were distinguished by their brighter colouring. There can now be little doubt
                    that all the land-birds were specifically distinct. It seems to be just possible
                    that Sparrman’s <hi rend="italic">R. australis,</hi> which cannot be very
                    confidently referred to any known species of <hi rend="italic">Ocydromus,</hi>
                    may have been from Norfolk Island; but there is little probability of the point
                    ever being determined, though it seems to be worth the attention of
                    ornithologists.</p></note> Another species, <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Ocydromus,</hi> but apparently very nearly allied to it, is a
                    little bird peculiar, it is believed, to the Chatham Islands <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibis,</hi> 1872, p. 247), and now regarded by Captain Hutton as the type of a
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Cabalus</hi> under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">modestus,</hi> while other naturalists consider it to
                    be the young of the rare <hi rend="italic">Rallus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dieffen-bachi.</hi> So far the distribution of the Ocydromine form is wholly in
                    accordance with that of most others characteristic of the New-Zealand
                    sub-region; buta curious exception is asserted to have been found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">alliralius lafresnay-anus</hi> of New
                    Caledonia, which, though presenting some structural differences, has been
                    referred to the genus <hi rend="italic">Ocydromus.</hi></p>
                <p>The chief interest attaching to the Ocydromes is their inability to use in flight
                    the wings with which they are furnished, and hence an extreme probability of the
                    form becoming wholly extinct in a short time. Of this inability there are other
                    instances among the <hi rend="italic">Rallidae</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Moorhen,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 808); but here we have coupled with it the curious
                    fact that in the skeleton the angle which the scapula makes with the coracoid is
                    greater than a right angle, a peculiarity shared only, so far as is known, among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Carinatae</hi> by the Dodo. The Ocydromes are birds of
                    dull plumage, and mostly of retiring habits, though the common species is said
                    to show great boldness towards man, and, from the accounts of Cook and the
                    younger Forster, the birds seen by them displayed little fear. It is also
                    declared that they will interbreed with common poultry, and more than one writer
                    vouches for the truth of this extraordinary statement. It is to be hoped that
                    the naturalists of New Zealand will not allow the form to become extinct if any
                    effectual means can be taken to perpetuate it; but, should that fate be
                    inevitable, it at least behoves the present generation to see that every
                    possible jpiece of information concerning the birds be recorded, and ’every
                    possible preparation illustrating their structure be made, while yet there is
                    time; for, though much has been written on the subject, it is obvious from one
                    of the latest papers <hi rend="italic">(Trans. N^ew Zealand Institute,</hi> x.
                    p. 213) that there is still more to be learned, some of which may throw further
                    light on the affinities of the birds of the extinct genus <hi rend="italic"
