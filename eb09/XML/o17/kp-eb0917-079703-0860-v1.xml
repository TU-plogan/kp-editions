                <p><label type="entry">OPPIAN</label>. The literary history of the three Greek poems
                    on fishing, hunting, and fowling respectively which have come down to us from
                    antiquity under the name of Oppian involves several perplexing questions.
                    According to Suidas, Eusebius, and Syncellus, the author was a native of
                    Anazarbus or Corycus in Cilicia, and flourished in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.
                    Athenaeus also, who almost certainly wrote under Septimius Severus, speaks of
                    Oppian as a predecessor and near contemporary. According to an anonymous
                    biographer, he was the son of a philosopher of Anazarbus named Agesilaus, who
                    having incurred the displeasure of Severus by neglecting to wait upon him was
                    banished to Malta. Young Oppian accompanied his father, and by the exercise of
                    his poetical talents obtained his recall, and was further rewarded by a piece of
                    gold for every line he had written. He died prematurely upon his return to his
                    native country, and was honoured by an epitaph, which has been preserved,
                    celebrating his precocious genius, but affording no clue to his works or his
                    date. On turning to Oppian himself we find that his poem on fish and fishing <hi
                        rend="italic">(Halieutica)</hi> is actually addressed to an emperor
                    Antoninus who can have been no other than Marcus Aurelius, since the monarch’s
                    son is frequently mentioned, and the other Antonine princes were childless. The
                    author seems to speak of himself as a Cilician. On the other hand, the poem on
                    hunting <hi rend="italic">(Cynegetica)</hi> is no less unmistakably addressed to
                    the successor of Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and the writer represents himself
                    as a citizen of Pella or Apamea in Syria. The style of the two poems, moreover,
                    is dissimilar, the former being polished and poetical, the latter inelegant and
                    commonplace. If the <hi rend="italic">Cynegetica</hi> had been the earlier this
                    might have been explained, but the reverse is the fact. There seems no
                    alternative, therefore, but to divide the authorship, and the allusions of the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> to Commodus make it almost
                    certain that he must have written between the elevation of that prince to the
                    dignity of Augustus and the death of Marcus (177- 180 A.D.), while the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cynegetica</hi> seem to have been composed after the death of
                    Severus (211 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The improbability of two poets of
                    the same name and writing on such similar subjects having been such near
                    contemporaries maybe escaped by the supposition that the later writer was not
                    really named Oppian, but has been confounded with his predecessor from their
                    poems being transcribed together. This is the more probable as the poem on
                    fowling <hi rend="italic">(Ixeutica),</hi> which seems to resemble the <hi
                        rend="italic">Cynegetica</hi> in style, but is only extant in a prose
                    epitome, is attributed in some MSS. to a certain Dionysius. In this case
                    Oppian’s premature death and his epitaph may be accepted as historical and
                    genuine. The story of his deliverance of his father must be apocryphal, and the
                    imperial reward is probably founded upon a too literal interpretation of the
                    epithet “golden” applied to his verses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> are indeed excellent verses. Oppian has
                    made the most of his subject, which he has adorned with all the resources of
                    aquatic fancy and fable, and to which he has ingeniously imparted human interest
                    by constant parallels between the existence of fishes and the pursuits and
                    perils of human life. His matter is arranged to the best advantage: “he loves
                    descriptions,” says Μ. Henri Martin, “but not digressions.” Though careless of
                    fact in comparison with poetic embellishment, he has a first-hand acquaintance
                    with his theme as a sportsman and a lover of nature. His diction is choice, his
                    style animated, and his versification sonorous. Rhetorical display, the
                    accumulation of detail, and an occasional inaptness in his comparisons are his
                    only serious faults. The writer of the <hi rend="italic">Cynegetica,</hi> who
                    sometimes copies and spoils him, is a far inferior writer, frequently tasteless,
                    generally awkward and dry. Some of his descriptions, however, possess merit; he
                    is a naturalist as well as a poet, and his observation of nature is often
                    remarkably close, although, like his predecessor, he abounds in fables. His poem
                    seems to want a final book, in which the stratagems of the chase would have been
                    more fully described. The poetical qualities of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ixeutica,</hi> if any, have evaporated in the paraphrase; the descriptions
                    of the fowler’s snares are clear and precise.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> were first printed in 1478, in the metrical
                    Latin version of L. Lippus. The editio princeps of the original was published by
                    Junta at Florence in 1515; the <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Cynegetica</hi> were printed together by Aldus in 1517; the
                        <hi rend="italic">Ixeutica</hi> did not appear till 1704. The principal
                    modern editions are those by Schneider (Strasburg, 1776), who first
                    distinguished between the two Oppians, and by Lehrs (Paris, 1846, along with the
                    Bucolic poets), who adopted a number of ingenious emendations by Koechly.
                    Copious scholia on the <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> were edited by
                    Bussemaker (Paris, 1849). The best authorities on the literary questions
                    connected with the Oppians are Ferdinand Peter, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commentatio,</hi> Zeitz, 1840; Henri Martin in the <hi rend="italic"

                    and Ausfeld, <hi rend="italic">De Oppiano,</hi> &amp;c., Gotha, 1876. The
                    English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Halieutica</hi> by Diaper,
                    completed by Jones (Oxford, 1722), is not deficient in spirit, but much too
                    diffuse. The French prose translations by Limes and Belin de Ballu have been
                    superseded by Bourquin’s, Coulommiers, 1877. (R∙ G.)</p>
