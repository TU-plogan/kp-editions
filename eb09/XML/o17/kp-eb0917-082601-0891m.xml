                    sides by steppes. The central ridge occasionally reaches an elevation of about
                    5000 feet; there are several parallel ridges, which, however, nowhere exceed
                    2600 feet, and gradually sink towards the south. A great variety of geological
                    formations are represented within the government. Diorites and granites enter it
                    from the north and appear at many places from under the Silurian and Devonian
                    deposits. The Carboniferous limestones and sandstones, as also softer Permian,
                    Jurassic, and Cretaceous deposits, have a wide extension in the south and east.
                    Magnetic iron, copper, silver, and lead ores, auriferous sands, and salt from
                    the lakes constitute the mineral wealth of Orenburg, along with its very fertile
                    “black earth,” which covers wide areas around the Urals. It is traversed from
                    north to south by the Ural river, which also forms its southern boundary; the
                    chief tributaries are the Sakmara and the Ilek. The upper courses of the Byelaya
                    and the Samara, tributaries of the Kama and the Volga, also lie within the
                    government, as well as the affluents of the Tobol on the eastern slope of the
                    Ural range. Numerous salt lakes occur in the district of Tchelabinsk; but
                    several parts of the flat lands occasionally suffer from want of water. Thirteen
                    per cent, of the surface is under wood. The climate is continental and dry, the
                    average temperature at Orenburg being 37 <hi rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 4 Fahr.
                    (4° ’ 5 in January, 69 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 8 in July). Frosts of -
                    38°, and heats of 98° are not uncommon.</p>
                <p>The population (900,550 in 1870) numbered 1,120,700 in 1881. The increase is
                    largely due to immigration, an extensive tract of uncultivated land which
                    formerly belonged to the Bashkirs having recently been purchased by the
                    Government officials and leased to immigrants from the interior of Russia. The
                    inhabitants are mainly Great Russians, Bashkirs (26 per cent.), and Kirghiz
                    (about 5 per cent.). The majority belong to the Greek Church, or are
                    Nonconformists; 27 per cent, are Mohammedans, The chief occupations are
                    agriculture and cattle-breeding. Although only 3 2 per cent, of the area is
                    under crops, grain is both distilled and exported. In 1881 there were in the
                    province 581,000 horses, 441,000 cattle, 880,000 sheep, and 65,000 pigs.
                    Notwithstanding the abundance of iron and copper ore, mining is but little
                    developed. The industrial establishments (distilleries, tanneries, flourmills,
                    &amp;c. ) are few, and their aggregate production in 1879 was only 5,195,000
                    roubles, employing about 2200 workmen. The export trade in corn, skins, and
                    tallow is of some importance, and the fairs at Orenburg, Troitsk, and
                    Tchelabinsk yield large returns. There are five districts, the chief towns of
                    which are Orenburg (35,600 inhabitants), Orsk (14,350), Tchelabinsk or Tchelaba
                    (9000) Troitsk (8300), and Verkhneuralsk (10,350).</p>

                <p>The territory of the Orenburg Cossacks, which extends as a narrow strip up the
                    Ural river, occupies the whole of the government east of the Ural mountains, and
                    joins, by a narrow line of posts, the former line of blockhouses of the Siberian
                    Cossacks, has an area of 35,820 square miles, with a population in 1880 of
                    290,800 Cossacks and 16,460 peasants; 25,000 were Moslem Bashkirs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Orenburg,</hi> capital of the above government, is situated
                    on the right bank of the Ural river, 933 miles by rail south-east from Moscow.
                    The fortress, which has eleven bastions and a circumference of 6300 yards, has
                    lost its importance since the recent advances of Russia towards the south-east,
                    and is falling into decay. The town, on the other hand, is rapidly increasing,
                    and now includes the former suburbs of Golubinaya and Novaya. The population is
                    35,600. Orenburg has a military cadet school, two lower military schools, a
                    lyceum, and various primary schools,—one of them for Kirghiz children. The
                    inhabitants are chiefly occupied in agriculture and trade. The manufactures are
                    few, but the trade is steadily increasing; the imports include cotton, silk,
                    furs, wool, cattle, and horses, while cotton and woollen stuffs, cotton yarn,
                    leather, colours, sugar, and grain are exported. Orenburg is connected, by rail
                    with Samara on the Volga and with Moscow.</p>
                <p>The government of Orenburg was formerly inhabited by the Kirghiz in the south and
                    the Bashkirs in the north. The latter were brought under the rule of Russia in
                    1557, and the fort of Ufa was erected a few years later in order to protect them
                    against the raids of the Kirghiz. The frequent risings of the Bashkirs and the
                    continuous attacks of the Kirghiz led the Russian Government in the 18th century
                    to erect a line of forts and blockhouses on the Ural and Sakmara rivers, which
                    was afterwards extended south-westwards towards the Caspian, and eastwards
                    towards Omsk. The central point of these military lines was the fort of
                    Orenburg, originally founded at the confluence of the Or with the Ural (now
                    Orsk), and afterwards removed (in 1740) 120 miles lower doλvn the Ural river to
                    its present site. In 1773 it was besieged by Pugatchoff, the leader of the great
                    revolt of the peasantry, supported by the Bashkirs. The government of Orenburg
                    was created in 1774, embracing a wide territory which reached to the Volga, to
                    the Caspian, and to Perm, the limits to the eastward being undefined. In 1865
                    this was divided into two governments,—Ufa in the north and Orenburg in the
                    south. The steppe of the Kirghiz, which extends south of the Ural river towards
                    the Caspian and the Sea of Aral, continued under the jurisdiction of the
                    governor-general of Orenburg. Recently the steppe of the Orenburg Kirghiz has
                    been incorporated with the newly-created provinces of Turgay and Uralsk; and the
                    territory of the Orenburg Cossacks, formerly independent, has been brought
                    within the government of Orenburg, and subdivided into districts.</p>
