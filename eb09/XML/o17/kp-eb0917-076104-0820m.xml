                    >europaea),</hi> the well-known plant that yields the olive oil of commerce,
                    belongs to a section of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Oleaceae,</hi> of
                    which it has been taken as the type. The genus <hi rend="italic">Olea</hi>
                    includes about thirty-five species, very widely scattered, chiefly over the Old
                    World, from the basin of the Mediterranean to South Africa and New Zealand. The
                    wild olive, or oleaster, is a small tree or bush of rather straggling growth,
                    with thorny branches and opposite oblong pointed leaves, dark greyish-green
                    above and, in the young state, hoary beneath with whitish scales; the small
                    white flowers, with four-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma,
                    are borne on the last year’s wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the
                    leaves; the drupaceous fruit is small in the wild plant, and the fleshy
                    pericarp, which gives the garden olive its economic value, is hard and
                    comparatively thin. In the cultivated forms the tree acquires a more compact
                    habit, the branches lose their spinous character, while the young shoots become
                    more or less angular; the leaves are always hoary on the under-side, and are
                    generally lanceolate in shape, though varying much in breadth and size in the
                    different kinds. The fruit is subject to still greater alterations of form and
                    colour; usually oval or nearly globular, in some sorts it is egg-shaped, in
                    others much elongated; while the dark hue that it commonly assumes when ripe is
                    exchanged in many varieties for violet, green, or almost white. At present the
                    wild olive is found in most of the countries around the Mediterranean, extending
                    its range on the west to Portugal, and eastward to the vicinity of the Caspian,
                    while, locally, it occurs even in Afghanistan. An undoubted native of Syria and
                    the maritime parts of Asia Minor, its abundance in Greece and the islands of the
                    Archipelago, and the frequent allusions to it by the earliest poets, seem to
                    indicate that it was there also indigenous; but in localities remote from the
                    Levant it may have escaped from cultivation, reverting more or less to its
                    primitive type. It shows a marked preference for calcareous soils and a
                    partiality for the sea-breeze, flourishing with especial luxuriance on the
                    limestone slopes and crags that often form the shores of the Greek peninsula and
                    adjacent islands.</p>
                <p>The varieties of olive known to the modern cultivator are extremely
                    numerous,—according to some authorities, equalling or exceeding in number those
                    of the vine. In France and Italy at least thirty kinds have been enumerated, but
                    comparatively few are grown to any large extent. None of these can be safely
                    identified with ancient descriptions, though it is not unlikely that some of the
                    narrowleaved sorts that are most esteemed may be descendants of the famed
                    “Licinian” (see below). Italy retains its old pre-eminence in olive cultivation;
                    and, though its ancient Gallic province now excels it in the production of the
                    finer oils, its fast-improving culture may restore the old prestige. The
                    broad-leaved olive trees of Spain bear a larger fruit, but the pericarp is of
                    more bitter flavour and the oil of ranker quality. The olive tree, even when
                    free increase is unchecked by pruning, is of very slow growth; but, where
                    allowed for ages its natural development, the trunk sometimes attains a
                    considerable diameter. De Candolle records one exceeding 23 feet in girth, the
                    age being supposed to amount to seven centuries. Some old Italian olives have
                    been credited with an antiquity reaching back <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0821-0762"/> to the first years of the empire, or even to the
                    days of republican Rome; but the age of such ancient trees is always doubtful
                    during growth, and their identity with old descriptions still more difficult to
                    establish. The tree in cultivation rarely exceeds 30 feet in height, and in
                    France and Italy is generally confined to much more limited dimensions by
                    frequent pruning. The wood, of a yellow or light greenish-brown hue, is often
                    finely veined with a darker tint, and, being very hard and close-grained, is
                    valued by the cabinetmaker and ornamental turner.</p>
                <p>The olive is propagated in various ways, but cuttings or layers are generally
                    preferred; the tree roots in favourable soil almost as easily as the willow, and
                    throws up suckers from the stump when cut down. Branches of various thickness
                    are cut into lengths of several feet each, and, planted rather deeply in manured
                    ground, soon vegetate; shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow
                    trenches, when, covered with a few inches of soil, they rapidly throw up
                    sucker-like shoots. In Greece and the islands grafting the cultivated tree on
                    the oleaster is a common practice. In Italy embryonic buds, which form small
                    swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted beneath the surface,
                    where they grow readily, these “uovoli” soon forming a vigorous shoot.
                    Occasionally the larger boughs are inarched, and young trees thus soon obtained.
                    The olive is also sometimes raised from seed, the oily pericarp being first
                    softened by slight rotting, or soaking in hot water or in an alkaline solution,
                    to facilitate germination. The olives in the East often receive little attention
                    from the husbandman, the branches being allowed to grow freely and without
                    curtailment by the pruning-knife; water, however, must be supplied in long
                    droughts to ensure a crop; with this neglectful culture the trees bear
                    abundantly only at intervals of three or four years; thus, although wild growth
                    is favourable to the picturesque aspect of the plantation, it is not to be
                    recommended on economic grounds. Where the olive is carefully cultivated, as in
                    Languedoc and Provence, it is planted in rows at regular intervals, the distance
                    between the trees varying in different “olivettes,” according to the variety
                    grown. Careful pruning is practised, the object being to preserve the
                    flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping the head of the tree
                    low, so as to allow the easy gathering of the fruit; a dome or rounded form is
                    generally the aim of the pruner. The spaces between the trees are occasionally
                    manured with rotten dung, or other nitrogenous matter; in France woollen rags
                    are in high esteem for this purpose. Various annual crops are sometimes raised
                    between the rows, and in Calabria wheat even is grown in this way; but the trees
                    are better without any intermediate cropping. Latterly a dwarf variety, very
                    prolific, and with green fruit, has come into favour in certain localities,
                    especially in America, where it is said to have produced a crop two or three
                    seasons after planting. The ordinary kinds do not become profitable to the
                    grower until from five to seven years after the cuttings are placed in the
                    oliveground. Apart from occasional damage by weather or organic foes, the olive
                    crop is somewhat precarious even with the most careful cultivation, and the
                    large untended trees so often seen in Spain and Italy do not yield that certain
                    income to the peasant proprietor that some authors have attributed to them; the
                    crop from these old trees is often enormous, but they seldom bear well two years
                    in succession, and in many instances a luxuriant harvest can only be reckoned
                    upon every sixth or seventh season. The fruit when ripe is, by the careful
                    grower, picked by hand and deposited in cloths or baskets for conveyance to the
                    mill; but in many parts of Spain and Greece, and generally in Asia, the olives
                    are beaten down by poles, or by shaking the boughs, or even allowed to drop
                    naturally, often lying on the ground until the convenience of the owner admits
                    of their removal; much of the inferior oil owes its bad quality to the
                    carelessness of the proprietor of the trees. In southern Europe the olive
                    harvest is in the winter months, continuing for several weeks; but the time
                    varies in each country, and also with the season and the kinds cultivated. The
                    amount of oil contained in the fruit differs much in the various sorts; the
                    pericarp usually yields from 60 to 70 per cent. The ancient agriculturists
                    believed that the olive would not succeed if planted more than a few leagues
                    from the sea (Theophrastus gives 300 stadia as the limit), but modern experience
                    does not confirm the idea, and, though showing a preference for the coast, it
                    has long been grown far inland. A calcareous soil, however dry or poor, seems
                    best adapted to its healthy development, though the tree will grow in any light
                    soil, and even on clay if well drained; but, as remarked by Pliny, the plant is
                    more liable to disease on rich soils, and the oil is inferior to the produce of
                    the poorer and more rocky ground the species naturally affects. The olive
                    suffers greatly in some years from the attacks of various enemies. A fungoid
                    growth has at times infested the trees for several successive seasons, to the
                    great damage of the plantations. A species of coccus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">oleae,</hi> attaches itself to the shoots, and certain
                    lepidopterous caterpillars feed on the leaves, while the “olive-fly” attacks the
                    fruit. In France the olivettes suffer occasionally from frost; in the early part
                    of the last century many trees were cut to the ground by a winter of exceptional
                    severity. Gales and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause
                    mischief.</p>
                <p>The unripe fruit of the olive is largely used in modern as in ancient times as an
                    article of dessert, to enhance the flavour of wine, and to renew the
                    sensitiveness of the palate for other viands. For this purpose the fruit is
                    picked while green, soaked for a few hours in an alkaline ley, washed well in
                    clean water, and then placed in bottles or jars filled with brine; the Romans
                    added <hi rend="italic">amurca</hi> to the salt to increase the bitter flavour
                    of the olives, and at the present day spices are sometimes used.</p>
                <p>The leaves and bark of the tree are employed in the south, as a tonic medicine,
                    in intermittent fever. A resinous matter called “olive gum,” or Lucca gum,
                    formed by the exuding juice in hot seasons, was anciently in medical esteem, and
                    in modern Italy is used as a perfume.</p>
                <p>In England the olive is not hardy, though in the southern counties it will stand
                    ordinary winters with only the protection of a wall, and will bear fruit in such
                    situations; but the leaves are generally shed in the autumn, and the olives
                    rarely ripen.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Olea</hi> includes several other species of some
                    economic importance. The olive of America, <hi rend="italic">O. americana,</hi>
                    a rather small tree, growing in the southern parts of the United States, with
                    broadly-lanceolate leaves and compound racemes of small white fragrant flowers,
                    is remarkable for the extreme hardness of its wood, which, resisting ordinary
                    tools, is càlled devil-wood by the southern lumberers and squatters. <hi
                    rend="italic">O. panιculata</hi> is a larger, tree, attaining a height of 50 or
                    60 feet in the forests of Queensland, and yielding a hard and tough timber. The
                    yet harder wood of <hi rend="italic">O. laurifolia,</hi> an inhabitant of Natal,
                    is the black ironwood of the South African colonist. The white or yellowish
                    sweet-scented flowers of <hi rend="italic">O. fragrans,</hi> a Chinese species,
                    are employed to communicate their aroma to some of the finer teas; the oblong
                    serrated leaves are said to be used for the adulteration of inferior kinds. Some
                    other species of olive furnish hard and close-grained wood, but are not yet of
                    much general interest <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0822-0763"/> At what remote period of human progress the wild
                    oleaster passed under the care of the husbandman and became the fruitful garden
                    olive it is impossible to conjecture;—history and tradition are alike silent
                    regarding the origin of most of the more valued plants of cultivation, and we
                    know little more of the later evolution of the olive than of the remoter
                    genealogies of our present wheat and maize. The frequent reference in the Bible
                    to the plant and its produce, its implied abundance in the land of Canaan, the
                    important place it has always held in the economy of the inhabitants of Syria,
                    lead us to consider that country the birthplace of the cultivated olive. An
                    improved variety, possessed at first by some small Semitic sept, it was probably
                    slowly distributed to adjacent tribes; and, yielding profusely, with little
                    labour, that oily matter so essential to healthy life in the dry hot climates of
                    the East, the gift of the fruitful tree became in that primitive age a symbol of
                    peace and goodwill among the warlike barbarians. At a later period, with the
                    development of maritime enterprise, the oil was conveyed, as an article of
                    trade, to the neighbouring Pelasgic and Ionian nations, and the plant,
                    doubtless, soon followed,</p>
                <p>Hehn remarks that in the Homeric world, as depicted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> olive oil is known only as a luxury of the wealthy,—an exotic
                    product, prized chiefly for its value in the heroic toilet; the warriors anoint
                    themselves with it after the bath, and the body of Patroclus is similarly
                    sprinkled; but no mention of the culture of the plant is made, nor does it find
                    any place on the Achillean shield, on which a vineyard is represented. But,
                    although no reference to the cultivation of the olive occurs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the presence of the tree in the garden of Alcinous and
                    other familiar allusions show it to have been known when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> was written. Whenever the introduction may have taken place, all
                    tradition points to the limestone hills of Attica as the seat of its first
                    cultivation on the Hellenic peninsula. When Poseidon and Athene contended for
                    the future city, an olive sprang from the barren rock at the bidding of the
                    goddess, the patron of those arts that were to bring undying influence to the
                    rising state. That this myth has some relation to the first planting of the
                    olive in Greece seems certain from the remarkable story told by Herodotus of the
                    Epidaurians, who, on their crops failing, applied for counsel to the Delphic
                    oracle, and were enjoined to erect statues to Damia and Auxesia (symbols of
                    fertility) carved from the wood of the true garden olive, then possessed only by
                    the Athenians, who granted their request for a tree on condition of their making
                    an annual sacrifice to Athene, its patron; they thus obeyed the command of the
                    Pythian, and their lands became again fertile. The sacred tree of the goddess
                    long stood on the Acropolis, and, though destroyed in the Persian invasion,
                    sprouted again from the root,—some suckers of which were said to have produced
                    those olive trees of the Academy in an after age no less revered. By the time of
                    Solon the olive had so spread that he found it necessary to enact laws to
                    regulate the cultivation of the tree in Attica, from which country it was
                    probably distributed gradually to all the Athenian allies and tributary states.
                    To the Ionian coast, where it abounded in the time of Thales, it may have been
                    in an earlier age brought by Phoenician vessels; some of the Sporades may have
                    received it from the same source; the olives of Rhodes and Crete had perhaps a
                    similar origin. Samos, if we may judge from the epithet of Aeschylus
                    (Acu6≠υτos), must have had the fruitful plant long before the Persian wars. It
                    is not unlikely that the valued tree was taken to Magna Graecia by the first
                    Achaean colonists, and the assertion of Pliny (quoted from Fenestella), that no
                    olives existed in Italy in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, must be received
                    with the caution due to many statements of that industrious compiler. In Latin
                    Italy the cultivation seems to have spread slowly, for it was not until the
                    consulship of Pompey that the production of oil became sufficient to permit of
                    its exportation. In Pliny's time it was already grown abundantly in the two
                    Gallic provinces and in Spain; indeed, in the earlier days of Strabo the
                    Ligurians supplied the Alpine barbarians with oil, in exchange for the wild
                    produce of their mountains; the plant may have been introduced into those
                    districts by Greek settlers in a previous age. Africa was indebted for the olive
                    mainly to Semitic agencies. In Egypt the culture never seems to have made much
                    progress; the oil found in Theban tombs was probably imported from Syria. Along
                    the southern shore of the great inland sea the tree was carried by the
                    Phoenicians, at a remote period, to their numerous colonies in Africa,—though
                    the abundant olives of Cyrene, to which allusion is made by Theophrastus, and
                    the glaucous foliage of whose descendants still clothes the rocks of the
                    deserted Cyrenaica, may have been the offspring of Greek plants brought by the
                    first settlers. The tree was most likely introduced into southern Spain, and
                    perhaps into Sardinia and the Balearic Islands, by Phoenician merchants; and, if
                    it be true that old olive trees were found in the Canaries on their rediscovery
                    by mediaeval navigators, the venerable trees probably owed their origin to the
                    same enterprising pioneers of the ancient world. De Candolle says that the means
                    by which the olive was distributed to the two opposite shores of the
                    Mediterranean are indicated by the names given to the plant by their respective
                    inhabitants,—the Greek Aαiα passing into the Latin <hi rend="italic">olea</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">oliva,</hi> that in its turn becoming the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulivo</hi> of the modern Italian, the <hi rend="italic">olivo</hi>
                    of the Spaniard, and the <hi rend="italic">olive,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >olivier,</hi> of the French, while in Africa and southern Spain the olive
                    retains appellatives derived from the Semitic <hi rend="italic">zait</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">seit</hi>; but the complete subjugation of Barbary by the Saracens
                    sufficiently accounts for the prevalence of Semitic forms in that region; and
                    <hi rend="italic">aceytuno</hi> (Arab. <hi rend="italic">zeitûn),</hi> the
                    Andalusian name of the fruit, locally given to the tree itself, is but a vestige
                    of the Moorish conquest. Yielding a grateful substitute for the butter and
                    animal fats consumed by the races of the north, the olive, among the southern
                    nations of antiquity, became an emblem not only of peace but of national wealth
                    and domestic plenty; the branches borne in the Panathenaea, the wild olive spray
                    of the Olympic victor, the olive crown of the Roman conqueror at ovation, and
                    those of the equites at their imperial review alike typified gifts of peace
                    that, in a barbarous age, could be secured by victory alone. Among the Greeks
                    the oil was valued as an important article of diet, as well as for its external
                    use. The Roman people employed it largely in food and cookery,—the wealthy as an
                    indispensable adjunct to the toilet; and in the luxurious days of the later
                    empire it became a favourite axiom that long and pleasant life depended on two
                    fluids, <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> '∙ wine within and oil without.” Pliny
                    vaguely describes fifteen varieties of olive cultivated in his day,—that called
                    the ‘Licinian” being held in most esteem, and the oil obtained from it at
                    Venafrum in Campania the finest known to Roman connoisseurs; the produce of
                    Istria and Baetica was regarded as second only to· that of the Italian
                    peninsula. The <hi rend="italic">gourmet</hi> of the empire valued the unripe
                    fruit, steeped in brine, as a provocative to the palate, no less than his modern
                    representative; and pickled olives, retaining their characteristic flavour, have
                    been found among the buried stores of Pompeii. The bitter juice or refuse
                    deposited during expression of the oil (called <hi rend="italic">amurca},</hi>
                    and the astringent leaves of the tree have many virtues attributed to them by
                    ancient authors. The oil of the bitter wild olive was employed by the Roman
                    physicians in medicine, but does not appear ever to have been used as food or in
                    the culinary art.</p>
                <p>In modern times the olive has been spread widely over the world; and, though the
                    Mediterranean lands that were its ancient home still yield the chief supply of
                    the oil, the tree is now cultivated successfully in many regions unknown to its
                    early distributors. Soon after the discovery of the American continent it was
                    conveyed thither by the Spanish settlers. In Chili it flourishes as luxuriantly
                    as in its native land, the trunk sometimes becoming of large girth, while oil of
                    fair quality is yielded by the fruit. To Peru it was carried at a later date,
                    but has not there been equally successful. Introduced into Mexico by the Jesuit
                    missionaries of the 17th century, it was planted by similar agency in Upper
                    California, where it has prospered latterly under the more careful management of
                    the Anglo - Saxon conqueror. Its cultivation has also been attempted in the
                    south-eastern States, especially in Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi. In the
                    eastern hemisphere the olive has been established in many inland districts,
                    which would have been anciently considered ill adapted for its culture. To
                    Armenia and Persia it was known at a comparatively early period of history, and
                    many olive-yards now exist in Upper Egypt, where the cultivation is said to be
                    increasing. The tree has lately been introduced into Chinese agriculture, while
                    in the present generation it promises to become an important addition to the
                    resources of the Australian planter. In Queensland the olive has found a climate
                    specially suited to its wants; in South Australia, near Adelaide, it also grows
                    vigorously; and there are probably few coast districts of the vast
                    island-continent where the tree would not flourish. It has likewise been
                    successfully introduced into some parts of the Cape Colony. (C. P. J. )</p>
