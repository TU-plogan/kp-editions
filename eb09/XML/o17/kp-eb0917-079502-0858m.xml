                <p><label type="entry">OPORTO</label> (⅝.e., <hi rend="italic">0 Porto,</hi> The
                    Port), the second city of the kingdom of Portugal, the capital of Entre Douro e
                    Minho, the best-cultivated and the most fruitful province of the country, is
                    situated on both banks of the Douro, about 3 miles from its mouth, in 41° 9' N.
                    lat. and 8° 37' W. long. The part south of the Douro is known as Villa Nova da
                    Gaia. The mouth of the river is obstructed by a very dangerous shifting
                    sandbank, protected by a lighthouse and a castle situated in the village of Sâo
                    Joäo da Foz, which, along with Campanha, Paranhos, and Sordello, completes the
                    suburbs. The population of the city is 80,295, and with the suburbs 108,346.</p>
                <p>The view of the town from the river is singularly attractive and quaint. It
                    possesses many buildings of interest, and picturesque thoroughfares, which,
                    however, from the situation of the city, are very steep and irregular. The
                    principal edifices are the cathedral and the archbishop’s palace—the latter,
                    containing a fine staircase, conspicuously situated on a high rock—and the Torre
                    dos Clerigos, a granite tower 210 feet high, built in 1748, commanding a
                    splendid view, and visible at sea a long way off. The English factory (built in
                    1790), including a library, reading-room, and ballroom, is one of the largest
                    buildings, while the exchange (once the monastery of S. Francisco) is perhaps
                    the finest and most elaborately decorated structure in the country. The walls
                    and floor of the hall are entirely covered with beautiful inlaid devices in
                    polished native-coloured woods of all hues brought from the virgin forests of
                    the Brazils. The museum, the public library, containing over 80,000 volumes, the
                    barracks, the Da Miseracordia Hospital, and the opera-house are the other most
                    important public buildings. The Rua Nova dos In-glezes is the most frequented
                    street, and the Rua das Flores is one of the most interesting from the rich
                    display of gold-work, for which the town is famous, both in its shop windows as
                    well as—more characteristically and attractively—on the persons of the fishwomen
                    in their everyday garb. The Praça de San Ovidio, situated on the heights, and
                    laid out in terraces of flowers, deserves a visit from the traveller, while the
                    Largo da Torre da Marva is interesting as standing on the site of the ancient
                    Cale, from which the kingdom derives its name (Porto Cale). The chapel of Cedo
                    Feita, said to have been founded in 559 by the Visigothic king Theodomir (but
                    much more probably not till the 12th century), is very curious; the church of
                    Nossa Senhora da Lapa, a well-known landmark, is a handsome Corinthian edifice.
                    The city at one time had no less than 80 monasteries and chapels. The English
                    community maintain a chaplain and a doctor, and have a cemetery for their own
                    dead. Railways run from Oporto to Lisbon, and up the valley of the Douro to Pezo
                    da Regoa, and recently a junction has been made with the line through Spain to
                    Paris, whereby the long journey from Lisbon to that capital <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> Madrid is vastly shortened; a branch also runs to the frontier town of
                    Valença on the Minho. Oporto possesses good schools, a medical college with
                    numerous chairs, and a botanical garden. Several newspapers appear daily.</p>
                <p>The industries of Oporto are the most important and numerous in the kingdom,
                    employing about 6000 hands, the chief being paper, linen, wool, cotton, silk,
                    and gold manufactures, brocade, lace, glove, button, and pottery making. Oporto
                    is chiefly famous for the export of the wine which bears its name, of which the
                    great storehouses are on the south side of the river. The vines from which it is
                    made grow on the Alto Douro, a hilly and precipitous region lying about 60 miles
                    up the river, and having an area of 27 miles in length by 5 or 6 in breadth, cut
                    off from the sea, and shut in from the north-east by a range of mountains. The
                    trade was established in 1678, but the shipments for some years did not exceed
                    600 pipes (of 115 gallons each). In 1703 Lord Methven made a treaty with
                    Portugal, under which Portuguese wines were admitted on easier terms than those
                    of Gascony, and henceforward “port” began to be drunk. In 1747 the export
                    reached 17,000 pipes. In 1754 the great wine monopoly company of Oporto
                    originated, under which the shipments rose to 33,000 pipes. At the beginning of
                    the present century the policy of the Government more and more favoured port
                    wine, besides which the vintages from 1802 to 1815 were splendid both in
                    Portugal and in Madeira,—that of 1815 has, in fact, never been excelled. For the
                    next few years the grape crop was not at all good, but the 1820 vintage was the
                    most remarkable of any. It was singularly sweet and black, besides being equal
                    in quality to that of 1815. This henceforth became the standard taste and colour
                    for true port, and to keep up the vintage of following years to this exceptional
                    standard adulteration by elder-berries, syrup, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >jeropiga</hi> was resorted to. This practice did not long continue, for it was
                    cheaper to adulterate the best wines with inferior sorts of port wine itself.
                    There is scarcely a Portuguese wine, says Crawfurα, in skilful and intelligent
                    hands not capable of being made both sound and palatable without recourse to any
                    sort of adulteration. Port is now one of the purest wines. In 1852 the <hi
                    rend="italic">0idium</hi> which spread over Europe destroyed most of the
                    Portuguese vineyards. In 1867 the second monopoly company was abolished, and
                    since then the exports have been increasing till 1877, when the amount shipped
                    was 61,278 pipes, of which England absorbed 38,898. Since 1863 the total
                    exported has been 732,171 pipes (521,531 to England). In England port is
                    adulterated with the red Spanish wine of Tarragona, which is a true wine, but
                    procurable at half the cost of the cheapest port. The port wine duties are,
                    however, not oppressive, and, though the <hi rend="italic">Phylloxera</hi> has
                    produced great ravages, the trade is still very prosperous. Brand wines are
                    those made of different vintages blended together; “vintage” is a wine blended
                    by nature herself, and is of rare occurrence.</p>
                <p>Besides wine Oporto exports oranges (228,000,000 in 1878), onions, shipped as of
                    Spanish growth, and varying vastly in amount according to the season, and olives
                    (which go to Brazil alone, although they are cheaper and finer-flavoured when
                    truly ripe than those of any other country). An important trade is done in live
                    cattle. Portugal is one of the few countries never visited by the cattleplague.
                    They are sent to England as fat cattle, and are said to yield the finest grass -
                    fed beef admitted into the country. About 15,000 head were imported in 1878.
                    Feijδes or haricot (mostly the black, feijâo prêt) beans form a considerable
                    item of export to Brazil: 975,000 kilos were shipped in 1877. They are identical
                    with those from Sorrento, and are a little dearer, but of a distinctly finer
                    quality. Cork and sumach are also among the exporte. The imports are numerous:
                    codfish (bacalhâo), a national dish, uι immense quantities, as well as coals and
                    ore, are brought from Newfoundland, and cottons and yarns from Great Britain
                    (mostly), France, and Holland. Iron and steel goods were in 1877 imported from
                    England to the amount of 7,000,000 kilos, paying a 5 per cent. <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad valorem</hi> duty; in 1878, however, Sweden and Norway entered strongly into
                    competition. Coal is also imported from England, and costs the consumer in
                    Oporto twice its cost there. In 1878 of <pb break="no"

                    owing to the dangerous bar, comes into this port to call simply) 153 were
                    British.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of Oporto dates from an early
                    period. Before the Roman invasion, under the name of Gaia, or Cago, it was a
                    town with a good trade; the Alani subsequently founded a city on the opposite or
                    northern bank, calling it <hi rend="italic">Castrum Novum.</hi> About 540 A. D.
                    the Goths under Leovogild obtained possession of the northern district, who
                    yielded place in 716 to the Moors under Abdul Hassan, who then conquered the
                    whole of that region. The Christians, however, again gained possession by the
                    overthrow of the Moors, when it became the key of their position for the long
                    period during which the latter held sway in the southern provinces of Portugal.
                    The Moors once more became its masters for a short period, till in 1092 it was
                    brought by Dom Alfonso Frederico finally under Christian domination. The town is
                    renowned also in English military annals from the duke of Wellington’s famous
                    passage of the Douro in its immediate neighbourhood, close to where the fine
                    bridge of the northern railway now spans the river, by which he surprised and
                    put to flight Soult’s army, capturing the city on the 11th May 1809. It
                    sustained a severe siege in 1833 during the civil war headed by Dom Miguel, and
                    was bravely defended by Dorn Pedro with 7500 men, but with the loss of 16,000 of
                    its inhabitants.</p>
