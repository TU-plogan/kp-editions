                    applied. Those which are best known are met with in the central and eastern
                    portions of the Great Sahara and in the Libyan Desert. In that region they
                    consist generally of deep depressions or valleys, locally termed “wâdis,” where
                    the water comes to the surface in natural springs, or where it may be procured
                    by sinking wells. Under the influence of these beneficent springs vegetation
                    bursts forth and covers a more or less extensive area, which becomes a
                    halting-place for travellers in the desert, and frequently supports a
                    considerable population. Many of the oases are situated in the mountainous
                    regions, where the ground is sufficiently elevated to precipitate the moisture
                    in the atmosphere. The rain which falls, however, is rapidly absorbed by the
                    rocks or sandy soil, and much of it collects in depressions at no great depth
                    from the surface. The Arabs have long been in the habit of tapping these
                    subterranean waters by sinking wells, a copious supply being usually obtained at
                    depths varying down to 200 fathoms. Indeed, so rapidly does the water ascend
                    when the aqueous strata are pierced in certain localities that the well-sinkers
                    are sometimes suffocated ere they reach the surface. In the Algerian Sahara a
                    large number of artesian wells have been sunk by the French, resulting in the
                    formation of oases, which have to some extent affected the habits of the native
                    tribes by inducing them to become cultivators of these fertile tracts. It is
                    evident, therefore, that, notwithstanding the arid climate which prevails
                    generally throughout the African deserts, a tolerably plentiful supply of water
                    can be obtained by artificial means at various points. The springs, being
                    essential to the very existence of the oases, are naturally guarded with care so
                    as to prevent the sands encroaching on them. Should they cease to flow, the
                    decay of the vegetation rapidly ensues and the oases disappear. Another
                    characteristic feature of these fertile tracts is the palm-tree forests, which
                    are admirably adapted to such unfavourable conditions. The date and the dûm palm
                    are the commonest species met with in the forests; they are highly prized by
                    reason of the produce which they yield to the cultivators of the soil and the
                    shelter which they afford from the scorching sun. Indeed, so serviceable are
                    they that in some cases the Arabs artificially create an oasis with the aid of a
                    few palm trees by digging holes deep enough to allow the roots to pierce the
                    aqueous strata.</p>
                <p>From the accounts given by various travellers it would appear that, while the
                    larger oases cover extensive tracts, the smaller ones are liable to be effaced
                    by drifting sand. As an example of one of the largest, Air or Asben may be
                    mentioned, which measures 180 miles from north to south. Such extensive fertile
                    tracts are dotted over with villages, whose inhabitants carry on the cultivation
                    of the soil and export various articles of produce. By means of irrigation
                    different cereals are successfully cultivated, such as barley, rice, and
                    millet.</p>
                <p>In the western Sahara the chief oases are :—(1) Tuât, about 1000 miles to the
                    south-west of Tripoli, the principal town being In-sâlah ('Ain Salah); (2)
                    Taudeni, south-west of Tuât; (3) 'Arawân, south of Taudeni and north of
                    Timbuktu; and (4) Wâlata, southwest of 'Arawân. In the eastern portion of the
                    Great Desert the important oases are :—(1) Fezzân, the capital of which is
                    Morzιik, lying to the south-south-east of Tripoli; (2) Ghadâmes, north-west of
                    Fezzân; (3) Tibesti, south of Fezzân; (4) Bilma,west-south-west of Tibesti; and
                    (5) Air or Asben, west from Bilma and north-west from Lake Tchad. The last is
                    perhaps one of the most remarkable oases in the African desert, forming a
                    tableland whose average elevation is 2000 feet, with peaks rising to a height of
                    5000 feet. Heavy tropical rains are precipitated by this lofty plateau, and
                    hence the valleys are clothed with vegetation. This oasis is richly cultivated,
                    producing barley, maize, and millet. The capital is Agades, a town with 7000
                    inhabitants, which is situated on the caravan route between Morzιik and Sokoto,
                    and constitutes one of the important centres of trade in central Africa. _ , , .

                <p>In the Libyan Desert the chief oases are :—(1) Khargeh or Kharιja (the outer
                    oases), sometimes termed the <hi rend="italic">oasis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magna,</hi> about 120 miles to the west of Thebes; (2) Dakhel or Dâkhila (the
                    inner oases), situated to the west of Khargeh; (3) Farafreh (Farafira),
                    north-west of Dakhel; (4) Bahriya (northern), to the north of Farafreh; (5) Siwa
                    (the famous oasis of Jupiter Ammon), at the northern limits of the Libyan
                    Desert; and (6) the Kufra group, smith-west of Siwa. Perhaps the most fertile of
                    these tracts is Dakhel, which was first made known to Europeans in 1819 by Sir
                    A. Edmonstone. The chief produce consists of dates, rice, olives, and apricots,
                    but durra, barley, lemons, citrons, and figs also grow on the rich sou of this
                    oasis. It contains eleven villages, the total population being estimated at
                    6000. . ...</p>
                <p>Similar fertile tracts, though of smaller extent, occur in Arabia and in that
