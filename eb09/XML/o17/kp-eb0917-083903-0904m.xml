                    rend="italic">-c.</hi> 254). Of all the theologians of the ancient church, with
                    the possible exception of Augustine, Origen is the most distinguished and the
                    most influential. He is the father of the church’s science; he is the founder of
                    a theology which was brought to perfection in the 4th and 5th centuries, and
                    which still retained the stamp of his genius when in the 6th century it disowned
                    its author. It was Origen who created the dogmatic of the church and laid the
                    foundations of the scientific criticism of the Old and New Testaments. He could
                    not have been what he was unless two generations before him had laboured at the
                    problem of finding an intellectual expression and a philosophic basis for
                    Christianity (Justin, Tatian, Athenagoras, Pantaenus, Clement). But their
                    attempts, in comparison with his, are like a schoolboy’s essays beside the
                    finished work of a master. Like all great epoch-making personalities, he was
                    favoured by the circumstances of his life, notwithstanding the relentless
                    persecution to which he was exposed. He lived in a time when the Christian
                    communities enjoyed almost uninterrupted peace and held an acknowledged position
                    in the world. By proclaiming the reconciliation of science with the Christian
                    faith, of the highest culture with the gospel, Origen did more than any other
                    man to win the Old World to the Christian religion. But he entered into no
                    diplomatic compromises; it was his deepest and most solemn conviction that the
                    sacred oracles of Christendom embraced all the ideals of antiquity. His
                    character was as transparent as his life was blameless; there are few church
                    fathers whose biography leaves so pure an impression on the reader. The
                    atmosphere around him was a dangerous one for a philosopher and theologian to
                    breathe, but he kept his spiritual health unimpaired, and even his sense of
                    truth suffered less injury than was the case with most of his contemporaries. To
                    us, indeed, his conception of the universe, like that of Philo, seems a strange
                    medley, and one may be at a loss to conceive how he could bring together such
                    heterogeneous elements; but there is no reason to doubt that the harmony of all
                    the essential parts of his system was obvious enough to himself. It is true that
                    in addressing the Christian people he used different language from that which he
                    employed to the cultured; but there was no dissimulation in that,—on the
                    contrary, it was a requirement of his system. Orthodox theology has never, in
                    any of the confessions, ventured beyond the circle which the mind of Origen
                    first measured out. It has suspected and amended its author, it has expunged his
                    heresies; but whether it has put anything better or more tenable in their place
                    may be gravely questioned.</p>
                <p>Origen was born, perhaps at Alexandria, of Christian parents in the year 185 or
                    186. As a boy he showed evidence of remarkable talents, and his father Leonidas
                    gave him an excellent education. At a very early age, about the year 200, he
                    listened to the lectures of Pantaenus and Clement in the catechetical school.
                    This school, of which the origin is unknown, was the first and for a long time
                    the only institution where Christians were instructed simultaneously in the
                    Greek sciences and the doctrines of the Holy Scriptures. Alexandria had been,
                    since the days of the Ptolemies, a centre for the interchange of ideas between
                    East and West—between Egypt, Syria, Greece, and Italy; and, as it had furnished
                    Judaism with an Hellenic philosophy, so it also brought about the alliance of
                    Christianity with Greek philosophy. Asia Minor and the West developed the strict
                    ecclesiastical forms by means of which the church closed her lines against
                    heathenism, and especially against heresy; in Alexandria Christian ideas were
                    handled in a free and speculative fashion and worked out with the help of Greek
                    philosophy. Till near the end of the 2d century the line between heresy and
                    orthodoxy was less rigidly drawn there than at Ephesus, Lyons, Rome, or
                    Carthage. In the year 202 a persecution arose, in which the father of Origen
                    became a martyr, and the family lost their livelihood. Origen, who had
                    distinguished himself by his intrepid zeal, was supported for a time by a lady
                    of rank, but began about the same time to earn his bread by teaching; and in 203
                    he was placed, with the sanction of the bishop Demetrius, at the head of the
                    catechetical school. Even then his attainments in the whole circle of the
                    sciences were extraordinary. But the spirit of investigation impelled him to
                    devote himself to the highest studies, philosophy and the exegesis of the Sacred
                    Scriptures. With indomitable perseverance he applied <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n905/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0905-0840"/> himself to these subjects; although himself a
                    teacher, he regularly attended the lectures of Ammonius Saccas, and made a
                    thorough study of the books of Plato and Numenius, of the Stoics and the
                    Pythagoreans. At the same time he endeavoured to acquire a knowledge of Hebrew,
                    in order to be able to read the Old Testament in the original. His manner of
                    life was ascetic; the sayings of the Sermon on the Mount and the practical
                    maxims of the Stoics were his guiding stars. Four oboli a day, earned by copying
                    manuscripts, sufficed for his bodily sustenance. A rash resolve led him to
                    mutilate himself that he might escape from the lusts of the flesh, and work
                    unhindered in the instruction of the female sex. This step he afterwards
                    regretted. As the attendance at his classes continually increased—pagans
                    thronging to him as well as Christians —he handed over the beginners to his
                    friend Heraclas, and took charge of the more advanced pupils himself. Meanwhile
                    the literary activity of Origen was increasing year by year. He commenced his
                    great work on the textual criticism of the Scriptures; and at the instigation of
                    his friend Ambrosius, who provided him with the necessary amanuenses, he
                    published his commentaries on the Old Testament and his dogmatic investigations.
                    In this manner he laboured at Alexandria for twenty-eight years (till 231-232).
                    This period, however, was broken by many journeys, undertaken partly for
                    scientific and partly for ecclesiastical objects. We know that he was in Rome in
                    the time of Zephyrinus, again in Arabia, where a Roman official wanted to hear
                    his lectures, and in Antioch, in response to a most flattering invitation from
                    Julia Mammaea (mother of Alexander Severus, afterwards emperor), who wished to
                    become acquainted with his philosophy. In the year 216—the time when the
                    imperial executioners were ravaging Alexandria—we find Origen in Palestine.
                    There the bishops of Jerusalem and Caesarea received him in the most friendly
                    manner, and got him to deliver public lectures in the churches. In the East,
                    especially in Asia Minor, it was still no unusual thing for laymen, with
                    permission of the bishop, to address the people in the church. In Alexandria,
                    however, this custom had been given up, and Demetrius took occasion to express
                    his disapproval and recall Origen to Alexandria. Probably the bishop was jealous
                    of the high reputation of the teacher; and a coolness arose between them which
                    led, fifteen years later, to an open rupture. On his way to Greece (apparently
                    in the year 230) Origen was ordained a presbyter in Palestine by his friends the
                    bishops. This was undoubtedly an infringement of the rights of the Alexandrian
                    bishop; at the same time it was simply a piece of spite on the part of the
                    latter that had kept Origen so long without any ecclesiastical consecration.
                    Demetrius convened a synod, at which it was resolved to banish Origen from
                    Alexandria. Even this did not satisfy his displeasurè. A second synod, composed
                    entirely of bishops, determined that Origen must be deposed frôm the
                    presbyterial status. This decision was communicated to the foreign churches, and
                    seems to have been justified by referring to the self-mutilation of Origen and
                    adducing objectionable doctrines which he was said to have promulgated. The
                    details of the incident are, however, unfortunately very obscure. No formal
                    excommunication of Origen appears to have been decreed; it was considered
                    sufficient to have him degraded to the position of a layman. The sentence was
                    approved by most of the churches, in particular by that of Rome. At a later
                    period Origen sought to vindicate his teaching in a letter to the Roman bishop
                    Fabian, but, it would seem, without success. Even Heraclas, his former friend
                    and sharer of his views, took part against him; and by this means he procured
                    his own election shortly afterwards as successor to Demetrius.</p>
                <p>In these circumstances Origen thought it best voluntarily to retire from
                    Alexandria (231-232). He betook himself to Palestine, where his condemnation had
                    not been acknowledged by the churches any more than it had been in Phoenicia,
                    Arabia, and Achaia. He settled in Caesarea, and very shortly he had a
                    flourishing school there, whose reputation rivalled that of Alexandria. His
                    literary work, too, was prosecuted with unabated vigour. Enthusiastic pupils sat
                    at his feet (see the <hi rend="italic">Panegyric</hi> of Gregory Thaumaturgus),
                    and the methodical instruction which he imparted in all branches of knowledge
                    was famous all over the East. Here again his activity as a teacher was
                    interrupted by frequent journeys. Thus he was for two years together at Caesarea
                    in Cappadocia, where he was overtaken by the Maximinian persecution; here he
                    worked at his recension of the Bible. We find him again in Nicomedia, in Athens,
                    and twice in Arabia. He was called there to combat the Unitarian christology of
                    Beryllus, bishop of Bostra, and to clear up certain eschatological questions. As
                    he had formerly had dealings with the house of Alexander Severus, so now he
                    entered into a correspondence with the emperor Philip the Arabian and his wife
                    Severa. But through all situations of his life he preserved his equanimity, his
                    keen interest in science, and his indefatigable zeal for the instruction of
                    others. In the year 250 the Decian persecution broke out, Origen was arrested,
                    imprisoned, and maltreated. But he survived these troubles—it is a malicious
                    invention that he recanted during the persecution—and lived a few years longer
                    in active intercourse with his friends. He died, probably in the year 254
                    (consequently under Valerian), at Tyre, where his grave was still shown in the
                    Middle Ages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Writings.—</hi> Origen is probably the most prolific author of
                    the ancient church. “Which of us,” asks Jerome, “can read all that he has
                    written ?” The number of his works was estimated at 6000, but that is certainly
                    an exaggeration. Owing to the increasing unpopularity of Origen in the church, a
                    comparatively small portion of these works have come down to us in the original.
                    We have more in the Latin translation of Rufinus; but this translation is by no
                    means trustworthy, since Rufinus, assuming that Origen’s writings had been
                    tampered with by the heretics, considered himself at liberty to omit or amend
                    heterodox statements. Origen’s real opinion, however, may frequently be gathered
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Philocalia</hi><hi rend="italic">—Ά,</hi> sort of
                    anthology from his works prepared by Basil the Great and Gregory Nazi-anzenus.
                    The fragments in Photius and in the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> of Pamphilus
                    serve for comparison. The writings of Origen consist of letters, and of works in
                    textual criticism, exegesis, apologetics, dogmatic and practical theology.</p>
                <p>(1) Eusebius collected more than a hundred of Origen’s letters, arranged them in
                    books, and deposited them in the library at Caesarea (7/. <hi rend="italic"
                    >E.,</hi> vi. 36). In the church library at Jerusalem (founded by the bishop
                    Alexander) there were also numerous letters of this father (Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vi. 20). But unfortunately they have all been lost
                    except two,— one to Julius Africanus (about the history of Susanna) and one to
                    Gregory Thaumaturgus. There are, besides, a couple of fragments.</p>
                <p>(2) Origen's textual studies on the Old Testament were undertaken partly in order
                    to improve the manuscript tradition, and partly for apologetic reasons, to clear
                    up the relation between the LXX. and the original Hebrew text. The results of
                    more than twenty years’ labour were set forth in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hexapla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tetrapla,</hi> in which he placed the Hebrew
                    text side by side with the various Greek versions, examined their mutual
                    relations in detail, and tried to find the basis for a more reliable text of the
                    LXX. The <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi> was probably never fully written out,
                    but excerpts were made from it by various scholars at Caesarea in the 4th
                    century; and thus large sections of it have been <pb break="no"

                    although he produced no recension of his own.</p>
                <p>(3) The exegetical labours of Origen extend over the whole of the Old and New
                    Testaments. They are divided into <hi rend="italic">Scholia (σημeιωσeις,</hi>
                    short annotations, mostly grammatical), <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi>
                    (edifying expositions grounded on exegesis), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries</hi><hi rend="italic">(τόμοι).</hi> In the Greek original only a
                    very small portion has been preserved; in Latin translations, however, a good
                    deal. The most important parts are the homilies on Jeremiah, the books of Moses,
                    Joshua, and Luke, and the commentaries on Matthew, John, and Romans. With
                    grammatical precision, antiquarian learning, and critical discernment Origen
                    combines the allegorical method of interpretation—the logical corollary of his
                    conception of the inspiration of the Scriptures. He distinguishes a threefold
                    sense of scripture, a grammatico-historical, a moral, and a pneumatic,—the last
                    being the proper and highest sense. He thus set up a formal theory of
                    allegorical exegesis, which is not quite extinct in the churches even yet, but
                    in his own system was of fundamental importance. On this method the sacred
                    writings are regarded as an inexhaustible mine of philosophical and dogmatic
                    wisdom; in reality the exegete reads his own ideas into any passage he chooses.
                    The commentaries are of course intolerably diffuse and tedious, a great deal of
                    them is now quite unreadable; yet, on the other hand, one has not unfrequently
                    occasion to admire the sound linguistic perception and the critical talent of
                    the author.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Reuss,

                <p>(4) The principal apologetic work of Origen is his book κατά K∈λσ^oυ (eight
                    books), written at Caesarea in the time of Philip the Arabian. It has been
                    completely preserved in the original. This work is invaluable as a source for
                    the history and situation of the church in the 2d century; <hi rend="italic"
                    >for</hi> it contains nearly the whole of the famous work of Celsus (Λόγο? <hi
                    rend="italic">αληθής)</hi> against Christianity. What makes Origen’s answer so
                    instructive is that it shows how close an affinity existed between Celsus and
                    himself in their fundamental philosophical and theological presuppositions. The
                    real state of the case is certainly unsuspected by Origen himself; but many of
                    his opponent’s arguments he is unable to meet except by a speculative
                    reconstruction of the church doctrine in question. Origen’s apologetic is most
                    effective when he appeals to the spirit and power of Christianity as an evidence
                    of its truth. In details his argument is not free from sophistical subterfuges
                    and superficial reasoning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Doctrines). This work, which was composed before 228, is the first attempt at a
                    dogmatic at once scientific and accommodated, to the needs of the church. The
                    material is drawn from Scripture, but in such a way that the propositions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">regula fidei</hi> are respected. This material is then formed
                    into a system by all the resources of the intellect and of speculation. Origen
                    thus solved, after his own fashion, a problem which his predecessor Clement had
                    not even ventured to grapple with. The first three books treat of God, the
                    world, the fall of spirits, anthropology, and ethics. “Each of these three books
                    really embraces, although not in a strictly comprehensive way, the whole scheme
                    of the Christian view of the world, from different points of view, and with
                    different contents.” The fourth book explains the divinity of the Scriptures,
                    and deduces rules for their interpretation. It ought properly to stand as first
                    book at the beginning. The ten books of <hi rend="italic">Stromata</hi> (in
                    which Origen compared the teaching of the Christians with that of the
                    philosophers, and corroborated all the Christian dogmas from Plato, Aristotle,
                    Numenius, and Cornutus) have all perished, with the exception of small
                    fragments; so have the tractates on the resurrection and on freewill.<note

                    life and his relation to the faith of the church these two treatises are of
                    great importance. The first was written during the persecution of Maximinus
                    Thrax, and was dedicated to his friends Ambrosius and Protoctetus. The other
                    also dates from the Caesarean period; it mentions many interesting details, and
                    concludes with a fine exposition of the Lord’s Prayer.</p>
                <p>(7) In his own lifetime Origen had to complain of falsifications of his works and
                    forgeries under his name. Many pieces still in existence are wrongly ascribed to
                    him; yet it is doubtful whether a single one of them was composed on purpose to
                    deceive. The most noteworthy are the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> of a

                    unmistakably the stamp both of Neo-Platonism and of Gnosticism. As a theologian,
                    in fact, Origen is not merely an orthodox traditionalist and believing exegete
                    but a speculative philosopher of NeoPlatonic tendencies. He is, moreover, a
                    judicious critic. The union of these four elements gives character to his
                    theology, and in a certain degree to all subsequent theology. It is this
                    combination w*hich has determined the peculiar and varying relations in which
                    theology and the faith of the church have stood to each other since the time of
                    Origen. That relation depends on the predominance of one or other of the four
                    factors embraced in his theology.</p>
                <p>As an orthodox traditionalist Origen holds that Christianity is a practical and
                    religious saving principle, that it has unfolded itself in an historical series
                    of revealing facts, that the church has accurately embodied the substance of her
                    faith in the <hi rend="italic">regula fidei,</hi> and that simple faith is
                    sufficient for the renewal and salvation of man. As a philosophical idealist,
                    however, he transmutes the whole contents of the faith of the church into ideas
                    which bear the mark of Neo-Platonism, and were accordingly recognized by the
                    later Neo-Platonists as Hellenic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Porphyry says of Origen, <hi rend="italic">κατά</hi><hi

                    ecstatic element is held in abeyance. The ethico-religious ideal is the
                    sorrowless condition, the state of superiority to all evils, the state of order
                    and of rest. In this condition man enters into likeness to God and blessedness;
                    and it is reached through contemplative isolation and self-knowledge, which is
                    divine wisdom. “The soul is trained as it were to behold itself in a mirror, it
                    shows the divine spirit, if it should be found worthy of such »fellowship, as in
                    a mirror, and thus discovers the traces of a secret path to participation in the
                    divine nature.” As a means to the realization of this ideal, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n907/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0907-0842"/> Origen introduces the whole ethics of Stoicism.
                    But the link that connects him with churchly realism, as well as with the
                    Neo-Platonic mysticism, is the conviction that complete and certain knowledge
                    rests wholly on divine revelation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on oracles.
                    Consequently his theology is cosmological speculation and ethical reflexion
                    based on the Sacred Scriptures. The Scriptures, however, are treated by Origen
                    on the basis of a matured theory of inspiration in such a way that all their
                    facts appear as the vehicles of ideas, and have their highest value only in this
                    aspect. That is to say, his gnosis neutralizes all that is empirical and
                    historical, if not always as to its actuality, at least absolutely in respect of
                    its value. The most convincing proof of this is that Origen (1) takes the idea
                    of the immutability of God as the regulating idea of his system, and (2)
                    deprives the historical “Word made flesh” of all significance for the true
                    Gnostic. To him Christ appears simply as the Logos who is with the Father from
                    eternity, and works from all eternity, to whom alone the instructed Christian
                    directs his thoughts, requiring nothing more than a perfect— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> divine—teacher. In such propositions historical Christianity is
                    stripped off as a mere husk. The objects of religious knowledge are beyond the
                    plane of history, or rather—in a thoroughly Gnostic and Neo-Platonic spirit—they
                    are regarded as belonging to a supramundane history. On this view contact with
                    the faith of the church could only be maintained by distinguishing an exoteric
                    and an esoteric form of Christianity. This distinction was already current in
                    the catechetical school of Alexandria, but Origen gave it its boldest
                    expression, and justified it on the ground of the incapacity of the Christian
                    masses to grasp the deeper sense of Scripture, or unravel the difficulties of
                    exegesis. On the other hand, in dealing with the problem of bringing his
                    heterodox system into conformity with the <hi rend="italic">regula fidei</hi> he
                    evinced a high degree of technical skill. An external conformity was possible
                    inasmuch as speculation, proceeding from the higher to the lower, could keep by
                    the stages of the <hi rend="italic">regula fidei,</hi> which had been developed
                    into a history of salvation. The system itself aims in principle at being
                    thoroughly monistic; but, since matter, although created by God out of nothing,
                    was regarded merely as the sphere in which souls are punished and purified, the
                    system is pervaded by a strongly dualistic element. The immutability of God
                    requires the eternity of the Logos and of the world. At this point Origen
                    succeeded in avoiding the heretical Gnostic idea of God by assigning to the
                    Godhead the attributes of goodness and righteousness. The preexistence of souls
                    is another inference from the immutability of God, although Origen also deduced
                    it from the nature of the soul, which as a spiritual potency must be eternal.
                    Indeed this is the fundamental idea of Origen— “the original and indestructible
                    unity of God and all spiritual essences.” From this follows the necessity for
                    the created spirit, after apostacy, error, and sin, to return always to its
                    origin in God. The actual sinfulness of all men Origen was able to explain by
                    the theological hypothesis of pre-existence and the premundane fall of each
                    individual soul. He holds that freedom is the inalienable prerogative of the
                    finite spirit; and this is the second point that distinguishes his theology from
                    the heretical Gnosticism. The system unfolds itself like a drama, of which the
                    successive stages are as follows;—the transcendental fall, the creation of the
                    material world, inaugurating the history, of punishment and redemption, the
                    clothing of fallen souls in flesh, the dominion of sin, evil, and the demons on
                    earth, the appearing of the Logos, His union with a pure human soul, His
                    esoteric preaching of salvation, and His death in the flesh, then the imparting
                    of the Spirit, and the ultimate restoration of all things. The doctrine of the
                    restoration appeared necessary because the spirit, in spite of its inherent
                    freedom, cannot lose its true nature, and because the final purposes of God
                    cannot be foiled. The end, however, is only relative, for spirits are
                    continually falling, and God remains through eternity the creator of the world.
                    Moreover, the end is not conceived as a transfiguration of the world, but as a
                    liberation of the spirit from its unnatural union with the sensual. Here the
                    Gnostic and philosophical character of the system is particularly manifest. The
                    old Christian eschatology is set aside; no one has dealt such deadly blows to
                    Chiliasm and Christian apocalypticism as Origen. It need hardly be said that he
                    spiritualized the church doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh. But, while
                    in all these doctrines he appears in the character of a Platonic philosopher,
                    traces of rational criticism are not wanting. Where his fundamental conception
                    admits of it, he tries to solve historical problems by historical methods. Even
                    in the christology, where he is treating of the historical Christ, he entertains
                    critical considerations; hence it is not altogether without reason that in after
                    times he was suspected of “Ebionitic” views of the Person of Christ. Not
                    unfrequently he represents the unity of the Father and the Son as a unity of
                    agreement and harmony and “identity of will.”</p>
                <p>Although the theology of Origen exerted a considerable influence as a whole in
                    the two following centuries, it certainly lost nothing by the circumstance that
                    several important propositions were capable of being torn from their original
                    setting and placed in new connexions. It is in fact one of the peculiarities of
                    this theology, which professed to be at once churchly and philosophical, that
                    most of its formulae could be interpreted and appreciated <hi rend="italic">in
                    utramque partem.</hi> By arbitrary divisions and rearrangements the doctrinal
                    statements of this “science of faith” could be made to serve the most diverse
                    dogmatic tendencies. This is seen especially in the doctrine of the Logos. On
                    the basis of his idea of God Origen was obliged to insist in the strongest
                    manner on the personality, the eternity (eternal generation), and the essential
                    divinity of the Logos.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    consider the origin of the Logos he did not hesitate to speak of Him as a <hi

                    spiritual creatures. A <hi rend="italic">κτiσμa,</hi> which is at the same time
                    <hi rend="italic">opoovcrLov</hi> τω θeω, was no contradiction to him, simply
                    because he held the immutability, the pure knowledge, and the blessedness which
                    constituted the divine nature to be communicable attributes. In later times both
                    the orthodox and the Arians appealed to his teaching, both with a certain
                    plausibility; but the inference of Arius, that an imparted divinity must be
                    divinity in the second degree, Origen did not draw. With respect to other
                    doctrines also, such as those of the Holy Spirit and the incarnation of Christ,
                    &lt;fcc., Origen prepared the way for the later dogmas. The technical terms
                    round which such bitter controversies raged in the 4th and 5th centuries are
                    often found in Origen lying peacefully side by side. But this is just where his
                    epoch-making importance lies, that all the later parties in the church learned
                    from him. And this is true not only of the dogmatic parties; solitary monks and
                    ambitious priests, hard-headed critical exegetes,<note anchored="true"

                    during the time of the fierce Arian controversy. It was not so much the relation
                    between pistis and gnosis—faith and knowledge—as defined by Origen that gave
                    offence, but rather isolated propositions, such as his doctrines of the
                    preexistence of souls, of the soul and body of Christ, of the resurrection of
                    the flesh, of the final restoration, and of the plurality of worlds. Even in the
                    3d century Origen’s view of the Trinity and of the Person of Christ was called
                    in question, and that from various points of view. It was not till the 5th
                    century, however, that objections of this kind became frequent. In the 4th
                    century Pamphilus, Eusebius of Caesarea, Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Didymus,
                    and Rufinus were on the side of Origen against the attacks of Methodius and many
                    others. But, when the zeal of Epiphanius was kindled against him, when Jerome,
                    alarmed about his own reputation, and in defiance of his past attitude, turned
                    against his once honoured teacher, and Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria,
                    found it prudent, for political reasons, and out of consideration for the
                    uneducated monks, to condemn Origen,—then his authority received a shock from
                    which it never recovered. There were, doubtless, in the 5th century church
                    historians and theologians who still spoke of him with reverence, but such men
                    became fewer and fewer. In the West Vincent of Lerins held up Origen as a
                    warning example <hi rend="italic">(Commonit.,</hi> 23), showing how even the
                    most learned and most eminent of church teachers might become a misleading
                    light. In the East the exegetical school of Antioch had an aversion to Origen;
                    the Alexandrians had utterly repudiated him. Nevertheless his writings were much
                    read, especially in Palestine. The monophysite monks appealed to his authority,
                    but could not prevent Justinian and the fifth oecumenical council at
                    Constantinople (553) from anathematizing the teaching of Origen. It is true that
                    many scholars <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Hefele, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conciliengesch.,</hi> ii. p. 858 «&lt;?.) deny that Origen was condemned by
                    this council; but Möller rightly holds that the condemnation is proved <hi

                    edition is that of Car. and C. Vine. Delarue, 4 vols, fol., Paris,
                    1733-59,—reprinted by Lommatzsch, 25 vols. 8vo, Berlin, 1831-48, and by Migne,

                    new pieces have been edited by Gallandi and A. Mai. Amongst the older works on
                    Origen those of Huetius (printed in Delarue, vol. iv ) are the best; but

                    deserve to be mentioned. In recent times the doctrine of Origen has been
                    expounded in the great works on church history by Baur, Dorner, Böhringer,
