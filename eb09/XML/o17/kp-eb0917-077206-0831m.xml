                    controlling mind was John H. Noyes, who in 1834, while a student and licentiate
                    of the theological seminary of Yale College, was led by his study of the New
                    Testament to believe that the gospel of Christ, when fully accepted, secures
                    present salvation from sin, and that the second coming of Christ, instead of
                    being a future event, took place, according to promise, within a single
                    generation of His first coming. Other religious doctrines at variance with
                    popular theology were developed by Mr Noyes, such as that God is a dual being,
                    Father and Son; that God is in no sense responsible for the existence of evil,
                    but that the author of evil, as the author of good, was uncreated; that, the
                    second coming of Christ being past, we are now living in a new dispensation of
                    grace; that personal spiritual communication with Christ and His risen church is
                    possible, and when perfected secures salvation from all evil, including disease
                    and death itself.</p>
                <p>These doctrines found their practical expression in a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0832-0773"/> social system of pure communism. In the Oneida
                    Community, founded in 1848, “not one said that aught of the things which he
                    possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.” The Community was a
                    large family or brotherhood, numbering at one time over three hundred members,
                    the common bond being paramount. The children were regarded as belonging
                    primarily to the Community; and it was a favourite theory, which they made some
                    attempts to realize, that children should be begotten and reared only under the
                    best conditions. So far as their experiments in this direction extended, the
                    results, they claimed, justified their theories, and they adduced in
                    confirmation the testimony of critical observers like Professor Goldwin Smith,
                    who wrote after a visit to the Community as follows :—</p>
                <p>“Undeniably, they are a fine, healthy-looking, merry set of children. They are
                    reared under conditions of exceptional advantage, which could not fail to secure
                    health to'the offspring of any but positively diseased parents. The nurseries,
                    with everything about them, are beautiful. Large playrooms are provided for
                    exercise in winter. The nurses are not hirelings, but members of the Community
                    who voluntarily undertake the office. Every precaution is taken against the
                    danger of infection. A simple and wholesome dietary is enforced, and no mother
                    or grandmother is permitted to ruin digestion and temper by administering first
                    a poison from the confectioner’s and then another poison from the
                    druggist’s.”</p>
                <p>But, while the Oneida Communists extended the pentecostal principle to all social
                    relations, they yet maintained strict order among themselves. The thousands of
                    visitors who annually inspected their dwellings and factories, and admired their
                    lawns and gardens, discovered none of the usual signs of lax social morality.
                    Credit for this is unquestionably due in part to the strong personal influence
                    of Mr Noyes, but credit is also due to the members for voluntarily subjecting
                    themselves to a system of self-control in the intercourse of the sexes called
                    “male continence,” and to “mutual criticism,” which last was in fact exalted
                    into their principal means of government. The system is one of plain
                    truth-telling, and was termed “mutual” because it was expected that all, or
                    nearly all, would alternate as critic and subject. Sometimes persons were
                    criticized by a standing committee selected for the purpose by the Community,
                    sometimes by committees of their own selection, sometimes by the whole
                    Community. The critics were expected in all cases to speak the truth without
                    fear or favour, that the subject might see himself, whatever his faults or
                    virtues, as others saw him.</p>
                <p>Radical as its theories and practices were, the Oneida Community was able to
                    conduct its experiment with much success for thirty years. About that time
                    public opinion, aroused by the clergy of the surrounding region, demanded that
                    its social practices should be abandoned; and this was accordingly done in 1879,
                    under the counsel of its founder and president, Mr Noyes, who had many times
                    previously expressed his willingness to conform to the wishes of the public
                    respecting the practical assertion of his social principles. This important
                    change led to other changes in the society, including the introduction of
                    marriage and family life; and in 1880 communism of property gave place to
                    joint-stock, and the Community was legally incorporated as the Oneida Community,
                    Limited. Each member now has a separate individual interest represented by
                    shares of stock, in place of the undivided interest he formerly had in the
                    common property. These changes were so wisely managed that the complex
                    manufacturing and commercial businesses of the society were not seriously
                    disturbed. In the division of the property of the Community, prior to its
                    reorganization into a joint-stock company, a guarantee of support was first
                    offered to all elderly and infirm persons in lieu of stock; secondly, a
                    guarantee was pledged for the support and education of the children of the
                    Community till sixteen years of age; thirdly, labour in the new company was
                    guaranteed to all members of the old society; fourthly, some co-operative
                    features were preserved, such as common dwellings and lawns, a common laundry,
                    library, reading-room, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Although the Oneida Community was started with very limited capital (the
                    inventoried valuation of its property in 1857 being only 867,000), and hard work
                    and poor fare were the lot of its members for many years, yet industry and
                    business integrity brought their usual rewards, and upon the reorganization the
                    members were able to divide 8600,000. The last annual report of the Oneida
                    Community, Limited, filed with the secretary of state at Albany, New York, shows
                    that its assets, 1st January 1884, were 8785,656,—a sum covering, not only its
                    capital stock of 8600,000, but a surplus fund of 824,050, and all liabilities
                    against the company.</p>
                <p>The Oneida Community, Limited, owns water-powers and factories at Wallingford,
                    Connecticut, and Niagara Falls, New York, as well as at Community, New York; but
                    its business is principally carried on at the two places last named. At
                    Wallingford there existed, previous to the reorganization, a branch community,
                    varying from thirty to sixty members, and having a common interest in the parent
                    society,—both men and means being transferred from one society to the other as
                    occasion required.</p>
                <p>The Oneida Community has been often described by writers not connected with the
                    society, the most noteworthy being Colonel T. W. Higginson, Professor Goldwin
                    Smith, Charles Nordhoff in <hi rend="italic">Communistic Societies of the United
                    States,</hi> and William H. Dixon in <hi rend="italic">New America.</hi> The
                    Community also published many pamphlets and larger works in exposition of its
                    principles and social life, and a newspaper during its entire career of thirty
                    years. These may be consulted in several of the public libraries of the United
                    States, and also in the British Museum, which has a complete set of the
                    publications of the Oneida Community. The following list includes the more
                    important books and pamphlets :— <hi rend="italic">History of American
                    Socialisms,</hi> by John H. Noyes, 1870; <hi rend="italic">Berean, Home-Talks,

                    centuries before by colonists of the Bani Khâlid). These new places were in the
                    circuit of the old Bani Tamim towns destroyed by the sword of Khâlid b. Walid,
                    whose sites are now named Al- <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> Eyaria (Manzil
                    Εyar) and Al-Owshazia. Colonists of the Kaisite stock of Sbeya Arabs were the
                    first builders of Oneiza, and the emirs of the township are still of this blood.
                    After them came in colonists of the Tamim, who now form the chief element in the
                    population. The old faction warfare between the villages Jennah and Oneiza was
                    incessant, and the Bani Khâlid had the greatest name in Nejd till the rise of
                    the Wahhâbite power. Jennah then made alliance with the Montefi⅛ Arabs in the
                    north; Oneiza sided with the Wahhâbites, and, these soon overrunning all, a part
                    of the Jennah villagers abandoned their country, and went to live in
                    Mesopotamia, and the rest came in to inhabit Oneiza. The site of their old
                    village is now in the orchards of Oneiza, enclosed by the common town-wall.</p>
                <p>Oneiza is built upon an old <hi rend="italic">seil</hi> (freshet) strand (2600
                    feet above sea-level), and has been sometimes damaged by floods; the houses are
                    of clay; the population, greatly increased, as Mr Doughty was told, in the
                    fifteen years preceding his visit, was computed by him at nearly 7000. The site
                    is near the great Wâdi al-Romma (comp. Yâkùt, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"

                    distance, is the other great township of Middle Nejd, Boreida, less than Oneiza,
                    with a population probably of 5000.</p>
                <p>The people of these and the neighbouring towns, as Al-Russ,<note anchored="true"

                    probably, of Jârada, the ancient metropolis of Kasim.</p></note> are in great
                    part caravaners and merchants; they are the Lombards of Arabia, and are called
                    in the Mecca country “the easterlings,” and in the Syrian and Mesopotamian
                    border-lands the 'Azeil. These world-wandering men are commonly of easy, liberal
                    mind in doctrines of religion, whilst the large half of their home-dwelling
                    fellow-citizens are sour Wahhâbites. In these upper parts of the peninsula we
                    see yet some remains of the ancient Arabian civilization. Here is found the art,
                    elsewhere lost, of stone-cutting and well-building; and at Oneiza are goldsmiths
                    whose work is among the best seen in the bazaars of Mecca. Oneiza has an
                    appearance of commercial prosperity, but the poor farmers are much indebted ¾o
                    the money-lenders. The townsmen are among the greatest coffee-drinkers in
                    Arabia. The horse-dealers of Oneiza procure young horses from the nomads round
                    the town, even as far as Yemen, and ship these (known in India as “Oneiza horses
                    ”) at Koweyt for Bombay.</p>
                <p>When Ibrahim Pasha marched to Nejd against the Wahhabite power this town was held
                    by a resident for Ibn Sa’ùd. Ibrâhîm shelled the clay fortress, but allowed the
                    governor to depart with arms and baggage. After the building of Al-Riâd Oneiza
                    fell again to the Wahhabites. Jellowwy, a brother of the Wahhabite prince Feysel
                    ibn Sa'ιιd, was resident, but, bearing himself oppressively, he was expelled, as
                    had been determined in a secret council of the sheikhs. This brought Ibn Sa’iid
                    with all Nejd under arms, and the Shammar prince Ibn Rashid, to recover the
                    rebellious town. He encamped upon the borders of the Wadi al-Romma, and lay
                    there till the second year (1853-54), but attempted nothing (since Arabs cannot
                    be commanded or led to storm a clay town-wall even if, as in this case, it is no
                    more than 18 inches thick), and then departed, making peace with the townsmen
                    upon their own terms. A second war followed after eight years. Abdullah al-Aziz
                    al-Mohammed, the natural prince of Boreida, worsted by the Wahhabite faction,
                    fled to Oneiza; and a little later, when he was going to take refuge with the
                    sherif of Mecca, the Wahhâbites lay in wait for him in the desert and killed
                    him. Word being carried to Oneiza, the townsmen sent out armed men, who overtook
                    and fought with them because they had killed the guest of Oneiza, thus drawing a
                    new conflict on the town. Mohammed, another brother of the prince Ibn Sa’iid,
                    came against Oneiza, and all subject Arabia in arms with him; and to meet this
                    multitude Oneiza had little more than 1000 men. The Wahhâbites had cannon, but
                    could not handle them; the '0neizians, in their walled township, followed their
                    daily labours at leisure. The citizens made one sally in force, but after heavy
                    fighting were driven back with a loss of 200 men. There were two slighter
                    skirmishes in long months of warfare. At length the besiegers, impatient of the
                    time vainly spent, drew homeward, and Ibn Sa’iid returned to Al-Riâd.</p>
