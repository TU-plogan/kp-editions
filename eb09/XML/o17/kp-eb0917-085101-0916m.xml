                    his marriage three years later (29th June 1406) with Isabella, his cousin, widow
                    of Richard II. of England. The bride was two years older than her husband, and
                    is thought to have married him unwillingly, but she brought him a great
                    dowry,—it is said, 500,000 francs. She died three years later, leaving Charles a
                    widower and father of a daughter at the age of eighteen. He was already duke of
                    Orleans, for Louis had been assassinated by the Burgundians two years before
                    (1407). He soon saw himself the most important person in France, except the
                    dukes of Burgundy and Brittany, the king being a cipher. This position his
                    natural temperament by no means qualified him to fill. His mother was eager for
                    vengeance for her husband, and for years Charles did his best to carry out her
                    wishes by filling France with intestine war. Of this, however, he was only
                    nominally one of the leaders, the real guidance of his party resting with the
                    great count of Armagnac, whose daughter, Bonne, he married, or at least formally
                    espoused, in 1410. Five years of confused nego tiations, plots, and fightings
                    passed before the English invasion and the battle of Agincourt, where Charles
                    was joint commander-in-chief. According to one account he was dangerously
                    wounded and narrowly escaped with his life. He was certainly taken prisoner and
                    carried to England, which country was his residence thenceforward for a full
                    quarter of a century. Windsor, Pontefract, Ampthill, Wingfield (Suffolk), and
                    the Tower are named among other places as the scenes of his captivity, which,
                    however, was anything but a rigorous one. He was maintained in the state due not
                    merely to one of the greatest nobles of France but to one who ranked high in the
                    order of succession to the crown. He hunted and hawked and enjoyed society
                    amply, though the very dignities which secured him these privileges made his
                    ransom high, and his release difficult to arrange Above all, he had leisure to
                    devote himself to literary work. But for this he would hardly be remembered as
                    anything better than a more than usually amiable and less than usually able
                    example of the higher feudal nobility, whose political position rather than
                    their personal faults made government difficult or impossible in the later
                    Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>The work which secures a measure of immortality to Charles d’Orléans consists
                    wholly of short poems in the peculiar artificial metres which had become
                    fashionable in France about half a century or more before his birth, and which
                    continued to be fashionable till nearly a century after his death. Besides these
                    a certain number of English poems have been attributed to him. It is certain
                    that he studied the language of his captors, but it is more than doubtful
                    whether the extant English poems which bear his name are genuine, and in any
                    case they are of no value. The ingenuity of a single English critic has striven
                    to attribute to him a curious book in prose, called <hi rend="italic">Le Débat
                    des Hérauts de France et d’Angleterre,</hi> but Μ. Paul Meyer, in his edition of
                    the book in question, has completely disposed of this theory. For all practical
                    purposes, therefore, Charles’s work consists of some hundreds of short poems, a
                    few in various metres, but the majority either ballades or rondels. The
                    chronology of these poems is not always clear, still less the identity of the
                    persons to whom they are addressed, and it is certain that some, perhaps the
                    greater part of them, belong to the later years of the poet’s life. But many are
                    expressly stated in the manuscripts to have been “composed in prison,” others
                    are obviously so composed, and, on the whole, there is in them a remarkable
                    unity of literary flavour. Charles d’Orléans is not distinguished by any
                    extraordinary strength of passion or originality of character; but he is only
                    the more valuable as the last and not the least accomplished representative of
                    the poetry of the middle of the Middle Ages, in which the form was almost
                    everything, and the personality of the poet, save in rare instances, nothing.
                    Yet Charles d’Orléans is not entirely without <hi rend="italic"
                    >differentia.</hi> If he were he would hardly hold the place which at present he
                    justly occupies. He is a capital example of the cultivated and refined—it may
                    almost be called the lettered—chivalry of the last chivalrous age, expert to the
                    utmost degree in carrying out the traditional details of a graceful convention
                    in love and literature. But he is more than this; in a certain easy grace and
                    truth of expression, as well as in a peculiar mixture of melancholy, which is
                    not incompatible with the enjoyment of the pleasures, even the trifling
                    pleasures, of life, with listlessness that is fully able to occupy itself about
                    those trifles, he stands quite alone. He has the urbanity of the 18th century
                    without its vicious and prosaic frivolity, the poetry of the Middle Ages without
                    their tendency to tediousness. His best-known rondels—those on Spring, on the
                    Harbingers of Summer, and others—rank second to nothing of their kind.</p>
                <p>Poetry, however, could hardly be an entire consolation, and it is not surprising
                    to find that Charles, during all the long years of his captivity, was
                    perpetually scheming for liberty. But the English Government had too many
                    reasons for keeping him, and it was not till his hereditary foe Philip the Good
                    of Burgundy interested himself in him that the Government of Henry VI,, which
                    had by that time lost most of its hold on France, released him in return for an
                    immediate payment of 80,000 <hi rend="italic">saluts dor,</hi> and an engagement
                    on his part to pay 140,000 crowns at a future time. The agreement was concluded
                    on 2d July 1440. He was actually released on 3d November following, and almost
                    immediately cemented his friendship with Duke Philip by marrying his niece, Mary
                    of Cleves, who brought him a considerable dowry to assist the payment of his
                    ransom. He had, however, some difficulty in making up the balance, as well as
                    the large sum required for his brother, Jean d’Angoulême, who also was an
                    English prisoner. The last twenty-five years of his life (for, curiously enough,
                    it divides itself into three almost exactly equal periods, each of that length)
                    were spent partly in negotiating, with a little fighting intermixed, for the
                    purpose of gaining the Italian county of Asti, on which he had claims through
                    his mother, partly in travelling about, but chiefly at his principal seat of
                    Blois. Here he kept a miniature court which, from the literary point of view at
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n917/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0917-0852"/> least, was not devoid of brilliancy. At this most
                    of the best-known French men-of-letters at the time—Villon, Olivier de la
                    Marche, Chastelain, Meschinot, and others —were residents or visitors or
                    correspondents. His son, afterwards Louis XII., was not born till 1462, three
                    years before Charles’s own death. He had become, notwithstanding his high
                    position, something of a nullity in politics, and tradition ascribes his death
                    to vexation at the harshness with which Louis XI. rejected his attempt to
                    mediate on behalf of the duke of Brittany. At any rate he died, on 4th January
                    1465, at Amboise. Many of his later poems are small occasional pieces addressed
                    to his courtiers and companions, and in not a few cases answers to them by those
                    to whom they were addressed exist. The best edition of Charles d’Orléans’s
                    poems, with a brief but sufficient account of his life, is that of C.
