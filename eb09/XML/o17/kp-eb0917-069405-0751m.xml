                    extends from the top of the head to the end of the tail; the anal and perhaps
                    the caudal fins are absent; but the ven trais (and by this the oar-fish is
                    distinguished from the other ribbon-fishes) are developed into a pair of long
                    filaments, which terminate in a paddle-shaped extremity, but are too flexible to
                    assist in locomotion. The whole body is covered with a layer of silvery
                    epidermoid substance, which easily comes off and adheres to other objects.</p>
                <p>Oar-fishes are the largest deep-sea fishes known, the majority of the specimens
                    observed measuring 12 feet in length; but some are recorded to have exceeded 20
                    feet. Their range in the great depths of the ocean seems to extend over all
                    seas, from the North Sea to the South Atlantic, from Mauritius and Japan to the
                    coasts of New Zealand. But, however numerous they may be in the depths which are
                    their home, it is only by rare accident that specimens reach the surface; and of
                    these a very small proportion only have come under the observation of
                    naturalists, and been actually recorded. Thus from the coasts of Great Britain
                    only about twenty captures are known in the long space of a century and a half,
                    and not more than thirteen from those of Norway. Oar-fishes have been considered
                    by naturalists to have given rise to some of the tales of “sea-serpents,” but
                    their size as well as the facility with which they are secured when observed
                    render this solution of the question of the existence of such a creature
                    improbable. When they rise to the surface of the water they are either dead or
                    in a helpless and dying condition. The ligaments and tissues by which the bones
                    and muscles were held together whilst the fish lived under the immense pressure
                    of great depths have then become loosened and torn by the expansion of the
                    internal gases; and it is only with difficulty that the specimens can be taken
                    entire out of the water, and preserved afterwards. Every specimen found has been
                    more or less mutilated; and especially the terminal portion of the tail, which
                    seems to end in a delicate tapering filament, has never been perfect;—it is
                    perhaps usually lost as a useless appendage at a much earlier period of the life
                    of the fish.</p>
