                <p><label type="entry">OLD CATHOLICS</label>, the self-assumed name of a new party
                    in religious Christendom, which, like the Reformers of the 16th century, has for
                    its avowed aim the restoration of the ancient standard of Christian belief and
                    practice; but, while the Reformers took for their model the supposed doctrines
                    and institutions of the apostolic age, the Old Catholics have agreed to accept
                    the decrees of the first seven general councils (down to the second of Nicaea,
                    787 A.D.) as authoritative and binding on the church at large. Like the
                    Reformation, Old Catholicism may be said to have had its representatives within
                    the Roman Church long before its formal organization; but the immediate occasion
                    of the movement arose out of the assembling of the oecumenical council at Rome
                    in 1869 by Pope Pius IX. That pontiff had previously given indications of a
                    tendency towards a reactionary policy which contrasted strongly with the liberal
                    measures which characterized his earlier career. Of such indications the dogma
                    of the Immaculate Conception (8th December 1854) and the “Syllabus” of 1864 were
                    the most notable instances. The “Syllabus” was a formal repudiation of the chief
                    doctrines and theories which during the preceding twenty years had been put
                    forward by writers of various schools of thought, but representing opinions
                    unfavourable to the teachings of Catholicism or the claims of the Papacy; and
                    speculations which called in question the existence of a Divine Being were
                    condemned in the same category with views inimical to the temporal power of the
                    Roman curia. It was for the purpose of giving more emphatic recognition and
                    sanction to the tenets of the “Syllabus” that the oecumenical council of 1869
                    was professedly convened, and the announcement that such a solemn expression of
                    the convictions of the church at large was thus to be invited was hailed by the
                    organs of the Catholic press throughout Europe with unqualified approval. Not
                    until the council was on the eve of assembling did it become vaguely rumoured
                    that among the doctrines which would be brought forward for its acceptance and
                    ratification was that of the Papal Infallibility. The mere report was, however,
                    looked upon as a matter of such grave import that Prince Hohenlohe, the chief
                    minister of Bavaria, was induced to use the most strenuous exertions to prevail
                    upon the Catholic powers to combine to prevent the promulgation of such a dogma,
                    but without success.</p>
                <p>The council which assembled at Rome (8th December 1869) was more deserving of the
                    name of “oecumenical” than any which had ever before obeyed the behest of
                    emperor or pope, being attended by delegates from nearly all parts of the world.
                    It included 49 cardinals, 9 patriarchs of the Eastern communion, 4 primates, 121
                    archbishops, 479 bishops, and 52 abbots and other monastic dignitaries. The
                    total number on the day of opening was 719, increased by the 15th of January to
                    744. As a representative body it was, however, very unequally composed, the
                    numerous holders of Italian bishoprics (many of which are of but small extent)
                    constituting a large majority of the entire number. A proposal to rectify this
                    practical inequality by dividing the whole council into eight or six sections
                    representing national elements was summarily rejected. On the other hand, the
                    superiority of the minority in learning and reputation was obvious. It included
                    such names as Schwarzenberg, Mathieu, Darboy, Rauscher, Simor, Ginoulhiac,
                    MacHale, Dupanloup, Ketteler, Strossmayer, Clifford, Kenrick, Maret, and Hefele;
                    while in the long list of those who eventually recorded their placets in favour
                    of the new decree scarcely a name of real eminence appears. Dr Döllinger, the
                    foremost scholar of Catholic Germany, was not among the “fathers” of the
                    council, but his disapproval of the new dogma was notorious, as also was that of
                    the Comte de Montalembert in France. After protracted sittings, extending over
                    seven months, and characterized mainly by a series of discreditable manoeuvres
                    designed to break the firm phalanx of the minority, who could only record their
                    protests and utter eloquent remonstrances, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitutio</hi> (as it was termed) was finally laid before the council, and
                    carried with eighty-eight dissentients, while ninety-one abstained altogether
                    from recording any vote. The supremacy of the Roman pontiff over even an
                    oecumenical council was thus declared in terms more explicit and emphatic than
                    had ever before been employed (Friedrich, <hi rend="italic">Documenta,</hi> ii.
                    316), while the new dogma was enunciated in the following terms :—</p>
                <p>“We teach and define . . . that the Roman pontiff, when he speaks <hi
                    rend="italic">ex cathedra,</hi> that is, when in discharge of his office of
                    Pastor and Doctor of all Christians he defines, in virtue of his supreme
                    apostolic authority, a doctrine of faith or morals to be held by the Universal
                    Church, is endowed with the divine assistance promised to him in Blessed Peter,
                    with that infallibility with which our divine Redeemer willed that the church
                    should be furnished in defining doctrine of faith or morals, and, therefore,
                    that such definitions of the Roman pontiff are irreformable of themselves and
                    not in virtue of the consent of the church.”</p>
                <p>When the above dogma was promulgated in its entirety (18th July 1870) in the
                    presence of 535 fathers, only two dissentient votes were recorded. The rest of
                    the minority had decided on quitting Rome before the final event, a resolution
                    confirmed by the oppressive heat of the weather and the threatening aspect of
                    the political horizon. It has since been asserted on good authority that the
                    action of the Papal party was largely influenced by the empress of France and
                    her advisers; and it cannot be doubted that at Rome, not less than in Paris, it
                    was ardently hoped that this bold proclamation of Ultramontanist doctrine would
                    have been followed by the triumph of the French arms over those of Prussia.</p>
                <p>The conduct of the different members of the opposition on their return to the
                    isolation of their respective dioceses can only be described as a series of
                    pitiable tergiversations. The “sacrificio dell’ intelletto,” as it was termed,
                    was the plausible maxim adopted by one and all. Seventeen of the German bishops
                    almost immediately receded from the position they had taken up at Rome and gave
                    in their assent to the dogma, publishing at the same time a pastoral letter in
                    which they sought to justify their change of sentiment on the ground of
                    expediency in relation to the interests of the church (Michelis, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der neue Fuldaer Hirtenbrief,</hi> 1870). Their example was
                    followed by all the other bishops of Germany as well as by those of Bavaria.
                    Darboy and Dupanloup in France adopted a like course and took with them the
                    entire body of the Gallican clergy. Each bishop demanded in turn the same
                    submission from the clergy of his diocese, the alternative being suspension from
                    pastoral functions, to be followed by deprivation of office. It may be urged as
                    some extenuation of this general abandonment of a great principle, that those
                    who had refused to subscribe to the dogma received but languid support, and in
                    some cases direct discouragement, from their respective Governments. The
                    submission of the illustrious Hefele was generally attributed to the influence
                    exerted by the court of Würtemberg.</p>
                <p>The universities, being less directly under the control of the church, were
                    prepared to show a bolder front. Dr von Schulte, professor at Prague, was one of
                    the first to publish a formal protest. A meeting of Catholic professors and
                    distinguished scholars convened at Nuremberg (August 1870) recorded a like
                    dissent, and resolved on the adoption of measures for bringing about the
                    assembling of a really free council north of the Alps. The “Appel aux Evêques
                    Catholiques” of Μ. Hyacinthe Loyson (better known as “Father Hyacinthe ”), after
                    referring to the overthrow of “the two despotisms,” “the empire of the Napoleons
                    and the temporal power of the popes,” appealed to the Catholic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0814-0755"/> bishops throughout the world to put an end to the
                    schism by declaring whether the recent decrees were or were not binding on the
                    faith of the church. This appeal, on its appearance in <hi rend="italic">La
                    Libertà</hi> early in 1871, was suppressed by the order of the king of Italy. On
                    the 28th of March Dr Döllinger, in a letter of some length, set forth the
                    reasons which compelled him also to withhold his submission alike as “a
                    Christian, a theologian, an historical student, and a citizen.” The publication
                    of this letter was shortly followed by a sentence of excommunication pronounced
                    against Dr Döllinger and Professor Friedrich, and read to the different
                    congregations from the pulpits of Munich. The professors of the university, on
                    the other hand, had shortly before evinced their resolution of affording Dr
                    Döllinger all the moral support in their power by an address (3d April 1871) in
                    which they denounced the Vatican decrees with unsparing severity, declaring
                    that, at the very time when the German people had “won for themselves the post
                    of honour on the battlefield among the nations of the earth,” the German bishops
                    had stooped to the dishonouring task of “forcing consciences in the service of
                    an unchristian tyranny, of reducing many pious and upright men to distress and
                    want, and of persecuting those who had but stood steadfast in their allegiance
                    to the ancient faith” (Friedberg, <hi rend="italic">Aktenstücke</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">z.</hi><hi rend="italic">ersten Vatikanischen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Condi,</hi> p. 187). An address to the king, drawn up a few days
                    later, received the signatures of 12,000 Catholics. The refusal of the rites of
                    the church to one of the signataries, Dr Zenger, when on his deathbed, elicited
                    strong expressions of disapproval; and when, shortly after, it became necessary
                    to fill up by election six vacancies in the council of the university, the
                    feeling of the electors was indicated by the return of candidates who were all
                    distinguished by their avowed dissent from the new decrees. In the following
                    September the demand for another and a free council was responded to by the
                    assembling of such a congress at Munich. It was composed of nearly 500
                    delegates, convened from almost all parts of the world; but the Teutonic element
                    was now as manifestly predominant as the Latin element had been at Rome. The
                    proceedings were presided over by Professor von Schulte, and lasted three days.
                    Among those who took a prominent part in the deliberations were Landammann
                    Keller, Windscheid, Döllinger, Reinkens, Maassen (professor of the canon law at
                    Vienna), Friedrich, and Huber. The arrangements finally agreed upon were mainly
                    provisional; but one of the resolutions plainly declared that it was desirable
                    if possible to effect a reunion with the Oriental Greek and Russian Churches,
                    and also to arrive at an “understanding” with the Protestant and Episcopal
                    communions.</p>
                <p>In the following year lectures were delivered at Munich by various supporters of
                    the new movement, and the learning and oratorical powers of Reinkens were
                    displayed with marked effect. In France the adhesion of the abbé Michaud to the
                    cause attracted considerable interest, not only from his reputation as a
                    preacher, but also from the notable step in advance made by his declaration
                    that, inasmuch as the adoption of the stand-point of the Tridentine canons would
                    render reunion with the Lutheran and the Reformed Churches impossible, the
                    wisest course would be to insist on nothing more with respect to doctrinal
                    belief than was embodied in the canons of the first seven oecumenical councils.
                    The approximation which took place in the same year between the Old Catholics,
                    as they now began to be termed, and the historical little Church of Utrecht must
                    not be left unnoticed. Dr Döllinger, in delivering his inaugural address as
                    rector of the university of Munich, expressed his conviction that theology had
                    received a fresh impulse and that the religious history of Europe was entering
                    upon a new phase.</p>
                <p>Other circumstances contributed to invest Old Catholicism with additional
                    importance in the eyes of mere observers. It was evident that the relations
                    between the Roman curia and the Prussian Government were becoming extremely
                    strained. In February 1872 appeared the first measures of the Falk ministry,
                    having for their object the control of the influence of the clergy in the
                    schools; and when Cardinal Hohenlohe presented himself at Rome in the following
                    May the world was startled at the refusal of Pius IX. to receive the accredited
                    minister of the Prussian court. In the same year two humble parish priests,
                    Renftle of Mering in Bavaria and Tangermann of Unkel in the Rhineland, set an
                    example of independence by refusing to accept the decrees. The former, driven
                    from his parish church, was followed by the majority of his congregation, who,
                    in spite of every discouragement, continued faithful to him; and for years
                    after, as successive members were removed by death, the crosses over their
                    graves recorded that they had died “true to their ancient belief.” Tangermann,
                    the poet, expelled in like manner from his parish by the archbishop of Cologne,
                    before long found himself the minister of a much larger congregation in the
                    episcopal city itself. These examples exercised no little influence, and
                    congregations of Old Catholics were shortly after formed at numerous towns and
                    villages in Bavaria, Baden, Prussia, German Switzerland, and even in Austria. At
                    Warnsdorf in Bohemia a congregation was collected which still represents one of
                    the most important centres of the movement. In September the second congress was
                    held at Cologne. It was attended by some 500 delegates or visitors from all
                    parts of Europe, and the English Church was represented by the bishops of Ely
                    and Lincoln and other distinguished members. The general scope of the
                    proceedings was the formation of a more definite organization; and the question
                    of reunion with other churches was again a prominent topic of discussion. Among
                    those present was the late Dean Stanley, and the striking accounts which he
                    forwarded to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> of the whole congress did much to
                    awaken in England a more widely-extended interest in the movement.</p>
                <p>In the month of May in the following year (1873) the celebrated Falk laws were
                    enacted, whereby the articles 15 and 18 of the Prussian constitution were
                    modified, so as to legalize a systematic state supervision over the education of
                    the clergy of all denominations, and also over the appointment and dismissal of
                    all ministers of religion. The measure, which at the time was interpreted as
                    what Prince Bismarck afterwards openly declared it to have been, viz., a direct
                    response to the Vatican decrees, inspired the Old Catholics with a not
                    unreasonable expectation that the moral support of the Government would
                    henceforth be enlisted on their side. On the 11th of August Dr Reinkens, having
                    been duly elected bishop of the new community, received his consecration at
                    Rotterdam, as “missionary-bishop of Germany,” at the hands of Bishop Heykamp of
                    Deventer. The archbishop of Utrecht, on whom it would otherwise have devolved to
                    perform the ceremony, had died somewhat suddenly a few days before, and the
                    Ultramontanists did not scruple to interpret the event as a sign of the divine
                    displeasure. In the meantime the extension of the movement in Switzerland had
                    been proceeding rapidly, and it was resolved that Constance should be elected as
                    the centre for the third congress. The proceedings occupied three days ( 12th to
                    14th September), and were of an animated and interesting character,—the
                    intelligence that the Prussian Government had resolved on recognizing the
                    election of Bishop Reinkens contributing not a little to inspirit those who were
                    present. English and American theologians, of widely different schools,,
                    listened to the discussions with sympathizing appréciation<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0815-0756"/>, and even bore a part. The subjects which chiefly
                    occupied the consideration of the assembly were the institution of a synod as
                    the legislative and executive organ of the church, and schemes of reunion with
                    the Greek, the African, and the Protestant communions. The unanimity which
                    prevailed was remarkable, and not less so were the indications that the breach
                    between the Papacy and Old Catholicism had become decisive and final. On the
                    2Oth of September the election of Bishop Reinkens was formally recognized by the
                    German Government, and on the 7th of October he took the oath of allegiance to
                    the king.</p>
                <p>The following year (1874) was marked by the assembling of both a synod and a
                    conference at Bonn, and of a congress at Freiburg in the Breisgau. The acts of
                    the synod were mainly directed to modifications of the Roman discipline and the
                    removal of prevalent abuses. At the congress Bishop Reinkens spoke in hopeful
                    terms of the results of his observations during a recent missionary tour
                    throughout Germany. The conference, held on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of
                    September, had for its special object the discussion of the early confessions as
                    a basis of agreement, though not necessarily of fusion, between the different
                    communions above-named. The meetings, presided over by Dr Döllinger with an
                    ability and tact which excited general admiration, successively took into
                    consideration the <hi rend="italic">Filioque,</hi> the sacraments, the canon of
                    Scripture, the episcopal succession in the English Church, the confessional,
                    indulgences, prayers for the dead, and the eucharist. Some divergence of views
                    inevitably disclosed itself in the course of the discussions, but the same
                    conciliatory tone and feeling marked the close as well as the commencement of
                    the proceedings, and by both the English and the Continental religious press the
                    final results were hailed as eminently auspicious. As the direct results of
                    these deliberations it has since been decided to abolish compulsory confession
                    and fasting, to employ the vernacular in public worship, to recognize the
                    marriage of priests as lawful, and to allow them to administer in their churches
                    the communion in both kinds to members of the Anglican persuasion.</p>
                <p>Since 1874 Old Catholicism has found new adherents in other lands,—in Austria, in
                    Italy, and in Mexico; but the controversial spirit which in past history has
                    either broken up such organizations or largely impaired their efficiency has
                    also marred the success of this interesting movement. In Switzerland, where
                    important conferences were successively convened (at Solothurn in 1871, at Olten
                    in 1872, 1873, and 1874), the unanimity of the ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi>
                    Christian Catholics,” as they preferred to call themselves, seemed at one time
                    in danger of being shipwrecked on the question of episcopacy. It was not until
                    18th September 1876 that the conflict of opinions was so far composed as to
                    allow of the consecration of Bishop Herzog by Bishop Reinkens. The reforms
                    introduced by Μ. Hyacinthe Loyson in his church at Geneva have received only a
                    partial assent from the general body. Among the more practical results of his
                    example is to be reckoned, however, the fact that in French Switzerland nearly
                    all the clergy, in German Switzerland about one half, are now married men. But
                    the congregations, which in 1876 had reached the number of fifty-five, have
                    dwindled to thirty-five. The number of children in the different schools is
                    stated to be somewhat under 4000 (Nippold, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der
                    neuesten Kirchengeschichte,</hi> ii. 466- 478).</p>
                <p>In Germany, since the year 1878, the position of the Old Catholics has been one
                    of considerable difficulty. While their representatives have scrupulously
                    abstained from any course of action which could tend to embarrass the Government
                    in its political contests, the most influential organs of that Government have
                    systematically decried the movement and have undisguisedly aimed at its complete
                    extinction. This change of policy is mainly due to the altered relations with
                    the papal court. The present pontiff, skilfully ignoring the original and
                    genuine causes in which Old Catholicism took its rise, has sought to represent
                    its leaders as actuated by revolutionary designs and aiming at the subversion of
                    existing institutions, while the Papacy itself has been described as the chief
                    bulwark against social democracy and nihilistic tendencies. The Prussian
                    Government has responded by a series of concessions to the Roman Catholic
                    clergy, while the favour once shown to the seceding party is at an end. Bishop
                    Reinkens himself, though he still receives a salary from the state, no longer
                    draws it under the head of expenditure for Catholic worship. In Bavaria
                    Professor Friedrich has been constrained to transfer his services from the
                    theological to the philosophical faculty at Munich, and the little Old Catholic
                    congregation has been deprived of its church. Huber’s valuable literary powers
                    have been lost to the cause by his premature decease. In France the place of Μ.
                    Michaud, who has been appointed professor in the university of Bern, is in some
                    measure filled by the return of Father Hyacinthe from Geneva. Under such
                    conditions the continued progress of the party and even its existence are
                    obviously seriously imperilled. But, even if, like the Albigenses, the Lollards,
                    and other similar movements to which the assumptions of the Papacy have at
                    different times given rise, Old Catholicism should be destined to extinction, it
                    will not the less have left on permanent record an example of loyalty to
                    conscientious convictions the influence of which will long survive.</p>
