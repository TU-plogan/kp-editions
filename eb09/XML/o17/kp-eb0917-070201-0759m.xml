                    >Aβ8ιov,</hi> Abdias) is a name pretty frequent in the Old Testament, meaning
                    “servant” or worshipper “of Jehovah.” It is synonymous with Abdi and Abdeel, and
                    of a type common in Semitic proper names; compare the Arabic 'Abdallâh,
                    Taimallât, 'Abd Manât, &lt;fcc., the Hebrew Obed Edom, and many Phoenician
                    forms. The name of Obadiah is prefixed to the fourth and shortest book of the
                    minor prophets, and as no date or other historical note is added it is not
                    surprising that an early Hebrew tradition recorded by Jerome <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Comm. in Ob.)</hi> identified the prophet with the best-known Obadiah of the
                    historical books, the protector of the prophets in the reign of Ahab (1 Kings
                    xviii.). His tomb was shown in Samaria with those of Elisha and John the
                    Baptist, and the <hi rend="italic">Epitaphium</hi><hi rend="italic">Paulae</hi>
                    describes the wild performances, analogous to those of modern dervishes, that
                    took place before these shrines.</p>
                <p>It is now agreed on all hands thatΓit is vain to connect Obadiah the prophet with
                    any other Obadiah of the Old Testament, and that our only clue to the date and
                    composition of the book lies in internal evidence. The prophecy is directed
                    against Edom. Jehovah has sent a messenger forth among the nations to stir them
                    up to battle against the proud inhabitants of Mount Seir, to bring them down
                    from the rocky fastnesses which they deem impregnable. Edom shall be not only
                    plundered but utterly undone and expelled from his borders, and this he shall
                    suffer (through his own folly) at the hand of trusted allies (vers. 1-9). The
                    cause of this judgment is his cruelty to his brother Jacob. In the day of
                    Jerusalem’s overthrow the Edomites rejoiced over the calamity, grasped at a
                    share of the spoil, lay in wait to cut off the fugitives (vers. 10-14). But now
                    the day of Jehovah is near upon all nations, Esau and all the heathen shall
                    drink full retribution for their banquet of carnage and plunder on Jehovah’s
                    holy mountain. A rescued Israel shall dwell in Mount Zion in restored holiness;
                    the house of Jacob shall regain their old possessions; Edom shall be burned up
                    before them as chaff before the flame; they shall spread over all Canaan, over
                    the mountain of Esau and the south of Judah as well as over Gilead and the
                    Philistine and Phoenician coast. The victorious Israelites shall come up on
                    Mount Zion to rule the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom shall be Jehovah’s
                    (vers. 15-21).</p>
                <p>In vers. 10-14 the expositor finds sure foothold. The calamity of Jerusalem can
                    only be the sack of the city by Nebuchadnezzar; the malevolence and cruelty of
                    Edom on this occasion are characterized in similar terms by several writers of
                    the exile, but by none with the same circumstance and vividness of detail as
                    here (Ezek. xxv. 8, 12 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> XXXV.; Lam. iv. 21; Psalm
                    cxxxvii <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>). It is impossible to doubt that these
                    verses were written under the lively and recent impression of the events to
                    which they refer; to regard them as predictive (Caspari, Pusey, &amp;c.) is to
                    misunderstand the whole character of prophetic foresight, and to ascribe them
                    with Hitzig to the Persian or Greek period is equally unreasonable. The opening
                    verses of the prophecy, on the other hand, present a real difficulty. Obad. 1-6,
                    8 agree so closely and in part verbally with Jer. xlix. 14-16, 9, 10, 7 that the
                    two passages cannot be independent; nor does it seem possible that Obadiah
                    quotes from Jeremiah, for Obad. 1-8 is a well-connected whole, while the
                    parallel verses in Jeremiah appear in different order, interspersed with other
                    matter, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n760/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0760-0703"/> and in a much less lucid connexion. In Jeremiah
                    the picture is vague, and Edom’s unwisdom (ver. 7) stands without proof. In
                    Obadiah the conception is quite definite. Edom is attacked by his own allies,
                    and his folly appears in that he exposes himself to such treachery. Again, the
                    probability that the passage in Jeremiah incorporates disjointed fragments of an
                    older oracle is greatly increased by the fact that the prophecy against Moab in
                    the preceding chapter uses, in the same way, Isa. xv., xvi., and the prophecy of
                    Balaam. In spite of the objections of Blau (Z. <hi rend="italic">D. Jtf.
                    G.,</hi> xx. 173 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> there is no good reason to doubt
                    that the prophecy against Edom ascribed to Jeremiah is really from his pen; it
                    is earlier than the fall of Jerusalem,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Inver. 12 “have assuredly drunken” should be “shall
                    assuredly drink.”</p></note> and is one of a circle of prophecies in which
                    Nebuchadnezzar (the lion ascending from Jordan, ver. 19) appears as the
                    instrument of divine judgment on the nations. This being so, it seems necessary
                    to conclude, with Ewald <hi rend="italic">{Propheten,</hi> i. 489 <hi
                    rend="italic">s(p),</hi> Graf <hi rend="italic">(Jeremia,</hi> p. 558 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.∖</hi> and others, that Jeremiah and our book of Obadiah alike
                    quote from an older oracle. Ewald supposes that the treacherous allies of Edom
                    are the Aramaeans and the time that of Ahaz (2 Kings xvi. 6); but the tone of
                    the prophecy seems rather to refer it to a later date, when Edom had been for
                    some time independent and powerful; and it is not improbable that in Obad. 1-8
                    we have the first mention of that advance of the Arabs upon the lands east of
                    Palestine which is referred to also in Ezek. xxv. (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Moab,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 535). That the book of Obadiah, short as it is, is a
                    complex document might have been suspected, apart from Jer. xlix., from an
                    apparent change of view between vers. 1-9 and vers. 15 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi> In the former verses Esau is destroyed by his allies, and they occupy
                    his territory, but in the latter he perishes with the other heathen in the day
                    of universal retribution, he disappears before the victorious advance of Israel,
                    and the southern Judaeans occupy his land.</p>
                <p>The eschatology of Obadiah contains little that is peculiar. The conceptions of
                    the “rescued ones” (∏D'5δ), of the sanctity of Zion, of the kingship of Jehovah,
                    are the common property of the prophets from the time of Isaiah. The restoration
                    of the old borders of Israel and the conquest of Edom and the Philistines are
                    ideas as old as Amos ix., Isa. xi. 14; but the older prophets more often
                    represent this conquest as a suzerainty of Israel over its neighbours, as in the
                    days of David, while in Obadiah, as in other later books, the intensified
                    antithesis—religious as well as political —between Judah and the surrounding
                    heathen finds its expression in the idea of a consuming judgment on the
                    latter,—the great “day of Jehovah.” This view is not, however, original in
                    Obadiah; it is already expressed in Zephaniah. Between Joel and Obadiah there
                    are points of material and verbal agreement, sqjcTose as to imply that Joel used
                    the earlier book (Joel iii. 19,—Ob. 10, 14; Joeliii, 3, —Ob. 11; Joel ii. 32,
                    iii. 17,—Ob. 17). Another characteristic common to Obadiah with the latest
                    prophets is that, while he uses the words house of Jacob and house of Joseph,
                    the northern tribes have become to him a mere name; the restoration he thinks of
                    is a restoration of the kingdom of Jerusalem, and even Gilead is to be occupied
                    not by Joseph but by Benjamin.</p>
                <p>An indication of the place where Obadiah wrote seems to lie in ver. 20, where he
                    speaks of “the exiles in this S∏.” The word as pointed has been variously
                    explained to mean “bulwark” or “army”; it may also be read as “sand” or
                    “sea-coast” (Ewald), but, as the text of the verse is not sound and cannot be
                    translated without some correction, it is unsafe to build on this obscure
                    allusion. The prominence given to Edom, and the fact that Chaldaea is not
                    mentioned at all, make it probable that the book was not written in Babylonia.
                    The same verse speaks of exiles in Sepharad.</p>
                <p>Sepharad is probably Sardis, the Çparda of Darius in the Behistun inscription.
                    Many of the Jews were doubtless sold as slaves by Nebuchadnezzar. Lydia was a
                    great slave-market, and Asia Minor was a chief seat of the Diaspora at an early
                    date (comp. Gutschmidt, <hi rend="italic">Neue Beiträge,</hi> p. 77), so that
                    this identification does not supply ground for Hitzig’s argument that Obadiah
                    was written in the Greek period, when we read of many Jews being transplanted to
                    Asia Minor (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xii. 3). Schrader, however <hi
                    rend="italic">{K. G. F.,</hi> 116 <hi rend="italic">sq.; K.A. T.,</hi> 446),
                    thinks of a Shaparda mentioned by Sargon,, and lying in south-west Media.</p>
