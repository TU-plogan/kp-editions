                    if Vasari is right about his age his birth would have been in 1316. Milanesi,
                    the able editor of Vasari, is inclined to think that Orcagna died in 1368, when
                    he is known to have been seriously ill.</p></note>), whose full name was <hi

                    the son of a very able Florentine goldsmith, Maestro Cione, said to have been
                    one of the principal artists who worked on the magnificent silver frontal of the
                    high altar of San Giovanni, the Florentine Baptistery. The result of Orcagna’s
                    early training in the use of the precious metals may be traced in the extreme
                    delicacy and refined detail of his principal works in sculpture. He had at least
                    three brothers who all practised some branch of the fine arts: Lionardo or
                    Nardo, the eldest, a painter; Matteo, a sculptor and mosaicist; and Jacopo, also
                    a painter. They were frequently associated with Orcagna in his varied
                    labours.</p>
                <p>From the time of Giotto to the end of the 14th centurv</p>
                <p>Orcagna stands quite pre-eminent even among the many excellent artists of that
                    time. In sculpture he was a pupil of Andrea Pisano; in painting, though
                    indirectly, he was a disçiple of Giotto. Few artists have practised with such
                    success so many branches of the arts. Orcagna was not only a painter and
                    sculptor, but also a worker in mosaic, an architect, and a poet. His importance
                    in the history of Italian art rests not merely on his numerous and beautiful
                    productions, but also on his widespread influence, transmitted to his successors
                    through a large and carefully-trained school of pupils. In style as a painter
                    Orcagna comes midway between Giotto and Fra Angelico: he combined the dramatic
                    force and realistic vigour of the earlier painter with the pure brilliant colour
                    and refined unearthly beauty of Fra Angelico. His large fresco paintings are
                    works of extreme decorative beauty and splendour,—composed with careful
                    reference to their architectural surroundings, arranged for the most part on one
                    plane, without the strong foreshortening or effects of perspective with which
                    the mural paintings of later masters are so often marred.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Orcagna as a Painter.—</hi> His chief works in fresco were
                    at Florence, in the church of S. Maria Novella. He first covered the walls of
                    the retro-choir with scenes from the life of the Virgin. These, unfortunately,
                    were much injured by damp very soon after their completion, and towards the end
                    of the following century were replaced by other frescos of the same subjects by
                    Ghirlandaio, who, according to Vasari, made much use of Orcagna’s motives and
                    invention. Orcagna also painted three walls of the Strozzi chapel, at the
                    north-east of the same church, with a grand series of frescos, which still
                    exist, though in a much injured and “restored” state. On the northern end wall
                    is the Last Judgment, painted above and round the window, the light from which
                    makes it difficult to see the picture. In the centre is Christ floating among
                    clouds <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> surrounded by angels; below are kneeling
                    figures of the Virgin and St John the Baptist, with the twelve apostles. Lower
                    still are patriarchs, prophets, and saints, with the resurrection of the blessed
                    and the lost. The finest composition is that on the west wall, unbroken by any
                    win dow. It represents paradise, with Christ and the Virgin enthroned in majesty
                    among rows of brilliantly-coloured cherubim and seraphim tinged with
                    rainbow-like rays of light. Below are long lines of the heavenly hierarchy
                    mingled with angel musicians; and lower still a crowd of saints floating on
                    clouds. Many of these figures are of exquisite beauty, especially the few that
                    have escaped restoration. Faces of the most divine tenderness and delicacy occur
                    among the female saints; the two central angels below the throne are figures of
                    wonderful grace in pose and movement; and the whole picture, lighted by a soft
                    luminous atmosphere, seems to glow with an unearthly gladness and peace.
                    Opposite to this is the fresco attributed by Vasari to Orcagna’s brother
                    Bernardo, or rather Nardo <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Lionardo); it was
                    completely repainted in 1530, so that nothing but the design remains, full of
                    horror and weird imagination. To some extent the painter has followed Dante’s
                    scheme of successive circles.</p>
                <p>These paintings were probably executed soon after 1350, and in 1357 Orcagna
                    painted one of his finest panel pictures, as a retable for the altar of the same
                    chapel, where it still remains. In the centre is Christ in majesty between
                    kneeling figures of St Peter and St Thomas Aquinas, attended by angel musicians;
                    on each side are standing figures of three other saints. It is a work of the
                    greatest beauty both in colour and composition; it is painted with extreme
                    miniature-like delicacy, and is on the whole very well preserved. This retable
                    is signed, “An. dni. mccclvii Andreas Cionis de Florentia me pinxit.” <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0878-0815"/> Another fine altar-piece on panel by Orcagna,
                    dated 1363, is preserved in the Cappella de’ Medici near the sacristy of Sta
                    Croce; it represents the four doctors of the Latin church. According to Vasari,
                    Orcagna also painted some very fine frescos in Sta Croce, similar in subjects to
                    those attributed to him in the Campo Santo of Pisa, and full of fine portraits.
                    These do not now exist. In the cathedral of Florence, on one of the northern
                    piers, there hangs a nobly-designed and highly-finished picture on panel by
                    Orcagna, representing S. Zanobio enthroned, trampling under his feet Cruelty and
                    Pride; at the sides are kneeling figures of SS. Eugenius and Crescentius,—the
                    whole very rich in colour. The retable mentioned by Vasari as having been
                    painted for the Florentine church of S. Pietro Maggiore is now in the National
                    Gallery of London. It is a richly decorative composition of the Coronation of
                    the Virgin, between rows of saints, together with nine other subjects painted in
                    miniature. Other paintings on panel by Orcagna were sent by the Pope to Avignon,
                    but cannot now be traced. The frescos also have been destroyed with which,
                    according to Vasari, Orcagna decorated the façade of S. Apollinare and the
                    Cappella de’ Cresci in the church of the Servi in Florence.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The magnificent but much injured frescos of
                    the Last Judgment, Hell, and the Triumph of Death in the Pisan Campo Santo,

                    to Orcagna, but internal evidence seems to show that they are productions of the
                    Sienese school. Crowe and Cavalcaselle attribute them to the two brothers
                    Lorenzetti of Siena, but they have been so injured by wet, the settlement of the
                    wall, and repeated retouchings that it is difficult to come to any clear
                    decision as to their authorship. It appears, however, much more probable that
                    they are the work of Bernardo Daddi.</p></note></p>

                    member of the Sculptors’ Guild in 1352. His name occurs in the roll as “Andreas

                    Orcagna was appointed architect to the chapel of Or San Michele in Florence.
                    This curiously-planned building, with a large upper room over the vaulting of
                    the lower part, had been begun by Taddeo Gaddi as a thank-offering for the
                    cessation of the plague of 1348. It took the place of an earlier oratory
                    designed by Arnolfo del Cambio, and was the gift of the united trade guilds of
                    Florence. As to the building itself, it is impossible to say how much is due to
                    Taddeo Gaddi and how much to Orcagna, but the great marble tabernacle was wholly
                    by Orcagna. This, in its combined splendour of architectural design, sculptured
                    reliefs and statuettes, and mosaic enrichments, is one of the most important and
                    beautiful works of art which even rich Italy possesses. It combines an altar, a
                    shrine, a reredos, and a baldacchino. In general form it is perhaps the purest
                    and most gracefully designed of all specimens of Italian Gothic. It is a tall
                    structure of white marble, with vaulted canopy and richly-decorated gables and
                    pinnacles, reaching almost to the vaulted roof of the chapel. The detail is
                    extremely delicate, and brilliant gem-like colour is given by lavish enrichments
                    of minute patterns in glass mosaic, inlaid in the white marble of the structure.
                    It is put together with the greatest care and precision; Vasari especially notes
                    the fact that the whole was put together without any cement, which might have
                    stained the purity of the marble, all the parts being closely fitted together
                    with bronze dowels. The spire-like summit of the tabernacle is surmounted by a
                    figure of St Michael, and at a lower stage on the roof are statuettes of the
                    apostles. The altar has a relief of Hope between panels with the Marriage of the
                    Virgin and the Annunciation. On the right side, looking east, of the base of the
                    tabernacle are reliefs of the Birth of the Virgin and her Presentation in the
                    Temple; on the left, the Nativity and the Adoration of the Magi; and behind, the
                    Presentation of Christ in the</p>
                <p>Temple, and the Angel warning the Virgin to escape into Egypt. Above the last two
                    subjects are large reliefs of the Death of the Virgin, surrounded by the
                    apostles, and higher still her Assumption; she stands in a vesica, and is borne
                    by angels to heaven. On the base of the Virgin’s tomb is inscribed “Andreas
                    Cionis pictor Florentinvs oratorii archimagister extitit hvjvs mccclix.”
                    Orcagna’s own portrait is given as one of the apostles. In addition to these
                    richly-composed subject-reliefs the whole work is adorned with many other single
                    figures and heads of prophets, angels, and the Virtues, all executed with
                    wonderful finish and refinement. The shrine, which forms an aumbry in the
                    reredos, contains a miraculous picture of the Madonna. A fine bronze screen,
                    with open geometrical tracery, encloses the whole. No work of sculpture in Italy
                    is more magnificent than this wonderful tabernacle, both in general effect and
                    in the delicate beauty of the reliefs and statuettes with which it is so
                    lavishly enriched. It cost the enormous sum of 96,000 gold florins.
                    Unfortunately it is very badly placed and insufficiently lighted, so that a
                    minute examination of its beauties is a work of difficulty.</p>
                <p>No mention is made by Vasari of Orcagna’s residence in Orvieto, where he occupied
                    for some time the post of “capomaestro” to the duomo.<note anchored="true"

                    at the large salary (for that time) of 300 gold florins a year. His brother
                    Matteo was engaged to work under him, receiving 8 florins a month. When Orcagna
                    accepted this appointment at Orvieto he had not yet finished his work at Or San
                    Michele, and so was obliged to make long visits to Florence, which naturally
                    interfered with the satisfactory performance of his work for the Orviétans. The
                    result was that on the 12th of September 1360 Orcagna, having been paid for his
                    work up to that time, resigned the post of “capo-maestro” of the duomo, though
                    he still remained a little longer in Orvieto to finish a large mosaic picture on
                    the west front. When this mosaic (made of glass tesserae from Venice) was
                    finished in 1362, it was found to be uneven in surface, and not fixed securely
                    into its cement bed. An arbitration was therefore held as to the price Orcagna
                    was to receive for it, and he was awarded 60 gold florins.</p>
                <p>Vasari mentions as other architectural works by Orcagna the design for the piers
                    in the nave of the Florentine duomo, a zecca or mint, which appears not to have
                    been carried out, and the Loggia dei Lanzi in the Piazza della Signoria. It is,
                    however, more than doubtful whether Orcagna had any hand in this last building,
                    a very graceful vaulted structure, with three semicircular open arches on the
                    side and one at each end, intended to form a sheltered meeting-place for the
                    Priori during elections and other public transactions. This loggia was ordered
                    by the General Council ς&gt;f Florence in 1356, but was not actually begun till
                    the year 1376, after Orcagna’s death. The architects were Benci di Cione
                    (possibly a brother of Orcagna) and Simone di Francesco Talenti, both men of
                    considerable reputation in Florence. The sculptured reliefs of the seven Virtues
                    in the spandrels of the arches of the loggia, also attributed to Orcagna by
                    Vasari, were later still. They were designed by Angelo Gaddi (1383-1386), and
                    were carried out by three or four different sculptors.</p>
                <p>Pupils of Orcagna named by Vasari are Bernardo Nello, a Pisan, Tommaso di Marco,
                    a Florentine, and, chief of all, Francesco Traun, whose grand painting on panel
                    of St Thomas Aquinas enthroned with the arch-heretics at his feet still hangs in
                    the church for which it was painted,—Sta Caterina at Pisa. Orcagna had, in
                    addition to the two daughters mentioned above, a son named Crone, who was a
                    painter of but little eminence. Some sonnets attributed to Orcagna exist in MS.
