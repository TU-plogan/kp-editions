                    >sativa,</hi> L., one of about forty species mostly dispersed through the
                    temperate regions of the Old World. It belongs to the tribe <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aveneae</hi> of the order <hi rend="italic">Graminex</hi> or Grasses. The
                    spikelets form a loose panicle, familiar in the cultivated oat, the flowering
                    glume having its dorsal rib prolonged into an awn, which is in some species
                    twisted and bent near the base.</p>
                <p>The origin of the cultivated oat is generally believed to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >A.</hi><hi rend="italic">fatua,</hi> L., or “wild oat.” Prof. J. Buckman
                    succeeded in raising “the potato-oat type” and “the white Tartarian oat” from
                    grain of this species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Science and Practice of Farm Cultivation,</hi> p. 172
                    (1865).</p></note> Mr A. Stephen Wilson, however, thinks that as yet there is no
                    real proof of this relationship, because his own cultivation of the wild oat
                    made no difference upon it;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">A Bushel of Com,</hi> p. 145.</p></note> but there appears
                    to be a great tendency in the oat to degenerate on stiff clay soils into “weed
                    oats,” a fact which may perhaps account for this divergence of opinion. Lindley
                    had previously suggested that the cultivated oat was a domesticated variety of
                    some wild species, and that it might not improbably be referred to <hi
                    rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">strigosa,</hi> Schreb., “the
                    bristle-pointed oat,” which is the origin of the Scotch oat, according to
                    Buckman. The white and black varieties of this species, Mr Wilson observes, were
                    cultivated in England and Scotland from remote times, and “are frequently
                    mentioned in Rogers’ <hi rend="italic">History of Agriculture and Prices .

                    Parkinson tells us that in his time [early in the 17th century] the naked oat
                    was sown in sundry places, but “nothing so frequent” as the common sort. The
                    chief differences between <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">fatua</hi>

                    chaff-scales which adhere to the grain are thick and hairy, and in the latter
                    they are not so coarse and are hairless. The wild oat, moreover, has a long
                    stiff awn, usually twisted near the base. In the cultivated oat it may be
                    wanting, and if present it is hot so stiff and is seldom bent. The grain is very
                    small and worthless in the one, but larger and full in the other. Mr Wilson adds
                    that in the point of attachment “in the wild oat the hanger terminates in a
                    little oval spatula, . . . forming a kind of ball-and-socket connexion. . . . In
                    the cultivated oat the continuity of the vascular tissue in the hanger is not
                    broken off by any point of the kind.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to horses; he also states that ten varieties were introduced by Mohammed Ali
                    into Egypt for fodder, and that it was seen by Bruce wild in Abyssinia,
                    sometimes tall enough to conceal horse and rider (Grev.). And he adds that
                    eastward from Syria it is called “sulu” by the Tatars, and was observed by
                    Kaempfer and others in Japan; that it was brought over by colonists, and is now
                    cultivated in north-east America; and that it has now become naturalized in

                <p>Besides the use of the straw when cut up and mixed with other food for fodder,
                    the oat grain constitutes an important food for both man and beast. Being
                    cultivated best in comparatively low temperatures, it has long formed the staple
                    food for Scotland, north England, and Derbyshire, as well as for Germany,
                    wherever wheat does not flourish. It is extensively grown in all the northern
                    States of the American Union, and in New England its production largely exceeds
                    that of wheat. The oat grain (excepting the naked oat), like that of barley, is
                    closely invested by the husk. “This latter is used both in Scotland and Wales
                    for the preparation of a kind of porridge . . . called sowans and sucan.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>E. Smith, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foods,</hi> p. 167.</p></note> Oatmeal is made from the kiln-dried grain from
                    which the husks have been removed; and the form of the food is the well-known
                    “porridge.” In Ireland it is mixed with Indian-corn meal and is called
                    “stirabout.” Groats or grits are the whole kernel from which the husk is
                    removed. Their use is for gruel, which used to be consumed as an ordinary drink
                    in the 17th century at the coffee-houses in London. The meal can be baked into
                    “cake” or biscuit, as the Passover-cake of the Jews; but it cannot be made into
                    loaves in consequence of the great difficulty in rupturing the starch grains,
                    unless the temperature be raised to a considerable height. With regard to the
                    nutritive value of oatmeal, as compared with that of wheat flour, it contains a
                    higher percentage of albuminoids than any other grain, viz. , 12 · 6—that of
                    wheat being 10 · 8—and less of starch, 58 ’ 4, as against 66 ’ 3 in wheat. It
                    has rather more sugar, viz., 5'4—wheat having 4·2—and a good deal more fat,
                    viz., 5 ’ 6, as against 2 0 in flour. Lastly, salts amount to 3’0 per cent, in
                    oat, but are only 1 · 7 in wheat. Its nutritive value, therefore, is higher than
                    that of ordinary seconds flour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
