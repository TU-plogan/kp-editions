                <p><label type="entry">OBOE</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hautboy.</hi> The oboe
                    is an instrument containing a conical column of air, which is set in vibration
                    by means of a double-tongued reed. A series of holes pierced in the side of the
                    pipe permits the instrumentalist to progressively shorten the column by the
                    successive opening of the lateral holes, and thus produce a series of
                    fundamental sounds, the scale of which, in the primitive instruments without
                    keys, does not exceed the extent of an octave. All wind instruments with a
                    conical column of air, whatever may be the mode by which that is set in motion,
                    are subject to the laws of vibration of open pipes, according to which, by a
                    stronger pressure in blowing, the oboe reproduces each of its fundamental sounds
                    in the octave higher, and thus acquires a scale of two octaves, which, partiallv
                    chromatic in the old instruments, has become completely chromatic by the
                    adoption of keys. This extension of compass is further augmented in modern
                    instruments, in the grave sounds by keys permitting lengthenings of the
                    primitive column of air, and in the acute by the employment of other partial
                    sounds than the first of the harmonic series. In the present day the mean
                    chromatic extent of the oboe is comprised between the notes n <hi

                <p>⅜—and w —~~~ '^i</p>
                <p>The double reed is the most simple, as it is probably the oldest, of all reed
                    contrivances. It is sufficient to flatten the end of a wheat straw to constitute
                    an apparatus capable of setting in vibration by the breath the column of air
                    contained in the rudimentary tube; the invention of this reed is certainly due
                    to chance. An apparatus for sonorous disturbance thus found, it was easy to
                    improve it: for the wheat stalk a reed stalk was substituted, and in the
                    extremity of its pipe another reed stalk much shorter in length was inserted,
                    pared and flattened at the end; and then came the lateral holes, probably
                    another discovery of the great inventor chance. For the reed tube a wooden one
                    was substituted, still preserving the reed tongue, and it is in this form, after
                    having played an important part amongst the sonorous contrivances of antiquity,
                    that we find the ancestor of the oboe playing a part no less important in the
                    16th century, in which it formed the interesting families of the cormomes, the
                    corthols, and the cervelas. All these families have disappeared in the
                    instrumental combinations of Europe, but they are still to be found in Eastern
                    wind instruments, such as the Caucasian <hi rend="italic">salamouri,</hi> the
                    Chinese <hi rend="italic">kwantze,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hitshirild</hi> of Japan. It is important to remark that the column of air in a
                    cylindrical pipe, disturbed by any reed, submits to the laws of vibration of
                    stopped pipes; accordingly, to produce a sound of a given pitch, the pipe must
                    be theoretically half as short as an open pipe would be to obtain a note of the
                    same pitch. Moreover, open pipes under an increasing pressure of blowing,
                    produce, in subdividing the air column, the harmonics according to the
                    arithmetical progression 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c., while the stopped pipes can only
                    produce the odd harmonics in the series. In other words, the conical pipe
                    reproduces its fundamental sounds in the interval of the octave, the cylindrical
                    in that of the twelfth. A double reed associated with a cylindrical pipe can
                    only be used for columns of air of small diameter. Practice has demonstrated
                    that the reed stalk of which the tongue reed is made should not be of narrower
                    internal diameter than the pipe containing the column of air it is to act upon.
                    By the flattening necessary to form the tongues of a double reed, it must be
                    tolerably large, from which it happens that its proper sound is relatively
                    grave, and will only agree with instruments not above the region of the male
                    voice. I⅛must be remembered that the reproduction of fundamental sounds in the
                    twelfth is only possible by an artifice of modern invention. But it is evident
                    that chance has again intervened to show that a very small double reed can set
                    in vibration columns of air of considerable diameter, provided that the column
                    becomes gradually narrower towards its superior extremity where it receives the
                    reed, so as to terminate in a diameter equivalent to that of the reed itself. It
                    is impossible to say when it was that man first employed the phenomena of double
                    reeds and conical pipes, but the knowledge of them must at least have been later
                    than that of the cylindrical pipe, which we may regard as directly furnished by
                    nature. That antiquity made use of them, however, has been proved by Μ. Gevaert
                    in his admirable <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la musique dans</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">antiquité</hi>; but this learned author
                    shows that the double-reed pipes held but <pb break="no"

                    of ancient Greece and Rome.</p>
                <p>The instrument we call oboe appears for the first time in Sebastian Virdung’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Musica</hi><hi rend="italic">geputscht und</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >auszgezogen</hi> (1511). It there bears the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >schalmey,</hi> and is already combined with an instrument of similar
                    construction called <hi rend="italic">bombardt.</hi> This beginning of the oboe
                    family suggests the possibility of Virdung’s schalmey having existed in the
                    Middle Ages. Where, when, and how it was introduced into western Europe is at
                    present unknown, but the <hi rend="italic">zamr-al-kebir</hi> still used in
                    Moslem countries is practically identical with it, a circumstance which suggests
                    the possibility of its having been brought into Europe by the crusaders.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of musical instruments could not remain unaffected by the great
                    artistic movement known as the Renaissance; accordingly, we find them not only
                    improved and purified in form in the 16 th century, but also ranged in complete
                    families from the soprano to the bass. Praetorius, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syntagma</hi><hi rend="italic">Musicum</hi> (1615-20), gives us the full
                    nomenclature of the family with which we are concerned, composed of the
                    following individuals.</p>

                    three centuries. The following illustration (fig. 4), borrowed from a

                <p>The 17th century brought no great changes in the construction of the four smaller
                    instruments of the family.</p>
                <p>Of much extended use in France, they were there called “haulx bois,” or
                    “haultbois,” to distinguish them from the two larger instruments which were
                    designated by the words “gros bois.” Haultbois became hautbois in French, and
                    oboe in English, German, and Italian; and this word is now used to distinguish
                    the present smaller instrument of the family.</p>
                <p>The little schalmey and tenor pommer seem to have disappeared in the 17th
                    century; it is the discant schalmey and the alto pommer which by improvement
                    have become two important elements in modern instrumentation. The oboe, as such,
                    was employed for the first time in 1671, in the orchestra of the Paris opera in
                    <hi rend="italic">Pom&lt;me</hi> by Cambert. The first two keys, ¾ <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">⅛5≡</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">∣</hi>, date from the end
                    of the 17th century. In 1727 Gerhard Hoffmann of Rastenberg added the keys <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">1.</hi> A Parisian maker, Delusse, furnished, at the end of the
                    18th century, much appreciated improvements in the boring of the instrument. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Méthode</hi> of Sellner, published at Vienna in 1825, allows
                    nine keys, i~≡≡t and one which, when opened, established a loop or ventral
                    segment of vibration in the column of air, facilitating the production of sounds
                    in the octave higher. Triebert of Paris owes his great reputation to the
                    numerous improvements he introduced in the construction of the oboe.</p>
                <p>The alto pommer became but slowly transformed: it was called in French “hautbois
                    de chasse,” in Italian “oboe di caccia.” In the 18th century we find it more
                    elegant in form, but with all the defects of the primitive instrument. The idea
                    of bending the instrument into a half circular form to facilitate the handling
                    is attributed to an oboist of Bergamo, one Jean Periendis, who was established
                    at Strasburg about 1760. The fact of the instrument’s resembling a kind of
                    hunting-horn used at that time in England probably gained for it the name of
                    “corno inglese,” which it still retains (“cor anglais” in French). The first
                    employment of it in the orchestra is referred to Gluck, who had two “cors
                    anglais” in his <hi rend="italic">Alceste,</hi> as played at Vienna in 1767. But
                    it was not until 1808 that the cor anglais was first heard in the Paris opera;
                    it was played by the oboist Vogt in <hi rend="italic">Alexandre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chez</hi><hi rend="italic">Apelle</hi> by Catel. The improvements
                    in manufacture of this instrument closely followed those introduced in the oboe.
                    The 18th century produced an intermediate oboe between (2) and (3), which was
                    called “hautbois d’amour,’’and was frequently employed by J. S. Bach. It was a
                    third lower than the ordinary oboe, and fell into disuse after the death of the
                    great German composer. It has been resuscitated by the firm of C.</p>

                    manufacture.</p>
                <p>After the 16th century we find the instruments which were designated by the name
                    of “gros bois,” the (5) and (6) of Praetorius, transformed into shorter
                    instruments, the fagott and contra-fagott; so called because the column of air,
                    the same as in the pommer, was formed of two conical tubes which communicated
                    with the lower part of the instrument, and were pierced in a single piece of
                    wood. It is probably owing to the aspect of this double pipe that the satirical
                    name of fagot was given, preserved in Italian as fagotto, and in German as
                    fagott. A canon of Ferrara named Afranio has been cited as the author of the
                    transformation, about 1539, of the bass pommer, but Count Valdrighi, the curator
                    of the Estense library,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of the innovation. The fagottino is transformed in the same fashion.</p>
                <p>Sigismund Scheitzer of Nuremberg acquired a great reputation in the 16th century
                    for making the “basson,” a French word substituted for the old fagot, and
                    adopted in England as bassoon. His instrument had only two keys, We cannot tell
                    when the bassoon gained its present form, but it was probably at the end of the
                    17th century. It was made in exactly the same style as the fagottino represented
                    in fig. 5. It appeared for the first time in the orchestra with the oboe in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pomone</hi> (1671). It had three keys then, _| I <hi

                <p>of the instrument necessary, we may suppose it took its modern form at that
                    epoch. The fourth key, g ¾≡~^^l, dates from 1751. The bassoon appears with four
                    keys in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> of Diderot and D’Alembert
                    (Paris, 1751-65). The number of keys increased by the beginning of the present

                <p>duction of acute harmonics. It has since been improved by Almenräder in Germany,
                    Savari, and more recently Triebert and Goumas, Paris, and C. Mahillon,
                    Brussels.</p>
                <p>The reform in the construction of the flute due to Theobald Boehm of Munich about
                    1840, a reform which principally consisted in the rational division of the tube
                    by the position of the lateral holes, prompted Triebert to try to adapt the
                    innovation to the oboes and bassoons; but he failed, because the application of
                    it denaturalized the timbre of the instruments, which it was necessary, before
                    all things, to preserve. But his efforts did not remain sterile. In 1856 a
                    French bandmaster, Μ. Sarrus, thought out the construction of a family of brass
                    instruments ι⅛ith conical tubes pierced at regular distances, which, diminishing
                    the length of the air column, has rendered a series of fundamental sounds
                    easy,—more equal and free in timbre than that of the oboe family. Gautrot of
                    Paris realized the inventor’s idea, and, under the name of “sarrusophones,” has
                    created a complete family, from the sopranino in Eb to the contrabass in Bb, of
                    which his firm preserves the monopoly.</p>
                <p>In 1868 the firm of C. Mahillon, Brussels, produced a reed contrabass of metal,
                    destined to replace the old contrabassoon of wood, since much used in orchestras
                    and military bands. The first idea of this instrument goes back to 1839, and is
                    attributed to Schöll-nast and Son of Pressburg. It is a conical brass tube of
                    very large proportions, with lateral holes placed as theory demands, in
                    geometrical relation, with a diameter almost equal to the section of the tube at
                    the point where the hole is cut. From this it results that for each sound one
                    key only is required, and the seventeen keys give the player almost the facility
                    of a keyboard. The compass written for this contrabass is comprised between
                    ~j~=1</p>
                <p>and ———— but sounds an octave lower.</p>
                <p>We now turn to another kind of reed and its association with two kinds of
                    cylindrical and conical pipes,—the beating reed, which is formed of a single
                    tongue, and engenders vibrations in the column of air to which it is applied by
                    the contact of the tongue with the frame of a groove to which it is adapted. The
                    beating reed, though not having the extreme antiquity of the double reed, was
                    used at a very early period, for we find it applied to the chalumeaus of ancient
                    Egypt, still in use under the name of <hi rend="italic">arghoul,</hi> to the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">auloi,</hi> and the Roman fo‰.<note anchored="true"

                    at the upper end by the natural knot, beneath which a tongue is partly detached
                    by a longitudinal slit. We do not see the probable operation of chance so
                    clearly here as in the double reed. It may have been the inconvenience resulting
                    from the employment of double-tongued reeds of large dimensions to make
                    cylindrical pipes of a certain diameter speak that urged the invention of a more
                    commodious substitute. With double <hi rend="italic">auloi</hi> it would have
                    been almost impossible to blow two double reeds at one time, while, on the
                    contrary, it is easy to sound two pipes furnished with beating reeds introduced
                    simultaneously into the player’s mouth. Such as these are the actual Egyptian
                    <hi rend="italic">arghoul</hi> and <hi rend="italic">zummdrah.</hi> It is in the
                    beating reed and cylindrical tube, a combination bequeathed to us by remote
                    antiquity, that we find the principle of one of the leading instruments of the
                    modem orchestra, the clarinet or clarionet.</p>
                <p>The European chalumeau of the Middle Ages, in English “shawm,” differed but
                    little from the ancient Egyptian chalumeau: its tube was of wood, and the upper
                    part of the tube communicated with the bore by an opening made laterally and
                    longitudinally, on the edges of which the reed-tongue was bound by repeated
                    turns of string. Neither in the Middle Ages nor in the 16th century do we find
                    the chalumeau much employed. Praetorius, who in his <hi rend="italic">Theatrum
                    instrumentorum</hi> has given exact drawings of the instruments he knew, does
                    not cite the chalumeau. But there exists in the fine collection of the Liceo
                    Musicale at Bologna a double chalumeau of wood covered with leather, the make of
                    which takes it back to the 16th century. Drawings of this instrament occur in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> of Diderot and D’Alembert, and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Muzykaal Kunstwoorderiboek</hi> of J. Verschure-Reynvaan
                    (Amsterdam, 1795). The chalumeau was pierced with eight holes and with two keys,
                    and produced the following series of fundamental sounds—</p>

                <p>The present writer has had the good fortune to find quite recently two examples
                    in the National Museum at Munich, and has been kindly authorized by Herr von
                    Hefner-Alteneck, director of the museum, to reproduce them for the museum of the
                    conservatoire at Brussels. For one of these see fig. 6. It is from this
                    reproduction that he has been enabled to determine the exact nature of the
                    improvement of the chalumeau, about 1690, by Christopher Denner of Nuremberg, an
                    improvement which has gained for him the reputation of having invented the
                    clarinet. Every clarinet player knows that it is sufficient for one of the upper
                    keys not to quite close the hole for it to produce, instead of the fundamental
                    sound, the interval of the twelfth above it,—in other words, the second partial.
                    This phenomenon is easily explained: the communication between the external air
                    and the upper part of the air-column in the instrument forms a ventral segment
                    or loop of vibration and forces the column to divide, and, as a cylindrical pipe
                    affected by a reed sounds harmonically after the manner of stopped pipes, the
                    possible partial after the fundamental is naturally the second. This phenomenon
                    must have struck Denner, and have suggested to him the idea of obtaining the
                    same result according to a regular manner and at the will of the executant. He
                    arrived at it by raising a little the key governed by the thumb of the left
                    hand, which when opened conjointly with the A key produced the Bh of the
                    chalumeau. This change of position of the key did not hinder the production of
                    the Bh, but doubled at one stroke the extent of compass of the instrument in
                    giving it the following notes—</p>

                    first to make use of the artifice already referred to which permits instruments
                    of cylindrical bore to produce fundamental sounds and then-twelfths.</p>

                <p>About the middle of last century the clarinet was lengthened <hi

                    added, v y. -. j≡ ≡3, which filled the vacant space between the two registers.
                    Two new keys were also added,</p>
                <p>-j- <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> -!—</p>
                <p>it is said, by Barthold Fritz of Brunswick <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> st P</p>
                <p>1766). The sixth key, i⅛, is attributed to the clarinetist Lefebvre, Paris, about
                    1791. In 1810 Ivan Muller carried the number of keys up to thirteen, in which
                    state the instrument has come to us, and is the system most employed. It has
                    been improved by the Belgian makers, Bachmann, the elder Sax, C. Mahillon, and
                    Albert, who have collectively established the reputation of Belgian clarinets.
                    In Paris, Lefebvre, Buffet-Crampon, and his successor Goumas—in London, Rudall,
                    Bose, and Carte, justly own a high position among famous clarinet-makers. The
                    firm of C. Mahillon, Brussels, have invented the mechanism with double effect
                    known by the name of C⅛ key. Invented in 1862, it is now universally adopted. In
                    1842 the Parisian maker Buffet, advised by a professor named Klosé, adopted from
                    Boehm’s flute the invention of movable rings. His clarinet has consequently been
                    ranked as of Boehm’s system, although the lateral division of the tube does not
                    follow that which that clever maker applied to his flute. The clarinet was first
                    employed in a theatre in 1751, in the pastoral by Rameau entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeante</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cephise.</hi> The imperfections of the instrument at that time obliged them to
                    be made in nearly every key. To avoid the burden of this the 18th-century
                    players varied the key of their instruments by added joints. About the middle of
                    the 18th century the clarinet was introduced in military music and by degrees
                    supplanted the oboe. The instruments used, at first were in C and F. About 1815
                    they were replaced by the Bb and Eb clarinets.</p>
                <p>Besides the high clarinets, the basset horn (Italian, corno di bassetto) was soon
                    known in Germany; a clarinet in F with the grave fifth of the one in C, it was
                    made to descend easily to with the help of supplementary keys, and to diminish
                    the length of the tube it was bent back upon itself in the part nearest to the
                    bell,—the curve being enclosed in a kind of box which concealed the artifice.
                    The invention of the basset horn is attributed to a Bavarian maker at Passau,
                    who was living about 1770, but whose name is now unknown. Obtaining the
                    improvements given to it by Theodore Lotz of Pressburg in 1782, and Ivan Muller
                    in 1812, and those of contemporary makers, the basset horn has become the
                    beautiful alto clarinet which is generally used in the key of Eb.</p>
                <p>It would appear that the first idea of the bass clarinet emanated from Henri
                    Greuser of Dresden, who made the first one in 1793. It was not used in the
                    orchestra until 1836, when Meyerbeer made magnificent employment of it in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Huguenots.</hi></p>
                <p>The almost forgotten clarinet d’amour was made in G and F, the fourth and fifth
                    below the clarinet in C. It differed from other clarinets in the bell, which,
                    retracted in the lower part, affected the pear-shaped contour that distinguishes
                    the modern cor anglais.</p>
                <p>A few words remain to be said about the combination of the beating reed with a
                    conical tube, which goes no farther back than the beginning of this century. A
                    fagottino in F, called “dolcino,” was at that time used, the air-column of which
                    was more decidedly conical than that of the fagottino properly so called. The
                    double reed was replaced in it by a beating reed attached to a mouthpiece like
                    that of the clarinet but smaller. This instrument seems not to have had success.
                    But the most important combination of beating reed and conical tube was
                    accomplished in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian established in Paris, who
                    invented the family of saxophones. This instrument is a brass tube pierced to
                    produce the following</p>
                <p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15</p>
                <p>In virtue of the principle previously explained, the saxophone “octaves,” and,
                    setting out from the fourth fundamental, each note can be reproduced in the next
                    upper octave by the help of two keys successively employed, which, by opening,
                    form a loop. Four more keys disposed at the upper end permit the production
                    of</p>
                <p>∑⅛-=3, which completes the compass of the saxophone. Four instruments of the
                    saxophone family are now used, viz., the soprano in Bb, a major second below the
                    note written; the alto in Eb, a fifth below the soprano; the tenor in Bb, an
                    octave below the soprano; and the baritone in Eb, an octave below the alto.
                    These instruments fill an important place in the military music of France and
                    Belgium. The brilliant success which Ambroise Thomas has achieved by using the
                    beautiful tone of the alto saxophone in the ghost scene in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamlet</hi> is well known. (V. Μ. )</p>
