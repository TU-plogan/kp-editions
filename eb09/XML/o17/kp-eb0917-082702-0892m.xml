                    and with many variations in the tragedians. He was preserved by his sister
                    Electra, and conveyed to Phanote on Mount Parnassus, where king Strophius took
                    charge of him. In his twentieth year he was ordered by the oracle to return home
                    and revenge his father’s death. According to Aeschylus, he met his sister
                    Electra before the tomb of Agamemnon, whither both had gone to perform rites to
                    the dead; a recognition takes place, and they arrange how Orestes shall
                    accomplish his revenge. Orestes, after the deed, goes mad, and is pursued by the
                    Erinnyes, whose duty it is to punish any violation of the ties of family piety.
                    He takes refuge in the temple at Delphi; but, though Apollo had ordered him to
                    do. the deed, he is powerless to protect his suppliant from the consequences. At
                    last Athena receives him on the acropolis of Athens and arranges a formal trial
                    of the case before twelve Attic judges. The Erinnyes demand their victim; he
                    pleads the orders of Apollo; the votes of the judges are equally divided, and
                    Athena gives her casting vote for acquittal. The Erinnyes are propitiated by a
                    new ritual, in which they are worshipped as Eumenides (the Kindly), and Orestes
                    dedicates an altar to Athena Areia. Such is the account in which authorities
                    generally agree, but Euripides introduces a different series of adventures after
                    Orestes has taken refuge at Delphi. Apollo orders him to go to Tauris, carry off
                    the statue of Artemis which had fallen from heaven, and bring it to Athens. He
                    repairs to Tauris with Pylades, and the pair are at once imprisoned by the
                    people, among whom the custom is to sacrifice all strangers to Artemis. The
                    priestess of Artemis, whose duty it is to perform the sacrifice, is Iphigeneia,
                    the daughter of Agamemnon, who had been transported hither by the goddess when
                    her father was about to offer her (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Iphigeneia).</hi>
                    She offers to release Orestes if he will carry home a letter from her to Greece;
                    he refuses to go, but bids Pylades take the letter while he himself will stay
                    and be slain. After a conflict of mutual affection, Pylades at last yields, but
                    the letter brings about a recognition between brother and sister, and all three
                    escape together, carrying with them the image of Artemis.</p>
                <p>Orestes appears also as a central figure in the legends of many other places. In
                    Cappadocia he introduced the worship of Artemis Tauropolos at Comana and
                    Castabala. Near Gythium in Laconia was a stone called Zeus Cappotas; here the
                    madness left Orestes. In Trcezen there was before the temple of Artemis a stone
                    on which Orestes was purified, and a hut in front of the temple of Apollo
                    Thearius in which he stayed till the purification was accomplished. Seven stadia
                    from Megalopolis, on the left of the road to Messene, was a shrine of the
                    Maniae, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the Erinnyes. Immediately beyond it was a
                    tumulus, on the summit of which was an upright stone like a finger, <hi
                    rend="italic">Δακτύλου Κίνημα,</hi> where Orestes bit off his own finger in his
                    madness. Beyond the mound was another shrine of the Erinnyes, worshipped now as
                    Eumenides in association with the Charites (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Graces).</hi> Here the Erinnyes, who had hitherto appeared black to Orestes,
                    appeared white to him, and the madness left him. Then he cut off his hair as an
                    offering at a place <hi rend="italic">'K.oυρeiov.</hi> The name of the tumulus
                    is clearly connected with the belief still frequently occurring that a hand
                    appears out of the tomb of any person who has murdered a mother or been murdered
                    by her. The tumulus itself was obviously one of those graves, which were
                    especially common in Lydia, a tumulus with a pillar on the apex; such tumuli
                    were found in Laconia, where, as Athenaeus says, they were called "the graves of
                    the Phrygians who came with Pelops.” <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0893-0828"/> In these legends it is apparent that Orestes is
                    the guilt - laden mortal who is purified from his sin by the grace of the gods;
                    his purification is a type of the merciful justice which the gods intend should
                    be shown to all persons whose crime is mitigated by extenuating circumstances.
                    These legends belong to an age when higher ideas of law and of social duty were
                    being established; the implacable blood-feud of primitive society gives place to
                    a fair trial of the culprit, and in Athens, when the votes of the judges are
                    evenly divided, mercy prevails. In the religion of Delphi similar ideas underlie
                    the ancient festival Septerion: in it Apollo himself is the murderer, and his
                    example sets forth to mankind the method of purification which heaven opens to
                    such sinners, if they are not entirely and wilfully guilty. Orestes is not a
                    figure of the Apollo religion, but is clearly connected with the cultus of the
                    Erinnyes; and his relation to these goddesses, and the intention of the myth,
                    are very plain in the Megalopolitan legend above mentioned. The Troezenian
                    legend has no appearance of being really ancient, just as the tales that connect
                    Orestes with the district Orestea in Arcadia, or Orestias in Epirus, are
                    obviously fictions of a later time. On the other hand, the Orestes of Tauric and
                    Cappadocian legend is a different person, connected with the spread of
                    Artemis-worship; it is not improbable that a similarity of name caused the
                    identification of two heroes belonging respectively to the cultus of Artemis and
                    of the Erinnyes.</p>
                <p>Orestes had an historic part assigned to him as Greek mythology became
                    systematized. Phocian auxiliaries restored him to the throne of his father, and,
                    according to Hellanicus, he began the Aeolic migration to Asia Minor. He was
                    buried on the road from Tegea to Thyrea, and Herodotus (it 67) tells a quaint
                    story of the manner in which the Spartans discovered his bones and, in obedience
                    to an oracle, carried them to Sparta.</p>
