                    rend="smallcaps">Jean Dominique,</hi> one of the most popular physicists
                    belonging to the first half of the present century, was born on the 26th
                    February 1786, at Estagel, a small village near Perpignan, in the department of
                    the Eastern Pyrenees. His father was a licentiate in law, and, being appointed
                    treasurer of the mint for the department, τemoved with his family to Perpignan
                    about the beginning of the century. Arago has left an autobiographical sketch,
                    drawn with great vivacity, though touched occasionally with somewhat high
                    colouring; and to this we are indebted for the incidents of the earlier portion
                    of his life. From boyhood he had decided military tastes, inspired by constant
                    contact with troops at his native village, which was a halting station for
                    soldiers on their way to Perpignan, or to the army of the Pyrenees. François was
                    sent as an outdoor pupil to the municipal college of Perpignan, and began to
                    study mathematics with an eye to the entrance examination to the Polytechnic
                    school. Here he was soon beyond the depth of his master’s knowledge; but, with
                    that undaunted spirit which carried him through many hardships and difficulties
                    in after life, he sent to Paris for the works of Legendre, Lacroix, and Garnier,
                    and studied them assiduously in private. Within two years and a half he had
                    mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a great deal more; he
                    had read Euler’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Analyse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Infinitesimale,</hi> Lagrange’s <hi rend="italic">Théorie des Fonctions
                    Analytiques</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique,</hi> and Laplace’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste.</hi> He does not indeed pretend to have
                    understood at the time all he read in these works, but he had been early
                    encouraged by D’Alembert’s maxim, “Go on, and the light will come to you,” and
                    he had carried it into practice. On going up for examination at Toulouse he
                    completely astounded his examiner, Μ. Monge, by his knowledge of Lagrange, and
                    received the highest commendation from him. Towards the close of 1803 he entered
                    the Polytechnic school, with the artillery service as the aim of his ambition.
                    We have in the autobiography many amusing instances of the inefficiency of some
                    of the Polytechnic professors at that time, of the peculiarly French familiarity
                    existing between professors and pupils, as well as of the political passions
                    absurdly allowed to distract the school. In 1804, through the advice and
                    recommendation of Poisson, with whom he had become very intimate, Arago received
                    the appointment of secretary to the Observatory of Paris, a valuable post for a
                    young man of science, as it brought him in contact with the most eminent
                    philosophers of the day. He now became acquainted with Laplace, and he had as
                    fellow-worker in the laboratory the celebrated Biot. Through the influence of
                    Laplace with the Government, Arago and Biot were commissioned to complete the
                    meridional measurements which had been begun by Delambre, and interrupted since
                    the death of Méchain in 1804. The object of this survey was to determine, with
                    as great nicety as possible, the ten-millionth part of a quadrant of the
                    meridian through Paris, which had been agreed upon by the National Convention as
                    the standard unit of length, and named the <hi rend="italic">mètre.</hi> To
                    measure an actual quadrant from the north pole was, of course, an impossibility;
                    but the plan adopted was to measure the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to
                    Barcelona, and from their know n difference of latitude to deduce the length of
                    the quadrant. For this purpose they left Paris in 1806, to commence operations
                    among the mountains of Spain—operations attended with the greatest personal
                    privation, fatigue, and danger. Biot returned to Paris after they had determined
                    the latitude of Formentera, the southernmost point to which they were to carry
                    the survey, leaving Arago to make the geodetical connection of Majorca with
                    Ivica and with Formentera.</p>
                <p>The adventures and difficulties of the latter were now only beginning. The
                    political ferment caused by the entrance of the French into Spain extended to
                    these islands, and the ignorant populace began to suspect that Arago’s movements
                    and his blazing fires on the top of Mount Galatzo were telegraphic signals to
                    the invading army. They became ultimately so infuriated that he was obliged to
                    cause himself to be incarcerated in the fortress of Belver in June 1808. On the
                    28th July he managed to escape from the island in a fishing boat, and after an
                    adventurous voyage he reached Algiers on the 3d August. Under the disguise of a
                    strolling merchant he procured a passage in a vessel bound for Marseilles. A
                    journey, however, of eleven months was before him ere he was destined to reach
                    that port, for the vessel fell into the hands of a Spanish corsair on the 16th
                    August, just as it was nearing Marseilles. With the rest of the crew, Arago was
                    taken to Rosas, and imprisoned first in a windmill, and afterwards in the
                    fortress of that seaport, until the town fell into the hands of the French, when
                    the prisoners were transferred to Palamos. After fully three months’
                    imprisonment they were released on the demand of the Dey of Algiers, and again
                    set sail for Marseilles on the 28th Nov., but when within sight of their port
                    they were driven back by a southerly wind to Bougia on the coast of Africa.
                    Transport to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary stay
                    of three months; and with his usual courage, Arago set out for it by land under
                    conduct of a Mahometan priest, reaching it on Christmas day, after encountering
                    many perils from lions, and having uncomfortable squabbles with natives on the
                    way. A six months’ stay in Algiers gave him opportunity to note the manners and
                    habits of the people, of which he gives some amusing and graphic accounts. Once
                    again, 21st June 1809, he set sail for his native land; and, as by some strange
                    perversity of fortune, he had to undergo a monotonous and inhospitable
                    quarantine in the Lazaretto at Marseilles before his difficulties were over. The
                    first letter he received, while in the Lazaretto, was from Humboldt at Paris,
                    sympathising with him, and congratulating him on the termination of his
                    laborious and perilous enterprise; and this was the origin of a connection <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0320-0301"/> which, in Arago’s words, “lasted over forty years
                    without a single cloud ever having troubled it.”</p>
                <p>Through all the vicissitudes of this long campaign Arago had succeeded in
                    preserving the records of his survey; and his first act on his return home was
                    to deposit them in the Bureau de Longitude at Paris. As a reward for his
                    adventurous conduct in the cause of science, he was shortly afterwards (17th
                    Sept. 1809) voted a member of the Academy of Sciences, in room of the deceased
                    Lalande, at the remarkably early age of twenty-three, being, to the vexation of
                    Laplace, elected by a large majority of votes over his friend Poisson. Before
                    the close of the same year (1809) Arago was chosen by the council of the
                    Polytechnic school to succeed Μ. Monge in the chair of analytical geometry; and
                    about the same time he was named by the emperor one of the astronomers of the
                    Royal Observatory, which was accordingly his residence till his death. He was
                    also made one of the examiners in connection with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >École</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Application</hi> for
                    engineers and artillery at Metz. In all these situations he rapidly attained
                    very great popularity, gaining the esteem of his pupils by the charming
                    clearness of his style in lecturing and the personal interest he showed in their
                    progress.</p>
                <p>In 1816, along with Gay-Lussac, Arago commenced a monthly journal of science, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et de</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique,</hi>
                    which soon acquired that high scientific reputation which it has always
                    maintained. In the same year the two philosophers visited England, and made the
                    personal acquaintance of some of the most eminent men of that country, meeting
                    among others Dr Thomas Young, a memoir of whom was afterwards written by Arago.
                    In 1818 or 1819, Arago proceeded along with Biot to execute, on the coasts of
                    France, England, and Scotland, the geodetic operations which the Board of
                    Longitude had directed. They also measured the length of the seconds’ pendulum
                    at Leith, and in Unst, one of the Shetland isles; the results of the
                    observations being published in 1821, along with those made in Spain. He was
                    elected a member of the Board of Longitude immediately afterwards, and proved a
                    valuable addition to the society, contributing to each of its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annuals,</hi> for about twenty-two years, most important scientific notices on
                    astronomy and meteorology, and occasionally on civil engineering, as well as
                    interesting memoirs of members of the Academy.</p>
                <p>After his appointment to the Observatory, Arago had commenced, at the request of
                    the Board of Longitude, a series of popular lectures on astronomy, which were
                    continued from 1812 to 1845. His success as a lecturer was almost unparalleled,
                    and can only be compared to that of Faraday. All ranks flocked to hear him,
                    fascinated by his graceful eloquence and his crystalline clearness of
                    explanation. He used to remark, what many lecturers often forget, that “<hi
                    rend="italic">clearness is politeness in public speakers.”</hi> His manner in
                    lecturing is said to have been to fix his eye on some one of his audience, whose
                    intellect had apparently the minimum of development, and to keep it fixed till
                    the face should brighten up with intelligence.</p>
                <p>When Buonaparte’s hopes of empire in Europe had begun to wane, and he was turning
                    to America as a land of refuge, where he might still have scope for his
                    ambition, he suggested to Μ. Monge that, with a scientific guide, he should
                    explore the new continent from Canada to Cape Horn, study the great physical
                    wonders of that territory, and leave behind him works and discoveries worthy of
                    himself. Monge named Arago as the proper associate and assistant in the
                    enterprise, and had even negotiated with Napoleon for a handsome allowance to be
                    granted to Arago, and for a fund to be devoted to the purchase of a complete set
                    of astronomical and physical instruments. But Arago would not for a moment
                    entertain the proposal. He pointed the emperor to the march of the English and
                    Prussian armies on his capital as a matter demanding more pressing
                    consideration, and declined to leave the Old World to study science in the New,
                    “when France might perhaps lose its independence and disappear from the map of
                    Europe.” Subsequent events prevented a renewal of Napoleon’s scientific
                    negotiations and projects.</p>
                <p>After the Restoration Arago took no very prominent part in the politics of the
                    day, though he at all times maintained with boldness and ardour liberal opinione
                    of the extreme republican type. By the revolution of 1830, however, he was
                    summoned from the studies of the observatory and the laboratory to the field of
                    political strife in the Chamber of Deputies, and in the Municipal Council of
                    Paris. Elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Lower Seine, he
                    employed his splendid gifts of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all
                    questions connected with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the
                    encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many of the most
                    creditable national enterprises, dating from this period, are due to the
                    advocacy of Arago—such as the reward to Daguerre for his wonderful invention of
                    photography, the grant for the publication of the works of Fermat and Laplace,
                    the acquisition of the museum of Cluny (one of the sights of Paris), the
                    development of railroads and electric telegraphs, the improvement of the
                    navigation of the Seine, and the boring of the Artesian wells at Grenelle.</p>
                <p>The year 1830 was a remarkable epoch in his life on account of several other
                    offices to which he was appointed. He now received the chief direction of the
                    Observatory, and from his position in the Chamber of Deputies he obtained grants
                    of money for the rebuilding of part of the Observatory and for the addition of
                    magnificent instruments, which raised it to be a model, in place of a public
                    disgrace, as it had been before. In the same year, too, his zeal in the cause of
                    science was rewarded with the highest honour any philosopher might aspire to—the
                    perpetual secretaryship of the Academy of Sciences, in room of the distinguished
                    Fourier. On the 7th June (1830) he was elected by 39 out of 44 votes. This
                    appointment inspired new life into the Academy. Arago threw his whole soul into
                    its service, and by his pleasing faculty of securing friendship and lifelong
                    attachments, he gained at once for himself and for the Academy a world-wide
                    reputation. As perpetual secretary it fell to him to pronounce historical <hi
                    rend="italic">éloges</hi> on the decease of resident or foreign members of the
                    Academy; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of thought, his happy
                    piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge peculiarly adapted him. Some of
                    his <hi rend="italic">éloges</hi> are masterpieces of elegant biography. When Μ.
                    Flourens pronounced Arago’s own funeral eulogy, he said, “In the eulogies of the
                    eloquent secretary are found all the qualities of his spirit, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d’une verve</hi><hi rend="italic">brillante, de la vigueur,</hi><hi

                    513.)</p>
                <p>In 1834 Arago visited England for the second time, to attend the third meeting of
                    the British Association, held that year in Edinburgh. From this time till the
                    stirring events of 1848, Arago led a life of comparative quiet,— not the quiet
                    of inactivity, however, for his incessant labours within the Academy and the
                    Observatory produced a multitude of contributions to all departments of physical
                    science, which make him one of the most voluminous of authors in this subject.
                    But the change came. Louis Philippe, having failed to satisfy the extreme
                    republican party, and to grant them those social advantages that they imagined a
                    republic alone could yield, was swept from his throne, and Arago left his
                    laboratory to join in forming an extempore government. His popularity was so
                    great <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0321-0302"/> that he was entrusted with the discharge of two
                    most important functions, that had never before been united in one person, viz.,
                    the Ministry of War and of Marine. Energetically and faithfully the philosopher
                    of forty years’ standing applied himself to his new duties; and however
                    ignominious may have been the ultimate failure of the Provisional Government,
                    there can be little question that Arago struggled honestly in the cause of
                    social liberty and improvement. While Minister of Marine he effected some
                    salutary reforms, such as the improvement of rations in the navy and the
                    abolition of flogging; he abolished political oaths of all kinds, and, against
                    an array of monied interests, he succeeded in procuring the abolition of negro
                    slavery in the colonies.</p>
                <p>During the insurrection of June, Arago’s courage was conspicuously! displayed in
                    his entreaties to the mob to stop their murderous outrages. For the first time
                    in his life Arago failed, and he himself narrowly escaped with his life. With
                    his mental and physical energies shattered by fatigue and disappointment, he
                    terminated here his active political career, though he continued to the last to
                    take an interest in the affairs of his country, and to watch for the dawn of a
                    brighter future. Failing eye and trembling hand could now be of little use in
                    the service of science; but warned by the disease (diabetes) that had attacked
                    him, he determined to occupy his few remaining years in preparing for the press
                    some MSS. of original researches which his political duties had prevented his
                    communicating to the Institute.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of May 1852 proclamation was made that the oath of allegiance to
                    the Government of Louis Napoleon would be required from all its functionaries,
                    including the Board of Longitude. Arago peremptorily refused, choosing to
                    sacrifice his office and home of nearly half a century rather than violate the
                    dictates of his conscience, which he would be doing if he complied, seeing that,
                    as a member of the Provisional Government of 1848, he contributed to the
                    abolition of all political oaths. In a letter to the Minister of Public
                    Instruction, he intimated his resignation of his post as astronomer at the
                    Bureau de Longitude, at the same time stating the services he had rendered to
                    his country in the cause of science, and the grief which this separation from
                    the scene of his labours of so many years would impose. To the credit of the
                    Prince President, he respected the sentiments so boldly declared by the
                    halfblind old philosopher, and made “an exception in favour of a savant whose
                    works had thrown lustre on France, and whose existence his Government would
                    regret to embitter.”</p>
                <p>The tenure of office thus granted did not prove of long duration. Arago was now
                    on his death-bed, under a complication of diseases, induced, no doubt, by the
                    hardships and labours of his earlier years. In the summer of 1853 he was advised
                    by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he accordingly set
                    out for the Eastern Pyrenees, accompanied by his affectionate niece, Madame
                    Langier. But the change was unavailing, and he returned to Paris to die. After a
                    lingering illness, in which he suffered first from diabetes, then from Bright’s
                    disease, and lastly from dropsy, he breathed his last on the 2d Oct. 1853, at
                    the age of 67. The day before his death he had been visited by Lord Brougham,
                    his old and intimate friend, and the interview had excited him much. Μ. Biot
                    also had an interview with him only three hours before his death. Arago said to
                    his veteran colleague and <hi rend="italic">collabor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ateτιr,</hi> "I intend to resign my situation of perpetual secretary to the
                    Academy, since I can no longer discharge its duties.” Biot’s reply must have
                    smoothed the pillow of the dying savant, “If you do, we will all come to you in
                    a body to bring it back to you, and reproach you for your ingratitude.” A public
                    funeral was, with good taste, decreed to Arago by the emperor, notwithstanding
                    his refused allegiance to the Imperial Government, and it took place on the 5th
                    Oct. with all the pomp and parade of an Imperial act. A beautiful and eloquent
                    eulogy was pronounced over his tomb by the distinguished Μ. Flourens, who
                    succeeded him as perpetual secretary of the Academy, while Μ. Barral performed
                    the duty entrusted to him by the young philosophers of the public schools of the
                    metropolis of giving utterance to their last adieu.</p>
                <p>Thus closed perhaps the most singular career in the annals of science. Of Arago’s
                    moral character it is difficult to form a true estimate, extolled as it is on
                    the one side by his countrymen, and too severely criticised as it often is on
                    the other side by British writers. Allowance must be made for the Spanish blood
                    that flowed in his veins. The ardour of his temperament, his quick and far
                    darting intellect, the powerful love of country which his youthful vicissitudes
                    had only intensified, all combined to produce a consciousness of power, which,
                    in the Academy of Sciences or in the management of the Observatory, might stamp
                    his bearing as dictatorial, and which, in questions of national priority of
                    invention, might render his judgment partial. With the imperiousness, perhaps,
                    of a powerful intellect, Arago was free from that selfishness that has so often
                    been exhibited by men who have enjoyed such high offices of trust during times
                    of national disorder. He cared for money only as it supplied the wants of his
                    experimental researches and the means of educating his family; he lived a simple
                    and a frugal life; his income never exceeded £500 a year; and, refusing to
                    accept any reward for his four months’ services as Minister of Marine, he
                    sacrificed fortune for the sake of his country and of science.</p>
                <p>From he personal history of Arago we turn to his literary and scientific labours
                    and discoveries. It has been already shown that, as editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annuaire</hi> or Almanac of the Board of Longitude, he commenced,
                    in 1822, a series of regular contributions of scientific articles to that
                    Annual, remarkable for their lucidity of style, united with mathematical
                    accuracy of detail; that, as perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, his
                    <hi rend="italic">éloges</hi> alone would have secured him lasting reputation;
                    and that, as director of the Observatory, he rapidly restored its efficiency and
                    completely remodelled it. He has, indeed, been often accused of doing little or
                    nothing for the practical advancement of astronomy; and of shrinking from the
                    steady and regular drudgery of observation as too tame to be congenial to his
                    versatile mind. To reproach a man who has done much, because he has not done
                    more, or because he has not followed in the beaten track, is, to say the least,
                    far from generous criticism. His applications of physics to astronomical
                    research—such as to his photometric measurements of lunar and stellar
                    brightness, of the polar snows of Mars, and of . the belts of Jupiter and
                    Saturn, to the structure of the sun as revealed by his spots, to the effect of
                    atmospheric refraction on astronomical observations, to irradiation and variable
                    stars—are surely in themselves not despicable contributions to the science. But
                    apart altogether from his labours in the Observatory, he has rendered vastly
                    greater service to astronomy by Ins popular expositions of it than hundreds of
                    the most assiduous observers put together. Few have had, in such a degree as he,
                    the gift of reducing the abstract conceptions of pure science to the level of
                    the popular apprehension without descending to the puerile and frivolous.</p>
                <p>In 1820, when the subject of steam boilers was attracting attention, Arago was
                    employed by Government to execute, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n322/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0322-0303"/> along with Dulong, a series of experiments on the
                    elastic force of steam at different temperatures. This difficult and most
                    hazardous task, where they were exposed to the bursting of a boiler at any
                    moment, they accomplished with the greatest ability and coolness. Of these
                    experiments, as well as of others,—on the density of air, on the velocity of
                    sound, on the pressure of gases being proportional to their density,
                    &lt;fcc.,—there will be found elaborate memoirs in the <hi rend="italic">Comptes
                    Rendus</hi> of the Academy, and in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">de Physique.</hi></p>
                <p>It is, however, on his contributions to Magnetism and Optics that Arago’s fame as
                    an experimenter and discoverer rests. By employing the method of oscillating
                    needles, he established the universal influence of magnetism on all substances,
                    though it was left to Faraday to make the grander generalisations of
                    diamagnetism. Arago found that a magnetic needle, made to oscillate over
                    non-ferru-ginous surfaces, such as water, glass, copper, &amp;c., falls more
                    rapidly in the extent of its oscillations according as it is more or less
                    approached to the surface. Over ice, for example, an oscillation of 53° on each
                    side of the magnetic meridian, fell to 43° after 60 oscillations at a distance
                    of 52 j millimetres from the ice; while, at a distance of 7 mm., it fell by the
                    same amount after 26 oscillations. Over glass there was a fall from 90° to 41°
                    in 221 oscillations, at a distance of 4Ό1 mm., and in 122 oscillations at a
                    distance of *91 mm. For this discovery Arago was awarded the Copley medal‘by the
                    Royal Society of London in 1825; and he has the honour of being the first
                    foreigner to whom this distinction was accorded. This discovery was followed by
                    another. It occurred to him to try, conversely, the effect of oscillating or
                    rotating a plate of non-ferruginous metal near a magnetic needle at rest. He
                    caused a plate of pure copper to revolve by clock-work, which was also of
                    copper, under a magnetic needle within a glass-receiver, and with a sheet of
                    paper between the needle and the revolving plate to prevent air currents.
                    Gradually the needle was drawn from the magnetic meridian, till finally, on a
                    very rapid rotation of the plate, it fairly swung round and continued in
                    constant rotation. An account of these experiments he read before the Academy of
                    Sciences, on the 7th March 1825, and they were exhibited in London in the
                    following April by Gay-Lussac, exciting universal interest among the
                    philosophers of this and other countries. This phenomenon of <hi rend="italic"
                    >rotatory magnetism,</hi> as it is termed, is indissolubly linked with the name
                    of Arago; but it was reserved for the genius of Faraday to offer the true
                    explanation of it, after it had long occupied the attention of Herschel,
                    Babbage, Barlow, Nobili, and other distinguished men, as well as of its
                    discoverer.</p>
                <p>Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded as having proved the long suspected
                    connection between the aurora borealis and the variations of the magnetic
                    elements. He established, too, the fact of an hourly variation of these,
                    traceable, no doubt, to the influence of the sun as an enormous magnet at a
                    distance. It is worth mentioning that Arago was the first to employ the galvanic
                    current for the permanent magnetisation of steel, though in the field of
                    electro-magnetism his discoveries and researches as a whole are not to be
                    compared with those of the profounder Ampère.</p>
                <p>It is, however, his investigations in Optics that form the most marked feature
                    and the crowning glory of Arago’s scientific career. We owe to him not only
                    important optical discoveries of his own, but the credit of stimulating the
                    genius of Fresnel, with whose history, as well as with that of Malus and of
                    Young, this part of his life is closely interwoven. Shortly after the beginning
                    of the present century the labours of the three philosophers last named were
                    shaping the modern doctrine of the undu latory theory of light. Malus had made
                    in 1808 his discovery of the polarisation of light by reflection, identifying it
                    with the effects of double refraction; Young had devised his beautiful theory of
                    interferences; and Fresnel had been simultaneously conducting elegant
                    experiments in the very same field as the English philosopher. It was the
                    communication to the French Academy of Sciences of a paper on this subject by
                    Fresnel that led to his intimacy with Arago. Fresnel’s arguments in favour of
                    the undu-latory doctrine found little favour with Laplace, Poisson, and Biot,
                    the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by
                    Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the
                    paper. This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and
                    Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further researches in this
                    subject. These investigations were rewarded by a remarkable discovery, in 1811,
                    the very year that Malus terminated his career so auspiciously begun. After
                    Huyghens’s time, when Iceland spar and rock crystal were alone supposed to have
                    the property of double refraction, mineralogists had suspected the same property
                    to exist in a number of other crystals, though it was often almost impossible to
                    determine its existence. But Arago discovered that a plate of any doubly
                    refracting crystal, such as selenite or mica, when interposed between two
                    similar polarising prisms or piles of glass plates, displays splendid tints,
                    varying in colour with the thickness of the plate and with its inclination to
                    the transmitted beam, and varying in intensity as the plate of mica or selenite
                    is turned round in its own plane. By this simple means double refraction may be
                    detected in the smallest plate of a crystal. The explanation of this remarkable
                    phenomenon was a difficult problem, and for some time perplexed both English and
                    Continental investigators. Dr Young, in 1814, ascribed the cause generally to
                    interference; but Arago saw that this explanation was incomplete. The clue to it
                    was, however, found in the law, established by the joint labours of Arago and
                    Fresnel, <hi rend="italic">that two polarised rays cannot interfere unless
                    polarised in the same or parallel planes.</hi> This involved the idea of <hi
                    rend="italic">transverse vibrations</hi> of the ether across the direction of
                    propagation, an idea which at first seemed a stumbling-block to the theory of
                    undulations, and which Fresnel and Arago did not venture for some time to
                    embrace. Once expressed, however, this theory of transverse vibrations reduced
                    the whole phenomena of polarisation to a simple mechanical effect, a <hi
                    rend="italic">resolution of rectilinear motion into two rectangular
                    components;</hi> and so far from upsetting the wave theory, it has by its very
                    simplicity and comprehensiveness but helped to establish it on a sure
                    foundation.</p>
                <p>Arago applied his discovery to the construction of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >polariscope,</hi> for estimating the feeblest amount of polarisation; and lie
                    used this instrument for some very interesting experiments on the polarisation
                    of the light of the sky (which is sunlight polarised by reflection from the
                    atmosphere), and on that of different incandescent and reflecting surfaces. He
                    also found that the moon and the tails of comets send light to the eye which is
                    slightly polarised, thus betraying its borrowed origin. But that of the sun,
                    being absolutely neutral, is only comparable (according to Arago) to the light
                    arising from incandescent vapours, thus distinguishing the sun from a solid or
                    liquid globe.</p>
                <p>We cannot do more than allude to Arago’s other optical papers and experiments. He
                    was, probably, the only Frenchman of his time who was well acquainted with
                    Young’s discoveries. The explanation by the doctrine of interference of the
                    colours of Newton’s rings received an important confirmation from an experiment
                    of Arago’s, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0323-0304"/> which proved them to arise from the mixture of
                    the pencils of light reflected at the two neighbouring surfaces. He pressed a
                    lens of glass against a plate of metal, in which case the central spot is white
                    or black when light polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence is
                    reflected at an angle greater or less than the polarising angle for glass; and
                    the rings vanish altogether at the polarising angle — results which Airy
                    subsequently proved conformable to the undulatory theory.</p>
                <p>To Arago is also due the discovery of the power of <hi rend="italic">rotatory
                    polarisation</hi> exhibited by quartz. He found that a beam of polarised light
                    transmitted along the axis of a crystal of quartz becomes depolarised, and
                    produces colours varying with the thickness of the crystal. If the polarised
                    light be homogeneous, and the analysing plate be placed athwart this polarised
                    beam so as to reflect none of it, the interposing of a quartz crystal will turn
                    round the polarised beam in its passage, so that when it falls on the analysing
                    plate it is no longer athwart it, and the light is partly reflected. The
                    researches in this field were taken up by Biot, Fresnel, Herschel, Seebeck,
                    Airy, and others; and the phenomenon was first explained by Airy to be due to
                    the fact that along the axis of a quartz crystal the beam consists of two
                    circularly polarised portions, while in other directions it consists of two
                    elliptically polarised portions. In some substances the rotation is to the right
                    hand, and in others to the left.</p>
                <p>Last of all, among the many contributions of Arago to the support of the
                    undulatory hypothesis, comes the <hi rend="italic">experimentum crucis</hi>
                    which he proposed to carry out for comparing directly the velocity of light in
                    air and in water or glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be
                    accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory, it
                    should be retarded. Wheatstone’s experiment, in 1835, of measuring the velocity
                    of the electric discharge had suggested the idea to Arago; and in 1838 he
                    communicated to the Academy the details of his apparatus. Owing to the great
                    care required in the carrying out of the project, and to the interruptions to
                    his labours by the events of the revolution, it was the spring of 1850 before he
                    was ready to put his idea to the test. But, as fate would have it, just at that
                    time his eye-sight suddenly <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> way. With a melancholy
                    resignation he consoled himseif with having merely laid down the problem and
                    having indicated the means of its solution, and with the hope that other
                    experimenters would follow in his steps and add a new proof in favour of the
                    undulatory system. Arago lived to see his wishes realised in the beautiful
                    experiments of Fizeau and Foucault, which, with improvements of detail in the
                    apparatus, were based on the plan proposed by him. These, as all the scientific
                    world knows, confirmed the deductions from the wave theory, and established the
                    retardation of the velocity of light in denser media. With this ended those
                    brilliant labours which have in no small degree contributed to render the
                    arguments in favour of the undulatory doctrine all but unanswerable,</p>
