                    >58°</hi> 18' and 61° 46' E. It was known to the Persian geographers as the Sea

                    derives its present name from the Kirghese designation of <hi rend="italic">Aral
                    Denghis,</hi> or Sea of Islands. Its length, from north to south, is 265 miles,
                    and its breadth, from east to west, about 145. It is the greatest body of water
                    in the steppes of Asia, next to the Caspian Sea, and is one of the largest lakes
                    in the world. Its level is 117 (or, according to recent explorations, which,
                    however, require verification, 250) feet above the Caspian, which is 84 feet
                    below the Black Sea. It is bounded on the JSΓ. by the Ural steppes; on the W. by
                    the rocky plateau of the Ust-Urt, which separates it from the Caspian; on the S.
                    by the alluvial district of Khiva; and on the E. by the Kysyl-Kum, or Red.
                    Desert, and the Kara-Kum, or Black Desert. In the north the shore is
                    comparatively low, and the coast-line is broken into a number of irregular bays,
                    of which the most important are those of Sary-Chaganak and Paskevitch; and on
                    the west an almost unbroken wall of rock extends from Chernycheff Bay
                    southwards, rising towards the middle to a height of 500 feet. The southern
                    coast is occupied by the delta of the Oxus (Jîhûn, Amu-Daria, El-Jiryan), which
                    divides into a number of channels, the most important of which, beginning from
                    the west, are the Aibugir or Laudan, the Ulu-or Ulkun-Daria (Great River), and
                    the Kuvan-Jarma, Kuk, or Yangy Su (New River), as it is variously called. The
                    Laudan forms a vast swamp, 80 miles long, and about 20 broad, before it
                    disembogues into the sea; and the whole of the neighbouring reaches are
                    extremely shallow. The only other tributary of any size is the Jax-artes (Sîhûn,
                    Syr-Daria, Shâsh), which enters towards the northern extremity of the east
                    coast, and is suspected to be shifting its course and embouchure more and more
                    to the north. The whole eastern coast is fringed with multitudes of small
                    islands, and a number of considerable size are situated in the open towards the
                    north and west. Kug-Aral, which is the largest of all, lies across the northern
                    portion opposite the mouth of the Syr-Daria, and cuts off what is called the
                    Kitchkine Dengis, or Little Sea. Proceeding south we find in succession,
                    Barsa-Kilmas, Nicholas Island, Bellinghausen, Lasaroff, and, near the mouth of
                    the Taldyk, Takmakdty. Upon some of these islands the Russian explorers found
                    large numbers of antelopes, which showed by their perfect fearlessness, combined
                    with their curiosity, that they had hitherto been undisturbed by man. For the
                    most part the Sea of Aral is comparatively shallow, the depth towards the west
                    coast being 37 fathoms, and towards the centre only 15. Navigation is rendered
                    dangerous by the frequency and violence of the storms, and the almost total
                    absence of shelter for ships. The northeast wind is the most prevalent, and
                    sometimes blows for months together. The only other craft, except the steamships
                    of the Russians, that venture on the waters, are the flat-bottomed boats of the
                    Kirghese. The first vessel ever known to have been launched on the Aral was
                    conveyed across the desert in pieces by the Russian Admiral Boutakoff, about
                    1848. The sea abounds with fish of various kinds, as the sturgeon, silurus,
                    carp, and especially a species of herring; thus agreeing in its ichthyology with
                    the Caspian, from which it is distant 150 miles. The water is only slightly
                    brackish. During winter the northern portion is completely frozen, but towards
                    the south it is very seldom that ice is formed to any extent. The Aral has no
                    visible outlet; and to account for there being no increase in its size, it was
                    supposed that there might be a subterraneous communication with the Caspian Sea
                    or the Sea of Khuzar; but the evaporation is so great as not only to maintain an
                    equilibrium, but even, it has been thought, to produce, as in the case of the
                    Caspian, a gradual diminution. In regard to the period of the formation of the
                    Aral there are two theories, each supported by high authority. According to Sir
                    H. Rawlinson <hi rend="italic">(^Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
                    Society,</hi> March 1867) the disturbances which produced the present lake took
                    place in the course of the Middle Ages; while Sir Roderick Murchison contends
                    <hi rend="italic">(Journal of Roy. Geog. Soc.</hi> 1867, p. cxliv., &amp;c.)
                    that the Caspian and Aral have existed as separate seas before and during all
                    the historic period, and that the main course of the rivers Jaxartes and Oxus
                    was determined in a prehistoric period. The former bases his opinion largely on
                    historical evidence, and the latter trusts principally to geological data. The
                    whole subject has been recently reviewed in <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aralseefrage,</hi> by Robert Roesler, Associate of the Imperial
                    Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1873.</p>
