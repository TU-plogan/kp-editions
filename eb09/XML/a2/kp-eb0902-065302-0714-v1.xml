                    of the Church of England, contain the public standard of religious belief
                    adopted by that body. They were drawn up by Archbishop Parker, sanctioned by
                    Convocation in 1562, and published by royal authority in the following year. The
                    general principles of this body of doctrine, and the form into which it was
                    thrown, had been gradually developed during the previous attempts to establish a
                    standard of faith in England. Soon after the authority of the Pope had been
                    thrown off by the English Church, there began to appear wide differences of
                    opinion with regard to the extent of reformation required. One party, the
                    conservative, held by the old practices of the Church of Rome; another, the
                    moderate reformers, desired to abolish these practices on account of the abuses
                    to which they were liable; while the various sects of the Anabaptists were eager
                    for radical reformation both of doctrine and of practice. Religious turbulence
                    and strife prevailed to such an extent that, in 1536, a set of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ten Articles</hi> was published by royal authority,
                    intended, as was expressly stated, to “stablyshe Christen quietnes and unitie
                    among us, and to avoid contentious opinions.” A considerable share in the
                    composition of this code was taken by Henry himself. The articles were evidently
                    intended as a compromise; they contained much that was afterwards rejected by
                    the church, and do not seem to have given <pb break="no"

                    though not authoritatively, superseded by the publication, in 1537, of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Institution of a Christian Man.</hi> For two or three years
                    before this negotiations had been carried on with the Continental reformers, and
                    proposals had been made for a general conference at which some universal
                    articles of faith might be considered. The conference took place but did not
                    attain the end desired, for Henry, at first favourably disposed, was swayed by
                    the influence of the anti-reformation party; and Cranmer, while able to come to
                    agreement with the German deputation so far as points of doctrine were
                    concerned, saw clearly that it would be a hopeless task to try to abolish all
                    the ancient ceremonies. The increasing influence of the conservative party led
                    to the passing, by Convocation and Parliament, in 1539, of Henry’s Six <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Articles,</hi> the “bloody statute,” or “whip with six
                    strings,” as they were then called, from the cruel persecutions to which they
                    gave rise. These articles enforced belief in transubstantiation, declared that
                    communion in both kinds was unnecessary, that the marriage of priests was
                    unlawful, that vows of chastity or widowhood were absolutely binding, that
                    private masses and auricular confession were expedient and necessary. The
                    severity of these doctrines was mitigated by the third authorised formulary of
                    Henry’s reign, <hi rend="italic">The Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any
                        Christian Man,</hi> called the “King’s Book,” and published in 1543. The
                    conference with the Germans, though not entirely successful, had not been
                    without fruit. Among Cranmer’s papers has been found a set of Thirteen Articles
                    bearing evident traces of the Continental ideas, and highly interesting on
                    account of the influence it exercised on the later formularies. Many of these
                    articles are drawn directly from the Augsburg Confession, and there seems no
                    doubt that they thus formed an intermediate step between that Confession and the
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Forty-two Articles</hi> of Edward. These were drawn up
                    by Cranmer in obedience to the command of the king and privy council, who, in
                    1551, ordered the archbishop to “frame a book of articles of religion, for the
                    preserving and maintaining peace and unity of doctrine in this church, that,
                    being finished, they might be set forth by public authority.” Great care was
                    taken in their preparation; the first draft was sent round to the bishops, then
                    revised by Cranmer, submitted to Cheke and Cecil, and to the six royal
                    chaplains, and finally laid before the council. In 1553 the mandate enjoining
                    subscription to them was granted by the king, but the articles had already been
                    printed in English. In the same year they were published in Latin, and appended
                    to a short catechism of Christian doctrine. It has been much disputed whether
                    these articles were sanctioned by Convocation, or were only circulated by order
                    of council; on the whole, the balance of probability seems to be in favour of
                    the supposition that they had received ecclesiastical sanction (Hardwick, <hi
                        rend="italic">History of the Articles,</hi> 106-112).</p>
                <p>During the reign of Mary these articles were suppressed, but, on the accession of
                    Elizabeth and the elevation of Parker to the see of Canterbury, attention was
                    again directed to the framing of some standard body of truth. A series of Eleven
                    Articles was drawn up in 1559, and was in use for some time; it had not,
                    however, full authority, though it was enforced in Ireland until 1615. In 1562
                    the houses of Convocation were summoned, and Parker laid before them a revised
                    copy of the Forty-Two Articles. In the work of revision he had been assisted by
                    Bishops Grindal, Horn, and Fox. The changes introduced by them were, for the
                    most part, Lutheran in tendency, and were probably influenced by the Würtemberg
                    Confession of 1551. Articles v., xii., xxix., and xxx. of the present set were
                    newly introduced; x., xvi., xix. (part being transferred to the present vii.),
                    and xli. of the old series were omitted. Seventeen other articles were modified
                    by partial omission, alteration, or substitution. Convocation further struck out
                    Articles xxxix., xl., and xlii.; made considerable alterations in iii. and
                    xxviii., and some slight changes in viii., xv., xxii., xxix., and xxxiii. A
                    Latin manuscript of Parker’s, containing a list of signatures, might be supposed
                    to give the final state of the document, but it differs from the extract taken
                    in 1637 by Laud’s order from the registers, both in regard to the signatures,
                    and in the omission of the first clause of Article xx. The articles, now
                    thirty-nine in number, were submitted to the queen, who is said to have read and
                    examined them. After nearly a year’s delay they were published in Latin. In this
                    edition the disputed clause of Article xx. is found, and Article xxix. is wholly
                    omitted. In the English version, printed in the same year, the clause of Article
                    xx. is wanting. In all editions after 1571, Article xxix. is inserted, and, with
                    one exception, the same is true of the clause in Article xx. A law (13 Eliz. c.
                    12) was passed in 1571, ordaining that the clergy “should subscribe to all the
                    articles which only concern the confession of a true Christian faith, and the
                    doctrine of the sacraments.” Convocation of the same year inserted Article
                    xxix., made a few slight changes, added a list of the Apocryphal books, and thus
                    gave the articles their present form. The only serious attempt at alteration was
                    made in 1595, when the Primate, Whitgift, accepted a series of articles proposed
                    by Dr Whitaker of Cambridge. These, generally known as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lambeth Articles,</hi> were strongly Calvinistic in tone. They did not
                    receive sanction, and were immediately suppressed. At a later date (1604) it was
                    again sought to introduce them, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The canons of
                    1604 enforced subscription, while the general relation of the articles to the
                    church was defined by the royal declaration of 1628 (now prefixed to them),
                    which enjoins the settlement of disputed points by Convocation, the acceptation
                    of the articles in their plain and full bearing, and the interpretation of them
                    in their literal and grammatical sense.</p>
                <p>The articles are not intended to be a complete system of theology, but only
                    enumerate certain truths of such primary importance that any one denying them is
                    thereby excluded from the church. They do not, however, furnish merely a
                    negative test; they were framed not only for the avoidance of diversity of
                    opinion, but for the establishment of consent regarding true religion.
                    Accordingly, they treat in order of the main points of theological doctrine, and
                    may be classified thus:-—(1.) Articles i,-v., the doctrine of the Trinity; (2.)
                    Articles vi.—viii., the rule of faith or sources of our knowledge of religious
                    matters; (3.) Articles ix.-xviii., the doctrines which concern the Christian as
                    an individual, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> sin, redemption, and their cognate
                    notions; (4.) Articles xix.-xxxix., the necessary relations of Christians as
                    members of a religious community, including the general theory of the church,
                    and the doctrine of the sacraments. The Church of Ireland continued to use the
                    Eleven Articles until 1615, when a more elaborate code was drawn up by Ussher.
                    This, in 1635, was superseded by the Thirty-Nine Articles, which were then
                    adopted by the Irish Church. The Episcopal Church in Scotland accepted the
                    articles in 1804, and in America the church subscribed to them in 1801,
                    excluding, however, the Athanasian Creed.</p>
