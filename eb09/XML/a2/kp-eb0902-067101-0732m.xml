                    ancient sculptures and antiquities, including the famous Parian Chronicle,
                    formed by Thomas earl of Arundel, and presented by his grandson, thè Hon. Henry
                    Howard (afterwards duke of Norfolk), to the University of Oxford in the year
                    1667. They were purchased for the first proprietor in 1624 by Mr (afterwards Sir
                    William) Petty, who, along with John Evelyn, had been employed by the earl of
                    Arundel to collect marbles, books, statues, and other curiosities in Italy,
                    Greece, and Asia Minor. On their arrival in London in the year 1627 they were
                    placed in the gardens of Arundel House, the site of which is now occupied by
                    Arundel, Norfolk, Surrey, and Howard Streets in the Strand. Thomas Howard, earl
                    of Arundel and Surrey, the founder of the collection, was born in 1586 (or,
                    according to others, 1592). He had at first only the honorary title Lord
                    Maltravers, but in 1603 he was restored to most of the honours previously in the
                    possession of his family. For several years he resided or travelled in Italy,
                    and there acquired a strong taste for works of art, specimens of which he began
                    to collect. In 1621 he was made earl marshal of England, and afterwards
                    discharged the offices of ambassador, general, and lord high steward. He went
                    abroad in 1641, and died at Padua in 1646. His large collection contained not
                    only sculptured marbles, but also coins, busts, statues, and gems. In the
                    turbulent reign of Charles I., and during the Protectorate, Arundel House was
                    often deserted by its owners; and, in their absence, some of the marbles were
                    defaced and broken, and others either stolen or used for the ordinary purposes
                    of architecture. After the death of the earl his collection was divided among
                    his family. The inscribed marbles, which fell to the elder son, ultimately found
                    their way to Oxford; the busts and some statues were sold and dispersed; and the
                    gems descended to the Marlborough family, in whose possession they now are. Some
                    of the statues, which had been purchased at the sale of Arundel House by Sir
                    William Fermor, were presented to the University of Oxford in 1755. Of the large
                    collection now known as the Arundel or Oxford marble3 the most remarkable is the
                    Parian Chronicle, or Marmor Chronicon. This when found consisted of a large
                    oblong slab of Parian marble, on which was engraved in capital letters a
                    chronological compendium of the principal events of Greece during a series of
                    1318 years, beginning with the reign of Cecrops, 1582 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and ending with the archonship of Diognetus, 264 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi> The marble originally measured 3 feet 7 inches and 2
                    feet 11 inches on the two sides respectively, its breadth being 2 feet 7 inches;
                    but the chronicle of the last 90 years is lost, so that the part now remaining
                    ends with the archonship of Diotimus, 354 years before the birth of Christ; and
                    in this fragment the inscription is at present so much corroded and effaced that
                    the sense must in some measure be supplied by conjecture. Immediately on the
                    arrival of these marbles in England the greatest curiosity was excited among
                    literary men. Selden, with the assistance of some other scholars, cleaned and
                    examined first the marble containing the Smyrnean and Magnesian league, and then
                    the Marmor Chronicon. The fo∏o∙wing year Selden published a small volume in
                    quarto, including about 39 inscriptions copied from the marbles. His researches
                    were continued and completed by Prideaux (1676), Maittaire (1732), and Chandler
                    (1763). The Arundelian marbles, though generally regarded as genuine relics of
                    antiquity, have been discovered in some instances to differ somewhat from the
                    most authentic historical accounts. Their authenticity was called in question in
                    a dissertation by the Rev. J. Robertson, published in 1788, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Parian Chronicle.</hi> This essay has been answered by several
                    writers, particularly by the eminent scholar, Professor Porson, and the
                    authenticity of the marbles may be regarded as fairly established. See Boeckh,
