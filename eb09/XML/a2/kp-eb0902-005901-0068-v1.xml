                    the assassin of Gustavus III., king of Sweden, was descended from an honourable
                    family, and was bom in 1759. After having been for some time at court as a page,
                    he entered the army, but left after a few years with the honorary rank of
                    captain. He is said to have been concerned in some treasonable projects, and to
                    have been pardoned by the king, but the story has not sufficient authority. The
                    Swedish nobles were about this time violently opposed to the king, who, by the
                    aid of the other orders of the state, had wrested their power from them, and was
                    now ruling despotically. This dislike was increased by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >coup d’état</hi> of 1789, and by the king’s known, desire to interfere in
                    favour of Louis XVIII. of France. Ankarström, a man of strong passions and
                    violent temper, resolved upon the assassination of Gustavus, and communicated
                    his intention to the disaffected nobles, and among others, to Counts Horn and
                    Ribbing, who would willingly have undertaken the deed themselves. After some
                    ineffectual attempts to seize the king’s person, a favourable opportunity
                    offered itself. A masked ball was held at Stockholm on the 16th March 1792,
                    which the king attended, though he had been warned against doing so by an
                    anonymous letter. By a preconcerted signal, Count Horn indicated his victim to
                    Ankarström, who fired and inflicted a mortal wound. The murderer was identified
                    by the discharged pistol, thrown down in the ball-room, and was arrested. He did
                    not attempt to deny his crime, but declared that he had no accomplices. After a
                    long trial he was condemned, was publicly beaten on three successive dayβ, had
                    his right hand cut off, and was finally beheaded and quartered. He endured his
                    sufferings with the greatest fortitude, and seemed to rejoice in having rid his
                    country of a tyrant. His principal accomplices were imprisoned for life.</p>
