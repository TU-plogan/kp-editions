                    receives from him its name, was born at Oudewater, South Holland, 1560. Arminius
                    is a Latinised form of his family name Hermanns or Hermannson. His father, a
                    cutler, died while he was an infant, leaving a widow and three children.
                    Theodore Aemilius, a priest, who had turned Protestant, adopting James, removed
                    with him to Utrecht, but died when his charge was in his fifteenth year. Rudolph
                    Snellius, the mathematician, a native of Oudewater, then a professor at Marburg,
                    happening at the time to visit his early home, met Arminius, saw promise in him,
                    and undertook his maintenance and education. But hardly was he settled at
                    Marburg when the news came that the Spaniards had besieged and taken Oudewater,
                    and murdered men, women, and children, sparing only certain matrons and maids,
                    “who had been sold by auction to the soldiers at two or three dollars each.”
                    Arminius hurried home, but only to find all his relatives slain. In February the
                    same year (1575), the university of Leyden had been founded, and was becoming a
                    rallying point and nursery for the nascent literary genius, theological
                    activity, and scholarship of the country. Arminius seized the opportunity thus
                    afforded of pursuing his studies at home. The six years he remained at Leyden
                    (1576-82) were years of active and innovating thought in Holland. The War of
                    Independence had started conflicting tendencies in men’s minds. To some it
                    seemed to illustrate the necessity of the State tolerating only one religion,
                    but to others the necessity of the State tolerating all Richard Koornhert
                    argued, in private conferences and public disputations, that it was wrong to
                    punish heretics, and his great opponents were, as a rule, the ministers, who
                    maintained that there was no room for more than one religion in a State. Casper
                    Koolhaes, the heroic minister of Leyden—its first lecturer, too, in
                    divinity—pleaded against a too rigid uniformity, for such an agreement on
                    “fundamentals” as had allowed Reformed, Lutherans, and Anabaptists to unite.
                    Leyden had been happy, too, in its first professors. There taught in theology
                    William Feugueraeus, a mild divine, who had written a treatise on persuasion in
                    religion, urging that as to it “men could be led, not driven;” Lambert Danaeus,
                    who deserves remembrance as the first to discuss Christian ethics
                    scientifically, apart from dogmatics; John Drusius, the Orientalist, one of the
                    most enlightened and advanced scholars of his day, settled later at Franeker;
                    John Kolmann the younger, best known by his saying that high Calvinism made God
                    “both a tyrant and an executioner." Snellius, Arminius’s old patron, now removed
                    to Leyden, expounded the Ramist philosophy, and did his best to start his
                    students on the search after truth, unimpeded by the authority of Aristotle.
                    Under these men and influences, Arminius studied with signal success; and the
                    promise he gave induced the merchants’ guild of Amsterdam to bear the further
                    expenses of his education. In 1582 he went to Geneva, studied there awhile under
                    Theodore Beza, but had soon, owing to his active advocacy of the Ramist
                    philosophy, to remove to Basle. After a short but brilliant career there he
                    returned to Geneva, studied for three years, travelled, in 1586, in Italy, heard
                    Zarabella lecture on philosophy in Padua, visited Rome, and, open-minded enough
                    to see its good as well as its evil, was suspected by the stern Dutch Calvinists
                    of Popish leanings. Next year he was called to Amsterdam, and there, in 1588,
                    was ordained to the ministry. He soon acquired the reputation of being an
                    elegant preacher and faithful <pb break="no"

                    educational system of the city, and is said to have done it well. He greatly
                    distinguished himself by fidelity to duty during a plague that devastated
                    Amsterdam in 1602. In 1603 he was called to a theological professorship at
                    Leyden, which he held till his death in 1609.</p>
                <p>Arminius is best known as the founder of the anti-Calvinistic school in Reformed
                    theology, which created the Remonstrant Church in Holland (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Remonstrants),</hi> and contributed to form the Arminian
                    tendency or party in England. He was a man of mild and liberal spirit, broadened
                    by varied culture, constitutionally averse to narrow views and enforced
                    uniformity. He lived in a period of severe systematising. The Reformed
                    strengthened itself against the Roman Catholic theology by working itself, on
                    the one hand, into vigorous logical consistency, and supporting itself, on the
                    other, on the supreme authority of the Scriptures. Calvin’s first principle, the
                    absolute sovereignty of God, had been so applied as to make the divine decree
                    determine alike the acts and the destinies of men; and his formal principle had
                    been so construed as to invest his system with the authority of the source
                    whence it professed to have been drawn. Calvinism had become, towards the close
                    of the 16 th century, supreme in Holland, but the very rigour of the uniformity
                    it exacted provoked a reaction. Richard Koornhert could not plead for the
                    toleration of heretics without assailing the dominant Calvinism, and so he
                    opposed a conditional to its unconditional predestination. The two ministers of
                    Delft, who had debated the point with him, had, the better to turn his
                    arguments, descended from the supralapsarian to the infralapsarian position, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> made the divine decree, instead of precede and
                    determine, succeed the fall. This seemed to the high Calvinists of Holland a
                    grave heresy. Arminius, fresh from Geneva, familiar with the dialectics of Beza,
                    appeared to many the man able to speak the needed word, and so, in 1589, he was
                    simultaneously invited by the ecclesiastical court of Amsterdam to refute
                    Koornhert, and by Martin Lydius, professor at Franeker, to combat the two
                    infralapsarian ministers of Delft. Thus led to confront the questions of
                    necessity and free will, his own mind became unsettled, with the result, that
                    the further he pursued his inquiries the more he was inclined to assert the
                    freedom of man and limit the range of the unconditional decrees of God. This
                    change in doctrinal belief became gradually more apparent in his preaching and
                    in his private conferences with his clerical associates, and occasioned much
                    controversy in the ecclesiastical courts. The controversy was greatly
                    embittered, and the differences correspondingly sharpened, by his appointment to
                    the professorship at Leyden. He had as colleague Francis Gomarus, a strong
                    supralapsarian, perfervid, irrepressible; and their collisions, personal,
                    official, political, tended to develop and define their respective positions.
                    Arminius died, worn out by uncongenial controversy, before his system had been
                    elaborated into the logical consistency it attained in the hands of his
                    celebrated successor, Simon Episcopus, but though inchoate in detail, it was in
                    its principles clear and coherent enough. These may be thus stated :—</p>
                <p>1. The decree of God is, when it concerns His own actions, absolute, but when it
                    concerns man’s, conditional, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the decree relative to
                    the Saviour to be appointed and the salvation to be provided is absolute, but
                    the decree relative to the persons saved or condemned is made to depend on the
                    acts—belief and repentance in the one case, unbelief and impenitence in the
                    other—of the persons themselves.</p>
                <p>2. The providence or government of God while sovereign, is exercised in harmony
                    -with the nature of the creatures governed, t.e., the sovereignty of God is so
                    exercised as to be compatible with the freedom of man.</p>
                <p>3. Man is by original nature, through the assistance of divine grace, free, able
                    to will and perform the right; but is in his fallen state, of and by himself,
                    unable to do so; needs to be regenerated in all his powers before he can do what
                    is good and pleasing to God.</p>
                <p>4. Divine grace originates, maintains, and perfects all the good in man, so much
                    so that he cannot, though regenerate, conceive, will, or do any good thing
                    without it.</p>
                <p>5. The saints possess, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, sufficient strength to
                    persevere to the end in spite of sin and the flesh, but may so decline from
                    sound doctrine as to cause divine grace to be ineffectual.</p>
                <p>6. Every believer may be certain or assured of his own salvation.</p>
                <p>7. It is possible for a regenerate man to live without sin.</p>
                <p>Arminius’s works are mostly occasional treatises drawn from him by controversial
                    emergencies, but they everywhere exhibit a calm, well-furnished, undogmatic, and
                    progressive mind. Characteristic are such sayings as these in letters to his
                    friend, Uitenbogaert :—“Truth, even theological truth, has been sunk in a deep
                    well, whence it cannot be drawn forth without much effort.” “I should be foolish
                    were I to concede to any one so much of right in me, as that he should be able
                    to disturb me as often as he had a mind. Be this my brazen wall, a conscience
                    void of offence. Forward let me still go in my search after truth, and therein
                    let me die with the good God on my side, even if I must needs incur the hatred
                    and ill-will of the whole world.” He was essentially an amiable man, who hated
                    the zeal for an impossible orthodoxy that constrained “the church to institute a
                    search after crimes which have not betrayed an existence, yea, and to drag into
                    open contentions those who are meditating no evil.” His friend Peter Bertius,
                    who pronounced his funeral oration, closed it with these words,—“There lived a
                    man whom it was not possible for those who knew him sufficiently to esteem;
                    those who entertained no esteem for him are such as never knew him well enough
                    to appreciate his merits.”</p>
                <p>The works of Aπninius (in Latin) were published in a single quarto volume in
                    1631. The first volume of an English translation, with copious notes, by James
                    Nichols, was published in 1825, the second in 1828, but the third and concluding
                    volume is still due. A life was written by Casper Brandt, son of Gerard Brandt,
                    the historian of the Dutch Reformation, and published in 1724; republished and
                    annotated by the historian Mosheim in 1725; translated into English by the Rev.
                    John Guthrie, and published in 1854.</p>
