                    of that banquet, “Aristodêmus said that Eryximachus, Phaedrus, and others went
                    away; he himself fell asleep, and as the nights were long, took a good rest; he
                    was awakened towards daybreak by a crowing of cocks, and when he awoke, the
                    others were either asleep or had gone away; there remained awake only
                    Aristophanes, Socrates, and Agathon, who were drinking out of a large goblet
                    -which they passed round, and Socrates was discoursing to them. Aristodêmus did
                    not hear the beginning of the discourse, and he was only half awake; but the
                    chief thing which he remembered was Socrates insisting to the other two that the
                    genius of comedy was the same as that of tragedy, and that the writer of tragedy
                    ought to be a writer of comedy also. To this they were compelled to assent,
                    being sleepy, and not quite understanding his meaning. And first of all
                    Aristophanes fell asleep; and then, when the day was already dawning,
                    Agathon.”</p>
                <p>Although tragedy and comedy had their common origin in the festivals of Dionysus,
                    the regular establishment of tragedy at Athens preceded by half a century that
                    of comedy. The Old Comedy may be said to have lasted about 80 years (470-390
                    B.C.), and to have flourished about 56 (4G0-404 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    Of the forty poets who are named as having illustrated it the chief were

                    covers a period of about 70 years (390-320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> its
                    chief poets being Antiphanes, Alexis, Plato Comicus, Theopompus, and Strattis.
                    The New Comedy was in vigour for about 70 years (320-250 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> having for its foremost representatives Menander Philemon, and
                    Diphilus. The Old Comedy was possible only for a thorough democracy. Its essence
                    was a satirical censorship, unsparing in personalities, of public and of private
                    life—of morality, of statesmanship, of education, of literature, of social
                    usage— in a word, of everything which had an interest for the city or which
                    could amuse the citizens. Preserving all the freedom of banter and of riotous
                    fun to which its origin gave it an historical right, it aimed at associating
                    with this a strong practical purpose—the expression of a democratic public
                    opinion in such a form that no misconduct or folly could altogether disregard
                    it. That licentiousness, that grossness of allusion which too often disfigures
                    it, was, it should be remembered, exacted by the sentiment of the Dionysiae
                    festivals, as much as a decorous cheerfulness is expected at the holiday times
                    of other worships. This was the popular element. Without this the entertainment
                    would have been found flat and unseasonable. But for a comic poet of the higher
                    calibre the consciousness of a recognised power which he could exert, and the
                    desire to use this power for the good of the city, must always have been the
                    uppermost feelings. At Athens the poet of the Old Comedy had an influence
                    analogous, perhaps, rather to that of the journalist than to that of the modern
                    dramatist. But the established type of Dionysiae Comedy gave him an instrument
                    such as no public satirist has ever wielded. When Molière wished to brand
                    hypocrisy he could only make his Tartuffe the central figure of a regular drama,
                    developed by a regular process to a just catastrophe. He had no choice between
                    touching too lightly, and using sustained force to make a profound impression.
                    The Athenian dramatist of the Old Comedy worked under no such limitations of
                    form. The wildest flights of extravagance were permitted to him. Nothing bound
                    him to a dangerous emphasis or a wearisome insistence. He could deal the keenest
                    thrust, or make the most earnest appeal, and at the next moment—if his instinct
                    told him that it was time to change the subject— vary the serious strain by
                    burlesque. He had, in short, an incomparable scope for trenchant satire directed
                    by sure tact.</p>
                <p>Aristophanes is for us the representative of the Old Comedy. But it is important
                    to notice that his genius, while it includes, also transcends the genius of the
                    Old Comedy. He can denounce the frauds of a Cleon, he can vindicate the duty of
                    Athens to herself and to her allies, with a stinging scorn and a force of
                    patriotic indignation which make the poet almost forgotten in the citizen. He
                    can banter Euripides with an ingenuity of light mockery which makes it seem for
                    the time as if the leading Aristo-phanic trait was the art of seeing all things
                    from their prosaic side. Yet it is neither in the denunciation nor in the
                    mockery that he is most individual. His truest and highest faculty is revealed
                    by those wonderful bits of lyric writing in which he soars above everything that
                    can move laughter or tears, and makes the clear air thrill with the notes of a
                    song as free, as musical, and as wild as that of the nightingale invoked by his
                    own chorus in the <hi rend="italic">Birds.</hi> The speech of Dikaios Logos in

                    and such as these, are the true glories of Aristophanes. They are the strains,
                    not of an artist, but of one who warbles for pure gladness of heart in some
                    place made bright by the presence of a god. Nothing else in Greek poetry haβ
                    quite this wild sweetness of the woods. Of modern poets Shakespeare alone,
                    perhaps, has it in combination with a like richness and fertility of fancy.</p>
                <p>Fifty-four comedies were ascribed to Aristophanes. Forty-three of these are
                    allowed as genuine by Bergk. Eleven only are extant. These eleven form a running
                    commentary on the outer and the inner life of Athens during 36 years. We will
                    notice them briefly in the order of their dates. They may be ranged under three
                    periods. The first of these periods, extending to 420 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> includes those plays in which Aristophanes uses an absolutely
                    unrestrained freedom of political satire. The second period ends with the year
                    405. Its productions are distinguished from those of the earlier time by a
                    certain degree of reticence and caution. The third period, down to 388 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> comprises two plays in which the transition to the
                    character of the Middle Comedy is well marked, not merely by disuse of the
                    parabasis, but by general self-restraint.</p>

                    Since the defeat in Boeotia the peace party at Athens had gained ground, and in
                    this play Aristophanes seeks to strengthen their hands. Dicaeo-polis, an honest
                    countryman, is determined to make peace with Sparta on his own account, not
                    deterred by the angry men of Acharnae, who crave vengeance for the devastation
                    of their vineyards. He sends to Sparta for samples of peace; and he is so much
                    pleased with the flavour of the Thirty Years’ sample that he at once concludes a
                    treaty for himself and his family. All the blessings of life descend on him;
                    while Lamachus, the leader of the war party, is smarting from cold, snow, and

                    The Demos, or State, is represented by an old man who has put himself and his
                    household into the hands of a rascally Paphlagonian steward. Nicias and
                    Demosthenes, slaves of Demos, contrive that the Paphlagonian shall be supplanted
                    in their master’s favour by a sausage-seller. No sooner has Demos been thus
                    rescued than his youthfulness and his good sense return together.</p>

                    spirit of intellectual inquiry and culture rather than on a school or class. Two
                    classes of thinkers or teachers are, however, specially satirised under the
                    general name of “Sophist” (v. 331)— 1. The Physical Philosophers—indicated by
                    allusions to the doctrines of Anaxagoras, Hêracleitus, and Diogenes of
                    Apollonia. 2. The professed teachers of rhetoric, belles lettres, &lt;fcc., such
                    as Protagoras and Prodicus. Socrates is taken as the type of the entire
                    tendency. A youth named Pheidippides—obviously meant for Alcibiades—is sent by
                    his father to Socrates to be cured of his dissolute propensities. Under the
                    discipline of Socrates the youth becomes accomplished in dishonesty and impiety.
                    The conclusion of the play shows the indignant father preparing to burn up the
                    philosopher and his hall of contemplation.</p>

                    Peisthetaerus, an enterprising Athenian, and his friend Euelpides persuade the
                    birds to build a city—“Cloud-Cuckoo-borough”—in mid air, so as to cut off the
                    gods from men. The plan succeeds; the gods send envoys to treat with the birds;
                    and Peisthetaerus marries Basileia, daughter of Zeus. Some have found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Birds</hi> a complete historical allegory of the Sicilian
                    expedition; others, a general satire on the prevalence at Athens of headstrong
                    caprice over law and order; others, merely an aspiration towards a new and
                    purified Athens— a dream to which the poet had turned from his hope for a
                    revival of the Athens of the past. In another view, the piece is mainly a
                    protest against the religious fanaticism which the incident of the Hermae had
                    called forth. It can hardly be doubted that both this fanaticism and the part
                    taken by Alcibiades in promoting the Sicilian expedition were present to the
                    mind of Aristophanes; but in what proportions, and tempered with what other
                    elements, the very form of the comedy makes it idle to inquire.</p>

                    This play was brought out during the earlier stages of those intrigues which led
                    to the Revolution of the Four Hundred. It appeared shortly before Peisander had
                    arrived in Athens from the camp at Samos for the purpose of organising the
                    oligarchic policy. The <hi rend="italic">Lysistrata</hi> expresses the popular
                    desire for peace at any cost. As the men can do nothing, the women take the
                    question into their own hands, occupy the citadel, and bring the citizens to

                    allusion. Fear silences even comedy. Only women and Euripides are satirised.

                    fifteen months before the taking of Athens by Lysander. It may be considered as
                    an attempt to distract men’s minds from public affairs. It is a literary
                    criticism. Aeschylus and Euripides were both lately dead. Athens is beggared of
                    poets; and Dionysus goes down to Hades to bring back a poet. Aeschylus and

                    first edition of the play had appeared in 408 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi>
                    being a symbolical representation of the fact that the victories won by
                    Alcibiades in the Hellespont had brought back the god of wealth to the
                    treasure-chamber of the Parthenon. In its extant form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plutus</hi> is simply a moral allegory. Chremylus, a worthy but poor man, falls
                    in with a blind and aged wanderer, who proves to be the god of wealth. Asclêpius
                    restores eyesight to Plutus; whereupon all the just are made rich, and all the
                    unjust are reduced to poverty.</p>
                <p>Among the lost plays, the following are the chief of which anything is known
                    :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Banqueters</hi> (∆αtταλ∈⅛), 427 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> — A satire on young Athens. A father haβ two sons; one is brought up
                    in the good old school, another in the tricky subtleties of the new; and the
                    contrast of results is the chief theme.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Babylonians,</hi> 426 B.c.—Under this name the
                    subject-allies of Athens are represented as “Babylonians” —barbarian slaves,
                    employed to grind in the mill. The oppression of the allies by the demagogues—a
                    topic often touched elsewhere—was, then, the main subject of the piece, in which
                    Aristophanes is said to have attacked especially the system of appointing to
                    offices by lot. The comedy is memorable as opening that Aristophanic war upon
                    Cleon which was continued in the <hi rend="italic">Knights</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Wasps.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Merchantmen, The Farmers, The
                    Preliminary Contest</hi><hi rend="italic">(Proagôn),</hi> and possibly the <hi
                    rend="italic">Old Age (Geras),</hi> belonged to the First Period. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Geras</hi> is assigned by Süvern to 422 B.C., and is supposed to
                    have been a picture of dotage similar to that in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Knights.</hi> A comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Islands</hi> is conjectured
                    to have dealt with the sufferings imposed by the war on the insular tributaries.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Triphales</hi> was probably a satire on Alcibiades; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Storks,</hi> on the tragic poet Patrocles.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Aeolosicôn</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> produced by his
                    son Arârôs in 387 B.c.—Aristophanes probably parodied the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeolus</hi> of Euripides. The <hi rend="italic">Côcalus</hi> is thought to have
                    been a parody of the legend, according to which a Sicilian king of that name
                    slew Minôs.</p>
                <p>A sympathetic reader of Aristophanes can hardly fail to perceive that, while his
                    political and intellectual tendencies are well marked, his opinions, in so far
                    as they colour his comedies, are too indefinite to reward, or indeed to
                    tolerate, analysis. Aristophanes was a natural conservative. His ideal was the
                    Athens of the Persian wars. He disapproved the policy which had made Athenian
                    empire irksome to the allies and formidable to Greece; he detested the vulgarity
                    and the violence of mob-rule; he clave to the old worship of the gods; he
                    regarded the new ideas of education as a tissue of imposture and impiety. How
                    far he was from clearness or precision of view in regard to the intellectual
                    revolution which was going forward, appears from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clouds,</hi> in which thinkers and literary workers who had absolutely nothing
                    in common are treated with sweeping ridicule as prophets of a common heresy.
                    Aristophanes is one of the men for whom opinion is mainly a matter of feeling,
                    not of reason. His imaginative susceptibility gave him a warm and loyal love for
                    the traditional glories of Athens, however dim the past to which they belonged;
                    a horror of what was ugly or ignoble in the present; a keen perception of what
                    was offensive or absurd in pretension. The broad preferences and dislikes thus
                    generated were enough not only to point the moral of comedy, but to make lιim,
                    in many cases, a really useful censor for the city. The service which he could
                    render in this way was, however, only negative. He could hardly <pb break="no"

                    teacher for Athens. His rooted antipathy to intellectual progress, while it
                    affords easy and wide scope for his wit, must, after all, lower his intellectual
                    rank. The great minds are not the enemies of ideas. But as a mocker—to use the
                    word which seems most closely to describe him on this side—he is incomparable
                    for the union of subtlety with riot of the comic imagination. As a poet, he is
                    immortal. And, among Athenian poets, he has it for his distinctive
                    characteristic that he is inspired less by that Greek genius which never allows
                    fancy to escape from the control of defining, though spiritualising, reason,
                    than by such ethereal rapture of the unfettered fancy as lifts Shakespeare or
                    Shelley above it,—</p>
