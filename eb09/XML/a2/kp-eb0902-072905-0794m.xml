                <p>2. It signified the form of trial by a jury of sixteen persons, which eventually
                    superseded the barbarous judicial combat; this jury was named the Grand Assize.

                    is still applicable to the jury in criminal causes in Scotland.</p>
                <p>2. In the only sense in which the word is not now almost obsolete, assize means
                    the periodical session of the judges of the superior courts of Common Law, held
                    in the various counties of England, chiefly for the purposes of gaol delivery
                    and trying causes at <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius.</hi> Previous to Magna Charta
                    (1215) writs of assize had all to be tried at Westminster, or to await trial in
                    the locality in which they had originated at the septennial circuit of the
                    justices in eyre; but, by way of remedy for the great consequent delay and
                    inconvenience, it was provided by this celebrated Act that the assizes of <hi
                    rend="italic">mort</hi><hi rend="italic">d'ancestor</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >novel disseisin</hi> should be tried annually by the judges in every county. By
                    successive enactments, the civil jurisdiction of the justices of assize was
                    extended, and the number of their sittings increased, till at last the necessity
                    of repairing to Westminster for judgment in civil actions was almost obviated to
                    county litigants by an Act, passed in the reign of Edward I., which provided
                    that the writ summoning the jury to Westminster should also appoint a time and
                    place for hearing such causes within the county of their origin. The date of the
                    alternative summons to Westminster was always subsequent to the former date, and
                    so timed as to fall in the vacation preceding the Westminster term; and thus
                    “<hi rend="italic">Unless before,”</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius,</hi>
                    issues came to be dealt with by the judges of assize before the summons to
                    Westminster could take effect. The <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius</hi> clause,
                    however, was not then introduced for the first time. It occurs occasionally in
                    writs of the reign of Henry III. The Royal Commissions to hold the assizes
                    are—(1.) General, (2.) Special. The General Commission is issued twice a year to
                    the superior courts of Common Law at Westminster, and two judges are generally
                    sent on each circuit. It covers commissions—(1.) of <hi rend="italic">oyer</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">terminer;</hi> (2.) of Nisi Prius; (3.) of gaol delivery;
                    (4.) of the peace. Special commissions are granted for inquest in certain causes
                    and crimes.</p>
                <p>3. Assizes, in the sense of ordinances or enactments of a court or council of
                    state, are of considerable interest in our earlier economic history. As early as
                    the reign of John the observance of the <hi rend="italic">assisoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">venalium</hi> was enforced, and for a period of five hundred years
                    thereafter it was considered no unimportant part of the duties of the
                    legislature to regulate by fixed prices, for the protection of the lieges, the
                    sale of bread, ale, fuel, &lt;fcc. Sometimes in city charters the right to
                    assize such articles is specially conceded. Regulations of this description,
                    though hostile to free trade, were beneficial in the repression of fraud and
                    adulteration.</p>

                <p>4. Assizes are sometimes used in a wider legislative connection by early
                    chroniclers and historians,—the “assisae of the realme,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> occasionally meaning the organic laws of the country. In a still
                    more extended sense, the “Assizes of Jerusalem” is the name given to the code of
                    laws framed for the kingdom of Jerusalem at the instance of Godfrey of Bouillon,
                    the Crusader.</p>
