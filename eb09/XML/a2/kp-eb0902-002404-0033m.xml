                    (from αvψ,oς, wind, and ∕Λtτpov, a measure), a contrivance for indicating the
                    rate and direction of the wind. Ever since the birth of true experimental
                    science, it has been recognised as a matter of great importance and interest to
                    man that he should know something of the laws according to which the atmospheric
                    currents and changes are produced. Among meteorological phenomena, none deserve
                    more attention than the elements of the wind; and none have received more. Yet
                    anemometry has been all along the least successful department of meteorology,
                    partly owing, of course, to the nature of the agent to be dealt with, which is
                    the very type of fluctuation, and partly to a mistaken path of observation that
                    was too long followed. The error which, from the days of Hooke, in the middle of
                    the 17th century, to within a comparatively recent period, misdirected the
                    efforts of inventors, was the idea that the elements to be determined in the
                    case of the wind are its direction and <hi rend="italic">pressure,</hi> whereas
                    practically they are its direction and <hi rend="italic">velocity.</hi> If the
                    currents of air were anything like uniform, it would be a comparatively simple
                    matter to deduce the velocity from the pressure; but their variability is so
                    very great, that the relations between the velocity and the pressure become
                    unworkably complex. We know, from the elementary principles of dynam <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> cs, that the pressure at any instant will vary as the
                    square of the velocity. Obviously, therefore, the relative variations of the
                    pressure will be <hi rend="italic">twice as great</hi> as those of the velocity;
                    and the latter are too great, as we find them, to encourage us to double them
                    artificially. It must also be remembered that, from the inertia of the
                    indicating apparatus, errors will in every case arise; and these also will be
                    doubled if we take the pressure instead of the velocity variations. From all
                    this it will appear that comparatively little importance is to be attached to
                    the earlier and to all statical modes of anemometry.</p>
                <p>The essentials of every anemometer are two: (1), a <hi rend="italic"
                    >windvane,</hi> to show changes of direction; and (2), a <hi rend="italic"
                    >ιvind-gauge,</hi> to show changes of velocity, or of force. There is also a
                    distinction which we may have in every kind of meter. They may be either <hi
                    rend="italic">non-recording,</hi> as merely exhibiting the variations to the
                    eye; or <hi rend="italic">recording,</hi> or marking them permanently on
                    paper.</p>
                <p>The wind-vane, or weather-cock, is simply a flat sheet of thin metal, or two
                    sheets in the shape of a thin wedge, at the end of a metal rod, the whole
                    turning freely on a vertical axle. Besides serving to show the direction of the
                    wind itself, the vane is often used to turn the gauge, so as to present the
                    pressure-surface with its face always direct to the wind.</p>
                <p>Of ail the gauges that have been invented or proposed it would be impossible to
                    give even the names. The primitive statical forms of anemometer—that is, such as
                    set against the force of the wind a gradually increasing resistance, with some
                    means of indicating the point of balance —have been divided by Dr Robinson <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Roy. Irish Acad.,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 150) into three
                    classes :—First, vertical windmills, kept facing the wind by a vane, and acting
                    by winding on their axle a string against some form of graduated resistance. Of
                    this nature were Dr Hooke’s anemometer (which is generally considered the first
                    practical attempt in wind-measuring), and those of Wolfius and Martin. The
                    second class consists of those in which the wind acts on a flat plate, usually a
                    foot square, pressing it against the elasticity either of a metallic spring or
                    of a mass of confined air, a previous graduation of the elastic force having
                    been made for each instrument. The first gauge of this type was invented by the
                    celebrated Bouguer about the middle of last century; and since his time there
                    have been many attempts at improvement of this principle, the apparent
                    simplicity of the springmeasure being its recommendation. Modified forms of
                    Bouguer’s wind-pressure gauge are in use even at the present day; and about a
                    quarter of a century ago a selfregistering adaptation of it was constructed by
                    Osler, and very generally employed. The third class measures the wind-force by
                    the difference of level it is capable of producing in an inverted syphon, or U
                    tube, containing water or some other liquid. Lind’s anemometer, invented in
                    1775, is the best known of this type, and is still in common use. It is simply a
                    U tube, with one leg bent at right angles towards the upper end, and attached to
                    a vane, so as to have its mouth constantly facing the wind. It is about
                    half-filled with water, and a scale graduated to hundredths of an inch is
                    attached. The difference of level in the legs of the syphon indicates the force
                    of the wind; but it is only by experiment that the pressures corresponding to
                    these differences can be laid down. Thus each instrument requires a
                    carefully-constructed reference table of pressures and velocities corresponding
                    to its readings. According to Lind, a difference of level of 1 inch indicates a
                    pressure of 5 ’ 2 B&gt; on the square foot, and that corresponds to a velocity
                    of about 32∣ miles an hour, which is in common language a <hi rend="italic">high
                    wind.</hi> A difference of 3 inches would indicate a <hi rend="italic"
                    >storm,</hi> and one of 6 inches a <pb break="no"

                    in simplicity is a fourth class, that may be added to Dr Robinson’s, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">pendulum anemometers,</hi> where the pressure-plate is swung as a
                    pendulum, and indicates the wind-force by its deviation from the vertical. The
                    first of this form w as invented by the Marquis Poleni, and gained the prize of
                    the French Academy in 1733. They are still employed as simple rough-and-ready
                    indicators to the eye of the strength of the wind.</p>
                <p>Several other anemometers have been contrived, which, from being essentially
                    non-recording, may be mentioned as more curious than valuable. Among these are—(
                    1. ) A <hi rend="italic">musical anemometer,</hi> suggested by Dr Hooke, and
                    constructed by Delamanon, in which the λvind was caused to sound automatically,
                    in a set of pipes, a particular note corresponding to its velocity; (2.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Leslies anemometer,</hi> or rather anemometric principle, which
                    deduces the velocity of the wind from its effect in cooling a thermometer, it
                    being supposed that the rate of cooling is proportional to the velocity of the
                    wind; (3.) <hi rend="italic">Brewster’s evaporation anemometer,</hi> by which
                    the velocity may be deduced from the amount of water evaporated in a given time
                    from a rough open surface, such as sponge or flannel, the two being in
                    proportion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Osier’s anemometer,</hi> the last of the pressure-gauges we
                    shall mention, being one of the most trustworthy and most common registering
                    anemometers in this country, merits a more particular description. It traces
                    with pencils on a sheet of paper (which is moved along, either in a vertical or
                    a horizontal position, at a constant rate by means of clock-work) lines which
                    indicate changes of the wind, both in direction and in pressure. Its general
                    principle will be readily understood without a diagram. Changes of <hi
                    rend="italic">direction</hi> are recorded in this way. The axle that carries the
                    vane, and turns with it, has keyed on its lower end a pinion which, working in a
                    horizontal rack, moves it backwards or forwards as the axle turns one way or the
                    other; and a pencil fixed to the rack traces its movements on the
                    register-sheet. Changes of <hi rend="italic">pressure,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >wind-force,</hi> are measured by means of springs. A square foot of a light
                    metal plate, placed vertically and turning with the vane-rod, receives the
                    impulse of the wind, and is forced against three springs, so arranged that one,
                    two, or all of them may be pressed on according to the violence of the wind. The
                    extent of compression against the springs is transmitted through the hollow
                    vane-axle, by means of chains and pulleys, to a light spring, which presses a
                    pencil gently against the paper. Variations of motion of the upper plate thus
                    correspond to definite lateral deviations of this second spring pencil, and a w
                    avy line is traced on the paper as it moves along. The registersheet is ruled
                    across its length into twenty-four equal parts, one of which passes the pencil
                    points each hour; and lengthways it is ruled—first, with lines corresponding to
                    the cardinal points, under the direction-pencil; and secondly, on the field of
                    the other pencil, with lines spaced by actual experiment so as to correspond to
                    gradations of 5, 10, 15, 20, &amp;c. ÏÏ) of wind-pressure on the square foot.
                    Thus the pressure-curve, in the same way as on the indicator of a steam-engine,
                    includes between it and the horizontal line of zero-pressure a space
                    proportional to the amount of <hi rend="italic">work done</hi> by the wind on
                    the upper pressure-plate. Of course, so long as the wind blows in one direction,
                    the directionpencil traces a horizontal line; and if there be no wind at all,
                    both pencils trace the zero horizontal lines.</p>
                <p>We have not space to enter particularly into the history of the direct
                    velocity-measuring anemometers. As long ago as 1783, one was contrived on this
                    principle by Mr Edgeworth for the measurement of air-currents; but to Dr Whewell
                    belongs the credit of first appreciating at its true value the velocity as
                    opposed to the pressure measure. In the <hi rend="italic">Cam. Trans.,</hi> vol.
                    vi., he describes an instrument of his own devising, which was afterwards
                    extensively used. Sir W. Snow Harris recommended it strongly to the British
                    Association in 1844, exhibiting results of his own observations with it during
                    three previous years. Owing, however, to some practical defects, such as the
                    great frictional resistance of toothed wheels and endless screws, which have
                    more effect on the indications of a gentle wind than of a high one, and to the
                    want of an arrangement for indicating the <hi rend="italic">times</hi> of the
                    variations, Dr WhewelΓs instrument has now fallen into disuse. A description of
                    it may be found in Drew’s <hi rend="italic">Practical Meteorology.</hi> One of
                    the most valuable contributions to this science was made by Dr Robinson, of
                    Armagh, who between the years 1843 and 1846 conducted a number of experiments
                    and calculations on the proper form to be given to the revolving vanes. He found
                    radical defects in the principle of all the vanes previously employed; either
                    their moving power was not sufficiently great to make the frictional correction
                    inconsiderable, or their velocity, in place of being less, was often three or
                    four times greater than that of the wind, requiring greater complicacy of
                    machinery to reduce the speed of the tracing point; or, lastly, their results
                    were not identical, though constructed after the same type. The form adopted by
                    Robinson to remedy these defects is that shown in the figure. Though it had been
                    suggested to him by Edgeworth, it deservedly bears the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robinson’s Cups</hi> (fig. 1), as he was the first to show experimentally and
                    analytically its advantages. The arrangement consisted of four light metal
                    hemispheres C, of as large a diameter as convenient, extended at the ends of
                    light and strong metal radii, so that they shall be as far from the axis of
                    motion as possible, and so reduce the effect of friction to a minimum. They
                    require no vane to keep them facing the wind, that represented by F, F, in the
                    figure having a movement quite independent of the cups, as will be explained
                    presently. He found that the cups move at almost exactly one-third of the rate
                    of the wind— a happy simplicity of ratio—and this for all instruments made after
                    one type. Experiments were made with sets of two, three, four, and six cups; but
                    the velocity ratio between the cups and the wind was simplest and most constant
                    with four, the number now universally employed. In the paper already quoted <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Roy. Irish Acad.,</hi> vol. xxii), Dr Robinson describes a
                    self-registering apparatus, to which he had fitted the horizontal cups. But we
                    shall describe instead one of the more modern and simple registers, which seems
                    to leave little further to be desired in the way of compactness and accuracy. It
                    is the invention of Mr Beckley, of the Kew Observatory, and is described in full
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Report of the British Association,</hi> 1858, p. 306.
                    The outside, or wind-receiving parts are represented in the above figure, and
                    consist of Robinson’s cups C, for the wind-velocity, and a double fan F, or
                    windmill governor, for wind-direction. The fans serve as a vane, turning so as
                    to keep their axes constantly at right angles to the w ind, and are more steady
                    than the ordinary vane. They are connected with the outer brass tube B, and
                    carry it round with them on any change of winddirection. The second figure shows
                    the manner in which the motions of the fans and cups are recorded. R is a
                    cylinder, which carries the register-sheet, on which the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n35/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0035-0026"/> two pencils P, Q, press lightly. It is turned
                    round at a uniform rate by clock-work in K, making a complete revolution in
                    twenty-four hours, or moving through half an inch per hour. Horizontal lines
                    divide the sheet into hour spaces, marked 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., in the figure. The
                    fan, or direction-axle B (fig. 1), communicates its motions to a mitre wheel M
                    (fig. 2), which, gearing into the bevel wheel T, moves the cylinder D, with its
                    brass pencil P. By a change of the wind from north to south, the pencil would
                    trace a line along the cylinder between the vertical lines N and S. In like
                    manner the velocity of the cups is communicated by a shaft passing through the
                    direction-axle to a mitre wheel W, which moves the bevel wheel N, the cylinder
                    L, and its pencil Q. Vertical lines are drawn on the paper, so that the pencil
                    moves over one space, while the wind travels 10 miles, or the cups one-third of
                    that distance. The velocity range does not extend beyond 50 miles, that being
                    sufficiently high above the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> rate of the winds.
                    The sheet requires to be renewed, and the clock-work rewound every twenty-four
                    hours, a matter of only a minute or two. The figure shows a simple brass spiral
                    pencil; but the pencil devised by Beckley for the Kew Observatory consists of a
                    strip of brass fixed spirally on edge, so that for equal increments of rotation
                    of its cylinder its point of contact with the register-sheet shifts along by
                    equal increments horizontally.</p>
                <p>Anemometry now forms a most important feature in all meteorological observations,
                    and many important and remarkable results have appeared since the invention of
                    self-recording apparatus. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi></p>
