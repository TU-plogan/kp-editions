                    fact that he was made archon at a time when the possession of a certain amount
                    of property was an indispensable qualification for that office. But extremely
                    little is known of his early life. So far as political tendencies went, he had
                    been a companion and follower of Clisthenes, and it is also told that he had a
                    great veneration for the character and legislation of Lycurgus. He, therefore,
                    natnrally took the aristocratic side in questions of state policy, and
                    consequently found himself incessantly opposed to the great democratic leader,
                    Themistocles. Plutarch relates many anecdotes of the constant opposition between
                    the two, but in several points his account must be inaccurate.l</p>
                <p>The first certain appearance of Aristides in history was at the battle of
                    Marathon, 490 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> where he was one of the ten
                    generals, and led his own tribe, Antiochis. He is said to have been second in
                    command to Miltiades. According to custom each of the ten generals had supreme
                    command of the whole army for one day; Aristides saw the disadvantages of this
                    system, which totally prevented any fixed plan being carried out, and by his
                    advice and example prevailed on the other generals to relinquish their right in
                    favour of Miltiades. This prudent measure contributed largely to the success of
                    the battle, in which also, according to Plutarch, much was due to the valour of
                    Aristides. He was left with one tribe to collect the spoil from the field of
                    battle, while Miltiades marched to Athens to protect the city from the Persian
                    fleet. He discharged the duty intrusted to him with the most scrupulous honesty.
                    Next year he was made archon eponymus, and his reputation for justice appears to
                    have been increased by the manner in which he performed the duties of his
                    office. But his great rival, Themistocles, who had been meanwhile increasing his
                    own power, grew jealous, and gradually raised a strong feeling against him by
                    representing how dangerous it was for a democracy that any individual should be
                    allowed to gain such influence as that of Aristides. The Athenians, uneasy at
                    this idea, banished him by ostracism in 483. It is said that, on this occasion,
                    an ignorant fellow, who did not know Aristides, came up to him, and, giving him
                    his shell, desired him to write upon it the name of Aristides. The latter asked
                    in surprise if Aristides had done him any wrong. “No,” was the reply, “and I do
                    not even know him, but it irritates me to hear him everywhere called <hi
                    rend="italic">the justP</hi> Aristides made no answer, but took the shell and
                    wrote his own name on it</p>
                <p>On the night before the battle of Salamis, Aristides, who was still in exile,
                    made a perilous journey through the enemy’s fleet, and reached the tent of
                    Themistocles. He told him that he had come to bury in oblivion their former
                    differences; that he had learned his plan for giving battle to the Persian fleet
                    in the narrow straits of Salamis, and highly approved of it; and that he would
                    assist him to the utmost of his ability. By his influence the other generals
                    were induced to assent to the plans of Themistocles, of whom they were somewhat
                    jealous. On the day of battle, Aristides collected some Athenian volunteers, and
                    made a descent on the little island of Psyttalea, which was filled with the
                    forces of the enemy. These he routed and almost annihilated. After the victory
                    of Salamis he dissuaded Themistocles from his ambitious plan of conquering Asia
                    by destroying the bridge which the Persians had built over the Hellespont, and
                    thereby cutting off their communications.</p>
                <p>About this time his sentence of exile appears to have been revoked, for in 479 he
                    was general of the Athenians in the campaign against Mardonius, and shared with
                    Pausanias the glory of the victory-at Plataea. By his prudent counsels before
                    the battle, he settled a dangerous dispute with the Tegetae; and after the
                    victory, when the Athenians and Lacedaem onians were contending as to the right
                    of erecting the trophy, he prevailed on the Athenians to give up their claim.
                    The Lacedaemonians immediately followed this example, and the honours of the day
                    were given to the Plataeans. He also instituted yearly sacrifices and
                    quinquennial games at Plataea, to celebrate the victory over the barbarians and
                    the liberation of Greece. On his return to Athens, Aristides introduced the
                    famous measure by which the archonship was thrown open to all classes of
                    citizens. In 477, he was sent along with Cimon, over whom he had great
                    influence, to take command of the Athenian contingent, under the general command
                    of Pausanias the Lacedaemonian. The haughtiness and oppressive conduct of the
                    Spartans had disgusted the allies, who were completely won over by the mildness
                    and prudence of Aristides and Cimon. In a body the allied Greeks threw off the
                    hegemony of Sparta, and formed a confederation under the Athenians. To Aristides
                    was committed the task of drawing up the laws for this confederacy, and settling
                    the amount of tribute which should be paid by each state. This duty he
                    discharged to the complete satisfaction of the allies, who were delighted to be
                    assessed at only 460 talents. The first instalment of the tax was paid into the
                    national treasury, then situated on the sacred island of Delos, but afterwards
                    transferred to Athens, a measure which Aristides is said to have declared unjust
                    but expedient.</p>
                <p>The time and place of his death are uncertain. It is known, at least, that he
                    survived the banishment of Themistocles, for his generous conduct towards his
                    fallen rival is commemorated by Plutarch. He died, probably, about 468 B,c.,
                    according to some at Athens, according to others at Pontus. He is said to have
                    died in such poverty that he did not leave enough to defray his funeral
                    expenses, but had a tomb erected to him with funds from the public treasury.
                    This tomb at Phalerum was still to be seen in the time of Plutarch. His
                    daughters received marriage portions from the state, and his son, Lysimachus,
                    was granted a sum of money and a portion of land. Such was the respect of the
                    Athenians for the memory of their great statesman, that even his remote
                    descendants are said to have received assistance from the public treasury.</p>
