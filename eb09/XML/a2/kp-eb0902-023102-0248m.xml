                    years at the University of Naples, leaving it in his sixteenth year. While there
                    he in all probability came under the influence of the Dominicans, who were then
                    the rising order in the church, and were doing their utmost to enlist within
                    their ranks the ablest young scholars of the age, for in spite of the opposition
                    of his family, and especially of his mother (an opposition which was overcome
                    only by the intervention of Pope Innocent IV. ), he assumed the habit of St
                    Dominic in his seventeenth year.</p>
                <p>His superiors, seeing his great aptitude for theological study sent him to the
                    Dominican School in Cologne, where Albertus Magnus, the most famous thinker of
                    his age, lectured on philosophy and theology. In 1245 Albertus was called to
                    Paris, and there Aquinas followed him, and remained with him for three years, at
                    the end of which he graduated as bachelor of theology. In 1248 he returned to
                    Cologne with Albertus, and was appointed second lecturer and <hi rend="italic"
                    >magister</hi><hi rend="italic">studentium.</hi> This year may be taken as the
                    beginning of his literary activity and public life. Ere he left Paris he had
                    thrown himself with ardour into the controversy raging between the University
                    and the Begging Friars respecting the liberty of teaching, resisting both by
                    speeches and pamphlets the authorities of the University; and when the dispute
                    was referred to the Pope, the youthful Aquinas was chosen to defend his order,
                    which he did with such success as to overcome the arguments of the celebrated
                    William of St Amour, the champion of the University, and one of the most
                    celebrated men of the day. In the year 1257, along with his friend Bonaventura,
                    he was created doctor of theology, and began to give courses of lectures upon
                    this science in Paris, and also in Rome and other towns in Italy. From this time
                    onwards his life was one of incessant toil, and we marvel at the amount of
                    literary work he was able to do, when we remember that during his short public
                    life he was continually engaged in the active service of his order, was
                    frequently travelling upon long and tedious journeys, and was constantly
                    consulted on affairs of state by the reigning pontiff.</p>
                <p>In 1263 we find him at the chapter of the Dominican order held in London. In 1268
                    he was lecturing now in Rome and now in Bologna, all the while engaged in the
                    public business of the church. In 1271 he was again in Paris, lecturing to the
                    students, managing the affairs of the church, and consulted by the king, Louis
                    VIII., his kinsman, on affairs of state. In 1272 the commands of the chief of
                    his order and the request of King Charles brought him back to the professor’s
                    chair at Naples. All this time he was preaching every day, writing homilies,
                    disputations, lectures, and finding time to work hard at his great work the <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologice.</hi> Such rewards as the
                    church could bestow had been offered to him. He refused the archbishopric of
                    Naples and the abbacy of Monte Cassino. In January 1274 he was summoned by Pope
                    Gregory X. to attend the council convened at Lyons, to investigate and if
                    possible settle the differences between the Greek and Latin churches. Though
                    suffering from illness, he at once set out on the journey; finding his strength
                    failing on the way, he was carried to the Cistercian monastery of Fossa Nuova,
                    in the diocese of Terracina, where, after a lingering illness of seven weeks, he
                    died on the 7th of March 1274. After his death the highest honours which the
                    church could bestow were awarded to the memory of Thomas. He was canonised in
                    1323 by Pope John XXII., and in 1567 Pius V. ranked the festival of St Thomas
                    with those of the four great Latin fathers, Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and
                    Gregory. Still higher is the honour implied in the fact, that no theologian save
                    Augustine has had the same influence on the theological thought and language of
                    the Western Church, and that no man has better fulfilled the ideal of the
                    monkish life than Thomas of Aquin.</p>
                <p>The writings of Thomas are of very great importance for philosophy as well as for
                    theology, for he is the spirit of scholasticism incarnate, and has done more
                    than any other writer save Augustine to fashion the theological language of the
                    Western Church. The mediaeval spirit, in all its various manifestations, aimed
                    at universal empire by way of external and visible rule. Its idea of the State
                    was the Holy Roman Empire actually embracing and dominating over all the
                    countries in Europe; its idea of the Church, that visible and tangible
                    catholicity which existed before the great Reformation; and in the department of
                    knowledge it showed its characteristic quality in its desire to embrace in one
                    system, under one science, the whole of human thought. It so happened that, in
                    the break between the old world and the new, the sole institution which survived
                    was the church, and the only science which was preserved was philosophy. Hence,
                    when scholasticism arose, the science which it found ready to its hand was
                    theology, and its task became that of bringing all departments of knowledge
                    under the dominion of this one sovereign science. All through the period of
                    scholasticism, from its beginning under Scotus Erigena down to its decline under
                    Gabriel Biel, this aim of establishing an empire of science was kept in view,
                    and no fresh advance in knowledge in any fresh field of investigation was ever
                    held to be made or taken possession of until its results had been brought under
                    the influence of the master science, and made to occupy their proper and
                    subordinate place. Aquinas occupies the central point in the history of
                    scholasticism, because he, more than any other, was trained by nature and
                    education to do the most that could be done to realise the scholastic ideal, and
                    present a condensed summary of all known science, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologice.</hi></p>
                <p>The principles on which the system of Aquinas rested were these. He held that
                    there were two sources of know ledge—the mysteries of Christian faith and the
                    truths of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0249-0232"/> human reason. The distinction between these two
                    was made emphatic by Aquinas, who is at pains, especially in his treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">Contra Gentiles,</hi> to make it plain that each is a distinct
                    fountain of knowledge, but that revelation is the more important of the two. It
                    is important to mark what Aquinas means by revelation and by reason. Revelation
                    is a source of knowledge, rather than the manifestation in the world of a divine
                    life, and its chief characteristic is that it presents men with mysteries, which
                    are to be believed even when they cannot be understood. Revelation is not
                    Scripture alone, for Scripture taken by itself does not correspond exactly with
                    his description; nor is it church tradition alone, for church tradition must so
                    far rest on Scripture. Revelation is a divine source of knowledge, of which
                    Scripture and church tradition are the channels; and he who would rightly
                    understand theology must familiarise himself with Scripture, the teachings of
                    the fathers, and the decisions of councils, in such a way as to be able to make
                    part of himself, as it were, those channels along which this divine knowledge
                    flowed. Aquinas’s conception of reason is in some way parallel with his
                    conception of revelation. Reason is in his idea not the individual reason, but
                    fountain of natural truth, whose chief channels are the various systems of
                    heathen philosophy, and more especially the thoughts of Plato and the methods of
                    Aristotle. Reason and revelation are both of them separate sources of knowledge,
                    which have their appropriate channels; and man can put himself in possession of
                    each, because he can bring himsélf into relation to the church on the one hand,
                    and the system of philosophy, or more strictly Aristotle, on the other. The
                    conception will be made clearer when it is remembered that Aquinas, taught by
                    the mysterious author of the writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius, who so
                    marvellously influenced mediaeval writers, sometimes spoke of a natural
                    revelation, or of reason as a source of truths in themselves mysterious, and was
                    always accustomed to say that reason as well as revelation contained two kinds
                    of knowledge. The first kind lay quite beyond the power of man to receive it,
                    the second was within man’s reach. In reason, as in revelation, man can only
                    attain to the lower kind of knowledge; there is a higher kind which we may not
                    hope to reach.</p>
                <p>But while reason and revelation are two distinct sources of truths, coming to men
                    by two distinct means of cortvey-ance, the supernatural and the natural means
                    for the delivery of truth, and apprehended by two distinct faculties, reason and
                    faith, the truths which each reveal are not in themselves contradictory; for in
                    the last resort they rest on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> absolute truth—they come
                    from the one source of knowledge, God, the Absolute One. Hence arises the
                    compatibility of philosophy and theology which was the fundamental axiom of
                    scholasticism, and the possibility of a Summa Theologiae, which is a Summa
                    Philosophiae as well. All the many writings of Thomas are preparatory to his
                    great work the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologice,</hi>
                    and show us the progress of his mind training for this his life work. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Catholicae Fidei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >contra Gentiles</hi> he shows how a Christian theology is the sum and crown of
                    all science. This work is in its design apologetic, and is meant to bring within
                    the range of Christian thought all that is of value in Mahometan science. He
                    carefully establishes the necessity of revelation as a source of knowledge, not
                    merely because it aids us in comprehending in a somewhat better way the truths
                    already furnished by reason, as some of the Arabian philosophers and Maimonides
                    had acknowledged, but because it is the absolute source of our knowledge of the
                    mysteries of the Christian faith; and then he lays down the relations to be
                    observed between reason and revelation, between philosophy and theology. This
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Contra. Gentiles,</hi> may be taken as an elaborate
                    exposition of the method of Aquinas. That method, however, implied a careful
                    study and comprehension of the results which accrued to man from reason and
                    revelation, and a thorough grasp of all that had been done by man in relation to
                    those two sources of human knowledge; and so, in his preliminary writings,
                    Thomas proceeds to master the two provinces. The results of revelation he found
                    in the Holy Scriptures and in the writings of the fathers and the great
                    theologians of the church; and his method was to proceed backwards. He began
                    with Peter of Lombardy (who had reduced to theological order, in his famous book
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Sentences,</hi> the various authoritative statements of
                    the church upon doctrine) in his <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Quatuor</hi><hi rend="italic">Sententiarum</hi><hi rend="italic">P.
                    Lombardi</hi><hi rend="italic">libros.</hi> Then came his deliverances upon
                    undecided points in theology, in his <hi rend="italic">XII. Quodlibeta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Disputata,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Quaestiones
                    Disputatae.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Catena</hi><hi rend="italic">Aurea</hi>
                    next appeared, which, under the form of a commentary on the Gospels, was really
                    an exhaustive summary of the theological teaching of the greatest of the church
                    fathers. This side of his preparation was finished by a close study of
                    Scripture, the results of which are contained in his commentaries, <hi
                    rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic">omnes Epistolas Divi Apostoli
                    Expositio,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Super Isaiam et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jeremiam,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">In Psalmos.</hi> Turning now to the
                    other side, we have evidence, not only from tradition but from his writings,
                    that he was acquainted with Plato and the mystical Platonists; but he had the
                    sagacity to perceive that Ari3t0tle was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> great
                    representative of philosophy, and that his writings contained the best results
                    and method which the natural reason had as yet attained to. Accordingly Aquinas
                    prepared himself on this side by commentaries on Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Interpretatione,</hi> on his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Posterior Analytics,</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Physics,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">De Anima,</hi> and on the
                    other psychological and physical writings of the great master, each commentary
                    having for its aim to lay hold of the material and grasp the method contained
                    and employed in each treatise. Fortified by this exhaustive preparation, Aquinas
                    began his <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologiae,</hi> which
                    was to be for human thought what the Holy Roman Empire was for the bodies, and
                    the Holy Catholic Church was for the souls of men. It was to be a visible empire
                    of thought, exhaustive, all-embracing, and sovereign. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologiae</hi> was meant to be the sum of all
                    known learning, arranged according to the best method, and subordinate to the
                    dictates of the church; that was the intention of the book; practically it came
                    to be the theological dicta of the church, explained according to the philosophy
                    of Aristotle and his Arabian commentators. The <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> is
                    divided into three great parts, which shortly may be said to treat of God, Man,
                    and the God-Man. The first and the second parts are wholly the work of Aquinas,
                    but of the third part only the first 90 quaestiones are his; the rest of it was
                    finished in accordance with his designs. The first book, after a short
                    introduction upon the nature of theology as understood by Aquinas, proceeds in
                    119 questions to discuss the nature, attributes, and relations of God; and this
                    is not done as in a modern work on theology, but the questions raised in the
                    physics of Aristotle find a place alongside of the statements of Scripture,
                    while all subjects in any way related to the central theme are brought into the
                    discourse. The second part is divided into two, which are quoted as <hi
                    rend="italic">Prima Secundae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Secunda Secundae.</hi>
                    This second part has often been described as ethic, but this is scarcely true.
                    The subject is man, treated as Aristotle does, according to his <hi
                    rend="italic">τeλo&lt;s,</hi> and so Aquinas discusses all the ethical,
                    psychological, and theological questions which arise; but any theological
                    discussion upon man must be mainly ethical, and so a great proportion of the
                    first part, and almost the whole of the second, has to do with ethical
                    questions. In his ethical discussion Aquinas distinguishes theological from
                    natural virtues and vices: tho theological <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0250-0233"/> virtues are faith, hope, and charity; the
                    natural, justice, prudence, and the like. The theological virtues are founded on
                    faith, in opposition to the natural, which are founded oh reason; and as faith
                    with Aquinas is always belief in a proposition, not trust in a personal Saviour,
                    conformably with his idea that revelation is a new knowledge rather than a new
                    life, the relation of unbelief to virtue is very strictly and narrowly laid down
                    and enforced. The third part of the <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> is also divided
                    into two parts, but by accident rather than by design. Aquinas died ere he had
                    finished his great work, and what has been added to complete the scheme is
                    appended as a <hi rend="italic">Supplementum</hi><hi rend="italic">Tertice
                    Partis.</hi> In this third part Aquinas discusses the person, office, and work
                    of Christ, and had begun to discuss the sacraments, when death put an end to his
                    labours.</p>
                <p>The best edition of the works of Aquinas is the Venice one of 1787, in
