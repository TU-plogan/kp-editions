                    son of King Edward the elder, and grandson of Alfred the Great, was born in 895.
                    There has been much doubt with regard to his legitimacy, as his mother, Ecgwyn,
                    is said to have been of humble origin; but these suspicions appear to rest on
                    slight foundations. On the death of Edward in 925, Athelstan, who had been named
                    by him as his successor, was elected king by the Mercians and West Saxons, and
                    crowned at Kingston in Surrey. Considerable opposition was made to his election,
                    and several of the leading nobles entered into a conspiracy to put out his eyes
                    and deprive him of the kingdom. Alfred the Atheling, who himself aimed at the
                    royal power, was suspected of being concerned in this plot, and was obliged to
                    proceed to Rome and there take an oath of innocence. While in the act of
                    swearing at the altar, he is said to have dropped down in a fit, and to have
                    died three days afterwards. In 925 Athelstan gave one of his sisters in marriage
                    to Sihtric, the Danish ruler of Northumbria, on whose death, in the following
                    year, he invaded the Danish dominions, drove out Sihtric’s son, Guthfrith, and
                    took possession of his territory. Guth-frith, after an unsuccessful attempt to
                    stir up Constantine, king of Scotland, to whom he had fled, and after a
                    fruitless invasion of England, made submission to Athelstan, and was kindly
                    treated by him. During the next few years, the Welsh, both of Wales and of
                    Cornwall, appear to haye been subdued, and to have done homage to the king of
                    England, who levied tribute on them, and fixed the Wye and the Tamar as the
                    boundaries of Wales and Cornwall respectively. He was thus virtually king of all
                    England. In 933 or 934 he also invaded Scotland, ravaged all the south country,
                    and compelled Constantine to pay a yearly tribute. Four years later, in 937, a
                    powerful combination was made against him. Anlaf, a Danish chief, or, according
                    to some accounts, a son of Sihtric, with the king of Scotland, the Welsh, and
                    the Danes of the north, invaded England. Athelstan, with his half brother
                    Edmund, met and signally defeated the invaders in the battle of Brunan-burh,
                    celebrated in the “Brunanburh War-Song.” In 940 or 941 Athelstan died at
                    Gloucester, and was buried at Malmesbury. England had prospered under his reign;
                    for he devoted much attention to commerce, and exercised a fostering care over
                    the civil and religious interests of his people. His power made him respected
                    and esteemed on the Continent, and several foreign princes and nobles were sent
                    to be educated at his court.</p>
