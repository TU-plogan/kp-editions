                    is, being shed at stated periods, —as in the deer, the horns in the Cavicornia
                    are permanent and persistent throughout life. The process arising from the
                    frontal bone constitutes the inner shaft, or “core” of the horn; and this bony
                    core is covered by a horny sheath. The horny sheath is purely epidermic in its
                    origin and nature; that is, it consists of a special development of the outer
                    skin or epidermal tissue. When these structures are contrasted with the horns of
                    the deer,—with which group, it may be remarked, the antelopes are frequently
                    confused, but from which they are essentially distinct,—they are at once seen to
                    be different in every particular. The horns or “antlers” of the deer are solid,
                    and consist entirely of bony tissue; and they are, furthermore, shed
                    annually.</p>
                <p>The antelopes, with the other Cavicornia, participate in the following
                    characters, in addition to those furnished by the structure of the horns. Both
                    sexes are generally provided with horns. The dental formula or arrangement of
                    the teeth exhibits a want of incisor teeth in the upper, and six incisors in the
                    lower jaw; canines totally wanting in the upper jaw, and two in the lower jaw;
                    and twelve molars in each jaw. The dental formula, therefore, runs thus :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> Ξ&gt; H “·
                    I≡-&gt;∙</p>
                <p>The feet are cleft; and accessory or supplemental hoofs exist on the back aspect
                    of the feet.</p>
                <p>The antelope family <hi rend="italic">{Antilopidoe),</hi> including a great
                    number of different species, is generally distinguished from the allied families
                    of the sheep, oxen, and goats, by the light, graceful, and deer-like form of its
                    members. The horns are chiefly cylindrical in shape, but may be twisted in an
                    annular or spiral manner. The beard, or “dew-lap,” characteristic of the deer
                    tribe, is generally absent in the antelopes; and of all the Cavicornia, they
                    constitute the only family in which the curious “tear-pits” or “lachrymal
                    sinuses” of the eyes are found. These latter organs are small sacs situated
                    below the eyes, and devoted to the secretion of a yellow substance of a
                    sebaceous or waxy nature.</p>
                <p>As regards their distribution, the antelopes are chiefly found in the eastern
                    hemisphere, and Africa appears to be the great centre of distribution of the
                    group. South Africa is especially rich in antelopes, and they may be regarded as
                    representing in that continent the deer of other regions of the world. In habits
                    they are, for the most part, gregarious, and are frequently found in immense
                    herds inhabiting the grassy plateaus and plains; whilst some species are
                    exclusively mountainous in their distribution.</p>
                <p>The particular form to which the name of “antelope” has been generally assigned
                    is the <hi rend="italic">Antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">cervicapra</hi> (Plate
                    I. fig. 5), found in the East, and distinguished by the triple curve of its
                    annulated horns. The gazelle or Barbary antelope <hi rend="italic">{Gazella
                        Dorcas)</hi> has long been famed in the poetic imagery of Eastern writers.
                    It has two small black horns. The algazel <hi rend="italic">{Gazella
                        Leucoryx)</hi> (Plate I. fig. 2), found in Persia and Arabia, has slender
                    limbs, and the horns of the male are horizontal, bent backwards, obliquely
                    annulated, with smooth tips, and nearly three feet long. Several nearly allied
                    species inhabit the northern portions of Africa, the <hi rend="italic">Gazella
                        Corinna</hi> (Plate I. fig. 3) exemplifying one of these latter forms. The
                    springbok <hi rend="italic">{Gazella Euchore)</hi> of the Dutch settlers, or
                    “springer” antelope, is a well-known f∣∣πn inhabiting the southern districts of
                    Africa. The horns are simple and annulate, and are curved, so as to form a
                    lyrate or lyre-shaped figure. This animal’s activity and powers of leaping have
                    procured for it its familiar names; and travellers have long noted the immense
                    numbers of these forms which congregate in vast herds in the plains of Southern
                    and Central Africa. The bontebok <hi rend="italic">{Gazella Pygarga),</hi> and
                    the blesbok <hi rend="italic">{Gazella albifrons),</hi> are allied to the
                    springbok, and inhabit the same regions as that form. The other species found in
                    Southern Africa include the rarer blue antelope <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Gazella</hi><hi rend="italic">leucophaea),</hi> and the roan antelope <hi
                        rend="italic">{Gazella equina),</hi> a large species described by
                    Burchell.</p>
                <p>The water bok <hi rend="italic">{Kobus ellipsiprymnus)</hi> (Plate I. fig. 4), a
                    well-known African form, is of considerable size. Its familiar name has been
                    derived from its habit of frequenting rivers, and from its powers of swimming.
                    The horns are large, curved, and spreading. The klippspringer <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Oreo-tragus</hi><hi rend="italic">saltatrix)</hi> of South Africa has a
                    close resemblance in size and habits to the European chamois. The koodoo <hi
                        rend="italic">{Strepsiceros Koodoo)</hi> (Plate I. fig. 1), inhabiting South
                    and West Africa, and otherwise widely distributed over the continent, is
                    provided with very long spiral horns, which, however, exist only in the male
                    animals. These latter antelopes represent “solitary” species, that is, they are
                    generally found living in detached pairs, or as solitary individuals. A related
                    species to the koodoo has been described under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">Doria.</hi></p>
                <p>The pigmy antelopes present examples of singular members of the family, in that
                    they are of exceedingly diminutive size. The <hi rend="italic">Guevei</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">{Antilope</hi> [or <hi rend="italic">Cephalolophus~</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">pygmoea)</hi> presents two well-marked
                    varieties, and one female specimen of the smaller variety scarcely exceeded the
                    dimensions of a large rat. The gueveis occur on the Guinea Coast, but are also
                    occasionally found at the Cape of Good Hope. The bush antelope <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Cephalolophus sylvicultrix),</hi> inhabiting the districts around Sierra
                    Leone, is also of a smaller size than the more typical antelopes, and is nearly
                    related to the preceding forms. The harnessed antelope <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">scripta)</hi> (Plate II. fig. 1), so named
                    from the white stripes with which its body is encircled, has been described as
                    occurring in Senegal·</p>
                <p>The eland or impophoo <hi rend="italic">{Boselaphus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Oreas)</hi> is one of the largest of the antelopes, and is ox-like in its
                    general proportions and appearance. The horns are straight and erect, and the
                    breast possesses a “dew-lap” or tuft. It inhabits the flat lands of Southern
                    Africa. Allied to the elands, but of smaller size, we find the addax <hi
                        rend="italic">{Oryx naso-maculata).</hi> Of this species there are several
                    varieties; but the typical form is found in Northern Africa, and is
                    distinguished by the elongated spiral horns.</p>
                <p>The gnus of South Africa form connecting links between the antelope and ox
                    families, presenting characters in external aspect which separate them out as
                    singular and somewhat abnormal forms. The gnu proper or wildebeest <hi
                        rend="italic">{Catoblepas Gnu)</hi> (Plate II. fig. 5), and the bastard
                    wildebeest <hi rend="italic">{Catoblepas Gorgon)),</hi> are the two forms
                    included in this genus. The head is bovine in its appearance, and to the ox-like
                    head are added the mane of the horse, the limbs of the stag, and the horns of
                    the buffalo. The horns are possessed by both sexes, and are curved from their
                    broad bases, at first downwards and forwards, their terminal portions being
                    directed upwards and backwards. These animals resemble a small horse in size,
                    and occur in large herds on the flat steppes of Southern Africa, although they
                    appear to be migratory in habits, and to have a wide range in distribution over
                    the southern half of the continent.</p>
                <p>Having thus indicated the more familiar of the antelopes inhabiting the great
                    African or central tract of distribution of the family, we may next glance at
                    the speciee found in the other continents. The Chinese antelope <hi
                        rend="italic">{Antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">gutturosa),</hi> or dzerin of
                    the Mongolian Tartars, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n115/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0115-0102"/> possesses short, thick horns, directed
                    backwards, divergent, with their points turned inwards. It occurs in the deserts
                    lying between China and Thibet. The chiru <hi rend="italic">(Pantholops
                        Hodgsonii),</hi> inhabiting Thibet and the mountainous slopes of the
                    Himalayas, possesses elongated horns of an annulated character, and is besides
                    distinguished by a soft glandular swelling above each nostril. It has an
                    abundant woolly coating; and from the fact of it sometimes appearing with a
                    single horn,—the second horn being rudimentary or undeveloped,—the mythical
                    tales of “unicorns” are supposed to have arisen.</p>
                <p>The chicara <hi rend="italic">(Tetracerus quadricornis)</hi> (Plate II. fig. 4),
                    or four-horned antelope, found in the forests of India generally, and
                    plentifully in Bengal, is of small size, and distinguished by the presence, in
                    the males only, of four horns, the larger pair of which are situated on the
                    upper aspect of the forehead, and are smooth, erect, inclined slightly forwards,
                    divergent, and about three inches long. The smaller horns are situated in front
                    of the first pair, and average in length an inch or more. The nyl ghau <hi
                        rend="italic">(Portax</hi><hi rend="italic">picta)</hi> (Plate II. fig. 3),
                    found in Northern India, like its African representative, the gnu, appears to
                    unite in itself the characters of the antelopes and oxen. The native name of the
                    creature, <hi rend="italic">nyl ghau,</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">blue
                        ox,</hi> and by the inhabitants of India it is regarded as being an ox,
                    although its true place is undoubtedly among the antelopes. In size the nyl ghau
                    resembles a stag; the tail is tufted; and the horns, occurring in the males
                    only, are curved upwards, and diverge at their extremities. The nyl ghau is
                    susceptible of being partly domesticated, and it has been ascertained to breed
                    freely in a tame state.</p>
                <p>The European species of antelope include the chamois <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Rupicapra</hi><hi rend="italic">Tragus)</hi> (Plate II. fig. 2), and the
                    saiga <hi rend="italic">(Colus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Antilocapra
                        Saiga).</hi> The former is essentially European in its distribution, but the
                    latter extends from Poland and Russia into Asia. The chamois inhabits the Alps
                    and mountains of Southern Europe, and occurs in small herds. The horns are
                    present in both males and females, and are of small size, and recurved at their
                    extremities. The chamois may be regarded as tending to link the antelope type to
                    that of the sheep. The saiga is distinguished by the large size of the horns,
                    and by the peculiar conformation of the nose, the opening of which is large, and
                    bounded by a soft cartilaginous margin.</p>
                <p>The American continent possesses but two representatives of the antelope family.
                    These are the so-called Rocky Mountain sheep or goat—a true antelope—and the
                    prongbuck or cabrit of North American regions. The Rocky Mountain sheep or goat
                        <hi rend="italic">(Haplocerus</hi><hi rend="italic">laniger),</hi>
                    possessing a coat of long woolly hair, is closely related to the chamois of
                    Europe; and in this form, as well as in the prongbuck, the connection between
                    the antelopes and goats may be traced.</p>
                <p>The prongbuck <hi rend="italic">(Antilocapra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >furcifera</hi><hi rend="italic">oτamericana)</hi> (Plate I. fig. 6)
                    presents a singular exception to the other members of the antelope family, in
                    the deciduous nature of the <hi rend="italic">sheaths ol</hi> the horns, which
                    are annually shed and developed. Accessory hoofs are wanting in the prongbuck,
                    and the lachrymal sinuses of other antelopes are undeveloped; as also are the
                    “inguinal pores,” or groin-sacs, found in most members of the family, and which
                    secrete a viscid substance, the function of which is undetermined. The females
                    are devoid of horns, and those of the males are branched in front, or are
                    “furcate,”—a conformation of these structures not found in any other member of
                    the antelope family. The chief habitat of the prongbuck appears to be the
                    prairie lands of Central America, and its northern limit would appear to be
                    about the fifty-third degree of north latitude. <hi rend="smallcaps">· (a.
