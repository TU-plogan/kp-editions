                <p><label type="entry">ASSAM</label>, a province of British India. Until the
                    beginning of 1874 Assam formed the north-east division of the territories under
                    the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal. In that year it was erected into a separate
                    administration, presided over by a Chief Commissioner, who acts directly under
                    the Governor-General of India in council. The district of Cachar was added to
                    the old division of Assam, and now forms part of the Chief Commissioner’s
                    jurisdiction. It lies between 24° and 28° N. lat., and between 90 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> and 98° E. long., and consists of the upper valleys
                    of the Brahmaputra for a length of about 500 miles from where that river enters
                    the north-eastern frontier of British India. These valleys vary in breadth, but
                    generally occupy a space of about 60 miles between the Himalayas on the north,
                    and the watershed which separates the Brahmaputra from the river system of
                    Cachar. Assam, therefore, is bounded on the N. by the sub-Himâlayan ranges of
                    the Bhutiâ, Akà, Daphlâ, and Miri tribes; on the E. by the unsurveyed forests
                    and mountains which separate British India from northern Burmah; on the S. by
                    the hills inhabited by the Nâgâs, Jaintiyas, and Khâsiàs, which separate Assam
                    from Silhet; and on the W. by the Gâro hills and Kuch Behar. Assam may be
                    considered, however, either as a natural province or as an artificial political
                    division. In its former aspect, in which it will be dealt with in this article,
                    it has an area of 48,473 square miles, with a population in 1872 of 2,412,480
                    souls. It is the outlying province of India to the north-east, so that while the
                    pressure of population in several of the inner divisions of Bengal varies from
                    500 to 573 persons per square mile, in Assam it is barely 50. Even deducting
                    12,058 miles of hill country in Lakhimpur and Cachar districts, the pressure of
                    population is only 66 persons per square mile in the more cultivated parts of
                    Assam. Taken as a political division, it is locally administered by a Chief
                    Commissioner, with his headquarters at Gauhâtï. It is subdivided into the ten
                    following districts, each under a deputy commissioner:—</p>

                    cession to the British in 1826. A full account of its ancient kings will be
                    found in Mr William Robinson’s <hi rend="italic">Assam,</hi> chap. iv.
                    (Calcutta, 1841). It seems to have been originally included, along with the
                    greater part of north-eastern Bengal, in the old Hindu territory of Kamπip. Its
                    early legends point to great religious revolutions between the rival rites of
                    Krishna and Siva as a source of dynastic changes. Its roll of kings extends deep
                    into pre-historic times, but the first Raja capable of identification flourished
                    about the year 76 <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> Kâmrûp, the Prâgjotishpur of
                    the ancient Hindus, was the capital of a legendary king Narak, whose son
                    Bhagadatta distinguished himself in the great war of the Mahabharata. On the
                    rise of the Koch power, the kings of Kuch Behar wrested a portion of Assam from
                    the kings of the Pal dynasty to whom it belonged. In the early part of the 13 th
                    century the Ahams or Ahorns, from northern Burmah and the Chinese frontiers,
                    poured into the eastern districts of Assam, founded a kingdom, and held it
                    firmly for several centuries. A tradition relates that this race of conquerors
                    were originally let down from heaven by iron chains, and alighted in a place
                    called Mungbingram, supposed to be in the Patkai range, in 567 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> Their manners, customs, religion, and language were,
                    and for a long time continued to be, different from those of the Hindus; but
                    they found themselves compelled to respect the superior civilisation of this
                    race, and slowly adopted its customs and language. The conversion of their king
                    Chuchengpha to Hinduism took place about the year 1611 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> and the whole Ahams of Assam gradually followed his example. In
                    mediaeval history, the Assamese were known to the Musalman population as a
                    warlike, predatory race, who sailed down the Brahmaputra in fleets of
                    innumerable canoes, plundered the rich districts of the delta, and retired in
                    safety to their forests and swamps. As the Muhammadan power consolidateα itself
                    in Bengal, repeated expeditions were sent out against these river pirates of the
                    north-east. The physical difficulties which an invading force had to contend
                    with in Assam, however, prevented anything like a regular subjugation of the
                    country; and after repeated efforts, the Musalmâns contented themselves with
                    occupying the western districts at the mouth of the Assam valley. The following
                    details will suffice for the history of a struggle in which no great political
                    object was attained, and which left the Assamese still the same wild and
                    piratical people as when their fleets of canoes first sallied forth against the
                    Bengal delta. In 1638, during the reign of the Emperor Shah Jahan, the Assamese
                    descended the Brahmaputra, and pillaged the country round the city of Dacca;
                    they were expelled by the governor of Bengal, who retaliated upon the plunderers
                    by ravaging Assam. During the civil wars between the sons of Shah Jahan, the
                    king of Assam renewed his predatory incursions into Bengal; upon the termination
                    of the contest, Aur-angzeb determined to avenge these repeated insults, and
                    despatched a considerable force for the regular invasion the Assamese territory.
                    His general, Mir Jumla, defeated the Raja, who fled to the mountains, and most
                    of the chiefs made their submission to the conqueror. But the rains set in with
                    unusual violence, and Mir Jumlâ’s army was almost annihilated by famine and
                    sickness. Thus terminated the last expedition against Assam by the Muhammadans,
                    whose fortunes in this country were never prosperous. A writer of the Muhammadan
                    faith says :—“Whenever an invading army haβ entered their territories, the
                    Assamese have sheltered themselves in strong posts, and have distressed the
                    enemy by stratagems, surprises, and. alarms, and by cutting off their
                    provisions. If these means failed, they have declined a battle in the field, but
                    have carried the peasants into the mountains, burned the grain, and left the
                    country desert. But when the rainy season has set in upon the advancing enemy,
                    they have watched their opportunity to make excursions and vent their rage; the
                    famished vaders have either become their prisoners or been put to death. In this
                    manner powerful and numerous armies have been sunk in that whirlpool of
                    destruction, and not a soul has escaped.” The same writer states that the
                    country was spacious, populous, and hard to be penetrated; that it abounded in
                    dangers; that the paths and roads were beset with difficulties; and that the
                    obstacles to conquest were more than could be expressed. The inhabitants, he
                    says, were enterprising, well-armed, and always prepared for battle. Moreover,
                    they had lofty forts, numerously garrisoned and plentifully provided with
                    warlike stores; and the approach to them was opposed by thick and dangerous
                    jungles, and broad and boisterous rivers. The difficulties in the way of
                    successful invasion are of course not understated, as it was the object of the
                    writer to exalt the prowess and perseverance of the faithful. He accounts for
                    their temporary success by recording that “the Musalman hordes experienced the
                    comfort of fighting for their religion, and the blessings of it reverted to the
                    sovereignty of his just and pious majesty.” The short-lived triumph of the
                    Musalmâns might, however, have warranted a less ambitious tone. About the middle
                    of the 17th century the chief became a convert to Hinduism. By what mode the
                    conversion was effected does not clearly appear, but whatever were the means
                    employed, it seems that the decline of the country commenced about the same
                    period. Internal dissensions, invasion, and disturbances of every kind convulsed
                    the province, and neither prince nor people enjoyed security. Late in the 18th
                    century some interference took place on the part of the British Government, then
                    conducted by Lord Cornwallis; but the successor of that nobleman, Sir John
                    Shore, adopting the non-intervention policy, withdrew the British force, and
                    abandoned the country to its fate. Its condition encouraged the Burmese, an
                    aggressive people, to depose the Râjâ, and to make Assam a dependency of Ava.
                    The extension of their encroachments on a portion of the territory of the East
                    India Company compelled the British Government to take decisive steps for its
                    own protection. Hence arose the sériée of hostilities with Ava known in Indian
                    history as the first Burmese war, on the termination of which by treaty in
                    February 1826, Assam remained a British possession. In 1832 that portion of the
                    province denominated Upper Assam was formed into an independent native state,
                    and conferred upon Purandar Sinh, the ex-Râjâ of the country; but the
                    administration of this chief proved unsatisfactory, and in 1838 his principality
                    was reunited with the British dominions. After a period of successful
                    administration and internal development, under the Lieutenant-Governor of
                    Bengal, it was erected into a separate Chief-Commissionership in 1874.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Aspects.</hi> —Assam is a fertile series of
                    valleys, with the great channel of the Brahmaputra (literally, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the Son of Brahma)</hi> flowing down its middle, and an infinite number of
                    tributaries and water-courses pouring into it from the mountains on either side.
                    The Brahmaputra spreads out in a sheet of water several miles broad during the
                    rainy season, and in its course through Assam forms a number of islands in its
                    bed. Rising in the Thibetan plateau, far to the north of the Himâlayas, and
                    skirting round their eastern passes, not far from the Yang-tse-kiang and the
                    great river of Cambodia, it enters Assam by a series of waterfalls and rapids,
                    amid vast boulders and accumulations of rocks. The gorge, situated in Lak-himpur
                    district, through which the southernmost branch of the Brahmaputra enters, has
                    from time immemorial been held in reverence by the Hindus. It is called the
                    Brahma-kunda or Parasurâmkunda; and although the journey to it is both difficult
                    and dangerous, it is annually visited by thousands of devotees. After a rapid
                    course westwards down the whole length of the Assam valley, the Brahmaputra
                    turns sharply to the south, spreading itself over the alluvial districts of the
                    Bengal delta, and, after several changes of name, ends its course of 1800 miles
                    in the Bay of Bengal. Its first tributaries in Assam, after crossing the
                    frontier, are the Kundil and the Digaru, flowing from the Mishmi hills on the
                    north, and the Tengâpâni and NawA Dihing, which take their rise on the Singpho
                    hills to the south-east. Shortly afterwards it receives the Dibang, flowing from
                    the north-east; but its principal confluent is the Dihang, which, deriving its
                    origin, under the name of the Sanpu, from a spot in the vicinity of the source
                    of the Satlej, flows in a direction precisely opposite to that river, and
                    traversing the table-land of Thibet, at the back of the great Himalaya range,
                    falls into the Brahmaputra in 27° 48'N. lat., 95° 26'E. long., after a course of
                    nearly 1000 miles. Doubts were long entertained whether the Dihang could be
                    justly regarded as the continuation of the Sanpu; these, however, have been
                    gradually removed by the additional testimony of more recent notices; and as it
                    is now ascertained that the last-named river does not flow into the Irawadi, it
                    appears impossible to account for its course to the sea, except by presuming it
                    to discharge its w aters into the Brahmaputra through the channel of the Dihang.
                    Below the confluence, the united stream flows in a south-westerly direction,
                    forming the boundary between the districts of Lakhimpur and Darang, situated on
                    its northern bank, and those of Sadiyâ, Sibsâgar, and Naogâon on the south; and
                    finally bisecting Kâmrüp, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0784-0719"/> crosses over the frontier of the province, and
                    passes into Bengal. In its course it receives on the left side the Buri Dihing,
                    a river having its rise at the south-eastern angle of the province; and lower
                    down, on the opposite side, it parts with a considerable offset termed the Buri
                    Lohit, which, however, reunites with the Brahmaputra 60 miles below the point of
                    divergence, bearing with it the additional waters of the Subansiri, flowing from
                    Thibet. A second offset, under the name of the Kalang River, rejoins the parent
                    stream a short distance above the town of Gauhâti. The remaining rivers are too
                    numerous to be particularised. Of these, not less than 61 are distinguished by
                    well-known names, of which 34 flow from the northern, <hi rend="italic">24</hi>
                    from the southern mountains, and the remainder from sources beyond the confines
                    of Assam. The streams of the south are not rapid, and have no considerable
                    current until May or June. Among the islands formed by the intersection and
                    confluence of the rivers is Mâjuli, or the Great Island, as it is called by way
                    of pre-eminence. This island extends <hi rend="italic">55</hi> miles in length
                    by about 10 in breadth, and is formed by the Brahmaputra on the southeast, and
                    the Buri Lohit river on the north-west. A Persian writer, Muhammad Kâzim, in
                    describing Assam at the close of the 17th century, makes some observations on
                    its general appearance. He thus speaks of Mâjuli two centuries ago :—</p>
                <p>“An island well inhabited, and in an excellent state of agriculture; it contains
                    a spacious, clear, and pleasant country. The cultivated part is bounded by a
                    thick forest, which harbours elephants, and these animals may be caught here, as
                    well as in four or five other forests in Assam. If there be occasion for them,
                    five or six hundred elephants may be procured in a year.”</p>
                <p>Describing the country south of the Brahmaputra, the same native author observes
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Across the river on the side of Garhgaon is a wide, agreeable, level country
                    that delights the heart of the beholder. The whole face of it is marked with
                    population and tillage; and it presents on every side charming prospects of
                    ploughed fields, harvests, gardens, and groves. From the village of Sâlagirâ to
                    the city of Garhgâon, a space of about 50 <hi rend="italic">kos</hi> (100 miles)
                    is filled with such an uninterrupted range of gardens, plentifully stocked with
                    fruit trees, that it appears as one garden. Within them are the houses of
                    peasants, and a beautiful assemblage of coloured and fragrant herbs, and of
                    garden and wild flowers blowing together. As the country is overflowed in the
                    rainy season, a high and broad causeway has been raised for the convenience of
                    travellers from Salagira to Garhgâon, which is the only uncultivated ground that
                    is to be seen. Each side of this road is planted with shady bamboos, the tops of
                    which meet and are entwined. Among the fruits which this country produces are
                    mangoes, plantains, jacks, oranges, citrons, limes, and punialeh, a species of
                    amleh, which has such an excellent flavour that every person who tastes it
                    prefers it to the plum. There are also cocoa-nut trees, pepper-vines, areca
                    trees, and the sadij (an aromatic leaf), in great plenty. Sugar-cane excels in
                    softness and sweetness, and is of three colours, black, red, and white; there is
                    ginger free from fibres, and betel vines. The strength of vegetation and
                    fertility of the soil is such that whatever seed is sown, or slips planted, they
                    always thrive. The environs of Garhg⅛n furnish small apricots, yams, and
                    pomegranates; but as these are wild, and not assisted by cultivation and
                    engrafting, they are very indifferent. The principal crop of this country
                    consists in rice and mash. Ades, a kind of pea, is very scarce, and wheat and
                    barley are never sown.”</p>
                <p>And in respect to the other great division of the province he remarks;—</p>
                <p>“The country which is on the northern side of the Brahmaputra is in the highest
                    state of cultivation, and produces plenty of pepper and areca nuts. It even
                    surpasses the southern portion in population and tillage; but as the latter
                    contains a greater tract of wild forests and places difficult of access, the
                    rulers of Assam have chosen to reside in it for the convenience of control, and
                    have erected in it the capital of the kingdom. The breadth of the northern
                    division from the bank of the river to the foot of the mountains, which is a
                    cold climate and contains snow, is various, but is nowhere less than 30 miles,
                    nor more than 90. The inhabitants of those mountains are strong, have a robust
                    and respectable appearance, and are of a middling size. Their complexions, like
                    those of the natives of all cold climates, are red and white; and they have also
                    trees and fruits peculiar to frigid regions.”</p>
                <p>This description, written two centuries ago, would apply at the present day. In
                    the upper part of the valley, towards the gorge where the Brahmaputra enters,
                    the country is varied and picturesque, walled in on the north and east by the
                    Himalayas, and thickly wooded from the base to the snowline. On either bank of
                    the Brahmaputra a long narrow strip of plain rises almost imperceptibly to the
                    foot of the hills. Gigantic reeds and grasses occupy the low lands near the
                    banks of the great river; expanses of fertile rice-land come next; a little
                    higher up, dotted with villages encircled by groves of bamboos and fruit trees
                    of great size and beauty, the dark forests succeed, covering the interior
                    table-land and mountains. The country in the vicinity of the large rivers is
                    flat, and impenetrable from dense tangled jungle, with the exception of some
                    very low-lying tracts which are either permanent marshes or are covered with
                    water during the rains. Jungle will not grow on these depressions, and they are
                    covered either with water, reeds, high grasses, or rice cultivation. On or near
                    such open spaces are collected all the villages. As the traveller proceeds
                    farther down the valley, the country gradually opens out into wide plains. In
                    the western district of Kâmrùp the country forms one great expanse, with a few
                    elevated tracts here and there, varying from 200 to 800 feet in height.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Varieties of Soils.</hi> —The soil is exceedingly rich and
                    well adapted to all kiuds of agricultural purposes, and for the most part is
                    composed of a rich black loam reposing on a gray sandy clay, though occasionally
                    it exhibits a light yellow clayey texture. The land may be divided into three
                    great classes. The first division is composed of hills, the largest group within
                    the valley being that of the Mikir Mountains, which stand out upon the plain.
                    Another set of hills project into the valley at Gauhâti But these latter are
                    rather prolongations of spurs from the Khâsiâ chain than isolated groups
                    belonging to the plains. The other hills are all isolated, and of small extent.
                    The second division of the lands is the well-raised part of the valley whose
                    level lies above the ordinary inundations of the Brahmaputra. The channels of
                    some of the hill streams, however, are of so little depth that the highest lands
                    in their neighbourhood are liable to sudden floods. On the north bank of the
                    great river, lands of this sort run down the whole length of the valley, except
                    where they are interrupted by the beds of the hill streams. The breadth of these
                    plains is in some places very trifling, whilst in others they comprise a tract
                    of many miles, according to the number and the height of the rocks or hills that
                    protect them from the aberrations of the river. The alluvial deposits of the
                    Brahmaputra and of its tributary streams may be considered as the third general
                    division of lands in Assam. These lands are very extensive, and present every
                    degree of fertility and elevation, from the vast <hi rend="italic">chars</hi> of
                    pure sand, subject to annual inundations, to the firm islands, so raised by
                    drift-sand and the accumulated remains of rank vegetable matter, as no longer to
                    be liable to flood. The rapidity with which wastes composed entirely of sand
                    newly washed forward by the current during floods become converted into rich
                    pasture, is astonishing. As the freshets begin to lessen and retire into the
                    deeper channels, the currents form natural embankments on their edges,
                    preventing the return of a small portion of water which is thus left stagnant on
                    the sands, and exposed to the action of the sun’s rays. It slowly evaporates,
                    leaving a thin crust of animal and vegetable matter. This is soon impregnated
                    with the seeds of the <hi rend="italic">Saccharum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spontaneum</hi> and other grasses that have been partly brought by the winds
                    and partly deposited by the water. Such places are frequented by numerous flocks
                    of aquatic birds, which resort thither in search of fish and mollusca. As
                    vegetation begins to appear, herds of wild <pb break="no"

                    supply of food and the solitude of the newly-formed land, and in their turn
                    contribute to manure the soil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Geology.</hi> —Limestone, coal, and petroleum are found;
                    with oil springs, mineral springs, and brine springs. The mountains on the
                    opposite sides of the valley are characterised by distinct systems, those on the
                    north being composed of primitive formations, while those on the south partake
                    largely of sandstone, shell-limestone, and coal. Some valuable minerals are met
                    with. Gold-dust is found in all the rivers flowing from the northern mountains,
                    but it differs in purity and colour, and also in malleability. That which is
                    obtained in the Dikrang is purer than that found in the Brahmaputra, though it
                    is more abundant in the bed of the latter river. Gold-dust is found most
                    plentifully near the foot of the northern hills; it is never sought for in the
                    southern rivers. Beds of iron-ore exist in various places, and tracings of
                    former workings on a large scale remain; but the native article, being undersold
                    by iron imported from England, is now driven out of the market. Coal has also
                    been discovered in beds of considerable magnitude, and from the circumstance of
                    its existence at the two extremities of the province, there appear grounds for
                    the inference that the coal formations of Assam are co-extensive with the whole
                    length of the valley. The extreme difficulty, however, of moving about in those
                    districts, the absence of roads, and the jungly and almost uninhabited state of
                    the country, have tended to prevent the opening up of the mineral deposits of
                    the province. More recently, the largely-extended cultivation of tea, and the
                    consequently increased demand for means of transport and communication, have
                    directed attention to the local supplies of fuel for the river steamers which
                    now navigate the Brahmaputra. In 1864-65, Mr H. B. Medlicott,
                    Deputy-Superintendent of the Geological Survey, visited this province, and
                    reported most favourably of the value and extent of the coal. To the north of
                    the Brahmaputra no coal worth working was found. To the south, in Upper Assam,
                    the principal localities are in the neighbourhood of Jaipur, in the Debrogarh
                    sub-division of the Lakhimpur district, and in the vicinity of Makum. The chief
                    sites are the Terap, where a minimum thickness of 5 feet of bright clean coal,
                    nearly horizontal, was seen; the Namchik, a tributary of the Dihang, where,
                    within 200 feet in length, three thick beds of good sound coal were seen, one 8
                    feet thick; and at Jaipur, where a seam of 17 feet thick occurs, of which 10
                    feet is good bright coal. Several other seams also exist which have never been
                    touched. The inaccessible nature of the country, however, and the want of a
                    trustworthy map, render it quite impracticable at present to obtain even an
                    approximate idea of the extent of area over which these beds range, and of the
                    amount of fuel available. It can, however, be safely asserted that this amount
                    is very large and most valuable. Assays of the Assam coals showed a proportion
                    of ash not exceeding from 2 to 5 per cent. The survey of the country is now
                    being pushed forward. Neither copper nor silver are found in the province.
                    Rock-salt is dug out of the earth, and brine springs are not uncommon, from
                    which salt is made; but the manufacture is costly, and the salt is as expensive
                    as that imported from Liverpool.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetable Products: Tea.</hi> —The most important article of
                    commerce produced in Assam is tea. The rice crop covers a very great proportion
                    of the cultivated land, but it is used for local consumption. The tea
                    plantations occupy only a very small area, but they are the one great source of
                    wealth to the province, and the necessities of tea cultivation are the chief
                    stimulants to the development of Assam. The plant was discovered in 1823 by Mr
                    Robert Bruce, who had proceeded thither on a mercantile exploration. The
                    country, however, then formed part of the Burmese dominions. But war with this
                    monarchy shortly afterwards broke out, and a brother of the first discoverer,
                    happening to be appointed to the command of a division of gun-boats employed in
                    some part of the operations, followed up the pursuit of the subject, and
                    obtained several hundred plants and a considerable quantity of seed. Some
                    specimens were ultimately forwarded to the superintendent of the botanic garden
                    at Calcutta. In 1832 Captain Jenkins was deputed by the Governor-General of
                    India, Lord William Bentinck, to report upon the resources of the country, and
                    the tea plant was brought to his especial notice by Mr Bruce; in 1834 a minute
                    was recorded by the Governor-General on the subject, to which it is stated tl at
                    his attention had been called to it in 1827 before his departure from England.
                    In accordance with the views of that minute, a committee was appointed to
                    prosecute inquiries, and to promote the cultivation of the plant. Communications
                    were opened with China with a view to obtain fresh plants and seeds, and a
                    deputation, composed of gentlemen versed in botanical studies, was despatched to
                    Assam. Some seeds were obtained from China; but they proved to be of small
                    importance, as it was clearly ascertained by the members of the Assam deputation
                    that both the black and the green tea plants were indigenous here, and might be
                    multiplied to any extent; another result of the Chinese mission, that of
                    procuring persons skilled in the cultivation and manufacture of black tea, was
                    of more material benefit. Subsequently, under Lord Auckland, a further supply of
                    Chinese cultivators and manufacturers was obtained—men well acquainted with the
                    processes necessary for the production of green tea, as the former set were with
                    those requisite for black. In 1838 the first twelve chests of tea from Assam
                    were received in England. They had been injured in some degree on the passage,
                    but on samples being submitted to brokers, and others of long experience and
                    tried judgment, the reports were highly favourable. It was never, however, the
                    intention of Government to carry on the trade, but to resign it to private
                    adventure as soon as the experimental course could be fairly completed.
                    Mercantile associations for the culture and manufacture of tea in Assam began to
                    be formed as early as 1839; and in 1849 the Government disposed of their
                    establishment, and relinquished the manufacture to the ordinary operation of
                    commercial enterprise. In 1851 the crop of the principal company was estimated
                    to produce 280,000 fi&gt;. Since then the enterprise has rapidly developed. The
                    returns for 1871 show 11,475,398 lb of tea manufactured in Assam, against
                    9,511,517in 1870,showing an increase of 1,963,881 lb in one year. There were 416
                    gardens open, and the whole extent of land held under the different tenures for
                    this purpose was 474,939 acres, of which 54,384 were reported to be under
                    cultivation. The average monthly number of labourers employed on the tea gardens
                    of Assam during 1871 was 54,326, of whom upwards of 38,000 were imported under
                    the Labour Transport Acts, chiefly from the western districts of Lower Bengal.
                    It is to be remembered that Assam now includes Cachar, and these statistics are
                    for the whole province as constituted in 1874. Tea cultivation is steadily
                    progressing in Assam, and has firmly established itself as a staple of Indian
                    trade. Besides rice and tea, the other principal crops of Assam are pulses,
                    Indian com, oil seeds, sugar-cane, <hi rend="italic">pan,</hi> hemp and jute,
                    rhea grass, mulberry, potatoes, and other vegetables.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Animals.</hi> —The zoology of Assam presents some
                    interesting features. Wild elephants abound and commit many depredations,
                    entering villages in large herds, and consuming everything suitable to their
                    tastes. Many are caught by means of female elephants previously tamed, and
                    trained to decoy males into the snares prepared for subjecting them to
                    captivity. A considerable number are tamed and exported from Assam every year,
                    but the speculation appears to be rather precarious, as it is said about twice
                    the number exported are annually lost in the course of training. Many are killed
                    every year in the forests for the sake of the ivory which they furnish; and the
                    supply must be very great which can afford so many for export and destruction
                    without any perceptible diminution of their number. The rhinoceros is found in
                    the denser parts of the forests, and generally in swampy places. This animal is
                    hunted and killed for its skin and its horn. The skin affords the material for
                    the best shields. The horn is sacred in the eyes of the natives. Contrary to the
                    usual belief, it is stated that, if caught young, the rhinoceros is easily
                    tamed, and becomes strongly attached to his keeper. Tigers abound, and though
                    many are annually destroyed for the sake of the Government reward, their numbers
                    seem scarcely, if at all, to diminish. Their destruction is sometimes effected
                    by poisoned arrows discharged from an instrument resembling a cross-bow, in
                    which the arrow is first fixed, and a string connected with the trigger is then
                    carried across the path in front Of the arrow, and fastened to a peg. The animal
                    thus struck is commonly found dead at the distance of a few yards from <pb

                    and bears are numerous; and the <hi rend="italic">Arctonix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Collaris</hi> of Cuvier, a small animal somewhat resembling a bear, but having
                    the snout, eyes, and tail of a hog, is found. Among the most formidable animals
                    known is the wild buffalo, which is of great size, strength, and fierceness.
                    Many deaths are caused by this animal, and a reward is given for its
                    destruction. The fox and the jackal exist, and the wild hog is very abundant.
                    Goats, deer of various kinds, hares, and two or three species of antelope are
                    found, as are monkeys in great variety. The porcupine, the squirrel, the civet
                    cat, the ichneumon, and the otter are common. The birds are too various to admit
                    of enumeration. Wild game is plentiful; pheasants, partridges, snipe, and
                    waterfowl of many descriptions make the country a tempting field for the
                    sportsman. Vultures and other birds of prey are met with. Crocodiles (commonly
                    ealled alligators) swarm in all parts of the Brahmaputra, and are very
                    destructive to the fish, of which hundreds of varieties are found, and which
                    supply a valuable article of food. The most destructive of the <hi rend="italic"

                    the snakes. Of these, several poisonous species exist, including the cobra and

                    fairly-grown healthy serpent of either of these species is deadly; and it is
                    ascertained that more deaths occur from snake-bite than from all the other wild
                    beasts put together. Among the non-poisonous serpents, the python ranks first.
                    This is an enormous boa-constrictor, of great length and weight, which drops
                    upon his prey from the branch of a tree, or steals upon it in the thick grass.
                    He kills his victim by rolling himself round the body till he breaks its ribs,
                    or suffocates it by one irresistible convolution round its throat. He seldom or
                    never attacks human beings unless in self-defence, and loss of life from this
                    cause is scarcely ever reported. Full details as to the botany and zoology of
                    Assam will be found in Mr William Robinson’s account of the province (Calcutta,
                    1841).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Inhabitants</hi> of the entire province number nearly
                    two and a half millions, of whom more than one million and three-quarters are
                    Hindus; 250,490 are Muhammadans, 1788 are Christians, and the remaining third of
                    a million are hill tribes, professing aboriginal faiths. The native population
                    is so exceedingly sparse that the demand for labour on the tea gardens has given
                    rise to a system of importing coolies from western Bengal. A series of laws
                    regulate the terms of the contract between the planter and the imported
                    labourer, prevent abuses in recruiting coolies among the ignorant peasantry of
                    the west, and provide for their health and comfort during their transit to the
                    distant districts of Assam. Under these Acts 4988 labourers were imported into
                    the tea districts of Assam (including Cachar) in 1871, the total number of
                    imported labourers employed on the tea plantations at the end of that year being
                    39,426. A large proportion of the native inhabitants derive their origin from
                    tribes who came from the Himalayan ranges, from Burmah, or from the Chinese
                    frontier. The most important of these are the Ahams or Ahorns, an offshoot of
                    the Shan race of Northern Burmah. They were the last conquerors of Assam before
                    the Burmese, and they long preserved their ancient traditions, habits, and
                    institutions. Hinduism first made its encroachments among their kings and
                    nobility. Several generations ago they gave up eating beef, and they are now
                    completely Hinduised, except in a few remote recesses of Assam. Hinduism has
                    also impressed its language upon the province, and the vernacular Assamese
                    possesses a close affinity to Bengali, with the substitution of s for the
                    Bengali <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> of a guttural <hi rend="italic">h</hi> for
                    the Bengali <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sh,</hi> and a few
                    other dialectic changes. Indeed, so close was the resemblance that during the
                    last thirty years Bengali was used as the court and official language of the
                    province under our rule. But with the development of the country the Assamese
                    tongue has asserted its claims to be treated as a distinct vernacular, and a
                    late resolution of Government (1873) re-established it as the language of
                    official life and public business.</p>
                <p>i The Assam peasant, living in a half-populated province, and surrounded by
                    surplus land, is indolent, good-natured, and, on the whole, prosperous. He
                    raises sufficient food for his wants with very little labour, and, with the
                    exception of a few religious ceremonies, he has no demand made upon him for
                    money, saving the light rental of his fields. Under the peaceful influences of
                    British rule, he has completely lost his ancient warlike instincts, and
                    forgotten his predatory habits. In complexion he is a shade or two fairer than
                    the Bengali His person is in general short and robust, but devoid of the grace
                    and flexibility of the Hindu. A flat face, with high cheek-bones, presents a
                    physiognomy resembling the Chinese, and suggests no idea of beauty. His hair is
                    abundant, black, lank, and coarse, but the beard is scanty, and usually plucked
                    out, which gives him an effeminate appearance. The women form a striking
                    contrast to the men; there is more of feminine beauty in them than is commonly
                    seen in the women of Bengal, with a form and feature somewhat approaching the
                    European. In most parts of the country the women of rank go about in public,
                    without that artificial modesty practised by native ladies in other parts of
                    India. Although the ancient ruling classes originally came to the province
                    across the Himalayas or from Burmah, a stream of immigration also went on from
                    Bengal, and the Nadiyâls or Dorns, who originally emigrated from the Delta, are
                    said to be the most numerous tribe in Assam. Their original employment was that
                    of fishermen. Although a very low caste, and indeed one of the out-castes among
                    the Hindus of Bengal, they observe in Assam various rules of purity in eating
                    and drinking, with a greater strictness than even the Brâhmans. They have not,
                    however, taken a BrAhman as their spiritual guide, but follow the instructions
                    of the Kalitâs, the ancient priests of the Ahams. The habits of life of the
                    Assamese peasantry are pre-eminently domestic. Great respect is paid to old age;
                    when parents are no longer capable of labour they are supported by their
                    children, and scarcely any one is allowed to become a burden to the public. They
                    have also in general a very tender regard for their offspring, and are generous
                    and kind to their relations. They are hospitable to people of their own caste,
                    but to no others. The use of opium is very general among the Assamese.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hill Tribes.</hi> —The hill and frontier tribes of Assam are
                    the Nâgas, Singphos, Daphlâs, Miris, Khâmptis, Mataks, Abars, Ac., nearly all of
                    whom, excepting the Nagâs, are found near the frontiers of Lakhimpur district.
                    The principal of these, in point oΓ numbers, are the Nâgas, who inhabit the
                    hills and forests along tho eastern and south-eastern frontier of Assam. They
                    generally live in small scattered communities of about twenty <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> houses each, and are divided into numerous clans or
                    <hi rend="italic">khels,</hi> of which the six most important residing in
                    British territory are the following, viz., the Namsangias, Bardwâriâs,
                    Paindwârias, Laptangs, Kaimais, and Topigamaias. Exclusive of the Nâgâ Hills
                    district of Assam, the population of which is returned at 68,918, the Nâgâs of
                    Lakhimpur count 2865 houses, with an estimated population of 14,383 souls. They
                    cultivate rice, cotton, yams, and Indian corn, and prepare salt from the brine
                    springs in their hills. The different tribes of Nagâs are independent of and
                    unconnected with one another, and are often at war with each other. The Singphos
                    are the most powerful tribe bordering on the Assam valley, and are scattered
                    over tho largest extent of country. Their territory is bordered on the north by
                    the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra; on the south by the Pâtkai range; on the
                    west by an imaginary line drawn south from the town of Sadiyâ to the Pâtkai
                    mountains; on the east by the Langtung mountains. They are a wild, daring tribe;
                    and in the early days of English rule in Assam they gave a good deal of trouble
                    by their frequent raids. They are now, however, looked upon as peaceful and
                    friendly neighbours. They have settled down to agriculture, and now do for
                    themselves what formerly they depended on their Assamese slaves to perform for
                    them. They only cultivate sufficient food for a portion of the year, and during
                    the remaining months they live upon wild yams and other jungle products. The
                    Government has no very definite relations with them; but they are generally
                    obedient, and in a loose way recognise British supremacy. The settlements of the
                    Singphos in or near the fron · tier of Lakhimpur are estimated to number about
                    3435 souls. The other tribes are the Khamtis Abais Miris Mishmis, and
                    Daphlis.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Administration.</hi> —The administrative statistics of the
                    province will be given separately for each of the ten districts mentioned in the
                    foregoing table under their alphabetical headings. Here it will suffice to say,
                    that Assam as a whole is under a Chief Commissioner who is directly responsible
                    to the Governor-General in council. The Assam districts form what is called a
                    non-regulation province— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    t</hi> one to which it has not been found expedient to extend our system of
                    government in its strict legal entirety. Each district, instead of being under a
                    judge and a magistratecollector, with their separate sets of subordinates, is
                    managed by a deputy-commissioner, in whom both the executive and judicial
                    functions are combined. It is essentially an outlying province, yielding very
                    little revenue to Government, and administered as cheaply as practicable. With
                    the exception of Goâlpârâ, the land revenue of Assam is at present under a light
                    temporary settlement, the permanent settlement not having yet been extended to
                    it on account of its sparse population and backward state. The population is
                    essentially agricultural, and no tendency appears on their part to gather into
                    trading centres or to develop city life. Throughout the whole province there are
                    only two towns with a population of upwards of 5000 souls, viz., Gauhäti,
                    population 11,492; and Sibsâgar, 5278. The various Government rules for granting
                    waste lands in feesimple or on long leases at easy rates, have brought a
                    considerable number of English capitalists and speculators into the province. It
                    is on these grants that many of the tea-gardens have been formed. The
                    development of European enterprise has created a sudden and an urgent demand for
                    roads, which the Government has hitherto not found itself in a position to meet.
                    For all the ordinary purposes of the province, and for its heavy and bulky
                    staples, such as timber, rice, food grains, and oil seeds, the Brahmaputra and
                    its tributaries afford ample means of transit. The great trunk road, which the
                    Muhammadans drove through Assam with a view to controlling the turbulent
                    population, has long ago fallen into decay, and at many places is only
                    recognisable as a line of fragmentary embankments. Each district, however, is
                    now developing a system of roads, or at any rate of country tracks, of its own;
                    and Sir George Campbell, the present Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal (1874),
                    initiated a liberal policy towards the Assam communications, with the view
                    rather to the future of the province than to the amount of expenditure which its
                    revenue at present warrants. Now that it is erected into a separate
                    administration, a still more rapid progress may be looked for. With its vast
                    forests, its inexhaustible ricegrounds, its coal, iron, and tea, and the cheap
                    means of transit which its rivers afford, Assam, although at present one of the
                    most backward among Indian provinces, has capabilities of development such as no
                    other part of Bengal possesses. (w. w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h.)</hi></p>
