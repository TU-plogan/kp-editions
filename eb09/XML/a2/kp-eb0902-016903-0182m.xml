                    1, 239; Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Ad Fam.,</hi> v. 12, 13). Apelles had worked
                    before then for Philip, the father of Alexander, and with a career of nearly
                    half a century, was at work after in the time of the first successors to
                    Alexander’s empire. He was born at Colophon, where it appears his father
                    Pytheas, also a painter, resided. His first instractor was a certain Ephorus, of
                    Ephesus, which was then the centre of the Asia Minor school of painting; the
                    rival school being that of Sicyon in Greece proper, whither Apelles next
                    proceeded, apparently to undergo the stricter discipline in drawing for which
                    that school was renowned, and perhaps also, as is said (Plutarch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Arat.,</hi> 13), to win a share of the good fortune and fame of
                    its leaders. He was here in the neighbourhood of Corinth, and it was probably
                    then that he was taken by the beauty of the young Lais, on seeing her drawing
                    water at the fountain of Peirene. Another incident, that of his having seen the
                    notorious Phryne bathing at Eleusis, and from this conceived the design of his
                    picture of Aphrodite Anadyomene, would also fall about this time, for the two
                    reasons that Phryne’s celebrity occurred in the period before Alexander, and
                    that Apelles is not known to have made a second stay in that district of Greece.
                    From Sicyon he went to the Macedonian court, and was there employed until
                    Alexander departed on his expedition into Asia, on which the painter accompanied
                    him as far as Ephesus, where he settled. Of the intimacy between him and his
                    royal patron there are a number of stories, which, however, from the variety in
                    the telling, may be without foundation in fact. According to Pliny (xxxv. 85),
                    Alexander having betrayed ignorance by some remark about painting, was told by
                    Apelles to be silent, lest the boys who were rubbing down colours in the studio
                    might laugh at him. But the version of the same story given by Plutarch <hi
                    rend="italic">(He Adul.,</hi> 15) has, in the place of Alexander, the Megabyzos,
                    or priest of Diana at Ephesus; while in Aelian <hi rend="italic">(Var.
                    Hist.,</hi> ii. 2) the story is told of Zeuxis, not of Apelles. Again, Aelian
                    <hi rend="italic">(Var. Hist.,</hi> ii 3) relates, that while Alexander was
                    inspecting a painting of a horse by Apelles, a horse neighed towards the
                    picture, upon which the painter remarked that the horse knew more of art than
                    the king. But Pliny (xxx. 95) instances the neighing of a horse, only as having
                    decided a competition between Apelles and some other painter. Still, so far as
                    the painter’s readiness of rebuke is concerned, these stories are confirmed by
                    other incidents, as when he told an artist, who boasted of his speed in work,
                    that the wonder was why he could not produce more of such stuff in the same
                    time; or, when having once accepted correction from a shoemaker about a wrongly
                    painted boot in one of his pictures, he declined further criticism from him,
                    with the observation which has since become a proverb, A <hi rend="superscript">
                    τ</hi> e <hi rend="italic">supra</hi><hi rend="italic">crepidam sutor
                    judicaret</hi> (Pliny, xxxv. 84). Of an opposite kind were his relations with
                    Protogenes, the Rhodian painter, whose abilities he readily recognised, and whom
                    he brought into notice by spreading a report that he intended to purchase his
                    friend’s pictures, and sell them as his own. Finding Protogenes not at home on
                    one of his visits, Apelles, instead of leaving his name, drew with a brush an
                    exceedingly fine line on a prepared tablet. Protogenes knowing the hand, and
                    accepting the challenge, drew within the line a still finer one in another
                    colour. But Apelles returning, divided the line a third time, and was confessed
                    the victor. Though Ephesus continued to be his home, Apelles worked also
                    elsewhere, as in Smyrna, Samos, and Rhodes, but principally in Cos, where he
                    received the rights of a burgess, and where probably he died. For an account of
