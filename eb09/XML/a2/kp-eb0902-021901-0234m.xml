                <p><label type="entry">AQUEDUCT</label></p>
                <p>A QUEDUCT, a conduit or channel for the conveyance of water (Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">aquaeductus),</hi> but commonly a structure of masonry erected to
                    conduct water across a valley at a high level, though structures of this kind
                    would be more properly termed aqueduct bridges. This distinction it is necessary
                    to bear in mind, more particularly when dealing with the undertakings of this
                    class carried out by the Greeks and Romans respectively, because, from the fact
                    of the former having apparently seldom if ever constructed aqueduct bridges, it
                    has been usual to institute a very unfavourable comparison between them and the
                    Romans, who, with imperial disdain of obstacles, furnished the cities of their
                    immense empire with a series of constructions of this kind for the supply of
                    water, which still in their ruins excite our astonishment. True to the
                    difference in national genius the Greeks, following the analogy of nature, in
                    which in their own country they saw the water collected in the hills passing for
                    miles along subterranean courses, and issuing in cool fountains at the coast,
                    adapted their system of conduits to the physical formation of a district,
                    cutting tunnels and canals, rather than bridging over valleys, and as a
                    consequence no conspicuous monument of their system now remains. But even if
                    what they did was so little as to justify Strabo (v. p. 235) in charging them
                    with neglect in this matter as compared with the carefulness of the Romans, it
                    is still clear from the records that they accomplished much, and that in this,
                    as in other respects, they were the instructors of the Romans. It is here to be
                    premised that the term aqueduct applies only to the conveyance of such water as
                    was used for drinking or other useful purposes, and not to the draining of
                    marshes, though in both cases the works may often have been of the same kind.
                    The insufficiency of water, supplied by natural springs and cisterns hewn in the
                    rock, which in an early age had satisfied the small communities of Greece, had
                    become a pressing public question by the time of the Tyrants, of whom Polycrates
                    of Samus and Pisistratus of Athens distinguished their rule by extensive works
                    to meet the exigencies of their states. For this purpose the former obtained the
                    services of Eupalinus, an engineer celebrated for the skill with which he had
                    earned out the works for the water supply of Megara, under the direction of the
                    Tyrant Theagenes <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 625 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>) At Samus the difficulty lay in a hill which rose between the town
                    and the water source. Through this hill Eupalinus cut a tunnel 8 feet broad, 8
                    feet high, and 4200 feet long, building within the tunnel a channel 3 feet broad
                    and 11 ells deep. The water, flowing by an accurately reckoned declivity, and
                    all along open to the fresh air, was received at the lower end by a conduit of
                    masonry, and so led into the town, where it supplied fountains, pipes, baths,
                    eloaeae, &lt;fcc., and ultimately passed into the harbour. In Athens, under the
                    rule of Pisistratus <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 560), a similarly extensive,
                    if less difficult, series of works was completed to bring water from the hills
                    Hymettus, Pentelicus, and Parnes. From Hymettus were two conduits passing under
                    the bed of the Uιssus, and most part of the course cut in the rock. Pentelicus,
                    richer in water, supplied another conduit, which can still be traced from the
                    modern village of Chalandri by the air shafts built several feet above the
                    ground, and at a distance apart of 40-50 metres; the diameter of these shafts is
                    4-5 feet, and the number of them still preserved is about sixty. Tributary
                    channels conveyed into the main stream the waters of the district through which
                    it passed. Outside Athens, those two conduits met in a large reservoir, from
                    which the water was distributed by a ramification of underground channels
                    throughout the city. These latter channels vary in form, being partly round,
                    partly square, and generally walled with stone; the chief one, that under the
                    bazaar, is sufficiently high and broad to allow two men to pass in it. Sometimes
                    pipes of baked clay were laid within them. The conduit from Mount Parnes appears
                    to have been reconstructed in later times. Some of these aqueducts continue to
                    supply Athens to this day, and are described as marvels of enterprise and skill
                    (E. Curtius, <hi rend="italic">über</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Wasserbauten der Hellenen,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Archäol.
                    Zeit.</hi> 1847, p. 19). In Sicily, the works by which Empedocles, it is said,
                    brought the water into the town of Selinus, are no longer visible; but it is
                    probable that, like those of Syracuse, they consisted chiefly of tunnels and
                    pipes laid under ground. The system of conduits in Syracuse which Thucydides
                    says (vi. 100) the Athenians partly destroyed on the Sicilian expedition, still
                    supplies the town with an abundance of drinkable water; and at one point, where
                    the tunnel passes under the sea to the island of Ortygia, presents what has long
                    been regarded as a remarkable achievement for early times. An example of what
                    appears to have been the earliest form of aqueduct in Greece has been discovered
                    in the island of Cos (Ross, <hi rend="italic">Inselreise,</hi> iii. p. 131),
                    beside the fountain Burinna on Mount Oromedon. It consists of a bell-shaped
                    chamber, built underground in the hill side, to receive the water of the spring
                    and keep it cool; a shaft rising from the top of the chamber supplied fresh air.
                    From this reservoir the water was led by a subterranean channel, 35 metres long
                    and 2 metres high.</p>
                <p>Of the constructions for the conveyance of water in Italy in early times, there
                    is an example at Tusculum, consisting of an oblong basin, divided into several
                    chambers, which received the water of a spring, and then distributed it by pipes
                    <hi rend="italic">(tubi,</hi><hi rend="italic">fistuloe)</hi> or canals. The
                    basin is built of blocks of stone, which, along the sides, overlap each other,
                    till they meet and form a roof—a principle of building which was afterwards
                    supplanted by vaulting, and which occurs also in the earliest Greek masonry. The
                    pipes were either of lead or baked clay. When the course lay in soil, gullies
                    were cut and conduits of masonry built within them. When rocky ground
                    intervened, tunnels were pierced, and in both cases shafts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(spiramen,</hi><hi rend="italic">lumen)</hi> were made at intervals of about
                    240 feet, to admit light and fresh air. The inside of the walls of these
                    channels received a coating impervious to water, composed of chalk and erushed
                    fragments of tile. Where the course was interrupted by an inequality in the
                    ground, a vertical pipe <hi rend="italic">(venter)</hi> was placed reaching to
                    the surface or above it. The water rushing up this pipe was freshened by contact
                    with the air, and again fell back to the new course which it had to take. Works
                    of this kind, undertaken for the public convenience, were paid for out of the
                    public purse, a tax being levied for the use of the water.</p>
                <p>If, to obtain a proper incline, the water-course had to be carried above ground,
                    the simple plan was to support it on a stone wall, and in this case the conduit
                    itself was also built of blocks of stone, coated with a stucco impervious to
                    water. But since a solid wall across a valley would have cut off the usual
                    traffic, it was found necessary to break up the wall, by means of arches, into a
                    series of pillars, and with this commenced the system of aqueduct bridges, which
                    have proved to be the most striking monuments of the Roman empire. As perhaps
                    the best known instance of this double purpose, of an archway under which
                    traffic might pass, and over which water might be conveyed, there is the Porta
                    Maggiore at Rome (Plate III.) The waters <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n235/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0235-0220"/> conveyed over it in two separate channels, are
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Claudia</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anio</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Novus,</hi> and from the three inscriptions above
                    the arches it appears (1.)—that the Emperor Claudius had constructed the
                    so-called Aqua Claudia Aqueduct from the springs Caeruleus and Curtius, 45 miles
                    from Rome; (2.) that the same emperor had constructed the so-called Anio Novus
                    Aqueduct from the 6 2d milestone from Rome; (3.) that the Emperors Vespasian and
                    Titus had restored these splendid undertakings of Claudius. Both aqueducts had
                    been begun by Caligula, 38 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and were completed
                    ten years after by Claudius. The two springs from which the Aqua Claudia took
                    its rise were in the Sabine hills near the 35th milestone, on the Via
                    Sub-lacensis. It was augmented by part of the Aqua Martia, famous for the
                    goodness of its water, and, owing to bends in the course, reached the length of
                    45 miles, as stated in the inscription, 35 miles of it being under and 10 above
                    ground. The Anio Novus, so called to distinguish it from an older aqueduct, the
                    Anio Vetus, took its rise in the river Anio at the 62d milestone, on the road
                    just named, the water being first collected in a large basin, where it was
                    allowed to purify itself. At the 32d milestone it was augmented by the clearer
                    water of the spring, <hi rend="italic">rivus Herculaneus.</hi> The entire length
                    of 62 miles was partly above and partly below ground. About 6 miles from Rome it
                    approached the Aqua Claudia, and from that point the two waters travelled
                    together to the city in two distinct channels, one above the other, and
                    supported by a chain of arches, which at one place reached the height of 109
                    feet. But in height these arches must yield to those of the aqueduct at Nismes,
                    the ancient Nemausus, erected in the time of Augustus, which rose to 180 feet.
                    *Γhe Pont du Gard, as the aqueduct at Nismes is now called, consists, as will be
                    seen from Plate IV., of three rows of arches striding acrose the valley of the
                    river Gardon. In the lowermost row are six arches, of which one has a span of 75
                    feet, the others each 60 feet. In the second row are twelve arches, each with a
                    span of 75 feet. In the third row are thirty-six smaller arches, immediately
                    above which was the water-course. As a bridge, the Pont du Gard has no rival for
                    lightness and boldness of design among the existing remains of works of this
                    class carried out in Roman times.</p>
                <p>Besides the two principal aqueducts at Rome already described, there remain to be
                    noticed twelve more which assisted in the supply of water for the city. These
                    are (1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Appia,</hi> which
                    took its rise at the foot of the Alban mountains on the Praeneste road, between
                    the 7th and 8th milestones, and measured from its source to the Porta Trigemina
                    11,180 paces, of which 11,130 were below ground. It appears to have been the
                    first important enterprise of the kind at Rome, and was the work of the old
                    Censor Appius Claudius, from whom ‘it derived its name. The date of its
                    construction was the year of Rome 442, according to Frontinus, an overseer of
                    aqueducts <hi rend="italic">(curator aquarum)</hi> under the empire, whose work
                    <hi rend="italic">De Aquoeduct.</hi><hi rend="italic">urb.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rornae</hi> we still possess. (2.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Anio Vetus,</hi>
                    constructed forty years after the last-mentioned aqueduct, by the Censor Manlius
                    Curius Dentatus, with the help of L. Papirius Censor, who finishedit. From its
                    source near Tivoli, on the left side of the Anio, it flowed 43,000 paces, of
                    which 42,779 were below ground, and 221 above. At the distance of 2 miles from
                    Rome (Frontinus, i. 21) it parted into two courses, one of which led to the <hi
                    rend="italic">horti</hi><hi rend="italic">asiniani,</hi> and was thence
                    distributed; while the other <hi rend="italic">(rectus ductus)</hi> led by the
                    temple of Spes to the Esquiline gate, the site of which was near the modern
                    Villa Negroni, where, in 1861, was found a subterranean conduit and an inscribed
                    stone, which left no doubt as to its having been one of the stones set up to
                    mark the distances of the Anio Vetus. (3.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Martia,</hi> rising on the left side of the Via Valeria,
                    traversed 61,710 paces, of which 54,247 were underground, and the remaining
                    distance carried partly on solid wall and partly on arches. It was the work of
                    Quintus Martius Rex, not of Ancus Martius the fourth king of Rome, as Pliny <hi
                    rend="italic">(N.H.,</hi> xxxi. 3) fancied, and took its name from its
                    constructor. Its waters were celebrated for their coolness and excellent
                    quality. (4.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Tepula,</hi> from its source in the
                    district of Tusculum, flowed 10,000 paces, mostly above ground, and on the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> same series of arches as carried the Aqua Martia, but
                    at a higher level. It was the work of the Censors Cn. Servilius Caepio and L.
                    Crassus Longinus, and was completed in the year 126 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Again, partly on the same structure of arches, and with a still
                    higher channel, flowed—(5.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Julia,</hi> from a source
                    near that of the last-mentioned aqueduct to within 7000 paces of the walls of
                    Rome, where the joint waters were received in a reservoir, and thence
                    distributed in various channels to the city. Its entire length was 15,426 paces.
                    It was constructed in the year 34 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by Marcus
                    Agrippa, to whose zeal to meet public wants in this direction were due the two
                    other aqueducts— (6.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Virgo,</hi> and (7.) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Aqua</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Crabra</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Damnata,</hi> the former as well known for the goodness of its
                    water as was the latter for the inferiority which procured it the designation of
                    Damnata. The Aqua Virgo, from its origin at a copious spring in a marsh on the
                    Collatine way, not far from the ancient Gabii, measured 14,105 paces, along
                    which it was conveyed in pipes, partly under and partly above ground, on a solid
                    substructure or on arches. It was completed in the year 48 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> (8.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Alsie-tina</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Augusta</hi> rose in Etruria, on the Via Claudia, and travelled
                    22,172 paces, of which 358 were on arches. It was the work of Augustus, whose
                    object was to furnish by it water for gardens and other than drinking purposes.
                    (9.) <hi rend="smallcaps">AquaTrajana,</hi> rising in Lake Sabatinus
                    (Bracciano), was constructed by Trajan. (10.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alexandrina,</hi> rising in the district of Tusculum, was the
                    work of Alexander Severus. (11.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Aqua Septimi ana</hi>
                    seems to have been only a branch led from the Aqua Julia to supply the baths of
                    the emperor from whom it takes its name, Septimius Severus. (12.) <hi

                    was made is unknown. Of the fourteen aqueducts which supplied ancient Rome,
                    three remain in use at the present time, furnishing the modern city with
                    abundance of water. The first of the three is the Aqua Virgo, now known as
                    Fontana di Trevi, supplying the best water in Rome. It was restored by Pope Pius
                    IV. The next is the Aqua Claudia, known as the Aqua Felice or di Termini, which
                    was restored by Sixtus V. The third is the Aqua Trajana, called, from the Pope
                    who restored it, viz., Paul V., Aqua Paole.</p>
                <p>At regular intervals along the course of an aqueduct were built reservoirs <hi
                    rend="italic">(castella),</hi> to enable repairs to be made at any point, and
                    also to let off water for the population of the district through which it
                    passed. It was the law that material necessary for repairs should be supplied
                    from the private property nearest to where the damage was, and should be
                    conveyed at the cost of the owner of such property. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Castella</hi> of smaller dimension were also required in many parts of the
                    city. Of these, it was said, there were 247 in Rome. To allow the water to
                    purify itself before being distributed in the city, large basins <hi
                    rend="italic">(piscinae</hi><hi rend="italic">limariae),</hi> were built outside
                    the walls. For the process of purification salt was used (Vitruvius, viii.)
                    These piscinae were covered in with a vaulted roof, and were usually on a
                    colossal scale, as in the example still preserved at Fermo, which consists of
                    two stories, each having three oblong basins communicating with each other; or
                    the Piscina Mirabile at Baiae, which is covered in by a vaulted <pb break="no"

                    perforated to permit the escape of foul air. Two stairs lead by forty steps to
                    the bottom of the reservoir. In the middle of the basin is a sinking to collect
                    the deposit of the water. The walls and pillars are coated with a stucco so hard
                    as to .resist a tool. The oversight of aqueducts was placed, in the times of the
                    republic, under the aediles and censors, though the latter appear to have taken
                    part in work of this kind rather from their financial interest in the matter.
                    Under the empire this task devolved on special officials styled <hi

                <p>Among aqueducts outside of Italy, constructed in Roman times and existing still,
                    the most remarkable, next to the Pont du Gard at Nismes already described,
                    are—(1.) The aqueduct bridges at Segovia and Tarragona in Spain, the former
                    being 2400 feet long, with 159 arches of greatly admired masonry, in two tiers,
                    and reaching the height of 102 feet. The bridge at Tarragona is 876 feet long,
                    and 83 feet high. (2.) At Mayence are the ruins of an aqueduct 16,000 feet long,
                    and carried on from 500 to 600 pillars. Similar witnesses of Roman occupation
                    are to be seen in Dacia, Africa, and Greece. (3.) The aqueduct at Metz (figured
                    on Plate IV.), which originally extended across the Moselle, here very broad,
                    conveyed to the city an abundance of excellent water from Gorsa. From a large
                    reservoir at the source of the aqueduct the water passed along subterranean
                    channels built of hewn stone, and sufficiently spacious for a man to walk in
                    them upright. Similar channels received the water after it had crossed the
                    Moselle by this bridge, at the distance of about 6 miles from Metz, and conveyed
                    it to the city. The bridge consisted of only one row of arches. The middle
                    arches have given way under the force of the river, but the others are still
                    perfectly solid. (4.) On Plate III. is figured one of the principal bridges of
                    the aqueduct of Antioch, 700 feet long, and at the deepest point 200 feet high.
                    The lower part consists almost entirely of solid wall, and the upper part of a
                    series of arches with very massive pillars. The masonry and design are rude. The
                    water supply was drawn from several springs at a place called Battelma, about 4
                    or 5 miles from Antioch. From these separate springs the water was conducted by
                    channels of hewn stone into a main channel, similarly constructed, which
                    traversed the rest of the distance, being carried across streams and valleys by
                    means of arches or bridges. (5.) At the village of Morea, about an hour’s
                    distance N.W. from the town of Mytilene, is the bridge of an aqueduct, figured
                    on Plate III. The water-course is carried above massive pillars built of large
                    hewn blocks of grey marble, and connected by means of three rows of arches, of
                    which the uppermost is of brick. The bridge extended about 500 feet in length,
                    and at the deepest was from 70 to 80 feet high. Judged by the masonry and the
                    graceful design, it has been thought to be a work of the age of Augustus.
                    Remains of this aqueduct are to be seen at Larisson Lamarousia, an hour’s
                    distance from Morea, and at St Demetri, two hours and a half from Ayasso, on the
                    road to Vasilika.</p>
                <p>The aqueduct near Spoleto, which now serves also as a bridge, is deserving of
                    notice as an early instance of the use of the pointed arch, belonging as it does
                    to the 7th or 8th century. It has ten arches, remarkable for the elegance of
                    their design and the airy lightness of their proportions, each over 66 feet in
                    span, and about 300 feet in height. (See Plate IV.)</p>
                <p>The aqueduct of Pyrgos, near Constantinople (figured on Plate III.), is a
                    remarkable example of works of this class carried out in the later times of the
                    Roman empire. It consists of two branches, of which only one is seen in
                    elevation on the plate. The other branch stood nearly ^,t right angles to this,
                    and is seen partly on the plan. From this circumstance it was called the Bended
                    or Crooked Aqueduct, to distinguish it from another termed the Long Aqueduct,
                    situated near the source of the waters. The branch seen in elevation extends 670
                    feet in length, and is 106 feet in height at the deepest part. It is composed of
                    three rows of arches, those in each row increasing in width from the bottom to
                    the top—an arrangement very properly introduced with the view of saving
                    materials without diminishing the strength of the work. The two upper rows
                    consisted of arches of semicircles, the lower of Gothic arches; and this
                    circumstance serves to fix the date of the structure, as these last were not
                    introduced until the 10th century. The breadth of the building at the base was
                    21 feet, and it diminished with a regular batter on each side to the top, where
                    it was only 11 feet. The base also was protected by strong buttresses or
                    counterforts, erected against each of the pülars. The other branch of the
                    aqueduct was 300 feet long, and consisted of twelve semicircular arches.</p>
                <p>This aqueduct serves to convey to Constantinople the waters of the valley of
                    Belgrade, one of the principal sources from which the city is supplied. These
                    are situated on the heights of Mount Haemus, the extremity of the Balkan
                    Mountains, which overhangs the Black Sea. The water rises about 15 miles from
                    the city, and between 3 and 4 miles west of the village of Belgrade, in three
                    sources, which run in three deep and very confined valleys. These unite a little
                    below the village, and then are collected into a large reservoir. After flowing
                    a mile or two from this reservoir, the waters are augmented by two other
                    streams, and conveyed by a channel of stone to the Crooked Aqueduct. From this
                    they are conveyed to another which is the Long Aqueduct; and then, with various
                    accessions, into a third, termed the Aqueduct of Justinian. From this they enter
                    a vaulted conduit, which skirts the hills on the left side, of the valley, and
                    crosses a broad valley 2 miles below the Aqueduct of Justinian, by means of an
                    aqueduct, with a double row of arcades of a very beautiful construction. The
                    conduit then proceeds onward in a circuitous route, till it reaches the
                    reservoir of Egri Kapan, situated just without and on the walls of the city.
                    From this the water is conducted to the various quarters of the city, and also
                    to the reservoir of St Sophia, which supplies the seraglio of the grand signior.
                    The Long Aqueduct is more imposing by its extent than the Crooked one, but is
                    far inferior in the regularity of design and disposition of the materials. It is
                    evidently a work of the Turks. It consists of two rows of arcades, the lower
                    being forty-eight in number, and the upper fifty. The whole length was about
                    2200 feet, and the height 80 feet. The Aqueduct of Justinian is a very excellent
                    work, and without doubt one of the finest monuments which remain to us of the
                    Middle Ages. It consists of two rows of large arcades in the pointed style, with
                    four arches in each. Those of the lower story have 52 feet of span, the upper
                    ones 40 feet. The piers are supported by strong buttresses, and at different
                    heights they have little arches passing through them, which relieve the deadness
                    of the solid pillar. The length of this aqueduct is 720 feet, and the height 109
                    feet. This aqueduct, though it bears the name of Justinian, was probably erected
                    in the time of Constantine.</p>
                <p>Besides the waters of Belgrade, Constantinople was supplied from several other
                    principal sources, one of which took its rise on the heights of the same
                    mountains, 3 or 4 miles east of Belgrade. This was conveyed in a similar manner
                    by an arched channel, elevated, when it was necessary, on aqueduct bridges, till
                    it reached the northern parts of the city. It was in the course of this aqueduct
                    that the contrivance of the <hi rend="italic">souterasi</hi> or hydraulic
                    obelisks, described by Andreossy (in his voyage to the Black Sea and account of
                    the Thracian Bosphorus) was <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0239-0222"/> constructed, which excited some attention, as
                    being an improvement on the method of conducting water by aqueduct bridges. “The
                    souterasi,” says Andreossy, “are masses of masonry, having generally the form of
                    a truncated pyramid or an Egyptian obelisk. To form a conduit with souterasi, we
                    choose sources of water, the level of which is several feet higher than the
                    reservoir by which it is to be distributed over the city. We bring the water
                    from its sources in subterranean canals, slightly declining until we come to the
                    borders of a valley or broken ground. We there raise on each side a souterasi,
                    to which we adapt vertically leaden pipes of determinate diameters, placed
                    parallel to the two opposite sides of the building. These pipes are disjoined at
                    the upper part of the obelisk, which forms a sort of basin, with which the pipes
                    are connected. The one permits the water to rise to the level from whence it had
                    descended; by the other, the water descends from this level to the foot of the
                    souterasi, where it enters another canal under ground, which conducts it to a
                    second and to a third souterasi, where it rises and again descends, as at the
                    last station. Here a reservoir receives it and distributes it in different
                    directions by orifices of which the discharge is known.” Again he says, “it
                    requires but little attention to perceive that this system of conducting tubes
                    is nothing but a series of syphons open at their upper part, and communicating
                    with each other. The expense of a conduit by souterasi is estimated at only
                    one-fifth of that of an aqueduct with arcades.” There seems to be really no
                    advantage in these pyramids, further than as they serve the purpose of
                    discharging the air which collects in the pipes. They are in themselves an
                    evident obstruction, and the water would flow more freely without any
                    interruption of the kind. In regard to the leaden pipes, again, they would have
                    required, with so little head pressure as is stated, to be used of very
                    extraordinary dimensions to pass the same quantity of water as was discharged
                    along the arched conduits. There is something, therefore, which would require
                    explanation in the account Andreossy gives of these pyramids, if, indeed, he did
                    not misunderstand the nature of them.</p>
                <p>The other principal source from which Constantinople is supplied, is from the
                    high grounds 6 or 8 miles west of the town, from which it is conducted by
                    conduits and arches, in the same manner as the others. The supply drawn from all
                    these sources, as detailed by Andreossy, amounted to 400,000 cubic feet per day.
                    The charge of the water-works at Constantinople belongs to a body of 300 Turks
                    and 100 Albanese Greeks, who form almost an hereditary profession.</p>
                <p>In ancient Egypt and Babylonia a different problem of water supply was presented,
                    both countries being flat and traversed by great rivers, from which they were
                    subject to regular inundations. Hence canals with large basins took the place of
                    the aqueducts of Greece and Rome, and the stupendous scale on which in Egypt the
                    waters of the Nile, and in Babylonia the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates,
                    were utilised, was a marvel to ancient travellers.</p>
                <p>In France various aqueducts have been formed after the manner of the Romans. The
                    most remarkable are those constructed in the reign of Louis XIV., at vast
                    expense, for conducting water from Marly to Versailles. The famous aqueduct
                    bridge of Maintenon, which was erected for conveying the waters of the river
                    Eure to Versailles, is without doubt, in point of magnitude and height, the most
                    magnificent structure of the kind in the world. In Plate IV. a view is given of
                    a portion of this work, on the same scale as the others there represented. Had
                    the whole been delineated on the same scale, it would have extended to four
                    times the breadth of the plate. It extends about 4400 feet in length, that is,
                    about five-sixths of a mile, is upwards of 200 feet in height, and contains 242
                    arcades, each divided into three rows, forming in all 726 arches about 50 feet
                    span. Of the subterranean aqueducts in France the finest is that of Arcueil,
                    which serves to conduct water to that village. It is 44,300 feet in length, or
                    upwards of 8 nailes, extending from the valley of Arcueil to the castle at the
                    gate of St Jaques, all built of hewn stone. It is about 6 feet in height, and
                    has on each side a foot-path 18 inches wide; it has a declivity of 1 foot in
                    1300. Another aqueduct of this kind is that of Rocquancourt, part of the system
                    which brings water to Versailles; it is 11,760 feet in length, or upwards of 2
                    miles, and has a declivity in its whole course of only 3 feet. In some parts of
                    its course it was necessary to make excavations 80 or 90 feet deep, which
                    rendered the execution very difficult.</p>
                <p>The great waterworks that supply the city of Marseilles with the water of the
                    Durance, by a canal about 60 miles in length, are among the boldest undertakings
                    of the kind in modern times. This canal, begun in 1839, and completed in 1847,
                    is conveyed through three chains of limestone mountains by forty-five tunnels,
                    forming an aggregate length of 8∣ miles, and across numerous valleys by
                    aqueducts; the largest of which, the Aqueduct of Roquefavour, over the ravine of
                    the River Arc, about 5 miles from Aix, surpasses in size and altitude the
                    ancient Pont du Gard. The immense volume of water, which passes at the rate of
                    198,000 gallons per minute, is carried across as in the old Roman aqueducts by a
                    channel of masonwork. The height of this aqueduct is 262 feet, and its length
                    1287.</p>
                <p>One other aqueduct of modern construction is worthy of notice. In those parts of
                    British India where the fall of rain is scanty and uncertain, recourse is had to
                    artificial irrigation, and the waters of many of the rivers of the country have
                    been rendered available for this purpose by means of public works constructed by
                    the Government. Of these the most important is the Ganges Canal, which traverses
                    the North-Western Provinces of Bengal, and distributes over their vast area
                    nearly the whole volume of the waters of the Ganges. The canal begins at the
                    point where the river issues from the mountains, and enters the plains of
                    Bengal. About 20 miles from its source, the line of the canal crosses the valley
                    of the Solani river, and the works for effecting the transit are designed on a
                    scale worthy of the undertaking. The valley is between 2 and 3 miles in width.
                    An earthen embankment is carried across, raised on an average between 16 and 17
                    feet above the surrounding country, and having a width of 350 feet at its base,
                    and 290 feet in the upper part. This embankment forms the bed of the canal,
                    which is protected by banks 12 feet in depth, and 30 feet wide at the top. To
                    preserve these banks from the effects of the action of the water, lines of
                    masonry formed into steps extend on each side throughout their entire length.
                    The Solani river is crossed by an aqueduct 920 feet long, having side walls 8
                    feet thick and 12 deep, the depth of the water being 10 feet. The water of the
                    canal passes through two separate channels. That of the River Solani flows under
                    fifteen arches, having a span of 50 feet each, constructed in the most
                    substantial manner, and springing from piers resting on blocks of masonry sunk
                    into the bed of the river. The cost of the aqueduct was upwards of &lt;£160,000.
                    In grandeur of design, solidity of construction, and, above all, in extensive
                    utility, it may challenge competition with any similar work in the world.</p>
                <p>Within the last century, the invention and improvement of the manufacture of cast
                    iron has completely changed the mode of conducting water into cities, by the
                    introduction of cast-iron pipes instead of the stone conduits of former times.
                    These pipes can now be formed of almost any <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n240/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0240-0223"/> dimensions, and united together into a continued
                    series so closely as to prevent the escape of the water even under a violent
                    pressure, arising from the altitude of the fountainhead. They enable us,
                    therefore, to take advantage of and give effect to the fundamental principle of
                    hydrostatics, that the fluid tends continually to a level, even though it be
                    confined in the smallest or most complicated system of pipes <hi rend="italic">;
                    so</hi> that however low it be carried in any valley, or to whatever distance,
                    still it will rise on the opposite side to the original altitude of the
                    fountainhead—a principle which is most important indeed in such works, seeing
                    that by it we are not restricted, as the Romans were, almost to a perfect level
                    in the line of the conduit. We have seen that, for the purpose of attaining this
                    level or very gentle declivity all along the conduit, they were under the
                    necessity of raising it by arcades continued in one unbroken series, frequently
                    30 or 40 miles in extent; and, in addition to this, they had often to prolong
                    the length of the track by a circuitous route, turning and winding for miles out
                    of its course, for the very purpose of increasing its length.</p>
                <p>But the use of pipes enables us to dispense with these long arcades all raised
                    nearly to the same level with the fountainhead; because the conduit may be
                    varied in its level to any extent, and still will rise at last to its original
                    altitude. The pipes, therefore, are merely laid all along the surface of the
                    ground, with a cover of 2 or 3 feet of soil to place them beyond the reach of
                    frost. To prevent, however, the frequent or abrupt alternations of rise, and
                    fall, any sudden inequalities in the ground are equalised by cuttings and
                    embankments, but not to anything like the extent that would be required to raise
                    the whole to a level. This,’therefore, forms a very great improvement in the
                    method of conducting water, the greatest indeed which has ever been made in this
                    important branch of practical mechanics. That it was not introduced by the
                    Romans, is not to be ascribed, as many have supposed, to their ignorance of the
                    hydrostatic principle that the fluid would rise to a level in the opposite
                    branches of the same train of pipes. They were well acquainted with this
                    principle, and a portion of a leaden pipe, supposed to have been used in the
                    baths of Caracalla, has been found, which sets this matter at rest; but, from
                    the low state of the arts at that period, they were unable to give effect to the
                    principle. They had not the means of fabricating pipes of such a magnitude as
                    would have been required for the enormous quantities of water consumed in Rome,
                    and at the same time, of strength sufficient to withstand the pressure from the
                    fountainhead. Lead was the only material that could be used by them for the
                    purpose; and besides the enormous thickness that so weak a material would have
                    required, and the impracticability of their forming pipes, and uniting them
                    together endwise, they were too well acquainted with the tendency of lead to
                    render the water unwholesome by its poisonous impregnation. The use of cast iron
                    was quite unknown. There remained, therefore, no resource but in the aqueducts,
                    which, though attended no doubt with vast expense, and requiring great
                    enterprise, skill, and patience, were yet attainable by these means, and formed
                    when completed a simple and very perfect mode of effecting the object. Now,
                    however, when the manufacture of cast iron has been brought to such perfection,
                    and methods contrived for uniting perfectly together all the pipes into one
                    connected train, this improved system has been universally adopted.</p>
                <p>In former editions of this work (under this heading) the works of the Edinburgh
                    Water Company, undertaken in 1819, and designed by Mr Jardine, civil engineer,
                    were described; but as there is little which can properly come under the popular
                    definition of Aqueduct, they will be more consistently referred to in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Waterworks.</hi><hi rend="italic">Croton Aqueduct,
                    New York.</hi></p>
                <p>The Croton Aqueduct, by which the city of New York is supplied with water, was
                    justly regarded at the time of its execution, from 1837 to 1842, as one of the
                    most magnificent works of the kind in modern times (figs. 1 to 5)</p>
                <p>Its length from the Croton Lake to the receiving reservoir is 38∣ miles. The
                    original reservoir, called Croton Lake, is formed by an embankment across the
                    Croton Creek, a small stream of wholesome water falling into the Hudson. It
                    covered 400 acres, and contained about 500,000,000 gallons of water. To the
                    valley of the Harlem River, a distance of 33 miles, the aqueduct (fig. 2,) is
                    built of stone, brick, and cement, arched over and under, 6 feet 3 inches wide
                    at the bottom, 7 feet 8 inches at the top, and 8 feet 5 inches high, and capable
                    of discharging 60,000,000 gallons per day. It is carried over the Harlem</p>
                <p>Valley in iron pipes, laid upon a magnificent bridge (figs. 3 and 4) 1460 feet
                    long, constructed of arches 114 feet above high-water mark at Yorkville. These
                    pipes passed into a receiving reservoir capable of holding 150,000,000 gallons,
                    and from thence the water was conducted for 2∣ miles to a distributing
                    reservoir, containing 20,000,000 gallons, by a double line of iron pipes, 3 feet
                    in diameter. From this reservoir the water was distributed to the city.</p>
                <p>The Croton water was originally introduced into New York in 1842, whop the
                    population was about 450 000 persons, and from that time to 1848, 18,000,000
                    gallons per day gave an abundant supply. In 1872, with a population of 1,000,000
                    persons, the quantity required was 88,000,000 gallons per day. Thus, between
                    1848 and 1872, while the population little more than doubled, the consumption of
                    water increased nearly five times. This fact, coupled with severe droughts in
                    1870 and 1871, when the natural volume of the Croton River fell to 27,000,000

                    the necessity of largely extended works. It was estimated that the basin above

                    were not only increased as described, but the means of distribution were largely
                    extended, and in one part of the city six lines of pipes 4 feet in diameter were

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manchester Waterworks.</hi></p>
                <p>The works by which the city of Manchester and its suburbs are now supplied with
                    water, and which have been in course of construction from the year 1848 to the
                    present time (1874), are perhaps, in some respects, the most stupendous works of
                    the kind which have ever been constructed, in which difficulties of no ordinary
                    character have been successfully overcome. These remarks, however, relate
                    especially to the impounding reservoirs, which are seven in number, with
                    embankments varying from 70 to 100 feet above the level of the valley in which
                    they are constructed, and cannot, therefore, be properly alluded to here. As the
                    conveyance of the water to the city is, however, by aqueduct, a few words
                    explanatory of the general scheme will be necessary.</p>
                <p>The water is collected from the river Etherow and its tributaries, which, rising
                    on the westerly slope of the Pennine chain of hills, flow into the river Mersey,
                    and so into the Irish Sea. The drainage ground from which the water is collected
                    lies nearly midway between Manchester and Sheffield. Its area is about 19,300
                    acres. It rises in parts to an elevation of about 1800 feet above the level of
                    the sea, and about 1200 or 1300 feet above the deep and romantic valley of
                    Longdendale, in which the main collecting reservoirs are situated. The district
                    consists of the shales and sandstones which constitute the lower portion of the
                    Coal Measure formation—the upper millstone grit forming the cap of the steep
                    escarpments on each side of the valley, while the lower millstone grit, which
                    may be said to separate the Coal Measure shale from the limestone shale, is
                    found in the bottom. The waters produced by this geological formation are among
                    the purest in the world. The spring water is especially brilliant, highly
                    aerated, containing little or no foreign matter, and extremely soft. It is at
                    all times very abundant, the district yielding much more spring water than the
                    usual quantity, in proportion to the area from which the springs issue. The
                    quantity of water flowing from the drainage ground would, if wholly stored,
                    afford a gross supply of about 40,000,000 gallons per day, of which about
                    13,000,000 gallons per day have to be delivered as compensation to the mills on
                    the stream, leaving about 27,000,000 gallons per day as the supply available for
                    the city and its suburbs.</p>
                <p>The water of heavy rains and wet seasons is collected in large impounding
                    reservoirs, the gross capacity of which is 4,233,000,000 gallons. In some of
                    these reservoirs thθ turbid and coloured water is impounded, where it is allowed
                    to settle and purify, and is subsequently given as compensation to the stream;
                    and in others, the pure water, when more than sufficient for the wants of the
                    city, is collected. Here it is stored till required, and then given in addition
                    to the spring water, when that is in itself deficient in quantity. The spring
                    water is separately collected, and conveyed to the city by aqueducts specially
                    constructed for the purpose. In heavy rains, which swell the streams, and
                    especially in autumn, the water is discoloured, but by a simple and ingenious
                    contrivance, every stream is made to separate its coloured water from its pure
                    water—the coloured water being passed to reservoirs set apart for the storage of
                    such water, and the pure water being sent at once to Manchester, or passed to
                    reservoirs in which it is stored for future use.</p>
                <p>The aqueducts by which this water is conveyed from the springs and from the
                    reservoirs, consist for the most part of tunnel and covered conduit, 6 feet in
                    diameter, with a fall of 5 feet in a mile, with cast-iron syphon pipes of large
                    dimensions across one valley, which has to be passed before the highest service
                    reservoir is reached. From this reservoir to the city, about 8 miles distant,
                    cast-iron pipes are laid along or under the public roads, to convey the water to
                    various other reservoirs at lower elevations, from which the city and its
                    suburbs are conveniently supplied. .</p>
                <p>In the main valleys in which the spring water is collected, or the flood and
                    turbid waters conveyed by separate channels, the aqueducts are chiefly open, and
                    are, to a great extent, formed of concrete 6 inches thick on the sides and
                    bottom, faced with dry stone pitching 9 inches in thickness. They are cheap,
                    easily constructed, and perfectly successful.</p>
                <p>The area and capacities of all the reservoirs are as follows :—</p>

                <p>The appropriation of the beautiful waters of Loch Katrine—rendered classical by
                    Sir Walter Scott—the romantic, ragged, and almost impassable Highland country
                    through which the aqueduct had to be constructed, and the distance from Loch
                    Katrine to Glasgow, all contributed to lend a special interest to the
                    undertaking. It is, however, a very simple work in itself, for, with but little
                    artificial addition, Loch Katrine, Loch Venachar, and Loch Drunkie were
                    converted into impounding reservoirs, the first for the supply of the city, and
                    the two latter for compensation.</p>

                <p>ttι‰w</p>
                <p>The length of the aqueduct from Loch Katrine to Glasgow is about 35 miles, of
                    which 27 may be considered as the aqueduct proper. The remaining 8 consist of
                    two lines of cast-iron pipes, by which the water is conveyed from the large
                    service reservoir at Mugdock to the city of Glasgow. The aqueduct is principally
                    in tunnel or covered conduit, but there are three valleys which are crossed by
                    iron syphon pipes of large diameter, and there are numerous aqueduct bridges of
                    varied character, suited to the peculiarities of the districts in which they had
                    to be constructed. The tunnels and covered conduits are 8 feet high and 8 feet
                    wide, with an inclination of 10 inches in a mile, and are capable of conveying
                    about 50,000,000 gallons of water in twenty-four hours. The syphon pipes across
                    the valleys have an inclination of 1 in 1000, or about 5 feet in a mile, and it
                    requires two pipes of 4 feet in diameter and one of 3 feet in diameter, to
                    convey the quantity of water in a day which the aqueduct will deliver.</p>
                <p>The work required the greatest engineering accuracy and skill, and so perfectly
                    have the lines and levels been kept, that it was only upon the closest
                    examination that the joinings in the tunnels could be detected.</p>
                <p>The work was commenced in the spring of 1855, opened by her Majesty the Queen in
                    October 1859, and finally completed in the course of 1860.</p>
                <p>The cost of the engineering works of the aqueduct, including the conversion of
                    the various lochs mentioned into reservoirs, and exclusive of land, and of the
                    distribution of the water in the city of Glasgow and its neighbourhood, was
                    &lt;£668,000; but the gross cost of the water supply, including the purchase of
                    two water companies, distribution, and everything, has been, to May 1873,
                    £1,756,793.</p>
                <p>The following description of the aqueduct was given by the engineer at a banquet
                    given to him in Glasgow after the completion of the works :—</p>
                <p>“It is impossible to convey to those who have not personally inspected it, an
                    impression of the intricacy of the wild and beautiful district through which the
                    aqueduct passes for the first 10 or 11 mües after leaving Loch Katrine. From the
                    narrowest point at which it was found the ridge between Loch Katrine and Loch
                    Chon could be pierced, the country consists of successive ridges of the most
                    obdurate rock, separated by deep wild valleys, in which it was very difficult in
                    the first instance to find a way. There were no roads, no houses, no building
                    materials,—nothing which would ordinarily be considered essential to the
                    successful completion of a great engineering work for the conveyance of water;
                    but it was a consideration of the geological character of the material, which
                    gavo all the romantic wildness to the district, that at onco determined me to
                    adopt that particular mode of construction which has been so successfully
                    carried out. For the first 10 miles, the rock consists of mica schist and clay
                    slate—close, retentive material, into which no water percolates, and in which,
                    consequently, few springs are to be found. This rock, when quarried, was unfit
                    for building purposes; there was no stone of a suitable description to be had at
                    any reasonable cost or distance, no lime for mortar, no clay for puddle, and no
                    roads to convey material. Ordinary surface construction, therefore, was out of
                    the question; but I saw that if tunnelling were boldly resorted to, there would
                    be no difficulty, beyond the cost and time required in blasting the rocks, in
                    making a perfectly watertight and all-enduring aqueduct; there would be no water
                    to hamper and delay us in the shafts and tunnels, and’ little would require
                    transporting through the country bur gunpowder and drill iron. This course was
                    therefore determined upon, and my expectations have been realised to the very
                    letter. The aqueduct may be considered as one continuous tunnel. As long as the
                    work continued in the primary geological measures, we had no water; and even
                    after it entered the Old Red Sandstone, and where it subsequently passed through
                    trap rock, there was much less than I expected; so that our progress, at no part
                    of the work, was ever materially interfered with by those incidents which
                    usually render mining operations costly and uncertain.”</p>
                <p>The rock, however, especially the mica slate, proved extremely hard and difficult
                    to work. At several points along the side of Loch Chon the progress did not
                    exceed 3 or 4 lineal yards in a month at each face, although the work was
                    carried on day and night. The average progress through the mica slate was about
                    5 yards in a month. In drilling the holes for blasting, a fresh drill was
                    required for every inch in depth on the average, and about sixty drills were
                    constantly in use at each face. The cost of the gunpowder alone, consumed in the
                    first 7} miles of the aqueduct, was £10,540, and there were about 175 miles of
                    fuse burned in firing it. The average cost per yard of this length of the
                    aqueduct was over £13, or £23,000 per mile. (Figs. 6 to 11, are cross sections
                    of the aqueduct, showing the general construction in various kinds of ground.)
                    The built and tunnelled part is all capable of passing 50,000,000 gallons per
                    day.</p>
                <p>The aqueduct bridges over the ravines are somewhat peculiar, varying in character
                    according to the circumstances of the district. In the wilder and more
                    inaccessible parts there are five extensive iron ones, varying in length from
                    124 to 332 yards, all of similar construction. (See fig. 12.) At the ends of
                    these bridges, in the shallowest parts of the ravines, the aqueduct has a
                    cast-iron trough supported on a solid dry stone embankment of the stone of the
                    district, carefully set by hand; the stone embankment being 9 feet wide at top,
                    with a batter of 3 inches to the foot on each side. The deeper parts of the
                    ravines or valleys are crossed by malleable iron tubes 8 feet wide by 6⅜ feet
                    high inside, supported by piers at intervals of 50 feet. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n243/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0243-0226"/> bottoms and sides of these tubes are f inch
                    thick, and the tops √⅛ inch thick, strengthened by angle and T iron. Fig. 13
                    shows a section of these tubes. The cast-iron made for adding 2∣ feet to the
                    height of the sides when additional water was required, and this has since been
                    done. The bottoms of the malleable-iron tubes are 3 feet below the bottoms of
                    the troughs, so that they should always be full of water, for the purpose of
                    securing the same temperature both in the bottom and top of the tubes, and so
                    pre venting unequal expansion and contraction. The aqueduct at the crossing of
                    small mountain streams (of which there were many) was carried in cast-iron
                    troughs similar to those already described, supported upon cast-iron beams over
                    the space left for the stream.</p>
                <p>The first deep valley which required to be crossed, by piping is that of the
                    Duchray water, about <hi rend="italic">55</hi> chains wide. The pipes first laid
                    down were 4 feet diameter in 9 feet lengths, with spigot and faucet joints, run
                    up with lead in the usual way. At the lowest point the pipes are under a
                    pressure of 165 feet. The river itself is crossed by cast-iron arched girders of
                    60 feet span; and here, as well as at the small basins at each end of the
                    piping, and at all other places where masonry was required, provision was made
                    for laying two additional lines of pipes, one 4 feet and the other 3 feet in
                    diameter. These pipes have since been laid. After passing through the ridge of
                    Old Red Sandstone conglomerate by the Clashmore tunnel, the aqueduct for 5 miles
                    is for the greater part in open cutting, with masonry sides, and a dry rubble
                    arch covered with 2 feet of puddle, and then covered in.</p>
                <p>The Endrick valley, like that of the Duchray, is crossed by cast-iron syphon
                    pipes for 2⅛ miles in length. Where they cross the river Endrick at the bottom
                    of the valley, the pipes are 1∣∙ inches thick, and have to sustain a pressure of
                    235 feet. The pipes are carried across small depressions in the valley by
                    resting them upon stone piers, and at the crossing of two roads, and of the
                    Forth and Clyde railway, they are further supported by cast-iron troughs (fig.
                    14) are 8 feet broad and 4 feet deep, and f inch thick, and were capable of
                    passing at this depth upwards of 20,000,000 gallons a day. Provision was
                    brackets. The pipes at these exposed places have flange joints, and they have
                    been covered with woollen felt to prevent expansion and contraction. There is a
                    short tunnel 110 yards long on this length of piping of dimensions sufficient to
                    carry the three lines of pipes. The construction of the aqueduct, for the 5
                    miles extending from the valley of the Endrick to the valley of the Blane,
                    presents the same general features as those already described. Good building
                    stone was abundant in this district, and the bridges are all of masonry. Fig. 15
                    is an elevation of one of the aqueduct bridges near Killearn at 19 miles from
                    Loch Katrine;</p>
                <p>The piping across the Blane is about 54 chains long, with a depression of 125
                    feet. The Blane water itself is crossed by a stone bridge, and there are basins
                    at each end of the pipes as before. The last piece of the aqueduct is a tunnel
                    2640 yards long, through a ridge of amygdaloidal trap, separating the valley of
                    the Blane from the valley of the Allander. The tunnel is 250 feet below the
                    summit of the hill.</p>
                <p>Mr Bateman, at the banquet referred to, summarised the works along the line of
                    aqueduct in nearly the following words :—“There are in the whole work eighty
                    distinct tunnels, upon which forty-four vertical shafts have been sunk for
                    facilitating and expediting the completion of the work.” Besides the tunnel at
                    the commencement of the aqueduct, called the Loch Katrine Tunnel, 2325 yards in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n244/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0244-0227"/> length, and upwards of 500 feet below the summit
                    of the hill, and the Mugdock Tunnel at the end of the aqueduct, 2640 yards in
                    length, there are “others, 700, 800, 1100, and 1400 yards in length. Not to
                    speak of smaller constructions, there are twenty-five important iron and masonry
                    aqueducts over rivers and ravines, some 60 and 80 feet in height, with arches of
                    30 feet, 50 feet, and 90 feet in span. The number of people employed, exclusive
                    of iron-founders and mechanics, has generally been about 3000; and for the
                    greater part of these, huts and roads and all other accommodation had to be
                    provided, the country for the most part being of the wildest and most
                    inaccessible description.”— “At the picturesque, ‘turf and timber’ village of
                    Sebastopol, as the miners calledit, at the head of Loch Chon, several hundreds
                    of work-people were accommodated. Provision stores, reading-rooms, a schoolhouse
                    and church, and a resident medical man and schoolmaster were provided for
                    them.”</p>
                <p>The aqueduct from its commencement at Loch Katrine to the Mugdock reservoir, is
                    25∣ miles long, 13 of which were tunnelled, 3∣ miles are iron piping across
                    valleys, and the remaining 9 miles consist of “cut and cover” conduit and
                    bridges. Where the ground was cut open the conduit was covered in, and the
                    surface restored after the aqueduct was built At the bridges the aqueduct is
                    covered with timber to prevent its being choked by snow. Most of them are
                    furnished with grooves in the masonry to receive stop planks, and with discharge
                    sluices to facilitate the emptying of the aqueduct, when it is necessary to
                    inspect or make repairs. Overflows are constructed at a number of the bridges,
                    to discharge the water if it should be necessary to stop the flow suddenly at
                    any point. The total cost of the aqueduct at the time the water was introduced
                    into the city, was £468,000, or an average of £18,000 per mile.</p>
                <p>It has been already stated that the 4-feet pipes across the valleys on the line
                    of aqueduct were intended to deliver 20,000,000 gallons a day. By the well-known
                    modification of Eytelwein’s formula, deduced from Du Buat’s experiments and more
                    elaborate formulae, the computed discharge is 21,500,000 gallons a day nearly,
                    and by Weisbach’s formulae, 21,750,000 gallons a day. These pipes, however, have
                    discharged 24,000,000 gallons a day without their being completely gorged, and
                    their ultimate discharge has therefore yet to be determined. The whole of the
                    pipes used in the works were coated with coal pitch and.oil, according to the
                    process patented by Dr R. A. Smith of Manchester, and first used by Mr Bateman
                    in the Manchester Waterworks. This coating, when well done, imparts a smooth
                    glassy surface to the pipes, and prevents, at least for a number of years, the
                    usual, and it may be said, inevitable oxidation. Weisbach found that for wooden
                    pipes 21 and 4 J inches diameter, the coefficient of resistance was 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 75 times as great as for “metallic pipes,” giving a
                    discharge about 14 per cent, less; and Μ. Morin has shown, in a paper which it
                    is believed is published in detail in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Savants</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrangers,</hi> the influence
                    the state of the surface has upon the discharge of a pipe, amounting, in
                    cast-iron pipes coated with pitch, and in glass pipes, to an increase of nearly
                    one-third in the discharge.</p>
                <p>It has also been pointed out by Μ. Morin, whose deductions are principally from
                    observations by Μ. Darcy director of the waterworks of Paris, that for large
                    sizes the diameters of the pipes seem also to exercise a more decided influence
                    on the discharge than has been hitherto assigned to them. Late observations on
                    the flow of gas through pipes by Μ. Arson, engineer of the Paris Gas Company,
                    tend to confirm the views of Μ. Morin.</p>
                <p>At the Mugdock Service Reservoir, 7 or 8 miles from Glasgow, the water is first
                    discharged into a basin, from which it passes over cast-iron gauge plates, 40
                    feet wide, brought to a thin edge. The depth of water passing over these plates
                    is regularly recorded and the discharge computed. From the basin the water falls
                    into an upper division of the main reservoir, about 2 acres in extent, and from
                    this it is discharged into the reservoir. The reservoir has a water surface of
                    60 acres, and a depth when full of 50 feet; it contains 548,000,000 gallons, and
                    is 317 feet above ordnance datum. It admits of repairs being made upon the
                    aqueduct without interrupting the supply of water to the city. Two earthen
                    embankments were necessary to form the reservoir; the main embankment is 400
                    yards long and 68 feet high, and the easterly embankment 240 yards long and 50
                    feet high, each with a puddle wall in the centre, and pitching on the front
                    slope in the usual way.</p>
                <p>The water is drawn from the reservoir by pipes laid in a tunnel through the hill
                    between the two embankments, there being no pipes through the embankments
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>At the end next the reservoir there is a stand-pipe so arranged that water can be
                    drawn at various heights, and about 50 yards from the reservoir, the water
                    passes into a circular well cut out of the rock, 40 feet in diameter and 63 feet
                    deep, and is strained by passing through copper wire-cloth, 40 meshes to the
                    inch, arranged in oak frames, forming an inner well of octagonal shape 25 feet
                    diameter; and from this latter the water finally passes into the two lines of
                    pipes leading to the city. Water can also be drawn direct from the gauge basin,
                    and from the upper compartment of the reservoir into the straining well, by a
                    line of 4-feet pipes through the bottom of the reservoir. These works, including
                    road and stream diversions, cost about £56,000.</p>
                <p>The two pipes leading from the straining well are each 42 inches diameter, and
                    are intended to deliver the whole 50,000,000 gallons a day; but on emerging from
                    the tunnel, which is 440 yards in length, they are diminished to 36 inches, and
                    they are continued of this size to the city. Provision was made for additional
                    pipes, which have since been laid. The different lines of pipes are laid side by
                    side for about 3 miles, after which they diverge—one line being carried by the
                    Great Western Road for the supply of the low districts of the city, and the
                    other by Maryhill for the supply of the high districts. These pipes come
                    together again, and are arranged so as to communicate -when necessary at St
                    George’s Road near the commencement of the city, up to which point their
                    respective lengths from the straining well are 7 miles for the low district
                    main, and 6∣ miles for the high. Each of these lines of pipes crosses the River
                    Kelvin and the Forth and Clyde Canal, and at these places provision was made for
                    additional pipes. Eleven feet were added to the width of the Kelvin Bridge on
                    the Great Western Road, by cast-iron girders, to carry the low district mains.
                    The two middle spans are each 93 feet, and the two side arches 37 feet span.</p>
                <p>The total cost of the works at their completion, in 1860, was as follows :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Vienna Waterworks.</hi></p>
                <p>A still more recent work, consisting mainly of aqueduct construction, is the
                    enterprise for supplying the city of Vienna with water. The water is obtained
                    from the springs of Kaiserbrunn and Stixenstein, both situated at the foot of
                    the Styrian Alps, which separate Austria from Styria. The Kaiserbrunn spring is
                    situated 1146 English feet abovo the Danube at Vienna, and the Stixenstein
                    spring 996 feet. The water is conducted by aqueduct to a receiving reservoir at
                    Rosenhugel, 277 feet above the Danube, and distant 2 miles from Vienna. The
                    length of the aqueduct from Kaiserbrunn to the receiving reservoir on the
                    Rosenhugel, is 56 j English miles. A branch of 3'9 English miles conducts the
                    Stixenstein spring to this aqueduct. The gradients of the aqueduct vary much in
                    the upper or early parts; but towards the end they become more regular. The
                    gradients have been thus varied for the purpose of keeping the canal as much as
                    possible along the level of the ground, so as to avoid high embankments. In
                    order to keep the water cool in summer, and lo secure it from freezing in
                    winter, the water is always 6 feet below the surface; and in places where
                    embankments were unavoidable, the aqueduct has been covered to the same extent.
                    The size of the aqueduct varies from 4 feet 6 inches in height, by 2 feet 6
                    inches in width, to 6 feet 6 inches in height, by 4 feet in width. In order to
                    facilitate the discharge, and to reduce friction, the inside of the aqueduct has
                    been plastered with a coating 2 inches thick of Portland cement and sand, in the
                    proportion of one of cement to two of sand. This coating was laid on in three
                    layers, the last being a very thin layer of pure cement, which, when hardened,
                    was rubbed with iron plates till it became perfectly smooth and polished. The
                    work was commenced in the winter of 1869-70, and completed in the month of
                    September 1873. The aqueduct is constructed for the purpose of supplying about
                    3,200,000 cubic feet per day, or 20,000,000 gallons. There are several important
                    aqueduct bridges along the line of works. Of these the principal is the aqueduct
                    of Baden, which consists of forty-three large arches, with spans varying from 5
                    klafters to 8⅛ klafters, and the greatest height 15 klafters 5 feet 5 inches, or
                    96 ’ 6 English feet, from the foundation of the pier to the top of the aqueduct.
                    The arches are of brickwork, as well as the vaulting of the canal. The piers,
                    together with the backing of arches and the sides of the canal, are faced with
                    ashlar, and filled up with rubble masonry. The canal is covered on the top with
                    earth, which is then covered with 9 inches of paving in rubble masonry</p>
                <p>The Mödling Aqueduct is, although one of the shortest, perhaps the finest on the
                    whole line of the works. It is situated in a very narrow gorge, with high rocks
                    rising on the side. The canal or aqueduct passes through a tunnel on one side,
                    and after crossing the aqueduct enters immediately into another tunnel on the
                    other. This aqueduct bridge consists of spans of 9 klafters, or 55'98 English
                    feet, in width, and is built entirely of bricks, with tho exception that the
                    piers are pointed with ashlar. The abutments, the foundations of which are
                    excavated in the rock, are built of rubble masonry, faced with ashlar. The other
                    chief aqueducts are—the one at Liesing with forty-six arches, very similar to
                    that of Baden, and that of Mauer with thirteen arches, built of bricks, and
                    making a fine curve across the valley.</p>
                <p>The receiving reservoir on the Rosenhugel, where the aqueduct ends, is divided
                    into two parts, capable together of holding 80,000 cubic feet English. From this
                    reservoir the water is taken to two other distributing reservoirs, from which
                    the city is supplied. The cost of the work, together with the network of pipes
                    in Vienna, has been about 25,000,000 florins or £2,000,000 sterling. The chief
                    engineer of the work was Herr Carl Junker of Vienna, and the contractor Mr
                    Antonio Gabrielli of London. The works were completed and opened in the autumn
                    of 1873.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water Supply of Paris.</hi></p>
                <p>The question of improving the water supply of this city was the subject of minute
                    and careful investigations, extending over a period of four or five years, (from
                    1854 to 1859.)</p>
                <p>Many projects were submitted to the Prefecture of the Seine, but the one finally
                    adopted was that studied by Mr Belgrand and the engineers of the municipality of
                    Paris. The scheme consisted in appropriating the waters of the Sonne and the
                    Soude, together with the Soudon and the Dhuis, all being tributaries of the
                    Marne, and flowing through chalk districts.</p>
                <p>The population of Paris, for the supply of which the scheme was laid out, was
                    taken at 2,000,000, and the waters from the sources selected were intended for
                    the domestic supply only—the existing supplies to Paris, which have become
                    gradually polluted and unfit for domestic use, being made available for all the
                    other general wants of the population. The quantity of water which it wa3
                    estimated would be required for the domestic purposes of such a population was
                    taken at 100,000 cubic metres per diem, or about 22,000,000 gallons per day; and
                    the works have been laid out for conveying this quantity. Gaugings of the
                    various streams selected, showed that in 1855, when the flow was at the lowest,
                    the produce of the Sonne and the Soude was 1081 litres per second, the Soudon
                    100, the Dhuis 315; making a total of 1496 litres per second, or about
                    28,000,000 gallons per day. At the time of lowest water in 1857, however, the
                    Sonne and the Soude together only yielded 880 litres per second, or 16,762,000
                    gallons per day, while in 1858, which was an exceptionally dry year (indeed the
                    driest year on record in this locality), they yielded together only 285 litres
                    per second, or 5,417,280 gallons per day; while in both these years the Soudon
                    and tho Dhuis gave almost the same quantities as in the year 1855.</p>
                <p>In order to meet the contingency of such a dry season as 1858, Mr Belgrand’s
                    project contemplated sinking wells or adits in the chalk, and obtaining
                    therefrom what he <pb break="no"

                    therein contained,”—artificial supplies, which would supply any deficiency in
                    the quantity yielded by the streams. The works comprised what are termed
                    conduits of derivation, being subsidiary conduits for collecting the waters from
                    the various streams, and conducting them to the commencement of the main
                    aqueduct that conveys the waters of the combined sources to Paris. The main
                    aqueduct commences at a level of about 105 metres above the sea. It is a little
                    over 180 kilometres in length (about 110 English miles), and terminates at Paris
                    in service reservoirs at Belleville, at a level of 83 j metres above the sea.
                    The subsidiary conduits are about 80 kilometres in length, and upon these and
                    the main aqueduct there are seventeen bridges, 6 kilometres of conduit
                    constructed upon arches, 7 kilometres of syphon piping, and 28 kilometres of
                    tunnel. The estimated cost of the ordinary works was about 19,000,000 francs, or
                    £760,000, to which must be added about 2⅛ million francs, or £100,000, for
                    special works, where the aqueduct had to be constructed through difficult
                    ground, and 4⅜ million francs, or £180,000, for compensation to riparian owners
                    on the streams which were selected as the sources of the supply, as well as to
                    the owners of mills who might be injured by the abstraction of the water, and
                    for the purchase of the lands through which the aqueduct had to be constructed;
                    making a total estimated outlay on the works at the sources of the supply, and
                    for the subsidiary mid main aqueducts up to the distributing at Belleville, of
                    26,000,000 francs or £1,010,000.</p>
                <p>The commission, to whom were referred all the projects which had been suggested,
                    in their report, considered on the 18th of March 1859, recommended that the sum
                    to be voted for the works should be 30,000,000 francs, or £1,200,000, thus
                    increasing the estimate by 4,000,000 francs, or £160,000, with the view of
                    providing ample means to cover any unforeseen works or difficulties which might
                    be encountered during the carrying out of the project. The works have since that
                    time been carried out substantially in accordance with the ideas and designs of
                    Mr Belgrand, and under his direction and supervision; but they are not yet
                    (1874) completed. The water from these sources is naturally very hard, but it is
                    bright, fresh, and well aerated.</p>
                <p>Although the system of pipes has superseded the use of stone channels all raised
                    to a level in the conveyance of water, there are still cases, such as those of
                    canals, where the water must be kept on a perfect level, and where, therefore,
                    aqueduct bridges are still necessary in conveying it over the valleys; and of
                    these we have long had examples in France, on the Languedoc canal. The first
                    aqueduct bridges for canals in this country were those made by the Duke of
                    Bridgewater, under the direction of the celebrated Brindley, and which, being
                    quite new here, excited no small degree of astonishment. The first and largest w
                    as the aqueduct at Barton Bridge for conveying the canal across the Irwell, 39
                    feet above the surface of the water. It consisted of three arches, the middle
                    one 63 feet span, and admitting under it the largest barges navigating the
                    Irwell with sails set. It was commenced in September 1760; and in July of the
                    following year the spectacle was first presented in this country, of vessels
                    floating and sailing across the course of the river, while others in the river
                    itself were passing under them. Since that period canal aqueducts have become
                    more common; and many excellent examples are to be found both in England and
                    Scotland. Of these are the aqueducts over the river Lune on the Lancaster canal,
                    designed by Rennie,—a very excellent and splendid work of five arches, each 72
                    feet span, and rising 65 feet above the level of the river; and the Kelvin
                    aqueduct, near Glasgow, which conveys the Forth and Clyde canal over the valley
                    of Kelvin, consisting of four arches, each 70 feet span, and rising 70 feet
                    above the level of the river. Plate IV. contains views of two other principal
                    aqueducts, viz., those of Pont-y-Cysyllte and Chirk in Wales. Of these the Pon
                    t-y-Cysylite aqueduct by Mr Telford is justly celebrated for its magnitude,
                    simplicity of design, and skilful disposition of the parts, combining lightness
                    with strength in a degree seldom attempted. This aqueduct serves to convey the
                    waters of the Ellesmere canal across the Dee and the vale of Llangollen, which
                    it traverses. The channel for the water is made of cast-iron, supported on
                    cast-iron ribs or arches, and these resting on pillars of stone. The iron being
                    much lighter than stone arches, this in one reason why the pillars have been
                    reduced apparently to such slender dimensions. They are quite strong enough,
                    however, as experience has proved. The whole length of the aqueduct is about
                    1000 feet, and consists of nineteen arches, each 45 feet span. The breadth of
                    the pillars at the top is 8 feet, and the height of the four middle ones is 115
                    feet to the springing. The pillars have a slight taper, the breadth of the
                    middle ones at the base being 15 feet. The height from the surface of the water
                    in the Dee to that in the canal is 126 feet 8 inches. The channel for the water
                    consists of cast-iron plates, cast with flanches, and these screwed together
                    with bolts; they are represented in the drawing, between the arched ribs and the
                    railing. The lines there show the joinings of the different plates. In order to
                    preserve as much water-way as possible, the channel is made the full width of
                    the canal and towing-path, and the latter projected over one side, and supported
                    inside by posts resting on the bottom of the canal. The aqueduct of Chirk was
                    designed by the same able engineer, and serves also to convey across a valley
                    the waters of the same canal. This aqueduct was the first in which iron was
                    employed. Hitherto the channel for the waters had been constructed of stone, or
                    partly of stone and partly of clay puddle, which it was generally found very
                    difficult to keep water-tight for a length of time. It was determined,
                    therefore, by Mr Telford, to try the effect of castriron, and to lay it at first
                    only on the bottom. The plates were accordingly laid directly over the sprandril
                    walls, which they served to bind together, and united by flanches and screws.
                    The sides of the channel were built with stone facings and brick hearting laid
                    in water-lime mortar. This plan succeeded completely, and the quantity of
                    masonry in the aqueduct was thereby greatly reduced. The aqueduct itself is 600
                    feet long, and 65 feet high above the river, consisting of ten arches, each 42
                    feet span. The piers are 10 feet thick.</p>
                <p>An aqueduct near Edinburgh, conveying the waters of the Edinburgh and Glasgow
                    Union Canal across the valley of the Water of Leith at Slateford, is an elegant
                    structure, similar in plan to that of Chirk, only that the waterchannel is
                    composed entirely of cast-iron, which is moreover built in with masonry. It is
                    about 500 feet in length, and consists of eight arches, each 45 feet span; and
                    the height of the canal is about 70 feet above the level of the river. On this
                    canal another aqueduct of the very same construction occurs in crossing the
                    valley of the Almond, and having several more arches. There are, in different
                    parts of the country, various other aqueducts, but, excepting the formation of
                    the water-way, these structures differ in no respect from bridges, particularly
                    those undertaken not so much with the view of crossing rivers as of raising the
                    level of the road entirely out of the valley,—an object now become of great
                    importance, from the improvements in modem modes of conveyance. For the
                    principles and mode of construction of these works, as well as of the aqueduct
                    bridges, so far as the arch is concerned, see articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arch</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Bridge.</hi></p>
