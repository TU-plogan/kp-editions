                <p><label type="entry">ANNUITIES</label></p>
                <p>BY an annuity is meant a periodical payment, made annually, or at more frequent
                    intervals, either for a fixed term of years, or during the continuance of a
                    given life, or a combination of lives, as will be more fully explained further
                    on. In technical language an annuity is said to be payable for an assigned <hi
                        rend="italic">status,</hi> this being a general word chosen in preference to
                    such words as “time,” “term,” or “period,” because it may include more readily
                    either a term of years certain, or a life or combination of lives. The magnitude
                    of the annuity is the sum to be paid (and received) in the course of each year.
                    Thus, if <hi rend="italic">£1</hi> 00 is to be received each year by a person,
                    he is said to have “an annuity of £100.” If the payments are made half-yearly,
                    it is sometimes said that he has “a half-yearly annuity of £100;” but to avoid
                    ambiguity, it is more commonly said he has an annuity of £100, payable by
                    half-yearly instalments. The former expression, if clearly understood, is
                    preferable on account of its brevity. So we may have quarterly, monthly, weekly,
                    daily annuities, when the annuity is payable by quarterly, monthly, weekly, or
                    daily instalments. An annuity is considered as accruing during each instant of
                    the status for which it is enjoyed, although it is only payable at fixed
                    intervals. If the enjoyment of an annuity is postponed until after the lapse of
                    a certain number of years, the annuity is said to be deferred. When an annuity
                    is deferred for any number of years, say n, it is said, indifferently, to
                    commence, or to be entered upon, after <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years,'or to run
                    from the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years; and if it is payable yearly, the
                    first payment will be made at the end of (π+l) years; if half-yearly, the first
                    half-yearly payment will be made at the end of (ra + ∣) years; if quarterly, the
                    first quarterly payment will be made at the end of (n + ∣) years; and so on. If
                    an annuity, instead of being payable at the end of each year, half-year, <hi
                        rend="italic">&amp;c.,</hi> is payable in advance, it is called an
                    annuity-due.</p>
                <p>If an annuity is payable for a term of years independent of any contingency, it
                    is called an annuity certain; if it is to continue for ever, it is called a
                    perpetuity; and if in the latter case it is not to commence until after a term
                    of years, it is called a deferred perpetuity. An annuity depending on the
                    continuance of an assigned life or lives, is sometimes called a life annuity;
                    but more commonly the simple term “annuity” is understood to mean a life
                    annuity, unless the contrary is stated. A life annuity, to cease in any event
                    after a certain term of years, is called a temporary annuity. The holder of an
                    annuity is called an annuitant, and the person on whose life the annuity depends
                    is called the nominee.</p>
                <p>If not otherwise stated, it is always understood that an annuity is payable
                    yearly, and that the annual payment (or rent, as it is sometimes called) is £1.
                    Of late years, however, it has become customary to consider the annual payment
                    to be, not £1, but simply 1, the reader supplying <pb break="no"

                    pound, dollar, franc, thaler, &amp;c. It is much to be desired that this course
                    should be followed in any tables that may be published in future.</p>
                <p>The annuity, it will be observed, is the totality of the payments to be made (and
                    received), and is so understood by all writers on the subject; but some have
                    also used the word to denote an individual payment (or rent), speaking, for
                    instance, of the first or second year’s annuity,—a practice which is calculated
                    to introduce confusion, and should therefore be carefully avoided.</p>
                <p>The theory of annuities certain is a simple application of algebra to the
                    fundamental idea of compound interest. According to this idea, any sum of money
                    invested, or put out at interest, is increased at the end of a year ^by the
                    addition to it of interest at a certain rate; and at the end of a second year,
                    the interest of the first year, as well as the original sum, is increased in the
                    same proportion, and so on to the end of the last year,—the interest being, in
                    technical language, converted into principal yearly. Thus, if the rate of
                    interest is 5 per cent., £1 improved at interest will amount at the end of a
                    year to £1’05, or, as we shall in future say, in conformity with a previous
                    remark, 1 will at the end of a year amount to 1Ό5. At the end of a second year
                    this will be increased in the same ratio, and then amount to (Γ05) <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. In the same way, at the end of a third year, it
                    will amount to (1O5) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, and so on.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">i</hi> denote the interest on 1 for a year; then at the end
                    of a year the amount of 1 will be 1 + <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> Reasoning as
                    above, at the end of two years the amount will be (1 +i) <hi rend="superscript">
                        2</hi>, at the end of three years (1 +t) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, and
                    so on. In general, at the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years the amount will
                    be (1 +i)“; or this is the amount of 1 at compound interest in <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> years. The present value of a sum, say 1, payable at the end of <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> years, is such a sum as, being improved at compound
                    interest for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years, will exactly amount to 1. We have
                    seen that 1 will in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years amount to (1 +t)", and by
                    proportion we easily see that the sum which in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years
                    will amount to 1, must be &gt; or (1 +i)~∙. It is usual to put <hi rend="italic"
                        >V</hi> for ~j~pρ <hi rend="superscript"> so t</hi> ħat <hi rend="italic"
                        >v</hi> is the value of 1 to be received at the end of a year, and tΓ the
                    value of 1 to be received at the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years.</p>
                <p>Since 1 placed out at interest produces <hi rend="italic">i</hi> each year, we
                    see that a perpetuity of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is equal in value to 1; hence,
                    by proportion, a perpetuity of 1 is equal in value to -.. At ⅛</p>
                <p>5 per cent., t=O5, and -=»20; or a perpetuity is worth 20 years’ purchase: at 4
                    per cent., it is worth 25 years’ purchase, = 25^: at 3 per cent., it is worth
                    33⅜ years’ purchase, (,⅛ = 33⅜) .</p>
                <p>Instances of perpetuities are the dividends upon the public stocks in England,
                    France, and some other countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100
                    consols, this £100 is a mere conception or ideal sum; and the reality is the £3
                    a year which the Government pays by half-yearly instalments. The practice of the
                    French in this, as in many other matters, is more logical In speaking of their
                    public funds, they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the
                    annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other
                    instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived from the debenture stocks now
                    issued so largely by various railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly
                    payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years’ purchase which the
                    perpetual annuities granted by a government or a railway company realise in the
                    open market, forms a very simple te3t of the credit of the various governments
                    or railways. Thus at the present time (May 1874) the British perpetual annuity
                    of £3, derived from the 3 per cent, consols, is worth £93, or 31 years’
                    purchase; and a purchaser thus obtains 3’226 per cent, interest on his
                    investment. Other examples are given in the subjoined tables, the figures in
                    which are deduced from the Stock Exchange quotations of the irredeemable stocks

                <p>We may mention in passing that the more usual practice of foreign governments
                    when borrowing is not to grant the lender a perpetual annuity, but to issue to
                    him bonds of say £100 each, bearing an agreed rate of interest, these bonds
                    being usually issued at a discount, and redeemed at par by annual drawings
                    during a specified term of years.</p>

                            who wishes to pursue this subject is referred to Francis Baily's <hi

                            ones, which are at once simpler and more correct, are demonstrated.

                <p>If the annuity for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years is not to be enjoyed at once,
                    but only after the lapse of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> years, its value will be
                    reduced in the proportion of 1 to the value of 1 payable in <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It Remains to find the amount at compound interest at the end of <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> years of an annuity payable for that term. The amount
                    of 1 in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years being (1 +i) <hi rend="superscript">
                        n</hi>, its increase in that time is (1 + i) <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>-

                    interest during the remainder of the term. Hence it follows that the amount at

                <p>One of the principal applications of the theory of annuities certain is the
                    valuation of leasehold property; another is the calculation of the terms of
                    advances in consideration of an annuity certain for a term of years. At present
                    a large sum of money is annually borrowed by corporations and other public
                    bodies upon the security of local rates in the United Kingdom. It is sometimes
                    arranged in these transactions that a fixed portion of the loan shall be paid
                    off every year; but it is more commonly the case that, in consideration of a
                    present advance, an annuity is granted for a term of years, usually 25 or 30,
                    but in some instances extending to 50. Landed proprietors also, who possess only
                    a life interest in their property, have been authorised by various Acts of
                    Parliament to borrow money for the purpose of improving their estates, and can
                    grant a rentcharge upon the fee-simple for a term not exceeding 30 pears. These
                    are very favourite investments with the life insurance companies of the country,
                    as they are thus enabled to obtain a somewhat higher interest—from 4∣ to 4∣ per
                    cent.—than they could obtain upon ordinary mortgages with equally good security;
                    the reason for this, of course, being that these loans are not so suitable as
                    others for private lenders. In this case, as in all others, the price is
                    determined by the laws of supply and demand; and the number of lenders being
                    less than in the case of ordinary mortgages, the terms paid by the borrowers are
                    higher. When a loan is arranged in this way, it is desirable for various
                    purposes, and in particular for the ascertainment of the proper amount of
                    income-tax, to consider each year’s payment as consisting partly of interest on
                    the outstanding balance of the loan and partly as an instalment of the
                    principal. The problem of determining the separate amounts of these has been
                    considered by Turnbull, <hi rend="italic">Tables,</hi> p. 128; and by Gray, <hi
                        rend="italic">Λss. Mag.,</hi> xi. 172.</p>
                <p>In making calculations for these and similar purposes, it is but seldom necessary
                    to use the formulas given above. The computer usually has recourse to one of the
                    tables which have been published, containing values and amounts calculated for
                    various rates of interest. An extensive set of tables of this kind was published
                    in 1726 by John Smart; and many subsequent writers, as Dr Price, Baily, Milne,
                    Davies, D. Jones, J. Jones, have reprinted or abridged portions of these tables.
                    They show the amount and the present value both of a payment and of an annuity
                    of <hi rend="italic">£1 for every term of</hi> years not exceeding 100, at the
                    several rates of interest, 2, 2∣, 3, 3⅜, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 per cent.; the
                    five most important tables giving—</p>
                <p>(1.) The amount of £1 in any number of years, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>; or
                    (l+⅛)*.</p>
                <p>(2.) The present value of <hi rend="italic">£1</hi> due in any number of years,
                        <hi rend="italic">n∙,</hi> or(l+i)~".</p>
                <p>(3.) The amount of an annuity of £1 in any number of (l+i)∙-l years, <hi
                        rend="italic">n;</hi> or <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> —</p>
                <p>(4.) The present value of an annuity of £1 for any number of years, <hi
                        rend="italic">n;</hi> or —— <hi rend="subscript">:</hi> —-— ·</p>
                <p>(5.) The annuity which £1 will purchase for any number of years, <hi
                        rend="italic">n;</hi> or -— ∖ ·</p>
                <p>The scheme would be more complete if we add, with Corbaux, whose tables will be
                    described below— (6.) The annuity which would amount to £1 in <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> years; <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> (i <hi rend="subscript">
                        +</hi> i)∙-ι∙</p>
                <p>Smart gives the values of these functions not only for all integral values of <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> up to 100, but also for the half-years. In this
                    respect, however, he has not been followed by subsequent writers. Some (as
                    Milne) have stated that he “has given the amounts and the present values both of
                    sums and annuities certain, wrong for every odd number of half-years.” This
                    remark requires some explanation. The fact is that Smart’s tables are quite
                    correct, but are not applicable according to the conventions that are usually
                    observed in practice. Thus, for example, he gives the amount of 1 at the end of
                    half a year at 4 per cent, interest as equal to √Γ04 = lO1980390, this being the
                    strictly correct theoretical value at 4 per cent, interest. But in practice the
                    invariable rule is, when interest is calculated for a shorter term than a year,
                    to take a proportionate part of the year’s interest, thus virtually charging a
                    higher rate for the odd time, so that in the above case the amount at the end of
                    half a year will be 1Ό2. This circumstance renders it undesirable to tabulate
                    the amounts and values for half-years; and this is never now done. The course
                    adopted by Smart of giving the values and amounts of annuities for the odd
                    half-years is open to more serious objection. His figures in these cases are
                    merely the values of the algebraical functions above given, corresponding to the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> ⅜, 1∣, 2∣, &amp;c., and do not give the
                    amounts and values of annuities payable half-yearly. In fact, we are unable to
                    see that any practical use could ever be made of his results in these cases.</p>
                <p>. The following table, on p. 75, in which the rate of interest is 5 per cent.,
                    will serve to illustrate the nature of the tables in question, as reprinted by
                    Baily, D. Jones, and others.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the figures in the column numbered (2) are the reciprocals
                    of those in (1), and the figures in column (5) the reciprocals of those in (4).
                    Also, that the figures in (4) are the sums of the first 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., terms
                    of (2). Again, the figures in (3) are derived by the successive addition of
                    those in (1) to the first term, 1 ’ 000000; and the figures in (4) are equal to
                    the product of those in (2) and (3). We have added the column (6) from
                    Cor-baux’s tables. These figures are the reciprocals of those in (3), and are
                    equal to the product of those in (5) and (2), while the figures in (5) are the
                    products of those in (1) and (6).</p>
                <p>It would perhaps be more convenient in practice if tables (3) and (6J were
                    altered so as to relate to annuities payable in advance (or annuities-due). In
                    that case (3) would give the amount at compound interest in <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> years of an annuity-due of 1, and (6) the annuity-due which would,
                    at compound interest, amount to 1 in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years;</p>
                <p>(l+i) <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> + <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>-l-i that is
                    to say, the values of the functions and <hi rend="strikethrough">(1 +

                    application of table (3) is to find the amount of the premiums paid upon a life
                    policy, and these premiums are always payable in advance. If that table were
                    arranged as here suggested, the figures contained in it would be derived from
                    those in (1), in precisely the same way as <pb break="no"

                <p>(4) from (2). It would also be an improvement, for a reason to be mentioned
                    presently, if the heading of the tables were altered, so that, for example,
                    instead of (1) being called a table of the amounts of “£1” at the end of any
                    number of “years,” it were called a table of the amounts of “1” at the end of
                    any number of “terms.” It is not to be understood that the tables are arranged
                    in the, manner here shown. Smart gives, in his First Table of Compound Interest,
                    the values of our (1) for the various rates of interest arranged side by side;
                    in his Second Table he gives the values of our (2) at diiferent rates of
                    interest similarly arranged; and so for (3), (4), and (5). This arrangement has
                    been followed by most authors, not only by those mentioned above as having
                    copied Smart’s tables, but also by Chisholm, who states that the compound
                    interest tables in his work <hi rend="italic">(Commutation Tables,</hi> 1858)
                    have been specially computed for it. He gives the tables (1), (2), (3), (4), and
                    (5), at the rates of interest 3, 3⅛, 4, 5, 6 per cent., to any number of years
                    up to 105. Hardy s <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of Simple and Compound
                        Interest,</hi> 1839, contains tables (1), (2), (3), (4), for the rates of
                    interest ⅛, ⅜, f, 1, 1∣, 1 i, 1J, 2, 2⅜, 2⅜, 2∣, 3, 3∣, 3⅜, 3∣, 4, 4⅜, 4⅞, 4∣,
                    5, 6, 7, and 8 percent., for any number of years up to 100. The arrangement in
                    our specimen is that adopted by Rance in his <hi rend="italic">Tables of
                        Compound Interest,</hi> 1852. He gives tables (1), (2), (3), and (4), at
                    rates of interest proceeding, by steps of ⅛ per cent., from ∣ to 10 percent.,
                    for any number of years from 1 to 100. The same arrangement is also followed in
                    the tables appended to Francis Corbaux’s <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of Compound
                        Interest,</hi> 1825; but this author gives in one opening of the book not
                    only the six tabular results in our specimen, but also the corresponding results
                    when interest at the nominal rate of 5 per cent, is payable half-yearly and
                    quarterly, thus giving in one opening 24 tabular results side by side. He gives
                    results for every quarter of a year up to 16 years, and then for each year up to
                    100; and his rates of interest range from 3 to 6 per cent., at intervals of ∣
                    per cent. The only other tables we think it needful to mention are Turnbull’s,
                    1863. His work gives tables (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), for the Tates of
                    interest 3, 3⅜, 4, 4⅜, 5, and 6, payable yearly; for 3, 3⅛, 3⅜, 3f, 4, 4⅛, 4⅜,
                    4J, 5, 5⅜, payable half-yearly; and 3, 3⅜, 4, 4⅛, 5, 6, payable quarterly. The
                    results extend in every case to 80 terms of conversion—that is, 80 years, 80
                    half-years, and 80 quarters respectively. The arrangement of the tables differs
                    from that cf all the others mentioned, as each page contains only the results
                    pertaining to one table at one rate of interest. The results are given not only
                    in decimals, but in £ <hi rend="italic">s. d.</hi> in addition, which also is
                    unusual.</p>
                <p>A few words may be here added as to the practical method of constructing compound
                    interest tables. The formulas we have found above are not directly used for the
                    calculation of the greater part of the tabular results; but these are in
                    practice deduced the one from the other by continuous processes, the values
                    found by the formulas being used at intervals for the purpose of verification.
                    Smart gives, on page 47 of his work, a description of the method he has
                    employed, and the subject has been fully dealt with by Gray in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Tables and</hi><hi rend="italic">Formulée,</hi> chap. 2. Since
                    the publication of that work, the Arithmometer of Μ. Thomas (of Colmar) has come
                    into extensive use for the formation of tables of this kind. For a description
                    of the instrument, and some of its uses, the reader is referred to the papers in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine</hi> by Major-General Hannyngton, vol.
                    xvi. p. 244; Mr W. J. Hancock, xvi. 265; and by Gray, xvii. 249; xviii. 20 and
                    123.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have considered the annuity payments to be all made annually; and the
                    case where the payments are made more frequently now requires attention, First,
                    suppose that the annuity is payable by half-yearly instalments; then, in order
                    to find the present value of the annuity, we have first to answer the question,
                    What is the value of a sum payable in six months’ time <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi>? and, in order to find the amount of the annuity in <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi> years, we must first determine what is the amount of a sum at the
                    end of six months. The annual rate of interest being <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    it may be supposed at first sight that the amount of 1 at the end of six months
                    will be 1 + 5; but if this were the case, the amount at the end of a second
                    period of six months would be increased in the same proportion, and be ^1 + ,
                    or</p>
                <p>1 +1 + . But this is contrary to our original assump tion that the annual
                    interest is <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and the amount at the end of a year
                    therefore 1 + <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> In fact, if we suppose the interest on 1
                    for half a year to be the interest on it for</p>
                <p>. i <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> a year will not be <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    but ⅛ + -. In order that the amount at the end of a year may be 1 + <hi
                        rend="italic">i,</hi> the amount at the end of six months must be such a
                    quantity as, improved at the same rate for another six months, will be exactly 1
                    + <hi rend="italic">i;</hi> hence the amount at the end of six months must be
                        <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> ∕Γ+ι, or (1 + i) <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi>. Reasoning in the same way, it is easy to see that, the true annual rate
                    of interest being <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> the amount of 1 in any number of
                    years, <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> whether integral or fractional, will always be
                    (l + ⅛)*. Hence, by similar reasoning to that pursued above, the present value
                    of 1 payable at the end of any number of years, <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    whether integral or fractional, will always be (1 + <hi rend="italic"
                        >i')~</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic smallcaps"> v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript smallcaps">
                        λ</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> .</hi></p>
                <p>It is now easily seen—we omit the demonstrations for the sake of brevity—that the
                    present value of an annuity payable half-yearly for <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    years <hi rend="italic">(n</hi> being integral) is <hi rend="strikethrough"
                        >*∆⅛j</hi><hi rend="superscript strikethrough"> +1</hi><hi
                        rend="strikethrough">· l~(</hi><hi rend="superscript strikethrough">
                        1</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">+*)'</hi> —. <hi rend="subscript"> an</hi> d
                    that the amount of a similar annuity at the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    years is .</p>
                <p>It is to be observed, however, that when we are dealing with half-yearly payments
                    in practice, the interest is never calculated in the way we have here supposed.
                    On the contrary, the nominal rate of interest being <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    the rate paid half-yearly is ∣, so that the true annual rate in praeda tice is
                        <hi rend="italic">i</hi> 4- - <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> instance, if
                    interest on a loan is payable half-yearly, at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum,
                    the true rate of interest is '050625, or <hi rend="italic">£5,</hi> Is. 3d. per
                    £100. Under these circumstances interest is said to be convertible into
                    principal twice a year. Assuming that interest is thus convertible <hi
                        rend="italic">m</hi> times a year, the rate of interest for the τzι <hi
                        rend="superscript"> α</hi> part of a year will be —, and the amount of 1 at
                    the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years, that is, at the end of <hi
                        rend="italic">mn</hi> intervals of conversion, will be fl + . Assuming the
                    number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> now to increase<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0085-0076"/> indefinitely, or interest to be convertible
                    momently, the above amount becomes <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >*,</hi> where ε is the base of the natural (or Napierian) logarithms.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the above-mentioned practice as to half-yearly interest, the
                    values given in Smart’s tables for the odd half-years, though theoretically
                    correct, are practically useless, and they have been superseded by the other
                    tables above mentioned. It is important, however, always to bear in mind that
                    when interest is thus payable half-yearly or quarterly, the true rate of
                    interest exceeds the nominal. From want of attention to this point, the subject
                    has become involved in much confusion, not to say error, in the works of Milne
                    and some other writers.</p>
                <p>It is easily seen from the above formula that the amount of 1 in <hi
                        rend="italic">mn</hi> years, at the rate of interest —, is the same as <hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> that of 1 in <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> years, at the rate of interest <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    convertible <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times a year; and a similar property holds
                    good of present values. Hence, the tables calculated at the rate of interest may
                    be used to find the amounts and present values at the rate <hi rend="italic"
                        >i</hi> convertible <hi rend="italic">m</hi> times a year; for example, the
                    tables calculated for interest 2 per cent, will give the results for 4 per cent,
                    payable half-yearly. For this reason it would be an improvement, as remarked
                    above, to use the word “terms” in the headings of the tables instead of
                    “years.”</p>
                <p>We pass on now to the consideration of the theory of life annuities. This is
                    based upon a knowledge of the rate of mortality among mankind in general, of
                    among the particular class of persons on whose lives the annuities depend. If a
                    simple mathematical law could be discovered which the mortality followed, then a
                    mathematical formula could be given for the value of a life annuity, in the same
                    way as we gave above the formula for the value of an annuity certain. In the
                    early stage of the science, De-moivre propounded the very simple law of mortaEty
                    which bears his name, and which is to the effect, that out of 86 children born
                    alive 1 will die every year until the last dies between the ages of 85 and 86.
                    The mortality, as determined by this law, agreed sufficiently well at the middle
                    ages of life with the mortality deduced from the best observations of his time;
                    but, as observations became more exact, the approximation was found to be not
                    sufficiently close. This was particularly the case when it was desired to obtain
                    the value of joint life, contingent, or other complicated benefits. Demoivre’s
                    law is now, accordingly, entirely a thing of the past, and does not call for any
                    further notice from us. Assuming that law to hold, it is easy to obtain the
                    formula for the value of an annuity, immediate, deferred, or temporary; but such
                    formulas are entirely devoid of practical utility. Those who are curious on the
                    subject may consult the paper by Charion, Ass. <hi rend="italic">Mag.,</hi> XV.
                    141. In vol. vi. p. 181, will be found an investigation by Gray of the formula
                    for the value of an annuity when the mortality table is supposed to follow a
                    somewhat more complicated law. No simple formula, however, has yet been
                    discovered that will represent the rate of mortality -with sufficient accuracy;
                    and those which satisfy this condition are too complicated for general use.</p>
                <p>The rate of mortality at each age is, therefore, in practice usually determined
                    by a series of figures deduced from observation; and the value of an annuity at
                    any age is found from these numbers by means of a series of arithmetical
                    calculations. Without entering here on a description of the manner of making
                    these observations and deducing the rate of mortality, and of the construction
                    of “Mortality Tables,” we append, for the sake of illustration, one of the
                    earliest tables of this kind, namely, that of Deparcieux, given in his <hi

                <p>It is to be understood from this table that the mortality among the persons
                    observed was such that out of every 1000 children alive at the age of 3, 30 died
                    before attaining the age of 4, leaving 970 alive at 4; 22 died between the ages
                    of 4 and 5, leaving 948 alive at the age of 5; and so on, until one person is
                    left alive at the age of 94, who died before attaining the age of 95.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of explaining more fully the method of finding the value of a
                    life annuity, it will be convenient, in the first instance, to establish the two
                    following lemmas.</p>

                        contingency. —</hi> Suppose that the sum of 1 is to be received in <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> years’ time, provided that a certain event shall then
                    happen (or shall have then happened), the probability of which is <hi

                    received in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years’ time is <hi rend="italic">v*.</hi>
                    In order to introduce the idea of probability into the problem, suppose that <hi
                        rend="italic">p =</hi> so that there are <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cases
                    favourable to the happening of the assumed event, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    unfavourable, the total number of possible cases, all of which are equally
                    probable, being (α + δ). We may suppose, for instance, that there are (α + δ)
                    balls in a bag, of which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are white and <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> black; and that 1 is to be received if a white ball is
                    drawn. In order to determine the value of the chance of receiving 1 in
                    consequence of a white ball being drawn, suppose that (α + δ) persons draw each
                    one ball, and that every one who draws a white ball receives 1; then the total
                    sum to be received is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the value of the expectation
                    of all the (α + δ) persons who draw is also <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> But it is
                    clear that each of the persons has the same chance of drawing a white ball,
                    therefore the value of the expectation of each of them is <hi rend="italic">-~

                    be alive is to be found, as already intimated, by means of a mortality table.
                    Out of the various tables of this nature that exist, that one must be chosen
                    which, it is believed, most faithfully represents the probabilities of life of
                    the class of persons to which the nominee belongs. Suppose we have reason to
                    believe that Deparcieux’s table, above given, is the most suitable in the case
                    before us,—that the age of the nominee is 30, and the term of years 10. Then,
                    observing that, according to Deparcieux’s table, the number of persons living at
                    the age 30 is 734, while the number at the age 40 is 657, and the difference, or
                    the number who die between the two ages, is 77, we conclude that the chances of
                    any particular nominee of the age of 30 dying before attaining the age of 40 are
                    as 77 to 734, and the chances in favour of his living to the age of 40 are as
                    657 to 734; or the probability of his living to 40 is .</p>
                <p>Passing now from figures to more general symbols, we will use <hi rend="italic"
                        >l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> to denote the number given in the
                    mortality table as alive at any age <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> so that, for
                    example, in the above table, Z <hi rend="subscript"> 3o</hi> = 734, i <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 40</hi> = 657; and in accordance with what we have just
                    explained, the probability of a nominee of the age <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    living to the age <hi rend="italic">x + n,</hi> will therefore be expressed by
                    -γ <hi rend="superscript"> ti</hi>. Hence, by lemma 1, the value of 1 to *jr be
                    received if the nominee shall be alive at the end of <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    years, is ∙y¾". In the particular case supposed above, <hi rend="italic">•
                        *</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the actual value will be, taking the rate
                    of interest at 3 per cent., × (lO3) <hi rend="superscript"> -10</hi> = ’ 666035.
                    We may look at the question from another point of view. Suppose that 734 persons
                    of the age of 30 agree to purchase from an insurance company each an endowment

                    probabilities of life being supposed to be correctly given by Deparcieux’s
                    table, we see that 657 of those persons will be alive at the end of 10 years, or
                    the engagement of the insurance company to pay £1 to each survivor amounts to
                    the same thing as the engagement to pay £657 at the end of 10 years, and the
                    present value of this sum is 657 (lO3)~ <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi>. The sum
                    that should be paid by each of the 734 persons, so that the company shall
                    neither gain nor lose by the transaction, is 6ö 7</p>
                <p>therefore — (1 ∙03) <hi rend="superscript"> -10</hi>, as before. If we suppose
                    the probabilities of life to agree with those of the English Table, No. 3,

                <p>If now we carefully examine the reasoning of the last paragraph, we see that we
                    have made an assumption that must not be allowed to pass without some further
                    justification.. We have assumed, in. fact, that the lives we are dealing with
                    will die off at the exact rate indicated by the mortality table. This, however,
                    we know, is not necessarily the case. Even if the mortality table correctly
                    represents in the long run the rate of mortality among the lives we are dealing
                    with, we know that the rate of mortality will, from accidental circumstances, be
                    sometimes greater and sometimes less than that indicated by the table. If, for
                    example, we have 734 persons under observation all of the age 30, we have no
                    certainty that at the end of 10 years exactly 77 will have died, leaving 657
                    alive. It is, indeed, within the range of possibility— firstly, that the whole
                    734 persons may die before the age 40; and, secondly, that none of them may die,
                    or that the whole 734 may attain the age of 40. It appears, therefore, as if we
                    had used the word “probability” in the second lemma in a different sense from
                    that we attached to it in the first; for, in that case we know that if the whole
                    of the <hi rend="italic">(a + b)</hi> balls are drawn, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    of them will certainly be white, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> black. But the
                    cases will be more parallel if we suppose that each of the balls, after being
                    drawn, is replaced in the bag. If this is done, we see it is no longer certain
                    that when (α + <hi rend="italic">b)</hi> drawings take place, <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> of the balls will be white, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> black. It
                    may, under these altered circumstances, possibly happen that the balls drawn at
                    each of the <hi rend="italic">(a + b)</hi> drawings will all be white, or on the
                    contrary all black. But when a very large number of drawings are made, we can
                    prove that the ratio of white balls drawn to the black will differ very little
                    from the ratio of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and will
                    exactly equal it if the number of drawings is supposed to be indefinitely large.
                    In this case we know that the probability of drawing a white ball is still ——-,
                    and passing now to the case of lives under Λ"T" 0</p>
                <p>observation, we can say, in the same sense, that the probability of a person of
                    the age of 30 living for 10 years is, according to Deparcieux’s table, ~, and
                    that on the average of a very large number of observations, that fraction will
                    accurately represent the number of persons surviving. We shall, therefore, be
                    justified in basing all our reasonings on the assumption that the lives we are
                    dealing with die precisely at the rate indicated by the figures of the mortality
                    table.</p>
                <p>We* are now in a position to show how the value of a life annuity is calculated.
                    The annual payment of the annuity being 1, which is to be made at the end of
                    each year through which the nominee shall live, the annuity consists of a
                    payment of 1 at the end of one year if the nominee is then alive, of the same
                    payment at the end of two years, at the end of three years, &lt;fcc., under the
                    same condition, and is therefore equal to the sum of a series of endowments. If
                    a; is the age of the nominee, the value of the endowment to be received at the
                    end of the nth year is, as we have seen in lemma 2, v <hi rend="superscript">
                        n</hi>, and the total value of the annuity is therefore</p>
                <p>⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi>.... (1.)</p>
                <p>&lt;X <hi rend="italic">I* lχ</hi></p>
                <p>By means of this formula, taking the values of <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi

                    values from the compound interest tables previously described, we can calculate
                    the value of an annuity at any age with any degree of accuracy desired. In
                    practice the calculations would be most readily made by the aid of
                    logarithms.</p>
                <p>We can arrive at the above formula more readily by availing ourselves of the
                    supposition which we have seen to be allowable, that the lives under observation
                    will die off exactly at the rate indicated by the mortality table.</p>

                <p>Thus, suppose that <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> js</hi>
                    persons of the· age <hi rend="italic">x</hi> buy each an annuity of 1. Then the

                    the payments at the end of the second year. Proceeding in this way, the total

                        >l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> persons, will be <hi

                    average number of years which persons of the given age will one with another

                <p>The first writer who is known to have attempted to obtain, on correct
                    mathematical principles, the value of a life annuity, was Johan De Wit, Grand
                    Pensionary of Holland and West Friesland. All our exact knowledge of his
                    writings on the subject is derived from two papers contributed by Mr Frederick
                    Hendriks to the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> vol. ii. p. 222, and
                    vol. iii. p. 93. The former of these contains a translation of De Wit’s report
                    upon the value of life annuities, which was prepared in consequence of the
                    resolution passed by the States General, on the 25th April 1671, to negotiate
                    funds by life annuities, and which was distributed to the members· on the 30th
                    July 1671. The latter contains the translation of a number of letters addressed
                    by De Wit to Burgomaster Johan Ξudde, bearing dates from September 1670 to
                    October 1671. The existence of De Wit’s report was well known among his
                    contemporaries, and Mr Hendriks has collected a number of extracts from various
                    authors referring to it; but the report is not contained in any collection of
                    his works extant, and had been entirely lost for 180 years, until Mr Hendriks
                    conceived the happy idea of searching for it among the state archives of
                    Holland, when it was found together with the letters to Hudde. It is a document
                    of extreme interest, and (notwithstanding some inaccuracies in the reasoning) of
                    very great merit, more especially considering that it was the very first
                    document on the subject that was ever written; and Mr Hendriks’s papers will
                    well repay a careful perusal.</p>
                <p>It appears that it had long been the practice in Holland for life annuities to be
                    granted to nominees of any age, in the constant proportion of double the rate of
                    interest allowed on stock; that is to say, if the towns were borrowing money at
                    6 per cent., they would be willing to grant a life annuity at 12 per cent.; if
                    at 5 per cent., the annuity granted was 10 per cent.; and so on. De Wit states
                    that “annuities have been sold, even in the present century, first at six years’
                    purchase, then at seven and eight; and that the majority of all life annuities
                    now current at the country’s expense were obtained at nine years’ purchase;” but
                    that the price had been increased in the course of a few years from eleven
                    years’ purchase to twelve, and from twelve to fourteen. He also states that the
                    rate of interest had been successively reduced from 6∣ to 5 per cent., and then
                    to 4 per cent. The principal object of his report is to prove that, taking
                    interest at 4 per cent., a life annuity was worth at least sixteen years’
                    purchase; and, in fact, that an annuitant purchasing an annuity for the life of
                    a young and healthy nominee at sixteen years’ purchase, made an excellent
                    bargain. It may be mentioned that he argues that it is more to the advantage,
                    both of the country and of the private investor, that the public loans should be
                    raised by way of grant of life annuities rather than perpetual annuities. It
                    appears conclusively from De Wit’s correspondence with Hudde, that the rate of
                    mortality assumed as the basis of his calculations was deduced from careful
                    examination of the mortality that had actually prevailed among the nominees on
                    whose lives annuities had been granted in former years. De Wit appears to have
                    come to the conclusion that the probability of death is the same in any
                    half-year from the age of 3 to 53 inclusive; that in the next ten years, from 53
                    to 63, the probability is greater in the ratio of 3 to 2; that in the next ten
                    years, from 63 to 73, it is greater in the ratio of 2 to 1; and in the next
                    seven years, from 73 to 80, it is . greater in the ratio of 3 to 1; and he
                    places thé limit of human life at 80. If a mortality table of the usual form is
                    deduced from these suppositions, out of 212 persons alive at the age of 3, 2
                    will die every year up to 53, 3 in each of the ten years from 53 to 63, 4 in
                    each of the next ten years from 63 to 73, and 6 in each of the next seven years
                    from 73 to 80, when all will be dead. This is the oonclusion we have drawn from
                    a careful study of the report; but, in consequence of the inaccuracies above
                    mentioned, some doubt exists as to De Wit’s real meaning; and Mr Hendriks’s
                    conclusion is somewhat different from ours (see his note, <hi rend="italic">Ass.
                        Mag.</hi> vol. ii. p. 246). The method of calculation employed by De Wit
                    differs much from that described above, and a short account of it may interest
                    the reader. Suppose that it were desired to apply it to deduce the value of an
                    annuity according to Deparcieux’s mortality table given above, then we assume
                    that annuities are bought on the lives of 1000 nominees each 3 years of age. Of
                    these nominees, 30 will die before attaining the age of 4, and no annuity
                    payment will be made in respect of them; 22 will die between the ages of 4 and
                    5, so that the holders of the annuities on their lives will receive payment for
                    1 year; 18 attain the age of 5 and die before 6, so that the annuities on their
                    lives are payable for 2 years. Reasoning in&lt;the same way, we see -that the
                    annuities on 15 of the nominees will be payable for 3 years; on 13, for 4 years;
                    on 12, for 5 years; on 10, for 6 years; and so on. Proceeding thus to the
                    extremity of the table, 2 nominees attain the age of 93, 1 of whom dies before
                    the age of 94, so that 90 annuity payments will be made in respect of him; and
                    the last survivor dies between the ages of 94 and 95, so that the annuity on his
                    life will be payable for 91 years. Having previously calculated a table of the
                    values of annuities certain for every number of years up to 91, the value of all
                    the annuities on the <pb break="no"

                    twenty-two times the value of an annuity for 1 year, eighteen times the value of
                    an annuity for 2 years, fifteen times the value of an annuity for 3 years, and
                    so on,—the last term being the value of 1 annuity for 91 years,—and adding them
                    together; and the value of an annuity on one of the nominees will then be found
                    by dividing by 1000. Before leaving the subject of De Wit, we may mention that
                    we find in the correspondence a distinct suggestion of the law of mortality that
                    bears the name of Demoivre. In De Wit’s letter, dated 27th October 1671 <hi
                        rend="italic">(Ass. Mag.,</hi> vol. iii. p. 107), he speaks of a
                    “provisional hypothesis” suggested by Hudde, that out of 80 young lives (who,
                    from the context, may be taken as of the age 6) about 1 dies annually. In
                    strictness, therefore, the law in question might be more correctly termed
                    Hudde’s than Demoivre’s.</p>
                <p>De Wit’s report being thus of the nature of an unpublished state paper, although
                    it contributed to its author’s reputation, did not contribute to advance the
                    exact knowledge of the subject; and the author to whom the credit must be given
                    of first showing how to calculate the value of an annuity on correct principles
                    is Dr Edmund Halley, F.R.S. In the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions,</hi> Nos. 196 and 198 (January and March 1693), he gave the
                    first approximately correct mortality table (deduced from the records of the
                    numbers of deaths and baptisms in the city of Breslau), and showed how it might
                    be employed to calculate the value of an annuity on the life of a nominee of any
                    age. His method of procedure exactly agrees with the formula (1) above given;
                    and while he confesses that it requires a series of laborious calculations, he
                    says that he had sought in vain for a more concise method. His papers, which are
                    full of interest, are reprinted in the eighteenth volume of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Assurance Magazine.</hi></p>
                <p>Previous to Halley’s time, and apparently for many years subsequently, all
                    dealings with life annuities were based upon mere conjectural estimates. The
                    earliest known reference to any estimate of the value of life annuities rose put
                    of the requirements of the Falcidian law, which (40 B.c.) was adopted in the
                    Roman empire, and which declared that a testator should not give more than
                    three-fourths of his property in legacies, so that at least one-fourth must go
                    to his legal representatives. It is easy to see how it would occasionally become
                    necessary, while this law was in force, to value life annuities charged upon a
                    testator’s estate. Aemilius Macer (230 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> states
                    that the method which had been in common use at that time was as follows :—From
                    the earliest age until 30 take 30 years’ purchase, and for each age after 30
                    deduct 1 year. It is obvious that no consideration of compound interest can have
                    entered into this estimate; and it is easy to see that it is equivalent to
                    assuming that all persons who attain the age of 30 will certainly live to the
                    age of 60, and then certainly die. Compared with this estimate, that which was
                    propounded by the Praetorian Prefect Ulpian— one of the most eminent
                    commentators on the Justinian Code—was a great improvement. His table is as
                    follows :—</p>

                <p>Here also we have no reason to suppose that the element of interest was taken
                    into consideration; and the assumption, that between the ages of 40 and 50 each
                    addition of a year to the nominee’s age diminishes the value of the annuity by
                    one year’s purchase, is equivalent to assuming that there is no probability of
                    the nominee dying between the ages of 40 and 50. Considered, however, simply as
                    a table of the average duration of life, the values are fairly accurate. At all
                    events, no more correct estimate appears to have been arrived at until the close
                    of the 17th century. Fuller information upon the early history of life annuities
                    will be found in the article “Annuities on Lives, History of,” in Mr Walford’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Insurance Cyclopaedia.</hi></p>
                <p>Demoivre, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Annuities,</hi> 1725, showed that
                    it was unnecessary to go through the whole of the calculation indicated by the
                    formula (1) or (2) for each age, and that the value of an annuity at any age
                    might be deduced by a simple process from that at the next older age. This may
                    be demonstrated as follows :—If it were certain that a person of any age, say
                    39, would live for a year, then the value of an annuity on his life would be
                    such a sum as would increase at interest in a year to the value of an annuity on
                    a life one year older, say 40, increased by a present payment of 1; that is,
                    putting <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for the value of an annuity and <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> α for that on a life one year older, the value
                    would be <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (1 + <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> α). But it
                    is uncertain that the life will exist to the end of a year, and the value of the
                    annuity must therefore be reduced in the proportion of this uncertainty, or be
                    multiplied by the probability that the given life will survive a year. Putting
                    then <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to denote this probability, we have <hi
                        rend="italic">a = υp</hi> (I + <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> α). This
                    formula may also be demonstrated algebraically. We have seen that <hi

                    he certainly showed that it is applicable to annuities on the joint duration of

                    how Gauss’s logarithmic table may be advantageously employed in calculating the
                    values of annuities by the above formula. That table gives us the value "of <pb

                    used (as recomputed and extended by Gray), “All the entries of the same
                    kind—direct and inverse—are brought together, the whole of the logarithms being
                    found before a single natural number is taken out. We consequently proceed right
                    through the table; and as we proceed, we find two, three, four, and even as many
                    as six and eight entries on the same opening. At the close, moreover, the taking
                    out of the numbers may, if necessary, be turned over to an assistant. On the
                    other hand, when the common tables are used, direct and inverse entries
                    alternate with each other, and involve likewise a continual turning of the
                    leaves backwards and forwards, by which the process is rendered exceedingly
                    irksome.”—Page 165, second issue, 1870.</p>
                <p>When the only object is to form a complete table of immediate annuities, the
                    above is the simplest and most expeditious mode of procedure; but when it is
                    desired to have the means of obtaining readily the values of deferred and
                    temporary annuities, it is better to employ a wholly different method.</p>
                <p>The value of a deferred annuity may be found as follows: —If it were certain that
                    the nominee, whose age is supposed to be now <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> would
                    survive <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years, so as to attain the age of <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">+ n,</hi> the value of the annuity on
                    his life being then <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                        x+n</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> its present value would be <hi
                        rend="italic">v*a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x+κ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >.</hi> But as the nominee may die before attaining the age of <hi
                        rend="italic">x + n,</hi> the above value must be multiplied by the
                    probability of his living to that age, which is , and we thus get the present
                    value of the deferred annuity, <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>. -y- <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi>. α <hi
                        rend="subscript"> x+n</hi>. We may arrive at this result otherwise. Thus, as
                    we have seen above, the present value of the first payment of the annuity, that
                    is, of 1 to be received if the nominee shall be alive at the end of ∙+ <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> i <hi rend="italic">n</hi> +1 years, is -γ-√* <hi

                    similarly seen to be — v <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> + <hi rend="superscript"

                <p>(We may here mention that this formula holds good, not only for ordinary
                    annuities, but also for annuities payable half-yearly or quarterly, and for
                    continuous annuities; also for complete annuities.)</p>
                <p>A temporary annuity is, as explained above, an annuity which is to continue for a
                    term of years provided the· nominee shall so long live. Hence it is clear that
                    if the value of a temporary annuity for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years is added
                    to that of an annuity on the same life deferred <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years,
                    this sum must be equal to an annuity for the whole Continuance of the same life;
                    the value of a temporary annuity for <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years will
                    therefore be equal to the difference between the value of a whole term annuity
                    and that of an annuity deferred <hi rend="italic">n</hi> years, or to <hi

                <p>We are now in a position to explain the method of calculating the value of
                    annuities above referred to. We have seen that the value of an annuity for the
                    life of a nominee whose age is <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> is k÷ιfl+⅛H-∑v <hi

                <p>It is convenient to arrange these results in a tabular form, as shown in the

                <p>If, for example, we wish to find the value of an annuity on a male life of 40
                    according to the English Table No. 3, with interest at 3 per cent., we find from
                    table (3) appended to this article, N <hi rend="subscript"> 40</hi> = 1374058, D

                <p>If we wish to find the value of this deferred annuity without using the D and N

                <p>We have, in conformity with popular usage, called our auxiliary table a “D and N

                        rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> xii. 328. His explanation of the term
                    is to the following effect :—Taking any two ages, say 30 and 40, we have,

                <p>Transpose the numbers opposite each age to the other age; then -whatever may be
                    the present age (less than 30)—</p>
                <p>A person might now give up &lt;£83,406, due at the age of 30, to receive
                    £125,464, if he live to be 40.</p>
                <p>A person might now give up an annuity of £1,374,058, to be granted at the age of
                    30, to receive in return another of £2,385,610 to be granted at the age of 40,
                    if he should live so long.</p>
                <p>“These proportions are independent of the present age of the party, and show that
                    the most simple indication of the tablée is the proportion in which a benefit
                    due at one age ought to be changed, so as to retain the same value and be due at
                    another age. They might, therefore, with great propriety, be called <hi

                <p>Before quitting this subject, we should mention that in practice other columns
                    are added to the table besides the D and N columns. A column, S, is given for
                    the purpose of calculating the values of increasing annuities; a column, M, for
                    calculating the values of assurances; and a column, R, for calculating the
                    values of increasing assurances. An explanation of the M column belongs to the
                    subject <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance;</hi> for an account of the S and R
                    columns, w e refer the reader to the works and papers on life insurance
                    contingencies, in which the D and N (or commutation) method is described;
                    particularly to those of David Jones, Gray, and De Morgan.</p>
                <p>The earliest known specimen of a commutation table is contained in William Dale’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of the Doctrine of
                        Annuities,</hi> published in 1772. A full account of this work is given by
                    Mr F. Hendriks in the second number of the <hi rend="italic">Assurance
                        Magazine,</hi> pp. 15—17. Dale s table, as there quoted, differs from the
                    one above described in that it commences only at the age of 50, and that he has
                    tabulated Zχ~ <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                        >l</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> x</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >.</hi> He says, “These calculations being made for the use of the societies
                    in particular who commence annuitants at the age of 50, it was not thought
                    necessary to begin the tables at a younger age.” He gives, however, another
                    table based on different mortality observations, commencing at the age of 40;
                    and in this case he tabulates Z <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> v <hi
                        rend="superscript"> x-40</hi>. His table also differs from the common form
                    in that it is adapted to find the values of annuities payable by half-yearly
                    instalments.</p>
                <p>The next work in which a commutation table is found is William Morgan’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Treatise on Assurances,</hi> 1779. In this work the values of
                        <hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">fv</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >~</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> are tabulated, and not n those
                    of <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >v</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> t</hi>; but, as
                    above mentioned, the properties of the table are not altered by the change.
                    Morgan gives the table as furnishing a convenient means of checking the
                    correctness of the values of annuities found by the ordinary process. It may be
                    assumed that he was aware that the table might be used for the direct
                    calculation of annuities; but he appears to have been ignorant of its other
                    uses.</p>
                <p>The first author who fully developed the powers of the table was John Nicholas
                    Tetens, a native of Schleswig, who in 1785, while professor of philosophy and
                    mathematics at Kiel, published in the German language an <hi rend="italic"
                        >Introduction to the Calculation of Life Annuities and Assurances.</hi> This
                    work appears to have been quite unknown in England until Mr F. Hendriks gave, in
                    the first number of the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> pp. 1-20
                    (Sept. 1850), an account of it, with a translation of the passages describing
                    the construction and use of the commutation table, and a sketch of the author’s
                    life and writings, to which we refer the reader who desires fuller
                    information.</p>
                <p>The use of the commutation table was independently developed in
                    England—apparently between the years 1788 and 1811—by George <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> Barrett, of Pet worth, Sussex, who was the son of
                    a yeoman farmer, and -was himself a village schoolmaster, and afterwards farm
                    steward or bailiff. .In the form of table employed by him, the quantity
                    tabulated is not <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >,</hi> but Z <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> (l <hi rend="italic">+i)</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> w</hi><hi rend="italic">~</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">v)</hi> is the last age in the mortality
                    table used. It has been usual to consider Barrett as the originator in this
                    country of the method of calculating the values of annuities by means of a
                    commutation table, and this method is accordingly sometimes called Barrett’s
                    method. (It is also called the commutation method and the columnar method.)
                    Barrett’s method of calculating annuities was explained by him to Francis Baily
                    in the year 1811, and was first made known to the world in a paper written by
                    the latter and read before the Royal Society in 1812.</p>
                <p>By what has been universally considered an unfortunate error of judgment, this
                    paper was not recommended by tho council of the Royal Society to be printed, but
                    it was given by Baily as an appendix to the second issue (in 1813) of his work
                    on life annuities and assurances. Barrett had calculated extensive tables, and
                    with Baily’s aid attempted to get them published by subscription, but without
                    success; and the only printed tables calculated according to his manner, besides
                    the specimen tables given by Baily, are the tables contained in Babbage’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Comparative View of the various Institutions for the Assurance
                        of Lives,</hi> 1826. It may be mentioned here that Tetens also gave only a
                    specimen table, apparently not imagining that persons using his work would find
                    it extremely useful to have a series of commutation tables, calculated and
                    printed ready for use.</p>
                <p>In the year 1825 Griffith Davies published his <hi rend="italic">Tables of Life
                        Contingencies,</hi> a work which contains, among other tables, two arrauged
                    on the plan we have above explained, the idea of them having been confessedly
                    derived from Baily’s explanation of Barrett's tables. The method was, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0091-0082"/> however, improved and extended by the
                    addition of the columns (M and R) for finding the values of assurances. Davies’s
                    treatise on annuities, as issued by his executors in 1855, with the explanation
                    that it is an uncompleted work, but that the completed portion had been in print
                    since 1825, contains several other tables of the same kind. In the preface to
                    this work it is stated that “the most important distinction between the two
                    methods is, that Mr Davies’s method is much simpler in principle than that of Mr
                    Barrett, as the columnar numbers given by the latter must be considered more as
                    the numerical results of algebraical expressions; whereas in Davies’s
                    arrangement it will be found, on reference to age 0, that the number in column D
                    represents the number of children just born, and those opposite ages 1, 2, 3, 4,
                    &amp;c., to the end of life, the present sums which would be required for the
                    payment of £1 to each survivor of such children at the end of 1, 2, 3, 4,
                    &amp;c., years to the extremity of life; and the sum thereof inserted in column
                    N, opposite age 0, represents the present fund required to provide the payment
                    of annuities of £1 each for life to all the children given in column D at age 0;
                    and from this method very considerable amount of labour is avoided by
                    multiplying the number living at each age by a fraction less than a unit; but by
                    Barrett’s method, the number living at each age has to be multiplied by the
                    amount of £1 improved for as many years as are equal to the difference between
                    that age and the greatest tabular duration, as already stated, which makes each
                    product a large multiple of the number living.” This passage, we are informed,
                    correctly represents Mr Davies’s own views on the subject. It may be noticed
                    that Davies does not employ the notation used above, D <hi rend="subscript">
                        x</hi>, N <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>, &lt;fcc., but omits the subscript
                        <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Thus, instead of the formula v? ⅛r he would
                    write</p>
                <p>N,- <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>-N <hi rend="subscript"> x+w</hi>- <hi
                        rend="subscript"> l</hi></p>
                <p>•N</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> i</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">-"N</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> i</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">*</hi></p>
                <p>In some respects this notation is perhaps preferable to that now used, as it is
                    certainly better, when there is no risk of confusion, to omit the subscript <hi
                        rend="italic">x.</hi> But Davies’s notation cannot be adopted without
                    alteration, as N <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> might be mistaken for the number
                    in the column N opposite the age 1. We may, however, consistently with the
                    principles of the notation adopted by the Institute of •N</p>
                <p>Actuaries, write the formula —==τ&lt;φ. The notation at <hi rend="superscript">
                        l</hi> NN</p>
                <p>present commonly used is due to David J ones, whose work (mentioned below) was
                    the first that contained an extensive series of commutation tables.</p>
                <p>On a general review of the whole evidence, we cannot help thinking that Barrett’s
                    merits in the matter have been somewhat exaggerated. The first idea of a
                    commutation table was not due to him, but (leaving Tetens out of view) to Dale
                    and Morgan; and it is certain that he was familiar with the latter’s treatise.
                    The change he introduced into the arrangement of the table, namely, multiplying
                    by a power of (1 + <hi rend="italic">ι)</hi> instead of by a power of <hi
                        rend="italic">v,</hi> is the reverse of an improvement; and accordingly, his
                    form of table has never been in practical use by any person but himself,
                    excepting only Babbage. It is, of course, not to be denied that great credit is
                    due to him as a self-educated man, for perceiving more clearly than his
                    predecessors the great usefulness of the commutation table; but in our opinion
                    he does not stand sufficiently out from those who preceded and followed him, to
                    justify the attempt to attach his name to the columnar method of calculating the
                    values of annuities and assurances. Those who desire to .obtain further
                    information on the matter, and to learn the views of other writers, can refer to

                <p>Very unfortunately, these tables are not all arranged upon the same principle,
                    but those contained in the Reports of the Registrar-General, in the <hi

                    are so arranged that the col umn N is shifted down one year, so that in them the

                <p>— <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> gives, not the value of the ordinary annuity,
                    but the •A-'X</p>
                <p>value of the annuity increased by unity, or the annuity-due. It is very needful
                    to bear this in mind <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the prevention of error; and the
                    existence of a difference of this kind is extremely perplexing. For information
                    upon the subject of this confusing change, see De Morgan’s paper “On the Forms
                    under which Barrett’s Method is represented, and on Changes of words and

                <p>All the preceding methods require a considerable amount of calculation in order
                    to obtain the value of an annuity on a life of any particular age. We will now
                    explain some methods of approximation, by means of which we can calculate with
                    much less labour the value of an annuity at <pb break="no"

                    complete table of annuities. The following method was demonstrated by Mr Lubbock
                    (afterwards Sir J. W. Lubbock) in a paper “On the Comparison of Various Tables
                    of Annuities” in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Philosophical Transactions</hi>
                    for the year 1829. Instead of calculating the value of each payment of the
                    annuity to be received at the ages <hi rend="italic">x +</hi> 1, <hi
                        rend="italic">x + 2,</hi> to the extremity of life, it will be sufficient to
                    calculate the values of the payments to be received at a series of equidistant
                    ages, say at the ages <hi rend="italic">x + n, x + 2n, x</hi> + 3n, Then, if V

                <p>As an example, we will apply this formula to calculate the value of an annuity on
                    a nominee of 40, according to the English Table, No. 3, Males, at 3 per cent,

                <p>Next, taking <hi rend="italic">n=ll,</hi> we have</p>

                <p>= 16∙4753.</p>
                <p>The value of the annuity calculated in the ordinary way is, as we have seen (page
                    80), 16 ∙4744.</p>
                <p>An improved form of this method was given by Mr W. S. B. Woolhouse in the Ass.
                        <hi rend="italic">Mag.,</hi> xi. 321. In order to explain this, we must
                    introduce the reader to a term which is of recent origin, but which the
                    application of improved mathematical methods to the science of life
                    contingencies has rendered of great importance— <hi rend="italic">the force of
                        mortality</hi> at a given age. This may be defined as the proportion of the
                    persons of that age who would die in the course of a year, if the intensity of
                    the mortality remained constant for a year, and the number of persons under
                    observation also remained constant, the places of those who die being constantly
                    replaced by fresh lives. More briefly, it is the instantaneous rate of
                    mortality. A very full explanation of this term is given by Mr W. Μ. Makeham, in
                    his paper “On the Law of Mortality,”Ass. <hi rend="italic">Mag.,</hi> xiii. 325.
                    The value of the function can be approximately found by dividing the number of
                    persons who die in a year by the number alive in the middle of the year. Thus,
                    if <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> denote the number
                    of persons living at the age <hi rend="italic">x, d</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> x</hi> the number dying between
                    the ages <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x+</hi> 1, and <hi
                        rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">
                        x</hi><hi rend="italic">~</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> the number
                    dying between the ages <hi rend="italic">x</hi>- 1 and <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    then the number dying between the ages a;-- and a; + - will be approximately and
                    the force of mortality is approximately</p>
                <p>Thus, in the English Table, No. 3, Males, the i r xi. <hi rend="subscript"> i
                        e</hi> ιu χ x&lt;n · 3465 + 3529</p>
                <p>value of the force of mortality at age 40 is - <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>- <hi
                        rend="subscript"> j</hi>-, √</p>
                <p>= 012853. <hi rend="superscript"> 544146</hi></p>
                <p>This quantity is usually denoted by the Greek letter <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi>
                    while δ is used to denote the quantity log <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> (l + i),
                    which Woolhouse has called the <hi rend="italic">force of discount.</hi> This
                    being premised, Woolhouse’s formula for the approximate value of an annuity is
                    n(V.+V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. + V <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>.+ . . .
                        <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> where it will be noticed that, since V <hi
                        rend="subscript"> o</hi> = 1, the two first terms are exactly equal in value
                    to those in Lubbock’s formula.</p>
                <p>Taking the same example as above, we have seen that ∕⅞ <hi rend="subscript">
                        0</hi> =O12853 also δ = Ό29558</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i0</hi> + δ =∙042411</p>
                <p>Making <hi rend="italic">n =</hi> 7, we have the value of the annuity</p>
                <p>= 16∙6437-4× Ό42411</p>
                <p>= 16*6437-Ί69644</p>
                <p>= 16∙4741.</p>
                <p>Making »=11, we have the value</p>
                <p>= 16*9009 -10 × Ό42411</p>
                <p>= 16 ’ 9009 - ’ 4241</p>
                <p>= 16*4768.</p>
                <p>Comparing the two processes, we see that when we have the valuee of <hi
                        rend="italic">μ</hi> and δ already computed, Woolhouse’s is decidedly the
                    shorter. On the other hand, it is easy to see that Lubbock’s formula applies,
                    not only to annuities, but to other benefits; and that it will be applicable to
                    find the values of such quantities as contingent annuities, the values of which
                    cannot be found exactly except by a very long series of calculations. (See
                    Davies, p. 354.) The reader who refers to Lubbock’s paper (which is reprinted in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ass. Mag.,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> n.</hi> 277),
                    or to the short account of it given in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on

                    with D. Jones’s work on annuities, will see that the terms involving Δ <hi

                    The above examples show that the formula, as now completed, is capable of giving
                    the values of annuities (and of course of other quantities) with very great
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>So long as we consider the annuity to be payable yearly, no allowance being made
                    for the time which elapses between the death of the nominee and the last
                    previous payment of the annuity, it is, as we have seen, a very simple problem
                    to calculate its value. But in practice annuities are generally payable by
                    half-yearly instalments, and it is the custom to pay a proportionate part of the
                    annuity for the odd time that elapses between the last half-yearly payment and
                    the death of the nominee; and the value found by the methods described above
                    therefore require to be corrected before they are strictly applicable in
                    practice. Approximate values of the necessary corrections are very easily found;
                    but the strict investigation of their correct values is a problem requiring a
                    considerable knowledge of the higher mathematics, and it would be quite beyond
                    our present purpose to consider it.</p>
                <p>When an annuity is payable half-yearly, the’common rule for finding its value is
                    to add ∙25, or a quarter of a year’s purchase, to the value of the annuity
                    payable yearly. When it is payable quarterly, *375 is added; and when by
                    instalments at <hi rend="italic">n</hi> equal periods throughout the year (or by
                    1 71—1</p>
                <p>--thly instalments), the addition is · The values thus found are sufficiently
                    correct for most purposes. More correct methods of finding the values of
                    annuities payable half-yearly, quarterly, &amp;c., are investigated in papers in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> by Woolhouse, xi. 327, and by
                    Sprague, xiii. 188, 201, 305. Some authors have assumed that when an annuity is
                    payable half-yearly, interest is also convertible half-yearly, overlooking the
                    circumstance that the true rate of interest is thereby changed, as we have
                    explained in the earlier part of this article. In fact, as we showed, 5 per
                    cent, interest convertible half-yearly is equivalent to a true rate of interest,
                    £5, Is. 3d. per cent. If, then, we have found the value of an annuity when
                    payable yearly at 5 per cent, interest, and require, perhaps, in the course of
                    the same investigation, the value of an annuity payable half-yearly, it is clear
                    that that value should be computed, not at <hi rend="italic">£5,</hi> Is. 3d.
                    per cent, interest, but at 5 per cent.; or if we prefer the rate £5, Is. 3d.,
                    then the value of the annuity payable yearly should also be calculated at that
                    rate.</p>
                <p>The approximate value of an annuity payable up to the day of the nominee’s death,
                    or of a “complete” annuity, as it is now usually called, is found in the case of
                    annuities payable yearly by adding to the value of the ordinary annuity the
                    valiιe of ⅜, payable at the instant of the nominee’s death; in the case of
                    half-yearly annuities, by adding the value of ∣; and in the case of quarterly
                    annuities, the value of ⅜, similarly payable. The more exact value of the
                    correction is investigated by Sprague, <hi rend="italic">Ass. Mag.,</hi> xiii.
                    358.</p>
                <p>The previous remarks refer almost exclusively to annuities which depend on the
                    continuance of one life, or to “single life annuities,” as they are commonly
                    called. But an annuity may depend on the continuance of two or three or more
                    lives. It may continue βo long as both of two nominees are alive, in which case
                    it is called an annuity on the joint lives; or it may continue as long as either
                    of them is alive, in which case it is called an annuity on the last survivor.
                    Again, if it depends on the existence of three nominees, it may .either continue
                    so long only as they are all three alive, when it is called an annuity on the
                    joint lives; or so long as any two of them continue alive, when it is called an
                    annuity on the last two survivors; or so long as any one of them is alive, when
                    it is called an annuity on the last survivor. In addition to these, we have
                    “reversionary” annuities, which are to commence on the failure of an assigned
                    life, and continue payable for the life of a specified nominee; or, more
                    generally, to commence on the failure of a given status, or combination of
                    lives, and continue payable during the existence of another status. There are
                    also “contingent” annuities, which depend on the order in which the lives
                    involved fail. Thus, we may have an annuity on the life of <hi rend="italic"
                        >X,</hi> to commence on the death of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> provided that
                    take place during the life of <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> and not otherwise, and
                    to continue payable during the remainder of the life of <hi rend="italic"
                        >x.</hi> Reversionary annuities are of considerable practical ini portance,
                    but contingent annuities are rarely met with. Lastly, we may mention annuities
                    on successive lives. These are of importance in the calculation of the values of
                    advowsons, and of fines on copy hold property. It does not fall within the scope
                    of this article to treat at any length of annuities on more than one life, and
                    we must refer the reader who wishes for further information with, regard to them
                    to the works of Baily, Davies, and David Jones, already mentioned, and Milne’s

                <p>The student who wishes to pursue the subject more thoroughly, and to become
                    acquainted with all the improvements in the theory of annuities that have been
                    introduced of late years, should carefully study the various articles
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Institute of Actuaries,</hi>
                    particularly those of Woolhouse and Makeham. The Institute was founded in the
                    year 1848, the first sessional meeting being held in January 1849. Its
                    establishment has contributed in various ways to promote the study of the theory
                    of life contingencies. Among these may be specified the following:— Before it
                    was formed, students of the subject worked for the most part alone, and without
                    any concert; and when any person had made an improvement in the theory, it had
                    little chance of becom ing publicly known unless he wrote a formal treatise on
                    the whole subject. But the formation of the Institute led to much greater
                    interchange of opinion among actuaries, and afforded them a ready means of
                    making known to their professional associates any improvements, real or
                    supposed, that they thought they had made. Again, the discussions which follow
                    the reading of papers before the Institute have often served, first, to bring
                    out into bold relief differences of opinion that were previously unsuspected,
                    and afterwards to soften down those differences,—to correct extreme opinions in
                    every direction, and to bring about a greater agreement of opinion on many
                    important subjects. In no way, probably, have the objects of the Institute been
                    so effectually advanced as by the publication of its <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journal.</hi> The first number of this work, which was originally called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> appeared in September 1850, and
                    it has been continued quarterly down to the present time. It was originated by
                    the public spirit of two well-known actuaries (Mr Charles Jellicoe and Mr Samuel
                    Brown), and was carried on by them for two years, we believe, at a considerable
                    loss. It was adopted as the organ of the Institute of Actuaries in the year
                    1852, and called the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine and Journal of the
                        Institute of Actuaries,</hi> Mr Jellicoe continuing to be the editor,—a post
                    he held until the year 1867, when he was succeeded by Mr Sprague. The name was
                    again changed in 1866, the words <hi rend="italic">“Assurance Magazine”</hi>
                    being dropped; but in the following year it was considered desirable to resume
                    these, for the purpose of showing the continuity cf the publication, and it is
                    now called the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Institute of Actuaries and
                        Assurance Magazine.</hi> This work contains not only the papers read before
                    the Institute (to which have been appended of late years short abstracts of the
                    discussions on them), and manv original papers which were unsuitable for
                    reading, together with correspondence, but also reprints of many papers
                    published elsewhere, which from various causes had become difficult of access to
                    the ordinary reader, among which may be specified various papers which
                    originally appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mechanics' Magazine,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Companion to the
                        Almanac;</hi> also translations of various papers from the French, German,
                    and Danish. Among the useful objects which the continuous publication of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the Institute has served, we may specify in
                    particular two :—that any supposed improvement in the theory was effectually
                    submitted to the criticisms of the whole actuarial profession, and its real
                    value speedily discovered; and that any real improvement, whether great or
                    small, being place! on record, successive writers have been able, one after the
                    other, tσ <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"

                    where the previous one had left off. The result has been, as stated above, that
                    great advances have lately been made in the theory. It may be truly said that
                    the recent advances and improvements in the theory of life contingencies have
                    rendered all the existing text-books antiquated; and until a new one shall be
                    produced, bringing the treatment of the subject down to the present time, a
                    complete knowledge of it can only be gained by a diligent study of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Journal of the Institute of Actuaries and Assurance
                        Magazine.</hi></p>
                <p>As intimated above, our remarks on annuities involving more than one life will be
                    very brief. The methods employed for the calculation of single life annuities
                    are easily extended to the case of joint life annuities. The fundamental
                    equation</p>
                <p>α=vp (l + <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> α)</p>
                <p>is true of annuities on two, three, or any number of joint lives, if we consider
                        <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to denote the probability that they will all
                    survive for one year; and <hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> the value of an annuity on the joint continuance of lives which are
                    severally one year older than those on which the required annuity depends. Thus
                    we have— <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> being the ages of the nominees—</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,⅛.⅛(i <hi rend="subscript"> +σ )(</hi></p>
                <p>; ≡ijp∙p <hi rend="subscript"> y</hi> (i+‰), and α,,, = <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic                     subscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic"

                        1</hi> c⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>).</p>
                <p>The columnar method of calculating annuities admits also of being extended to
                    annuities on joint lives. In the extensive tables contained in D. Jones’s
                    work,</p>
                <p>D <hi rend="subscript"> zj</hi>, <hi rend="italic">lj&gt;</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     subscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">y</hi> being the older of the two ages, and N <hi
                        rend="subscript"> zy</hi> = <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 1</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">D</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> jcj</hi><hi
                        rend="smallcaps">,</hi> + <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> D <hi
                        rend="subscript"> zy</hi> + <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> D <hi
                        rend="subscript"> zy</hi> + , where *D <hi rend="subscript"> zy</hi> is used
                    to denote D <hi rend="subscript"> x+n</hi>. <hi rend="subscript"> y+w</hi>.</p>
                <p>An improved form of the table was suggested by De Morgan, according to which we
                    should have D <hi rend="subscript"> zj</hi>, = »+y <hi rend="italic">lf</hi><hi
                        rend="italic subscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                        rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >.</hi> This would simplify the formulas for the values of contingent
                    annuities, but no tables have as yet been published calculated on this
                    principle. The same method might be extended to three lives, in which case the
                    most advantageous form would be D <hi rend="subscript"> xy</hi>, = <hi
                        rend="italic">lf,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >l,v</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> 3</hi>; but the
                    extent of the tables when three lives are involved renders it extremely
                    improbable that such will ever be published. The practical construction of a D
                    and N table for joint lives has been considered by Gray, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In dealing with annuities in which three lives are involved, we are met by the
                    difficulty that no tables exist in which the values of such annuities are given
                    to the extent required in practice. Such tables as those computed for the
                    Carlisle 3 per cent, table by Herschel Filipowski are of too limited extent to
                    be of any practical utility; for the values being given only for certain ages
                    differing by multiples of five years, a considerable amount of labour is
                    required to deduce the values for other ages. When, therefore, ∙we desire to
                    find the value of an annuity on the joint lives of say <hi rend="italic">x,
                        y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> it is usual to take the two oldest of

                    would be strictly accurate, if the mortality followed the law known as
                    Gompertz’s; that is to say, if the number of persons living according to the
                    mortality table at any age, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> could be represented by
                    means of the formula <hi rend="italic">dg∕</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1825, that by giving suitable values to
                    the constants, the above formula might be made to represent correctly the number
                    living during a considerable portion of life, say from age 10 to 60; but in
                    order to represent by the same formula the numbers living at higher ages, it is
                    necessary to give fresh values to the constants; and the discontinuity thence
                    resulting has always been a fatal obstacle to the practical use of the formula.
                    It has, however, from its theoretical interest, attracted a great deal of
                    attention from actuaries; and numerous papers on the subject will be found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Assurance Magazine.</hi> A claim to the independent (if
                    not prior) discovery of the formula has been put forward by Mr T. R. Edmonds;
                    but this claim, respecting which many communications will be found in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Assurance Magazine,</hi> is generally repudiated by competent
                    judges. De Morgan further showed <hi rend="smallcaps">(Am.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Mag.,</hi> viii. 181) that if the above property holds good, or <hi

                    gave independently a simple algebraical demonstration of the same property, x.
                    121. Makeham removed the above mentioned objection to Gompertz’s formula by
                    introducing another factor, and showed <hi rend="italic">(Ass. Mag.,</hi> xii
                    315) that the formula <hi rend="italic">dgi</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                        x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">*</hi> will
                    correctly represent the number living at any age <hi rend="italic">x</hi> from
                    about the age of 15 upwards to the extremity of life; and this formula has been
                    found very serviceable for certain purposes.</p>
                <p>The fact that Gompertz’s law does not correctly represent the mortality
                    throughout the whole of life, proves that the above-described practical method
                    of finding the value of an annuity on three joint lives is accurate only in
                    certain cases. Makeham has shown (Ass. <hi rend="italic">Mag.,</hi> ix. 361, and
                    xiii. 355) that when the mortality follows the law indicated by his modification
                    of Gompertz’s formula, the value of an annuity on two, three, or any number of
                    joint lives, can be readily found by means of tables of very moderate extent.
                    Thus the value of an annuity on any two joint lives can be deduced from the
                    value of an annuity at the same rate of interest on two joint lives of equal
                    ages; the value of an annuity on any three joint lives, by means of a table of
                    the values of annuities on three joint lives of equal ages; and so on; and
                    Woolhouse has shown (vol. XV. p. 401) how the values of annuities on any number
                    of joint lives, at any required rate of interest, can be found by means of
                    tables of the values of annuities on a single life at various rates of interest.
                    These methods, we believe, have not hitherto been practically employed to any
                    extent by actuaries, and it would perhaps be premature to say which of them is
                    preferable.</p>
                <p>As the reader will have observed, neither Gompertz’s nor Makeham’s formula
                    represents correctly the rate of mortality for very young ages. Various formulas
                    have been given which are capable of representing with sufficient accuracy the
                    number living at any age from birth to extreme old age, but they are all so
                    complicated that they are of little more than theoretical interest. They are,
                    however, likely to prove of increasing value in the problem of adjusting (or
                    graduating) a table of mortality deduced from observations,—an important
                    subject, which does not fall within the scope of this article. We may mention in
                    particular those given by Lazarus in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Mortalitätsverhältnisse und ihre Ursache</hi><hi rend="italic">{Rates of

                <p>The employment of formulas such as those given in the last paragraph, and the
                    application of the differential calculusfto the theory of life contingencies,
                    have naturally led to an improvement in the theory which is probably destined to
                    become of very great importance—we refer to the introduction of the idea of
                    “continuous” annuities and assurances. If the intervals at which an annuity is
                    payable are supposed to become more and more frequent, until we come to the
                    limit when each payment of the annuity is made momently as it accrues, the
                    annuity is called continuous. Strictly speaking, of course, this is an
                    impossible supposition as regards actual practice; but if an annuity were
                    payable by daily instalments, its value would not differ appreciably from that
                    of a continuous annuity; and if the annuity be paid weekly, the difference will
                    be so small that it may be always safely neglected. The theory of continuous
                    annuities has been fully developed by Woolhouse <hi rend="italic">(Ass.
                        Mag.,</hi> xv. 95). Assuming the number living in the mortality table at any

                        rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> must be a function
                    that is never negative for positive values of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> and as

                    will be noticed here that the superior limit of the integral is ∞. This is
                    necessary if <hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> is a
                    continuous mathematical function; for in that case, however large <hi

                        rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> will never become absolutely zero. Makeham

                        rend="italic">9</hi> given (pp. 312-327) a table, by means of which the
                    value of the annuity can be found when the values of <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> are known. This table requires a double
                    interpolation, and is therefore rather troublesome to use. Mr Emory M‘Clintock
                    has shown in the eighteenth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Assurance
                        Magazine,</hi> how the value of an annuity may be found by means of the
                    ordinary tables of the gammafunction. As Lazarus has pointed out in his
                    above-mentioned paper, when mortality tables are given in the ordinary form, it
                    is difficult to compare them and define precisely their differences; but if they
                    can be accurately represented by a formula containing only a few constants, it
                    becomes easy to show wherein one table differs from another; and the methods of
                    Makeham and M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clintock enable us to compare the
                    values of annuities, for any ages desired, according to different tables as
                    determined by such constants, without the labour of computing the mortality
                    tables in the usual form. They can therefore scarcely fail to grow in popularity
                    as they become better known.</p>
                <p>The principal application of the theory of life annuities is found in life
                    insurance. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance.)</hi> At the present time there
                    are upwards of one hundred companies of various kinds transacting the business
                    of life insurance in the United Kingdom. It is only since the passing of the
                    Life Assurance Companies Act, 1870, that it has been possible to form an
                    accurate estimate of the extent of the business transacted by these companies;
                    but, from the returns made under that Act, it appears that the total assets of
                    the companies amount to about £110,000,000, which are invested so as to produce
                    an annual income of about £4,000,000, and that the total premiums received
                    annually for insurance amount to about £10,000,000. There is no means at present
                    of saying exactly what is the total sum assured; but it is probably about £330
                    000.000, the average premium <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n96/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0096-0087"/> for insurance being about 3 per cent, per
                    annum. Theactual transactions at the present time in the purchase and grant of
                    immediate annuities, although small in comparison with the life insurance
                    transactions, are yet of considerable amount. It appears from the returns made
                    under the above-mentioned Act, that upwards of £250,000 is annually paid to
                    insurance companies for the purchase of annuities, and that the aggregate amount
                    of their liabilities under that head is nearly £420,000 a year. The Government
                    competes with the companies in the grant of annuities; and although its terms
                    are on the whole very much less favourable than the companies’, still in
                    consequence of the greater security offered, the business transacted by the
                    Government is much in excess of that transacted by the whole of the insurance
                    companies. It appears from recent returns (see Ass. <hi rend="italic">Mag.,</hi>
                    xv. 23), that the life annuities annually paid by the National Debt Office
                    amount to about £1,000,000, and that about £600,000 is on the average annually
                    invested with the Government for the purchase of fresh annuities. The purchase
                    and grant of life annuities have been carried on to a very considerable extent,
                    apparently at all times. We learn from De Wit’s above-mentioned report, that the
                    Governments of Holland and West Friesland had granted annuities systematically
                    for one hundred and fifty years before any correct estimate was formed of the
                    value of a life annuity. The British Government has at various times granted
                    life annuities, more especially on the Tontine principle, for the purpose of
                    raising money when it was difficult to obtain the sums required for the public
                    service by the ordinary methods. Various local bodies have at different times
                    raised money on the security of the local rates in consideration of the grant of
                    life annuities; and, at the present tiιhe, the Manchester Corporation grants
                    annuities on favourable terms for the purpose of obtaining funds to defray the
                    expense of the waterworks belonging to the city. During the existence of the
                    usury laws, it was very common for persons borrowing money upon the very best
                    security to grant annuities upon their lives in consideration of a present
                    advance. Thus, for example, if a country gentleman of the age of 40 wished to
                    borrow £10,000 upon a landed estate, the law forbade him to pay, or the lender
                    to receive, more than 5 per cent, interest, say £500 a year; but the law did not
                    forbid his granting an annuity of £1000 for his life, secured upon the estate.
                    Speaking roughly, an annual payment of £300 would be required to insure £10,000
                    upon the borrower’s life, and the annuity would therefore return the lender
                    about 7 per cent, interest, in addition to the premium on the insurance
                    necessary to return his capital. In this way the law, which was intended as a
                    protection to the borrower, to enable him to obtain a loan at a fixed moderate
                    rate of interest, very often had the directly opposite effect of greatly
                    increasing the cost of borrowing. The usury laws being now repealed, borrowers
                    and lenders are left at full Eberty to make such terms with each other as they
                    may think best. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">b. s.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
