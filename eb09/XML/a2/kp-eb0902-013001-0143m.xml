                <p><label type="entry">ANTINOMY</label> is the word employed by Kant, m the Critical
                    Philosophy, to mark the inevitable conflict or contradiction into which,
                    according to his view, speculative reason falls with itself, when it seeks to
                    conceive the complex of external phenomena, or nature, as a world or cosmos.
                    Literally the word means a conflict or opposition of laws <hi rend="italic"
                    >(</hi><hi rend="italic">Widerstreit der Gesetze).</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi><hi rend="italic">It</hi> is used by Kant both in a generic and in a
                    specific sense; the fate that lies upon the speculative endeavour of human
                    reason taking the form of four special contradictions. For the generic sense
                    Kant also has the word Antithetic, each antinomy being set forth in the shape of
                    thesis and antithesis, with corresponding demonstrations, the perfect validity
                    of which, in all cases, he most positively guarantees. The conflicting
                    propositions, or the cosmological ideas involved in them, are intimately, though
                    somewhat obscurely, related to the four heads of categories of the understanding
                    in the Kantian system, but this is not the place to enter into such details.
                    Expressed in the shortest form, the theses run thus :—The world (1) is limited
                    in space and time, (2) consists of parts that are simple, (3) includes causality
                    through freedom, (4) implies the existence of an absolutely necessary being. To
                    these answer the antitheses :—The world (1) is without limits in space or time,
                    (2) consists of parts always composite, (3) includes no causality but that of
                    natural law, (4) implies the existence of no absolutely necessary being. The
                    theses were taken by Kant from the speculative cosmology of the Wolffian school;
                    the antitheses are the not less dogmatic assertions made or suggested by
                    empirical thinkers. Since, according to Kant, equally valid arguments can be
                    adduced on each side, while, as mutually contradictory in their dogmatic sense,
                    the two sets of propositions cannot both be true, it is plain that reason must
                    have gone beyond its powers in seeking for a speculative knowledge of that which
                    can be given in no experience. But the function of a true philosophy does not
                    stop short with the detection of this internal strife of speculative reason; the
                    strife must be composed, and Kant^holds that none but his own critical doctrine
                    is equal to the task. The first two antinomies he overcomes by showing that
                    theses and antitheses, when critically understood of mere phenomena, are both
                    alike false; the others, by showing that the opposed members, when understood,
                    again critically, of noümena and phenomena respectively, may both be true. This
                    amounts to saying, that in neither of the two sets of cases (though in different
                    -ways) is the contradiction real, however really it has been intended by the
                    opposing partizans, or must appear to the mind without critical enlightenment.
                    It is wrong, therefore, to impute to Kant, as is often done, the view that human
                    reason is, on ultimate subjects, at war with itself, in the sense of being
                    impelled by equally strong arguments towards alternatives contradictory of each
                    other. Hamilton’s Law of the Conditioned—that all positive knowledge lies
                    between two extremes, neither of which we can conceive as possible, but yet, as
                    mutual contradictories, the one or other of which we must recognise as
                    necessary—while suggested by the Kantian doctrine of the Antinomy of Pure
                    Reason, is distinctly at variance with it. In the realm of phenomenal
                    experience, actual or possible, when it is properly conceived, Kant allows of no
                    conflict; and, though he denies that we can have speculative knowledge of a
                    realm transcending experience, he is satisfied of this at least, that knowledge
                    of the one realm may go forward without prejudice to moral conviction of
                    another. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. c. r.)</hi></p>
