                <p>THE art of angling, or of catching fish by a rod and line, is of very ancient
                    derivation. The earliest writer upon it in our country was the Dame Juliana
                    Berners, who wrote a treatise on it in the <hi rend="italic">Book of St
                    Albans,</hi> printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1496. Between that time and the
                    present there have been nearly a thousand books, or parts of books, written and
                    published upon this subject.</p>
                <p>The practice of angling may be arranged under three heads, viz., top or surface,
                    mid-water, and bottom angling. Surface angling includes fishing with an
                    artificial fly, or duping with a live fly or other insect; mid-water fishing
                    includes spinning or trolling with a dead bait and fishing with a live bait;
                    bottom fishing includes angling with worms and other baits, either resting on or
                    travailing with the stream along the bottom. The last is usually the first
                    practised by the angler, and we will therefore take it first.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bottom Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>The school-boy who comes home for the midsummer holidays, usually commences his
                    apprenticeship to the art of angling by fishing for some of the carp tribe in
                    some pond or river near his residence. For this purpose he provides himself with
                    a rod usually of from 12 to 14 feet long, and generally made of bamboo-cane,
                    which is the best for the purpose. A small reel, with 30 or 40 yards of silk
                    line, a light quill float, a yard or two of fine silk-worm gut, and a hook tied
                    on at the end of it, which for general work should be either Nos. 6, 7, 8, or 9
                    in size, and a few split shots pinched on the line for sinkers. He then plumbs
                    the depth of the water by the aid of a plummet, and fixes his float on the line
                    at such a depth that the hook barely or just touches the bottom. His chief baits
                    are worms and gentles or maggots. The worm (the reddest are the best) is stuck
                    on the hook by being threaded from head nearly to the tail. The gentles, to the
                    number of two or three, being stuck on as may be convenient. For gentles the
                    smaller hooks are used; and the hook being baited, is cast into the water and
                    hangs suspended by the float. When there is a bite the float bobs under, and the
                    angler jerks the rod up or strikes, hooks his fish, and, if a big one, plays
                    it,—that is, allows it to swim violently about until tired,—when he draws it
                    ashore and lands it. In still-water fishing for carp, tench, roach, &amp;c., the
                    angler uses now and then a handful of what is termed groundbait to draw the fish
                    round his hook. There are many substances used for this,—worms, gentles, grains,
                    boiled barley or wheat, &lt;fcc., &amp;c.,—but the best and most general is a
                    mixture of bran, soaked bread, and a little boiled rice worked up together; if
                    with this is mixed a few handfuls of carrion gentles, usually obtained from
                    horse slaughteryards, there is no better bait. To ensure sport it is often
                    necessary to bait a spot, or pitch, as it is termed, one or two evenings
                    previously. In still-water fishing this is all that has to be done. In bottom
                    fishing in running water the same preliminaries are observed in taking the depth
                    of the water, baiting, &lt;fcc.; but when the tackle is dropped into the water
                    the stream carries it along, and the angler, keeping the top of his rod over his
                    float·, follows it down his swim, as it is called, until he reaches the end, or
                    as far as he desires to fish, when he pulls his tackle out, and returns to the
                    head of the swim, and recommences striking at every bob or dip of his float. In
                    stream fishing he must either cast his ground-bait in so far up stream that it
                    will find bottom in his swim, or he must knead it into balls with a stone in the
                    middle or mixed with clay, so as to sink it to the bottom at once. In choosing a
                    swim on the banks of a river, if the angler cannot see a good stock of fish
                    anywhere, he should choose some spot which fish may be supposed to haunt,—a
                    spreading root, or bough, or overhanging bank with a hole under it, a deep hole
                    near banks of weeds, or a deep eddy off some sharp stream. Here the bottom
                    should be pretty level and free from obstructions, and the stream not too swift
                    nor too slow, so that the float may travel steadily and evenly without
                    hinderance throughout. If he cannot decide on any spot, let him look along the
                    bank for places worn by the angler’s feet, or where <hi rend="italic"
                    >debris</hi> of bran, &lt;fcc., points out that some angler has previously
                    fished and baited the stream. Having baited a pitch one day, it should never be
                    neglected on the next, as the fish will have had time to find out the bait, and
                    will perhaps be collected together there. Of course the choice of a pitch will
                    be guided very much by the species of fish the angler desires to fish for. The
                    places they frequent are noted hereafter. When the angler has hooked a big fish
                    which he cannot lift out without danger to tackle, he uses a landing-net, that
                    is, a bag-net on an iron ring fastened to the end of a pole, which he slips
                    under the tired fish and lifts securely to the bank. When fishing on a river
                    bank the last words in Walton’s <hi rend="italic">Complete Angler</hi> are to be
                    strictly observed, viz., “Study to be quiet,” for violent disturbance or motion
                    is fatal to sport. Having deliberately chosen a pitch and baited it, the angler
                    should not desert it hastily, or if he leaves it for a time for another, he
                    should return to it and give it another trial. In angling from a punt or boat a
                    shorter rod is used than from the bank, from 10 tα 12 feet being the limit. In
                    the Thames plan the punt or flat-bottomed boat is fixed directly across the
                    stream by means of two iron-shod poles which are driven into the bottom. The
                    depth being taken, and the ground-bait thrown in, the angler, sitting with his
                    face down stream* drops his tackle in close to the boat, and allows it to float
                    down stream unchecked as far as the line, which is generally a yard or two
                    longer than the rod, will permit, when he strikes, pulls up the tackle, drops it
                    again in close to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n42/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0042-0033"/> punt, and repeats the operation time after time.
                    In the middle of these punts there is generally a well, so that the fish when
                    caught are kept alive in the well until the day’s fishing is over. On the Trent
                    the method adopted is different. The punt or boat, if used at all, is fixed
                    diagonally and not directly across the stream. A very fine and light silk line
                    is employed, which will float easily and does not sink much at any time. A very
                    easy-going reel or winch is used, which turning on an oiled spindle lets off the
                    line very rapidly, and is set running with the lightest touch of the finger. The
                    rod being held at an angle of 90°, the line is allowed to run freely, until the
                    float and bait go sometimes as far as 50 or 60 yards down the stream,—a plan
                    which has many advantages, as much more ground is covered than in the restricted
                    swim of the Thames method, and the fish are less shy in biting so far from the
                    boat. The ground-bait is usually thrown in loosely above the punt, and generally
                    consists of chopped worms or greaves (tallow-melters’ refuse), and as the swim
                    is so long an one the ground-bait is certain to fetch the bottom somewhere
                    within it. In Norfolk a different plan still is adopted. The punt is anchored
                    lengthwise straight up and down, and the anglers fish on either side of it; but
                    the water being usually very deep the rods are longer and the tackle heavier,
                    and besides the moving float they have another rod, the tackle to which is so
                    heavily weighted that the baited hook rests on the bottom, and is not to be
                    moved by the stream—the fish picking up the bait at leisure, and the float
                    showing the bite. This is termed “tight corking.” These are the chief methods
                    employed in float fishing at the bottom. But other methods of fishing with a
                    stationary bait without a float are often adopted. The ledger is the chief of
                    these (see fig. 1 in the cut). This consists of a gut line a yard or two long,
                    which runs through a bullet or a lump of lead pierced with a round hole. On the
                    hook side of the line an obstruction is fastened so that the lead cannot slip
                    down to the hook, but the line is free on the rod side of the lead. The hook
                    being baited, the lead is dropped into the water and rests on the bottom, a
                    tight line between the rod top and the lead being kept. The instant a fish bites
                    at the hook, the line being free in that direction, it is felt at the rod top,
                    and the angler, yielding a little line to let the fish get the bait and hook
                    well in his mouth, strikes, lifting the lead, and so hooks the fish. Another
                    method, called the clay-ball, is to tie a bit of stick across the line a little
                    above the hook, which is baited with gentles and greaves, and then to weld a
                    lump of clay and ground-bait on the line round about the bit of stick. This is
                    dropped to the bottom, and the fish, attracted by the ball of bait, come up to
                    devour, and in time find the baited hook and take it most unsuspectingly.
                    Sometimes the baited hook is buried in the ball of bait, and the fish are
                    allowed to dig it out. Sometimes a float is used in conjunction with a small
                    clay ball to show the bites. Another plan of bait fishing at the bottom is with
                    a free line, with only a very light sinker of a split shot or two on the line.
                    The hook is baited with a worm, and allowed to travel along the bottom, the bite
                    being felt or seen in the action of the line on the water or the rod top. This
                    is chiefly employed in trout fishing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mid-Water Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>Spinning is the first branch of this kind of fishing, and is used chiefly for
                    pike and trout, though salmon and other fish occasionally are fished for and
                    taken thus. It consists in drawing along through mid-water a bait so <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n43/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0043-0034"/> disposed on a series of h00k3 as to revolve
                    rapidly, thus showing its silvery sides constantly to the fish of prey, and
                    attracting them to run after it and capture it, when the hooks which are about
                    it in turn capture them. A small fish— <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> little
                    trout, dace, gudgeon, or bleak principally, as these are the best fish for the
                    purpose—is hung on a range of hooks called a flight. This flight generally or
                    mostly consists of three triangles, or three hooks welded back to back, tied
                    upon gut or gimp at intervals of half an inch or so, a reversed hook near the
                    tail to keep it bent, and above them a sliding hook working in an eye, called
                    the lip hook (see fig. 2 in cut). A fish is then chosen suitable to the length
                    of the flight, the lowest triangle is stuck on the middle of the side of the
                    tail, the reversed hook just above it is then stuck into the fish a little below
                    the vent, so as to keep the tail of the fish bent or crooked. The other two
                    triangles are then stuck into the side of the bait in a straight line towards
                    the fish’s mouth. The line is then twisted two or three times round the shank of
                    the lip hook, so as to bring it just to the bait’s mouth and to keep it firmly
                    there. The hook is then passed through both lips of the bait, and the bait is
                    ready for use (see fig. 3 in cut); then it is hung on to a tackle called the
                    trace. This consists of a yard or two of gut, single or twisted, or gimp, as may
                    be desired; and at intervals of 18 or 20 inches or so, one or more swivels are
                    placed to permit the bait to revolve freely without also turning the line, which
                    would cause the whole running line to snarl and tangle, and a lead or sinker, so
                    disposed as to promote the same object, is put on just above the swivels, and
                    the trace is complete. (The upper part of the tackle in fig. 3 from swivel to
                    swivel shows the trace). The whole apparatus then being looped on to the main or
                    reel-line, is dtopped into the water, and being drawn rapidly through it, if the
                    bait be properly arranged on the hooks, spins with wonderful swiftness, often
                    like one long line of flashing silver. If it does not spin well, but “wobbles,”
                    as it is termed, the hooks are not properly fastened into the bait, and either
                    do not lie straight and even along the side, or the head or tail of the bait is
                    too slack or too tight. This must be amended as the bait cannot spin too well.
                    The object of its spinning well is not only to attract the fish, but to conceal
                    the hooks. The arrangement of the hooks on the flight given above is the one
                    most commonly adopted by Thames spinners, who are the best hands in this branch
                    of fishing, but there are many other arrangements which are sold by
                    tackle-makers, of which the Francis and Pennell tackles are perhaps the chief.
                    The reel-line used in spinning is usually made of plaited silk, dressed with a
                    composition to stiffen it and to prevent tangling; and the line is heavier or
                    lighter according as the bait and tackle to be used is heavier or lighter. In
                    working a spinning-bait, the angler first tries all the nearer water to the spot
                    where he stands, and gradually lengthens his line, allowing it to lie loose on
                    the ground, or in the boat or punt’s bottom, in coils at his feet Then with
                    about half as much line as the length of rod hanging down from the rod point, he
                    gently waves the bait backwards to the left or right, according to the side he
                    wishes to cast to, and then suddenly urging the rod forward with a sweep,
                    releases the running line which he has held fast against the rod, and the
                    impetus the bait has acquired by the swing sends it forward from 20 to 40 yards
                    towards the point the angler desires to cast to; then lowering the point cf the
                    rod to allow the bait to sink to mid-water, he holds the rod in the right hand,
                    and draws the line home through the rings with the left hand, allowing it to
                    fall at his feet as before, and raising and dipping the rod at every draw, makes
                    the bait spin and shoot, and rise and fall, as it comes towards him, in a most
                    attractive manner. The line being all drawn in, lies at his feet as before, and
                    lifting the bait out of the water again, he repeats his cast in a new direction,
                    and having fished all the water within reach he moves on. Should a fish run he
                    feels a jerk at the: rod point, or sees the line stop, and he strikes smartly
                    and plays his fish, drawing in line by hand, and taking care that no tangle
                    ensues. To avoid this at any time, he must see that there are no twigs or other
                    obstructions about his. feet where the line rests between each cast, which may
                    catch in the coils and cause a snarl or knot, as this spoils the cast by
                    preventing the line from running. In trout spinning smaller and lighter tackles,
                    rods, and lines are used than are employed for jack. For the big Thames trout,
                    and for trailing for the great lake trout, similar fashioned but lighter flights
                    and traces are employed; but for spinning the minnow for small river or brook
                    trout a different kind of flight is used. This flight is shown unbaited and
                    baited at figs. 4 and 5 in the cut. The big hook is inserted into the mouth of
                    the minnow, and by a little humouring the point is carried down the body along
                    the back-bone to the tail, where it is brought out, and the lip hook inserted
                    through both lips of the bait; and, if any attention has been paid to the size
                    of the minnow selected, the tail will be nicely bent round on the curve of the
                    hook so as to make the bait spin rapidly. Many anglers do not use any other
                    hooks than these two; but it is so easy for a trout to run and seize such a bait
                    and to miss being hooked, that to make sure, it is usual to employ in addition
                    the: little triangle of hooks, which is inserted half way down the side of the
                    bait. Even with this safeguard, when fish are running shyly, the angler will
                    find that he misses-from one-third to one-half of the runs which he gets. In
                    spinning for small trout various methods are pursued: some fish down stream,
                    some up; and where it is requisite: to wade, and a moderate rod is used, it is
                    best to fish up, wading in mid-stream, and casting on either hand towards-the
                    opposite banks, the angler brings the bait diagonally down towards him, with a
                    curving sweep in front. When, however, he can fish from the bank, it is best to
                    fish down, and to cast across, drawing with a diagonal sweep up stream. Usually
                    it is just as the bait is making the bend round that the fish seizes it, and
                    therefore it behoves the angler to keep a sharp look out then. Some anglers cast
                    the minnow over hand, and some under; the best plan is to cast it under, and,
                    taking hold of the reel-line between two of the rings on the middle joint of the
                    rod with the left hand, to draw a good portion of line off the reel, holding it
                    tight until the cast is made, when it is released, and doubles the length of
                    cast which the angler could make in the ordinary way,—as in minnow fishing the
                    tackle is too light, as a rule, to cast off loose line from coils on the ground,
                    and so, ordinarily, little more line than a yard or so more than the length of
                    the rod can be used; by this means, however, nearly double that length can be
                    get out. Of course the weight or sinkers on a minnow tackle will be
                    proportionate to the requirements of the stream, and though, the trace will be
                    of lighter gut than it is customary to use. for large trout, the fashion of the
                    tackle is similar. In this case, also, there are many other arrangements of
                    hooks used, but there are none so good as the one figured in the plate. In the
                    north there is another method of spinning practised, called par-tail fishing,
                    which is used chiefly when and where minnows are difficult to obtain, though
                    some persons prefer par-tail as a bait to minnow. For this only two hooks are
                    used similar to the two in the figure for minnowfishing, minus the triangle. A
                    par is taken and cut diagonally in two from the front part of the dorsal fin to
                    the middle of the space between the ventral and anal fins, The tail part being
                    taken, and the tail snipped off, the lip hook is put through the root of the
                    tail, and the big hook stuck into the bait so as to curve the broad end of the
                    bait <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0044-0035"/> on to the hook; the bait, if properly adjusted,
                    spins pretty well. Some anglers, however, cut a slice out of the back from
                    before the dorsal fin down to the tail, leaving a small part of the tail and
                    only part of the belly, and by adjusting this on hooks suited to it, it rather
                    more resembles the natural fish. These baits are used exactly like the
                    minnow.</p>
                <p>In fishing for larger trout, as the large lake trout or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmo ferox,</hi> the method generally adopted is that of trailing. Here a
                    small trout or par is used on the three-triangle tackle already mentioned above.
                    The line is weighted according to the depth of the water, and the boat is rowed
                    slowly along, some 30 or 40 yards of line being let out, so as to permit the
                    bait to sink and to tow some distance astern. Two rods are chiefly employed for
                    this sport—one being placed at each corner of the stern of the boat, and each
                    having on a different bait, weighted differently, and with a longer or shorter
                    line out, so as to give any fish inclined to feed a double chance. The proper
                    fine to take for these large trout when moving along the shores of a lake is
                    just where the water begins to go off between the deep and the shallow; and the
                    bait should travel as near to the bottom as it can, without catching in weeds or
                    stumps; as, though fish will frequently rise some distance to a bait, it is not
                    desirable to compel them to do so. When a big lake trout strikes, he usually
                    runs heavily, and bores down to the very depths of the loch, showing fine sport.
                    They frequently run to a large size, reaching 16 and 18 lb weight, and sometimes
                    heavier. They are, however, better for the table when 4 or 5 lb. The small lake
                    trout are spun for by trailing a minnow in the same way, but Jn shallower water;
                    and often when the fish are dull at the fly, they take well on the trail. There
                    are various artificial baits used for spinning, some of them imitating fish of
                    different kinds, and made of bone, horn, gutta-percha, mother-of-pearl, glass,
                    and other substances. One of the best and most generally known and used is the
                    “phantom bait,” invented and made by Mr Brown of Aberdeen. It is made of oiled
                    silk, and painted to represent a small trout or par; being cylindrical, when
                    drawn against the stream, it fills with water and plumps out to the size of a
                    fish; when seized, however, it compresses to a mere rag of oiled silk, leaving
                    nothing but the hooks in the fish’s mouth. There are various other
                    spinning-baits which do not exactly imitate any fish, as spoons, otters,
                    kill-devils, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Live Baiting.—</hi> The plan pursued in this kind of fishing
                    for pike is generally to use either what is termed “live snap or gorge tackle.”
                    In the former, the object is to strike as soon as the pike takes the bait into
                    his mouth; in the latter, to allow him to swallow or gorge it. In both cases a
                    float is used. This is usually a lump of cork nearly as large as a hen’s egg, to
                    carry a good-sized bait. The bait used generally is either a small roach, dace,
                    or gudgeon; failing these, any other that can be obtained. The best kind of snap
                    tackle may be seen in fig. 6. In the cut it consists of a single hook and a
                    triangle. The single hook is hooked through the root of the dorsal fin of a
                    small roach, dace, or gudgeon, and the triangle hangs down at the side of the
                    bait, as shown in fig. 7. Now, when a pike first seizes a bait he takes it
                    across his mouth, so that while the head and tail appear outside his jaws on
                    either side, the whole of the middle parts of the body are well within them;
                    and, as will be seen from the position of the hooks, they will most probably be
                    within the pike’s mouth also; consequently, as soon as the pike has had time to
                    take the bait so arranged into his mouth, the angler strikes smartly, and very
                    often hooks his fish and lands him. It will of course happen sometimes that the
                    triangle is not well in the fish’s mouth, in which case either the fish is
                    missed altogether, or, being very slightly hooked, he breaks away. Another
                    method of using the live bait is what is termed the “live gorge.” In this case a
                    pair of hooks, tied back to back, are used. The loop of the gimp on which they
                    are tied is hooked into a long needle, called a baiting needle. (See fig. 8,
                    which shows the hooks and the needle.) This is inserted under the skin at the
                    shoulder of the bait, and carried down just under the skin, towards the tail,
                    being brought out just behind the dorsal fin. The gimp is drawn through, and the
                    hooks stand as shown in the illustration. (See fig. 9.) In the illustration the
                    loop is hung on to the trace, and the tackle used as in ordinary live bait
                    fishing; only, when a pike takes the bait he is allowed to gorge it before the
                    angler strikes, being permitted to go where he will with the bait, and ten
                    minutes being allowed for him to gorge or pouch, as it is termed. This is a
                    tedious method of fishing, and is only used for pike,—as often the fish runs the
                    line foul of some weed, and leaves the bait; or, after mumbling it and killing
                    it, refuses to gorge, and the constant waiting whenever there is a run is
                    wearisome. But as there is less show of hooks, more runs are obtained in clear
                    water than with the live snap tackle. Another method of using the live bait is
                    with the paternoster, though this is chiefly used with minnow or small fry for
                    perch fishing. It is, however, sometimes used for pike, when a gimp tackle is
                    preferred and only two hooks used. For perch fishing, the paternoster simply
                    consists of a line of gut about 4 or 5 feet long; at the bottom of this is a
                    leaden bullet or plummet to sink it to the bottom; about 6 or 8 inches above
                    this a hook, on some 6 inches of gut, is fastened; a foot above this another
                    hook is fixed on, and a foot above that again, a third. This third hook is often
                    a gimp hook, when pike and perch are found in common, and a rather larger hook
                    and bait are used, so that if a pike should come to the bait, there may be a
                    fair chance of capturing him. A minnow being hooked through the lips on each of
                    the other hooks, the tackle is dropped into an eddy where perch are supposed to
                    be, and the three baits swim round and round the main line; so that, no matter
                    whether the fish are resting at the bottom or searching for their prey in
                    mid-water, they may be attracted. As soon as there is a bite from a perch the
                    angler feels it at the rod-point, slackens line for two seconds to let the fish
                    get the minnow well into his mouth, and then strikes. Should the immediate
                    neighbourhood not afford a bite, the tackle is cast to a distance, and after
                    being allowed to rest for a minute, it is drawn in a few feet, when another cast
                    is made, and then another draw, until the tackle is worked up on the boat or
                    bank, when another cast is made. In the winter, after the floods, very many
                    perch are caught in this way on the Thames, from 100 to 200 in a day being not
                    very uncommonly taken. Trolling with the dead gorge is another way of fishing;
                    and this is employed chiefly when the water is full of thick weeds and
                    rush-beds, -which prevent either spinning or live bait fishing, and solely also
                    for pike. An elongated piece of lead is cast on to a bit of twisted brass wire,
                    which has a couple of hooks similar to those on a live bait gorge tackle at the
                    other end (fig. 10); a gudgeon (which is the best bait for the purpose) to suit
                    the length of the lead is chosen; the loop of the gimp, to which the brass wire
                    is fastened, is slipped into the eye of a baiting needle. The needle is passed
                    in at the mouth of the bait and down along the spine, out at the tail. The lead
                    being drawn into the stomach of the bait, the two hooks lie on each side of the
                    mouth. The tail is tied tightly on to the gimp with three or four laps of silk,
                    to prevent it from slipping (see fig. 11), and the tackle and bait fastened on
                    to the trace used, which is usually a yard of gimp, with one <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n45/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0045-0036"/> hook or spring swivel to loop the tackle and bait
                    on. This bait is then dropped into holes between the weeds or rushes, and is
                    worked up and down by the lifting and falling of the rod-point, the lead within
                    the bait causing it to shoot and dart along as though the fish were alive. When
                    a pike seizes it, ten minutes must be allowed for him to pouch, when the angler
                    must strike firmly, hold on, and get his fish out as well as he can. It is by no
                    means the pleasantest method of fishing, as the waiting is tedious. The fish
                    constantly runs the line foul of the weeds, &amp;c.; and often, after a tedious
                    waiting, it is found that the fish has rejected the bait after all. Added to
                    these, there is this objection to all gorge fishing, that the angler must kill
                    every fish he catches, as the hooks are in the fish’s throat, and small
                    under-sized fish, which ought to be returned to the water, are sacrificed, as
                    well as fair takeable ones.</p>
                <p>Sometimes grubs and worms are used in mid-water fishing, being cast up stream and
                    allowed to float down in mid-water. This is chiefly for trout. The angler uses a
                    long, light bamboo rod, and a single shot for a sinker. Two small worms are
                    generally used; the brandling or gilt-tail is more frequently used (a worm found
                    in rotten manure, &amp;c.) Some use a single hook, some three small hooks tied
                    one above the other. This is called “the Stewart tackle,” after the author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Practical Angler;</hi> and the wO∏ns are twined round and
                    impaled on them. Wading up stream, the angler casts before him into every likely
                    stream and eddy, allowing the line and bait to come down towards him in
                    mid-water, and striking the moment he perceives a check. This is a very killing
                    plan, and is adopted with a modification of tackle, to fish w∣th beetles,
                    larvae, palmers, and, in fact, almost any kind of insect; for the trout is a
                    very omnivorous fish, and will hardly refuse anything that is small enough. The
                    lure is cast overhand, as in fly-fishing, and practice enables the angler to
                    cast nearly twice the length of the rod.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface or Fly Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>This method of fishing is conducted with the natural or the artificial fly. The
                    first of these ways is called daping, dibbing, or shade fishing, and consists of
                    using a long light rod with almost 2 yards of fine strong gut, to the end of
                    which is tied a No. 7 or 8 hook, not too coarse in the wire. A fly, beetle, or
                    insect of some kind is then put on the hook by transfixing the thorax of the
                    insect. Then the angler, having watched the fish rising under some bank or
                    projecting tree or bush, creeps very softly to the place, and, keeping himself
                    out of sight, pokes the point of his rod through some open spot in the bushes,
                    and allows the insect to drop on the surface, just over or a little above the
                    spot where the fish he wants to catch has been rising. Probably he will not be
                    able to see or to feel the fish rise, and he will have to trust to a third
                    sense—his hearing. He will hear a slight “plop,” like a bubble coming out of a
                    submerged glass. A gentle strike then is required, and a tight hand on the fish,
                    as such places are usually near old roots or boughs, in which the fish will try
                    to shelter himself and entangle the tackle. The best fish are frequently taken
                    in this way. Another method of using the natural fly or insect is by casting it.
                    In this case a single-hand fly-rod is used, and it requires great care to avoid
                    whipping the insect off the hook. Having cast the bait to the extent required,
                    the line and bait rest on the surface, and the bait floats down quite naturally
                    unchecked, and the fish riee at it in the ordinary manner. What is called the
                    blowline is another favourite method of using the live fly. A length of light
                    floss silk is fastened on to the running line with about 2 feet of fine gut and
                    a light hook at the end. Baiting the hook with a fly, the angler turns his back
                    to the wind, holds the rod (a long light cane one) upright, allows the wind to
                    blow the light floss line as far out as it will go, when he gradually lowers the
                    rod and guides the fly till it touches the water a yard above a fish, when he
                    floats over it. A little wind is required for this kind of fishing. Some
                    insects, beetles, creepers, or larvae of the stone-fly, &amp;c., are used in
                    mid-water, as already noted. A word or two as to the method: a couple of shots
                    being fixed on the line, the bait is cast with an underhand swing, as in minnow
                    fishing, up stream, and allowed to travel down towards where the angler stands.
                    At every stop or check of the line it is necessary to strike, for the bait being
                    tender, whether it be a twig, mud, or fish that arrests it, it will be spoilt;
                    therefore the angler must always strike on every suspicion of a bite. For full
                    particulars of this kind of fishing, as well as for all relating to trouting in
                    the North British streams, the angler cannot do better than get <hi
                    rend="italic">The Practical Angler,</hi> by the late Mr Stewart, one of the best
                    works ever published on such subjects. The best flies used for live-fly fishing
                    are the large ones, as the green and grey drake, the stone fly, known often in
                    Scotland as the May-fly, the big alder, the blue-bottle, and, indeed, any that
                    are large enough. In casting them the angler must be careful to let lιis line
                    make rather a sweep or circuit behind him, or he will easily flick off or
                    destroy his bait. In using the artificial fly the angler employs either a single
                    or a double handed rod,—generally he commences his apprenticeship with a single
                    one. This is usually made either of hickory, green-heart, or split bamboo tied
                    and glued up in lengths, runs from 10 to 12 feet long, and is tolerably
                    pliant,—more or less so, according to the taste of the angler. The linê used is
                    generally twisted or plaited hair and silk, or fine dressed silk. The first is
                    the lightest. A piece of gut, knotted together until it is about 3 yards long,
                    is termed the casting-line, point, lash, or collar. This is fastened to the end
                    of the reel or running-line, and to the other end of it is looped on an
                    artificial fly. Sometimes two or more flies are used; in this case they are
                    called droppers or bob flies, and are looped or tied on to the casting-line
                    about 18 inches or 2 feet apart. The end fly is called the tail or stretcher.
                    The best way of fastening on the drop flies is to whip the gut round with silk a
                    few times, just above one of the knots, to prevent chafing; then take a fly with
                    only about 5 inches of gut to it, tie a knot at the extreme end of the gut, and
                    then knot on it once or twice, if required, over the whipped silk, and if the
                    gut be moistened and drawn tight to the knot, even when only once knotted, it
                    rarely slips, and the more it is pulled of course the tighter it gets. When it
                    is desired to take the dropper off, a sharp knife slips off the extreme end
                    knot, and the tie comes off easily. The loss of gut is infinitesimal, and the
                    fly wears out before the gut is materially shortened. The angler having his rod
                    and line ready, and his cast of flies selected, begins by letting out a little
                    more line than the length of his rod, waves the rod back over his right
                    shoulder, so as to extend the line behind him, and then, making a slight curve,
                    impels it forward towards the point he desires to reach, letting it fall on the
                    water as lightly as possible; then he allows his flies to float down the stream
                    as far as they will go, when he draws out and repeats the cast, lengthening out
                    line as he does so until he has as much out as he requires, or can cast
                    comfortably. If in casting he does not make a curve with the rod-point behind
                    him, but returns the line too directly, he will crack his fly off, or so crack
                    the gut at the head of the fly that the first good fish will carry it away. When
                    the angler sees a fish rise at his fly, if he is fishing for small fish, he
                    cannot strike too quickly,—if for large ones, he may be a little more leisurely.
                    In fishing over a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n46/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0046-0037"/> fish that is rising, the best way is to cast a
                    little above, and to allow the flies, with as little of the line as possible, to
                    come over or past him. Some anglers fish up stream and some down. In fishing
                    down stream the angler exposes himself more to the fish, and is more apt to miss
                    his fish when they do rise; and if his tackle is fine and the fish heavy, having
                    the weight of the stream against him is also more apt to break it than when
                    fishing up; perhaps the best method is to fish diagonally up and across the
                    stream. The angler pursues one of two systems. He either waits till he sees fish
                    rise and fishes over them, wasting no time on intermediate water when he sees no
                    rises; or he fishes the water out thoroughly, searching every hollow, bank,
                    weed, and stone, that may hide a trout. In burn fishing for small trout the
                    latter method is generally the one adopted. In larger rivers, where the fish are
                    heavy and few, the former is more often preferred. When a good fish is hooked it
                    will often resist strongly, and rush violently about, seeking to hide itself
                    under weeds and roots, which are dangerous to the tackle. The angler must guide
                    the fish as well as he can until it is tired, letting out line from the reel
                    when resistance becomes too severe a strain on the tackle, and winding it in
                    again when opportunity serves, but always keeping a tight line on the fish, as a
                    slack line frequently loses it. When tired the fish should be towed gently to a
                    favourable bank, and the landing-net quietly slipped under him. There must be no
                    dashing or hasty movement with the net, lest the fish be frightened and make
                    another effort to escape, as fish frequently do, and successfully, as it is a
                    dangerous moment in the struggle. In fishing with a double-handed rod the rodis
                    longer and the line a little heavier; in other·respects there is no difference.
                    The rod will vary from 13 to 15 feet for trouting. The left hand grasps it below
                    the reel, and the right hand above; though, if the angler desires a change, or
                    the necessities of the stream or wind require it, the hands can be reversed. The
                    double-handed rod has several advantages over the single, having more power with
                    big fish, and keeping the line and flies higher above obstructions.</p>
                <p>The question of why fish take bunches of feathers tied on hooks, and what they
                    mistake them for, has often been asked; and it is now pretty generally allowed
                    that they take them for flies in the majority of instances, though in others
                    they may mistake them for water-beetles, larvae, or spiders, of which latter
                    insect there are several that inhabit the water. Now, there are two classes of
                    disputants on this matter: one which holds altogether to the fly theory, and
                    therefore strives to imitate each fly that comes out closely; the other, which
                    inclines more to the general insect theory, and merely gives a few flies of
                    different colours, not caring to imitate anything in particular. Probably the
                    best fishermen recognise both theories, but bind themselves exclusively to
                    neither. But before entering upon the selection of flies it may be well to point
                    out the difference in the practice of the north and south. We may, perhaps, take
                    the late Mr Stewart<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">The Practical Angler.</hi> A. &amp; C. Black,
                    Edinburgh.</p></note> as the exponent of the north; and, perhaps, Mr Francis
                    Francis<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">A Book on Angling.</hi> Longmans &amp; Co., London.</p></note> may
                    be held as the latest exponent of the south. Mr Stewart gives a short list of a
                    bare half-dozen of insects, three of which he calls spiders—black, red, and
                    dun—and which are what are known in the south as “hackle” flies; that is, flies
                    dressed with only a body and hackle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The pointed feathers on a cock’s or hen’s neck are called
                    hackles, but any small feather with a soft shortish fibre may be used as a
                    hackle.</p></note> The hackle is wound on round the hook, over the body, and is
                    supposed to represent the legs of the fly, there being no wings. Mr</p>
                <p>Stewart also has three flies of three general colours, yellow, brown, and dark
                    bodies; but as these may be varied with all sorts of wing3 and legs, the last
                    may embrace in reality any number of flies which the taste of the angler may
                    suggest. Mr Stewart’s standards, however, are dressed thus :—(1.) A woodcock
                    wing, with a single turn of a red hackle or landrail feather, dressed with
                    yellow silk freely exposed on the body. For fishing in dark-coloured waters the
                    fly may be dressed with scarlet thread. (2.) A harelug body, with corn-bunting
                    or chaffinch wing. A woodcock wing may also be put on the same body, but should
                    be made of the small light feathers taken from the inside of the wing. (3.) The
                    same wing as the last, with a single turn of a soft black hen-hackle, or a small
                    feather taken from the shoulder of a starling, dressed with dark-coloured silk.
                    These, as Mr Stewart says, can be varied to any extent; but he pins his faith on
                    those mentioned and the spiders: the black spider being a small dark starling
                    feather wound over a brown silk body; the red one, the small feather outside the
                    wing of the landrail, wound on over a yellow silk body; and the dun spider, the
                    small soft ash-coloured feather from outside the dottrel’s wing, with hardly any
                    body but the tying of the hook. This is Mr Stewart’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >repertoire—</hi> it is not overburdensome; but in the south Mr Francis says
                    that fish are much less numerous, and are larger and more critical, their
                    feeding-time being much longer and food being more plentiful than in the north,
                    and their taste, therefore, has to be more carefully considered; he therefore
                    gives a list of flies for each month. Space does not permit us to name the whole
                    of them, but we can enumerate a few of the best of them. The duns run through
                    the whole year, and are therefore with the angler the <hi rend="italic">pièce de
                    résistance.</hi> These comprise varieties of the blue and yellow dun, and should
                    be varied from the darkest slate-blue to the lightest shade yellow, from almost
                    golden yellow up to the lightest fawn, almost a white, and these, slightly
                    combined, go also to an olive. The earlier duns are the blue dun, which comes in
                    in March, and is one of the best spring flies. It is in the water more or less
                    throughout the season. Then there is the small dark iron-blue dun, which appears
                    in April or May, with wings almost as dark as the body; and the bright yellow
                    dun, with greenish-yellow body and pale slate-coloured wings. If these three be
                    taken as the darkest of their class, and varieties, each of a shade or two
                    lighter in colour, be made, they will take in the whole of this important class
                    of flies. These duns are all imperfect insects, and have another change to go
                    through before they are complete and able to propagate, and when they have
                    completed this they usually die. The fly casts its skin and becomes a perfect
                    insect, brighter in colour and more brisk in its motions. In this form they are
                    called by the angler “spinners.” Thus the blue dun becomes the red spinner, the
                    yellow dun the brown spinner, the iron-blue dun the jenny spinner, and so on.
                    All these flies belong, with several others, to the class or order <hi
                    rend="italic">Neuroptera</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or nerve-winged
                    flies—flies with clear gaudy wings, intersected with a network of veined
                    markings. They form the most important order for the angler; but there is
                    another order, the <hi rend="italic">Trichoptera,</hi> or hairy-winged flies,
                    which is scarcely less important, and which includes a very large number of
                    flies on which fish habitually feed. These flies have soft feathery folding
                    wings, which lie close on the back. They differ from the former order in having
                    one less change to go through, for when they emerge from the pupa state and
                    become flies, they are complete, and have no further change to go through. There
                    are, besides these, which are flies born from water, other orders of land flies,
                    imitations of which are used by anglers, as the cow-dung, hawthorn, and oak
                    flies, the house-fly, &amp;c., but they are comparatively insignificant, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n47/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0047-0038"/> and with the exception of the cow-dung, which is
                    a very useful fly, may be dispensed -with. It is impossible here to give the
                    dressing of the various flies; but if the angler goes to any respectable
                    tackle-maker and mentions the names of the flies he requires he will get them.
                    To commence then with the month of—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">March,</hi> which is early enough for fly-fishing. The earliest
                    fly found on the water is the February red. This, with the blue dun and the
                    March brown, will do well during March, if anything will. The same flies kill
                    well enough also in—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">April,</hi> and to them may be added the red spinner, the
                    cow-dung, the red and black hackles, the needle brown, and towards the end of
                    the month, or entering on May, the yellow dun and the iron-blue dun.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">May.—</hi> In addition to many of these, the angler may use the
                    stone-fly, the sedge-fly, and the orl or alder fly—a very celebrated and general
                    fly—with the little black gnat and the pale evening dun,—a fly which only comes
                    on in the evening towards dusk, when the fish feed ravenously on it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">June.—</hi> In this month the standing dish with the trout in
                    most rivers is the green drake, better known as the May fly, though it rarely
                    appears until May is over. This and its transformations, the grey drake, with
                    the well-known Welsh fly, the coch-y-bondu, otherwise the bracken clock,
                    shorn-fly, &amp;c.; these, with various light-coloured duns and spinners, may be
                    used through the month with effect, as this is the prime month for
                    fly-fishers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">July,</hi> as a rule, is rather an indifferent month. The
                    weather is hot, the water low and clear, and fish do not feed well till the
                    evening, when the white and brown moths may be used. In the day-time the red and
                    black ant flies often kill well, and these, with various light-coloured duns and
                    diminutive green, blue, and grey midges, must make up the bill of fare.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">August.—</hi> The August dun and the cinnamon now are added to
                    the list, many of the previous flies being still on.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">September</hi> brings the whirling dun and the willow-fly, and
                    this closes the angler’s fly-fishing for trout.</p>
                <p>In the latter months many of the earlier flies reappear, and with the list here
                    given the angler should have no difficulty in killing fish anywhere. Most of the
                    smaller troutflies are dressed on hooks that range from the sizes No. 10 to 17
                    in the scale of hooks given in fig. 12 in the cut— the larger flies, as the
                    May-flies, stone-fly, the moths, &amp;c., running up to sizes 6, 7, and 8. There
                    are, besides these flies, which are definite imitations of insects, a few of
                    such general make and colour that though they do not strictly imitate one fly,
                    may have a general likeness to several, and which are called general flies, and
                    are often used when the angler is in a difficulty in knowing what to put on his
                    cast. Among the best of these are the IIoffland, the Francis, the governor, the
                    coachman, the soldier palmer, the wren-tail, the grouse and partridge hackles,
                    &amp;c. As a rule, the smaller flies are used in the day-time, the size being
                    increased as the evening and night come on. In some waters, owing to the
                    excessive fishing, the trout get so wary that after the May-fly there is very
                    little chance, unless the day be particularly favourable, of hooking a trout
                    before the evening, and fishing is often carried on till ten or eleven o’clock
                    at night. Of course at such times the angler has to trust more to his senses of
                    feeling and hearing than sight. In the majority of instances it is the custom to
                    let the tackle soak, and when fishing to allow the fly to sink a little under
                    the surface—to fish with a “wet fly,” as it is called; in others, where the fish
                    are more wary, in order to imitate nature more closely yet, it is the custom to
                    fish with a dry one—that is, to make the fly and line rest on the surface,
                    without becoming submerged. To this end, when the fly and line become wet, they
                    are waved to and fro from the rod-point in the air to make them become dry
                    again. The fly should always be allowed to float down stream, as natural flies
                    do, and should not be jerked or “played,” as it is termed, unless the angler is
                    fishing down stream and drawing his fly against it, when he will allow it to
                    sink under water, and in that position it may be supposed to represent some <pb

                    >repertoire</hi> in this respect which differs wholly from that employed in
                    streams. Lake-trout flies, particularly in Scotland, are made with wool bodies,
                    the prevailing colours being red, claret, orange, yellow, green, and black, with
                    a light spiral up the body of gold or silver tinsel. The hackles are chiefly
                    either black or red, or red with a black centre; the wings are either of teal,
                    mallard, or woodcock. Here and there the white tip feather in the drake’s wing
                    is a favourite wing for flies. They are usually dressed on 7, 8, or 9 hooks; the
                    same flies a size or two larger do equally well for sea-trout flies.</p>
                <p>Lake-trout fishing is conducted either from a boat or from the shore. The best
                    depth of water in which to fish for trout varies from 6 or 8 to 12 or 14 feet,
                    and between these depths the best sport is obtained; and the angler should
                    therefore fish over them for choice, though occasionally fish may be caught in
                    both deeper and shallower water. In lake fishing it is always desirable to have
                    a good ruffling breeze, as the fish do not rise or take well in a calm. The best
                    places are in sheltered bays, by rocky points or islands, or where burns flow
                    in; drifting along by these, and casting ahead and shorewards, the angler
                    watches every break in the water. While drifting along in his boat, it may
                    happen that, the wind being high, he drifts too fast to fish thoroughly and
                    properly over the ground. To obviate this a stone or an anchor is cast over and
                    allowed to drag along the bottom, so as to check the way of the boat, and to
                    give time to the angler to fish. A good boatman and netsman is here a great
                    desideratum, and much of the chance of sport depends upon him. The great fault
                    of most boatmen is that they go too quickly over the casts; and it requires a
                    man with a knowledge of the lake, as well as experience in managing the boat, so
                    to conduct matters that the angler has the best chance of sport. When rowing to
                    his ground, or from point to point, the angler should always put out the
                    spinning minnow, and thus he may take one or two of the best fish. As fish do
                    not always lie in the same places, wind and weather have to be sedulously
                    consulted. In fishing from the shore the angler seldom gets the best sport, and
                    often has to wade to reach fishable water, while the best casts are often beyond
                    lιis reach; and therefore, whenever a boat can be employed, it is to be
                    preferred for lakes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salmon Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>The salmon is the noblest and strongest fish on which the angler essays his art,
                    and fish from 40 to 50 δ&gt; in weight, and sometimes of even more, are
                    occasionally taken by the rod and line; though for the ordinary purposes of
                    sport, fish from 7 or 8 ft&gt; up to 20 are far more generally taken. When a
                    salmon in good condition is first hooked he makes a strong and violent
                    resistance, dashing through the water frequently for a distance of 60 or 70
                    yards or more at a time, and compelling the angler to let so much line off the
                    reel; springing out of the water, often to a height of several feet, several
                    times during the struggle; and finding that force is unavailing to break the
                    line or withdraw the hook, he will often have recourse to cunning, and cut the
                    line or rub the hook out of his nose against some rock; or, hiding himself at
                    the bottom behind big stones and boulders, he will sιdk and remain immovable for
                    a long time. Occasionally he will run up or down rapids or falls in his terror
                    and rage. To control all these vagaries, to combat his cunning, the angler, with
                    his bending rod and practised skill, lets him take out line when his struggles
                    are dangerous, cautiously winding it back again when he is able to do so safely,
                    and thus keeping a certain strain upon the fish he gradually tires him out and
                    wears his strength down, and at last, when unable to resist any longer, he is
                    led in towards the shore, where upon some convenient rock or strand the
                    attendant gaffsman stands or crouches, with a sharp-pointed steel hook attached
                    to a short ashen staff called a gaff, waiting his opportunity. As the salmon is
                    led past or near him, almost on the surface of the water, the hook is extended
                    beyond the fish, the gaffsman makes a short sharp stroke with it, and digging
                    the hook into the side of the salmon, with a sudden and instantaneous pull drags
                    it out of the water to the land; a rap on the skull from a stick or stone
                    terminates the poor salmon’s life, and henceforth he becomes mere provender.
                    Sometimes a large landing-net is used to land the fish, but though this prevents
                    the spoiling of a portion of the fish by avoiding the need for making a hole
                    with the gaff, it is less convenient and of more risk to the safety of the fish.
                    The most favourite plan of fishing for salmon is with the fly, though in many
                    places they will also take both worm and minnow freely, and are thus fished for.
                    The salmon-fly is a most wonderful conglomeration of feathers, silks, and
                    tinsels, and oftentimes is as brilliant as the most glittering humming-bird.
                    What the salmon mistakes it for is not easy to say, for there is nothing like it
                    in nature. Probably a semi-transparent shrimp or prawn reflecting the gorgeous
                    tints of the surrounding sea vegetation may be the nearest approach to it. The
                    manufacture of the salmon-fly is given hereafter. They are made of various
                    sizes,—the longest for the early spring when the rivers are much swollen and
                    very turbid, when hooks of 3 inches in length, and sometimes even longer, are
                    employed; and from this extreme size they diminish gradually to a large
                    sea-trout size, which is about in accordance with the hooks numbered 6 and 7 in
                    the scale given in the illustration. These are used when the rivers have sunk
                    down to their summer level, and are very clear and still, and the flies in the
                    intervening sizes are carefully adjusted to suit the size and clearness of the
                    water. There is a great difference in the method of using the trout and the
                    salmon fly. In salmon fishing there are certain spots in the river upon which
                    salmon are known to rest and to feed, and these are called salmon-caste, throws,
                    lodges, or stands. They may be but a few yards in length, and comprise a
                    favourite ledge, or a rock or two, behind which salmon like to shelter,—for a
                    salmon always has his lair or resting-place behind some projecting rock or
                    stone; or they may extend for 100 or 200 yards, or even more. There are, too, in
                    many rivers plenty of places where salmon may be seen sporting and jumping
                    about, but where, owing to the depth of water or some other reason, they never
                    feed or at least take the fly. The angler, therefore, who knows thoroughly the
                    cast he is about to fish, has a great advantage, for he knows where the big
                    stones and the particular eddies are in which a salmon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0049-0040"/> may be expected to rise, and how the fly should
                    be drawn over the fish so as to show itself in the most tempting manner; whereas
                    the angler who has not much knowledge is often apt to dwell upon spots that are
                    comparatively barren, and to pass quickly over those that would perhaps repay
                    particular attention. In fishing a cast, the angler casts diagonally across down
                    stream, and draws the fly up stream towards him, softly raising and lowering the
                    top of the rod so as to check and loosen the fly alternately, and to make all
                    its fibres open and shut so as to counterfeit life. When a salmon rises to the
                    fly he either makes a big bulge or boil in the water, or, if he is unusually
                    eager, he throws his head and half his body above the surface, rolling over like
                    a porpoise in his endeavour to seize the fly; but a salmon very often misses the
                    fly in his eagerness, and when he does, the very worst the angler can do is to
                    pull it away from him, as after such a miss it is not at all uncommon for a
                    salmon to turn round hastily and to make a second snatch at the fly, which he
                    then rarely misses; but if the fly is whipped away from him, he is frightened
                    and disgusted, and goes down sulkily, refusing to rise again. It is therefore
                    the safest plan to wait till you feel your fish, and then to strike, and even
                    then it is not desirable to be too rough. A violent stroke is not the best
                    one,—a slight elevation of the rod so as to fix the point, and then a steady
                    strain, enough to force the barb of the hook home in the next minute, is the
                    best way of getting a firm hold. Many fishers strike the moment they see the
                    boil of the fish, under the belief that the boil is made by the tail of the
                    salmon as he turns to go down, and that they do not see him till he gets the fly
                    in his jaws. This is true, provided he does not miss his aim altogether; if he
                    does (as he certainly often does, for it must be remembered that the fly is
                    constantly in motion, which of course renders it not very easy to see), then to
                    strike is to pull the fly away and to deprive the salmon of another chance. When
                    he has hooked a fish, the angler should look round and study what dangers there
                    are which may prove destructive to his hopes, and determine if possible so to
                    manage his fish as to avoid them. lie must, therefore, always retain his
                    coolness and presence of mind; flurry and confusion are often fatal to success.
                    If a salmon jumps out of water the point of the rod should be lowered, so that
                    the line be slackened, for if it be tight the sudden weight is apt to pull it
                    out of the fish’s jaw. If he sulks, the only way is to frighten him out of his
                    hole by poking a long pole into it, or by throwing stones, or by some other
                    device. If he runs for the edge of a fall or rapid, it is often a very good plan
                    to let out a lot of loose line, and the salmon, fancying himself free again,
                    will not go over, but will head round and face up stream again. As the devices
                    of the salmon to escape are numerous, they cannot be dealt with fully here. No
                    two salmon-casts are alike, and therefore no two can be fished in the same way;
                    each one must be fished to suit the particular capabilities it possesses.</p>
                <p>The method of casting the salmon-fly is similar to that adopted with the
                    double-hand trout-rod; the only difference being that the rod is larger and
                    heavier, running up to 21 feet, and even more sometimes, and seldom less than 16
                    or 17 feet. The line is stout, well-dressed, 8-plait silk; the casting-line a
                    yard or two of treble-twisted gut, and a yard or two of stout single salmon gut.
                    Having mastered his rod well, the angler will find it comparatively easy to cast
                    up to 20 yards of line; from this up to 30 yards every extra yard he can throw
                    proves him more and more a good fisherman, while every yard he can cast beyond
                    30 shows him to be a master of his craft. The angler should never cast more line
                    out than he can work and fish comfortably; if he does, he has a slack line when
                    he requires a tight one, and he will often raise and scratch fish, and spoil his
                    own sport and other people’s, when a yard or two less of line would have enabled
                    him to catch his fish. Very long throws are only necessary under unusual
                    circumstances; 25 yards will generally cover fully all that the angler really
                    needs to fish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Salmon-Flies.</hi></p>
                <p>We may give a short list of general salmon-flies such as the angler will fifιd it
                    useful to have always by him, and which he can employ if he does not know the
                    general flies used on the river, and every river has some pet fly, some
                    different combination of feathers and fur from its neighbour. The flies given
                    are all standard flies, and may be had at any respectable tackle-maker’s. The
                    method of dressing them is the one which experience has shown to be the best for
                    attracting the notice of the salmon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Claret.—</hi> One of the most useful general flies.
                    Beginning the dressing at the bend of the hook, which is the tail end of the
                    fly, a turn or two of gold twist and golden-coloured floss silk is taken for the
                    tag; above this is lashed on a tail formed of a golden pheasant topping and some
                    strips of blue and red macaw. Over the stump of the tail is fastened the but, a
                    sort of ruff made of two or three turns of the herl or strands of a black
                    ostrich feather. Then comes the body—first three turns of orange floss silk,
                    then reddish claret pig’s wool wound on to the top of the body; over the wool
                    spirals of stout gold thread; and, beginning halfway down the body, a hackle of
                    reddish claret to the shoulder, and at the shoulder two or three turns of black
                    hackle. The wing is made first of tippet feather of the golden pheasant, which
                    forms a sort of short under wing; above that is a mixed wing of fibres from the
                    golden pheasant tail, turkey, bustard, and peacock wing, with a few fibres of
                    green and red parrot; above all a single topping, with a rib to either wing, of
                    bluo macaw fibre,—the head of the fly being black, either ostrich, herl, or
                    chenille. This fly may be used of various sizes, and is a very general favourite
                    in most waters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Black and Teal.—</hi> Another very general favourite, the
                    leading points_of which are a black body with silver spirals of twist or tinsel;
                    a single topping for the tail; black hackle up to the shoulder, over which
                    either <hi rend="italic">a</hi> teal feather or a gallina feather (with tho
                    large spots), and a wing of teal or rather pintail, and over it two jungle cock
                    feathers with or without a topping. This fly also may be used of all sizes;
                    dressed small, it is good for either lake or sea trout.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Blue Doctor.—</hi> Tag, a few turns of fine gold twist;
                    tail, a topping; but, scarlet crewel or wool; body, pale blue floss silk, with a
                    hackle a shade darker, or a blue jay’s feather; silver tinsel (in large flies
                    with silver twist beside it); grouse, partridge, or bustard hackle at the
                    shoulder; a blue jay feather or blue hackle over it. The wing is mixed of fibres
                    of the bustard, dark turkey, argus pheasant, claret, blue, and yellow fibres of
                    dyed swan; sometimes a topping over all and a head of scarlet crewel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Silver Doctor.</hi> —Also a very great favourite. Tag,
                    silver tinsel; tail, a topping; but, a turn of red crewel; body of silver tinsel
                    entirely; hackle, blue, with brown hackle at the shoulder, and a small speckled
                    gallina feather hackled on over it; wing chiefly pintail, with a few red and
                    blue fibres and a topping; head, red crewel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Butcher.—</hi> A very killing fly, and generally used. Tag,
                    gold twist and dark orange floss; tail, a topping; but, black ostrich herl;
                    body, two or three turns of scarlet. The same of a medium blue, then of red, and
                    lastly of dark blue pig’s wool; broad silver tinsel; a medium red claret hackle
                    with a gallina at the shoulder; under wing a tippet and rump feather of the
                    golden pheasant, and over them strips of brown mallard/, bustard, or peacock
                    wing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Parson.—</hi> If a gaudy fly is required, there are few
                    more showy ones than this. Tag, silver tinsel and mauve floss; tail, two
                    toppings, a few sprigs of tippet, and a green kingfisher feather; body, two
                    turns of gold floss silk, golden pig’s wool merging into orange; silver twist;
                    golden orange hackle, red orange hackle above it; three or four short toppings
                    tied on at the breast; wing, a tippet feather of the golden pheasant, a strip of
                    pintail on either side, seven or eight toppings, and a couple of kingfisher
                    feathers at the shoulder on either side; black head. A more subdued parson may
                    be made by using a jay’s hackle at the shoulder instead of the short toppings,
                    by reducing the number of toppings in the wing, and adding some darker fibres of
                    golden pheasant tail, bustard, &amp;c.</p>

                    black hackle, and wings of peacock wing, sometimes with a tippet in the centre
                    or a topping over. By varying the wing or hackle, a very taking series of flies
                    can be had.</p>
                <p>With this list of flies the angler ought to be able, in default of knowing the
                    special flies suited to the river, to fish any river with confidence, and, if
                    the fish are in the humour to rise, to get sport in it. The colour, and
                    particularly the size of the fly, are things to study in catering for a willing
                    salmon. Too large a fly often causes a false rise; when this is found to occur,
                    the size should be reduced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea-Trout Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>Next to the salmon ranks in value for sport the seatrout. Of these there are two
                    kinds: 1st, The salmontrout <hi rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >trutta);</hi> and 2d, The bull or grey trout <hi rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eriox).</hi> The former is much the better fish for sport and for
                    the table, the latter being coarser for the table and rather shy of the angler’s
                    lures. Sea-trout abound in several rivers in the north, and many are tak'en in
                    the tributaries of the Tweed and other northern rivers; but they are perhaps
                    more abundant and show better sport to the angler in some of the western Irish
                    waters. The salmon-trout usually average below 4 tt&gt; each, perhaps from 1 to
                    2 B⅛ being the prevailing size, though now and then much larger fish are taken.
                    The bull-trout often runs up to a far greater size, and fish of above 20 and
                    even up to 30 lb are not very uncommon. The salmon-trout, called in Ireland the
                    white trout, and on Tweed and the northern rivers the herling or silver white,
                    is a smart, bold-rising fish; it takes freely at times, and plays with wonderful
                    agility, frequently when hooked springing from the water like an acrobat many
                    times in succession, and trying all the angler’s skill to bring it into the
                    basket. In lakes they frequently abound in profusion, and a hundredweight of
                    them, and sometimes more, are or have been often taken in one day. The tackle,
                    of course, is lighter than that used for salmon, and somewhat heavier than is
                    used for the common trout. The flies are also of a size between those used for
                    the other two; bodies of claret, yellow and orange, green, blue, and black,
                    either of silk or fur, are the favourites. In Ireland they prefer a mixed wing,
                    chiefly made up of fibres of yellow, red, and green parrot, with bustard and
                    other dark feathers; the hackles being suitable. In Scotland they prefer plain
                    wings of drake, teal, woodcock, and the black and white tip from the wild drake
                    wing; but the fashion of the dressing is not a very important matter, so that
                    the colour is right. At times sea-trout rise very badly, and the angler will get
                    a number of rises, but succeed only in hooking a very few fish; but when the
                    fish are taking well, few branches of the sport show better amusement than a
                    day’s sea-trout fishing. They also, unlike the salmon, take a spinning bait well
                    while still in the salt water, and many are thus captured in the estuaries and
                    salt-water lochs of Scotland while they are making their way to the mouths of
                    the rivers up which they eventually would run to deposit their spawn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trout Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>The trout <hi rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">fario)</hi> has already
                    been fully dealt with as regards the means employed in capturing him, and very
                    little more needs to be said. He may be caught on the surface by the natural and
                    artificial fly, by spinning a minnow, &lt;fcc., in mid-water, by a live minnow,
                    by casting a beetle or grub also in mid-water, and by fishing with a worm at the
                    bottom. There are very few fish that have so wide a range as the trout. From the
                    poles to the outside boundaries of the tropics they are found on every
                    continent, either in running or still waters, for neither comes amiss to them.
                    From the huge lake trout, vying with the salmon in size and strength, the
                    species dwindles down to the small burn fish of six or eight to the pound. There
                    is hardly any way of using the rod that is not more or less suitable for their
                    capture; and though salmon fishing is held the nobler pursuit of the two, yet
                    far more skill is required to make an expert trout fisher, so cunning and wary
                    do they become when much fished over.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Greyling Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>The greyling <hi rend="italic">(Salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">Thymallus)</hi> is
                    not so widely distributed as the other members of the Salmonidae. It is found in
                    comparatively few rivers in England; in only ono in Scotland, the Clyde, into
                    which it was introduced some years ago; and not at all in Ireland. It is a
                    useful fish for the angler, inasmuch as it comes into the best rivers just as
                    the trout is going out. It is a handsome fish, of graceful shape, very silvery
                    sides and belly, with small black spots. It supposed to smell of thyme when
                    first caught, hence its name. It is seldom known to run much above 4 lb in
                    weight, and even that size is not at all common,— from £ or 1 B⅛ to 1∣ lb being
                    the average takeable size. It rises very freely to the fly, and will take other
                    bait; but is less carnivorous than the trout, so that minnow is rarely used as a
                    lure for it,—small insects, as gentles, caddis, &amp;c., may be used with
                    advantage. The flies it prefers are usually small bright duns and spinners, such
                    as are used for trout in clear waters. The longer dorsal fin of the greyling
                    allows it to rise from greater depths more rapidly than the trout, and deep
                    still reaches often hold the best fish. Unlike the trout, a greyling will often
                    rise and refuse the fly four or five or more times in succession, and yet will
                    perhaps take it after all. The mouth being tender, the fish must be treated more
                    gently than the trout, or it may break away. There is one way of fishing for
                    greyling practised in the midland rivers which is worth notice. It is called
                    “grasshopper fishing,” though the lure is totally unlike a grasshopper. A lump
                    of lead of an elongated pear shape is welded or cast on to the shank of a No. 5
                    or 6 hook. This is covered with wool or worsted wound on to it in rings of
                    different colours—green, yellow, and sometimes red. To make the bait more
                    attractive, sometimes two or three gentles are put on the hook, and the bait is
                    cast into a greyling eddy, and worked up and down smartly until taken by a fish.
                    The angler strikes at every suspicion of a bite. Large baskets of greyling are
                    taken thus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roach Fishing.</hi></p>
                <p>The roach <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus rutilus)</hi> is caught principally in
                    bottom fishing with the float, as before described. The roach has been termed
                    the river sheep, from his supposed unsuspiciousness of guile, but that can only
                    be when he is never fished for. About London, where he forms a great attraction
                    to a numerous body of anglers, he is particularly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0051-0042"/> sharp; and nothing but the finest tackle, such as
                    a single almost colourless horse hair, will take him, even gut being refused
                    when he is much fished for. A very light quill float and a few sinkers are
                    desirable. Roach weighing 2 tt&gt; are not at all common, from 1 &amp; to 1⅜ fi)
                    being the usual limits. The best hook baits for roach are gentles, greaves, red
                    worms, a plain paste made of flour and water or worked up bread crumb or pearl
                    barley. Of course there are a multitude of other baits which are sometimes
                    preferred, but these will rarely fail if the fish are at all inclined to feed.
                    The best general ground-bait is that already mentioned in bottom fishing, though
                    all sorts of other matters— as grains, barley-meal, pollard, boiled wheat,
                    &amp;c.—are sometimes used. Roach, when feeding near the surface, will sometimes
                    take a fly, as indeed will most fish. Size of hooks required, 10, 11, and
                    12.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Dace.</hi></p>
                <p>The dace <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">leuciscus)</hi> is
                    frequently found in common with the roach, though often abounding in trout
                    streams. Where there are no roach, it takes the same baits as the roach in all
                    respects, save that it runs much more freely at the fly. In the months of July,
                    August, and September on the Thames, large numbers of dace are taken with the
                    fly from the water between Isleworth and Teddington with small black and red
                    palmer and other flies tipped with a gentle or a piece of wash leather in
                    imitation, and it is not uncommon for an angler to take ten dozen of them in a
                    tide. The dace runs quickly, and requires very quick striking. The Jews are very
                    fond of dace for their feasts, and pay a high price for them. Size of hooks
                    required, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Chub.</hi></p>
                <p>The chub <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">cephalus)</hi> is
                    perhaps the least valuable fresh-water fish for table purposes, though probably
                    the barbel may almost be put on a level with him, albeit Izaak Walton contrived
                    to make a tasty dish of it; but at best the flesh is rather vapid, watery, and
                    abounding in bones. It is a fair sporting fish, however. In addition to his
                    taking all kinds of baits in bottom fishing, he will take both natural and
                    artificial insects on the surface boldly, and many are taken by dressing a
                    cockchafer, humble bee, or small frog, or by casting imitations of the same,
                    artificially prepared, under the boughs where the chub lies waiting. A big
                    artificial humble bee or cockchafer, or a fly made of a silver tinsel body,
                    coch-y-boudu hackle, and turkey wing, with sprigs of green peacock in it, are
                    about the three best lures for him, though many prefer red and black palmers.
                    The chub often lies also in deep heavy streams, and will frequently in such
                    cases take a live or a spinning minnow pretty freely. Among bottom baits cheese
                    and greaves are special favourites. The chub rarely exceeds 6 or 7 lb in weight,
                    though specimens have been known to attain 9 lb. Size of hooks, 3, 4, and
                    sometimes larger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Barbel.</hi></p>
                <p>The barbel <hi rend="italic">(Cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">barbus'),</hi> so
                    termed from the wattles or beard depending from the sides of the mouth, is a
                    very game fish for the angler, frequenting deep and rapid streams, and often
                    turbulent and broken waters, as at the tail of mill wheels, weirs, &amp;c. They
                    go in large shoals, so that when the barbel are got upon the feed the angler
                    often takes from 20 to 50 or more in a day. They require a good deal of
                    ground-baiting, however,—worms, gentles, greaves, &amp;c., being often used in
                    large quantities two or three nights before fishing to induce them to feed
                    freely, and even then the angler is as likely as not to be disappointed. A clean
                    red lob-worm is, upon the whole, perhaps the best bait for a barbel, and next to
                    that a bunch of gentles or greaves, though they will sometimes take freely a
                    number of things, including fat bacon and raw beef. They are fished for in
                    several ways by the ordinary and travelling float method, by the ledger and the
                    clay-ball principally; and it often happens that they will take pretty well in
                    one of these ways and refuse the others. The barbel nibbles a little at the
                    still bait before biting, but when a good double tug is felt, the angler may
                    strike firmly. Owing to its great expanse of fins, and its rounded body, the
                    barbel is a very stout fighter, and makes a most prolonged resistance; and
                    though it is not so active as either salmon or trout, it is more troublesome,
                    and takes longer to subdue. In the spring months the large barbel will
                    frequently take a spinning bait freely, and when spinning for large trout in a
                    weir the angler frequently receives severe disappointment by hooking a big
                    out-ofseason barbel. They run up to 16 lb weight, but one of 12 B) is not caught
                    every day. On the Thames the average is from 1 to 4 δ&gt;. They are a very
                    curious fish, some years biting freely, and during others hardly at all. Size of
                    hooks for worms, 1, 2, 3; for other baits smaller.</p>

                    said that there are two kinds of bream,—the small white bream (flat) and the big
                    olive-coloured bream. Much that applies to the barbel applies also to the bream.
                    The same baits and the same methods of fishing must be adopted, but if possible
                    finer tackle is required. Perhaps if there is one bait the bream likes better
                    than another, it is two or three brandlings or red worms stuck on the hook.

                    They are a curious fish, suddenly appearing in places where they have never been
                    seen before, and after stopping for a year or two, as suddenly disappearing.
                    They run up to 7 ft&gt;, and in the Thames average from 1 fi&gt; to 4 B&gt;.

                    described by the Dame Juliana Berners as a “deyntous dish.” Unfortunately the
                    decline of knowledge in the matter of fish feeding and rearing in ponds,
                    &lt;fcc., renders it difficult to realise the dame’s assertion, an ordinary carp
                    from an ordinary pond being poor in flesh and muddy in flavour, but it is quite
                    possible that the flesh, which is so susceptible of taking the η⅜sty flavours
                    exhaled around it, would, under better management, with better food and purer
                    water, be boflι delicate and “deyntous.” Of all fresh-water fish, the carp is
                    one of the most cunning and difficult to catch where he is much fished for,
                    though, singularly enough, they take much better in rivers than in still water.
                    In still water, even if you can induce a good carp to pay attention to your bait
                    (which you cannot always), he will nibble, and turn it about, until he either
                    sucks it off the hook without touching the hook, or he discovers the hook on the
                    line, becomes alarmed, and swims away. Very fine tackle, therefore, is required
                    in carp fishing; but as he is big and lusty, it should be round and strong.
                    There are various baits which more or less attract him. Paste sweetened with
                    sugar or honey is one of the best; but he will at times take gentles, greaves,
                    and red worms. Some affect boiled green peas, some beans, and many are taken
                    with parboiled potato, which is one of the best of baits in some places for
                    large fish. The best ground-baits are those recommended already, of bran, rice,
                    bread, &amp;c. If the fish are very shy, float tackle is to be avoided, and a
                    very light ledger on a pistol bullet used instead. As the line rests on the
                    ground, the carp does not see it, and takes the bait without suspicion. A clear
                    bottom, however, is desirable. Carp run up to a heavy weight, sometimes between
                    20 and 30 lb, and they live to a great age. Size of hooks, 5, 6, 7.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tench.</hi></p>
                <p>The tench <hi rend="italic">{Cyprinus tinca)</hi> very much resembles the carp in
                    his habits, feeding on much the same matters, though neither paste nor any
                    vegetable baits are to be recommended for tench. The best bait that can be put
                    to him 13 a red worm, or two or three gentles; and for ground-baits, chopped
                    worms and gentles are preferable. Tench bite best in the morning and evening,
                    when there is hardly light enough to see the float; for float tackle is best for
                    the tench, though he nibbles and mumbles at the bait exactly as the carp does
                    and often, like him, leaves it after nibbling off all the tail of the worm that
                    is beyond the point of the hook. When the tench is so shy his eagerness may be
                    stimulated by very gently drawing tho float and bait away a few inches, when he
                    will often rush at the bait and seize it at once. Tench are a very quiet,
                    unobtrusive fish, and may exist in a pond for a long time without being known to
                    be there. They are very capricious in biting, sometimes biting well for a day or
                    two, and again refusing all baits for weeks without any apparent reason. If
                    taken from clear waters, the tench is a very good table fish—second only to the

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Eel.</hi></p>
                <p>The eel <hi rend="italic">{Anguilla acutirostris).</hi> The eel is scarcely an
                    angler’s fish, but it is often taken in angling, and it is a most excellent and
                    luscious table fish. It takes various baits, as worms, small dead fish, which
                    are the best for it, and takes them better when they are still than when moving.
                    Thus, night-lines are the best way of capturing the eel. Occasionally float
                    tackle is used for the purpose, when the roughest tackle, with a float-hook and
                    worm, suffices. Sniggling for eels is an amusing way of taking them. A stout
                    needle, lashed to a long string, is concealed in a worm; the point of the needle
                    is stuck lightly in the end of a long stick. This is then introduced into the
                    mouth of a hole in which an eel is supposed to shelter. As soon as the eel sees
                    it he secures it, pulls it from the stick, and devours it. The string is lashed
                    to the middle of the needle, so that when the angler pulls at it the needle
                    turns crosswise in his gullet. The angler pulls with a steady strain at the
                    line, until at last the eel, unable to resist longer, comes out and is caught.
                    Clotting for eels, by means of a big bunch of worms strung upon worsted and
                    gathered up into festoons, is another way. The eels entangle their teeth in the
                    worsted, and are lifted out and dropped into a pail. A hundredweight in a night
                    has been caught in this way. They are chiefly caught, however, by baskets, nets,
                    or traps set in mill-weirs, when they are migrating, and in some places, at such
                    times, tons of eels are caught in a night. Fresh-water eels run up to a large
                    size. They have been known to exceed 20 Bb, but 4 or 5 S&gt; are more common,
                    and the average is from 1 to 2 lb. Hooks any size that is suitable—from 4 to
                    8.</p>

                <p>The gudgeon <hi rend="italic">{Cyprinus gobio)</hi> frequently forms the young
                    angler’s first quarry. This little fish abounds in large shoals in the Thames
                    and other rivers, six or seven dozen, or even more, frequently being taken at
                    one pitch. No ground-bait is required to attract them, but the bottom being
                    disturbed and harrowed by a heavy iron rake, the fish flock to the spot to
                    search for food in the <hi rend="italic">debris,</hi> and they will continue to
                    bite for some time, when another rake renews their avidity. A light cork float
                    and a small 10 or 11 hook, with a fragment of red worm, is all that is needed ·
                    for so eager are the little fellows, that they pull the float down with a dash,
                    so that the angler rarely misses his prey. A dish of gudgeons, gently fried,

                <p><hi rend="italic">On Tackle and Fly-Making.</hi></p>
                <p>It is exceedingly desirable that the angler should be able to make and repair his
                    own tackle. This will probably save him quite one-half of his outlay, and has
                    the satisfaction of knowing that he can trust to the tackle, which he cannot
                    always when he buys it; while, in case of accident, he can repair without delay,
                    when the impossibility of doing so might peril his day’s sport. The art of tying
                    strands of gut together and of whipping on a hook may be learnt in a minute; and
                    there is scarcely a book on angling that does not thoroughly explain it.
                    Fly-tying, however, requires more notice.</p>
                <p>The simplest form of trout-fly is the hackle, or palmerfly. Having whipped the
                    gut on to the hook with strong but fine silk, finishing at the bend of the hook,
                    take two or three strands from the peacock’s tail, known as harls, lay the ends
                    together at the bend of the hook and whip them on with the silk, wind the silk
                    on two-thirds up the hook, and then tie on the tip of a cock’s hackle. Fig. 13
                    (page 38) shows the position. Should it be desired, however, to run the hackle
                    all over the body, it may be tied on along with the peacock’s harls. In that
                    case, first wind on the harls round the hook side by side, avoiding the hackle,
                    until they reach the head of the hook, when they must be tied down and cut off;
                    then wind the hackle on likewise up to the head, pressing it down so as to make
                    the fibres point all towards the tail; and having reached the head, tie that
                    down too and snip off the waste, when fig. 14 is finished, and the hackle or
                    palmer-fly complete (see fig. 14). If it be required to produce a winged fly, a
                    little less hackle must be employed, and two slips of some suitable feather
                    placed together as a pair of wings, and whipped on as in fig. 15 (see fig. 15).
                    Should a tail be desired, two or three wisps of some suitable feather are
                    whipped on at the bend of the hook before tying on the harls, and if tinsel be
                    needed, that is tied on with the harl, and wound on over the body. Fig. 16 shows
                    the complete fly, with tail, tinsel, and all complete. Various matters are used
                    for bodies, as silk, wool, fur, Ac. How to put on fur will be told in tying the
                    salmon-fly.</p>
                <p>The method of tying a salmon-fly is rather more complicated than that used in the
                    trout-fly. Take a short piece of twisted gut or gimp, double it and lash it on
                    so as to leave an eye at the head, as in fig. 17 (see fig. 17); then take a
                    short fragment of tinsel or twist, and tie it on as shown; wind this round the
                    bend of the hook two or three times; this forms the tag, and may be seen
                    complete in fig. 18 (see fig. 18); over this tie on the tail, composed of fibres
                    or a topping, Ac., also shown in fig. 18<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Some flies have over this a couple of turns of ostrich hart
                    or other feather, which is called the but. It is not necessary, and serves no
                    purpose, but it is shown in the complete fly in fig. 20.</p></note> (see fig.
                    18); then tie in the silk or wool, or whatever the body is made with, also the
                    tinsel, if needed; having tied it in, carry the silk on until the spot where the
                    hackle is to commence is reached, then tie that in, and work the silk on to the
                    shoulder. The result of these preparations is shown in fig. 18 (see fig. 18).
                    Then wind on the silk or wool body evenly until it reaches the shoulder, when
                    fasten it off; next, wind on the tinsel in even spirals, and fasten that off in
                    the same way; next, the hackle, which may be stripped on one side, if it be
                    required, thinly, or prepared by pressing the fibres together, so as to make
                    them point as far as possible in the same direction. Having fastened off the
                    hackle, the fly appears as in fig. 19 (see fig. 19). Then having carefully left
                    a bit of the hook for the purpose, tie on the wing, which is composed of fibres
                    or strips of feathers laid together. This is a nice operation, and requires a
                    delicate but firm hand. After this, if it be needed, a head can be wound on over
                    the stump of the wing, and for that purpose a fragment of chenille is the best
                    substance. A few turns of the silk fixes the loop and finishes off, and a touch
                    of varnish secures it. The complete fly is shown in fig. 20. In using fur or
                    pig’s wool for a body, the long coarse fibres should be picked out and rejected;
                    the rest should be pulled into fragments, and then laid in a small ridge along
                    the palm of the hand and rolled over and over, as cigarette makers do their
                    tobacco; and having obtained sufficient coherence, it should be laid along the
                    silk, and the silk being twirled round rapidly, is incorporated with the fur,
                    which can then be wound on the hook to form the body of the fly. Various colours
                    may thus be employed in the same fly. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. f.)</hi><pb
