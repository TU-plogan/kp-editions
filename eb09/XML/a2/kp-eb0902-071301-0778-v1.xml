                <p><label type="entry">ASKEW, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ascue, Anne</hi></label>, one
                    of the numerous sufferers for the cause of the Reformation in the reign of Henry
                    VIII., was a lady of great worth and. beauty, of a good family in Lincolnshire,
                    and in correspondence with Queen Catherine Parr and the chief ladies of the
                    court. At first a Roman Catholic, she had gradually become convinced of the
                    falsity of transubstantiation; and her husband, irritated at her change of
                    religious opinions, compelled her to leave his house. On coming to London to
                    seek for a divorce she was arrested, and interrogated by Chancellor Wriothesley
                    and Bishop Bonner, at the instigation of whom, under threats of torture, she
                    signed a qualified recantation. She was imprisoned, and wrote to the king, says
                    Hume, “that as to the Lord’s Supper she believed as much as Christ himself had
                    said of it, and as much of His divine doctrine as the Catholic church had
                    required.” But while she could not be brought to acknowledge the king’s
                    explications, this declaration availed her nothing, and was rather regarded as a
                    fresh insult. She was cruelly racked in the presence, and it was said by the
                    hand, of the chancellor himself, in order to extort confession of those ladies
                    about court with whom she corresponded. Her fortitude and fidelity probably
                    saved the lives of the queen and others. She disclosed nothing, although her
                    limbs were so dislocated by the rack that, when condemned to be burnt alive she
                    could not stand, and was carried in a chair to Smith-field, where on 16th July
                    1546, she and four others underwent this terrible mode of execution with
                    undaunted courage.</p>
