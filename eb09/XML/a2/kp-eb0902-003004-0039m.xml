                    Marquis of</hi></label>, one of the most distinguished British generals of the
                    19th century, was born on the 17th of May 1768.∙ He was the eldest son of Henry
                    Lord Paget, first Earl of Uxbridge, of whose family of twelve sons and daughters
                    he was the last survivor. He received his early education at Westminster school,
                    and passed thence to Christchurch, Oxford, where he took the degree of Μ. A.
                    Quitting the university in 1790, he entered parliament the same year as member
                    for the Carnarvon group of boroughs, for which he sat six years. But to his
                    high-spirited and impetuous nature the soldier’s life was most attractive; and
                    during the excitement which was occasioned by the outbreak of the wars of the
                    French Revolution, Lord Paget raised on his father’s estate the regiment known
                    at first as the Staffordshire Volunteers, and afterwards as the 80th Foot in the
                    regular army. Of this regiment he was named lieutenant-colonel. Having entered
                    the army, and passed rapidly through the subordinate grades, he obtained his
                    commission as lieutenant-colonel on the 12th September 1793. In the following
                    year he commenced his career of active service in the campaign of Flanders,
                    under the Duke of York. So greatly did he distinguish himself, especially during
                    the retreat which followed the repulse of Turcoing, that notwithstanding his
                    youthful years, he was appointed, in the temporary absence of Lord Cathcart, to
                    the command of his brigade. Transferred soon after his return to England <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0040-0031"/> to a cavalry regiment, 16th Light Dragoons, he
                    was thenceforth attached to that branch of the service which he was to raise to
                    the highest degree of efficiency, and in connection with which he was to achieve
                    his greatest triumphs. About the same time (July 1795), Lord Paget married Lady
                    Caroline Elizabeth Villiers, daughter of the Earl of Jersey. Promoted colonel in
                    1796, he was transferred in April 1797 to the command of the 7th Light Dragoons,
                    and then began to apply himself strenuously to the improvement of discipline,
                    and the introduction of a new system of cavalry evolutions. In 1799 he took part
                    in the campaign, brief and disastrous, of the Duke of York in Holland. In the
                    general attack (Oct. 2) he distinguished himself by a dashing and successful
                    charge on a superior body of the enemy’s cavalry. On him devolved the arduous
                    task of guarding the rear in the retreat, and while thus engaged, he routed a
                    much larger body of French cavalry under General Simon, recovering some captured
                    cannon, and taking five of the enemy’s guns. Devoting himseif through the
                    following eight years, with zeal equal to his abilities, to the discharge of his
                    regimental duties, and to the perfecting of the reforms which he had previously
                    introduced, he attained the rank of major-general in April 1802, and that of
                    lieutenant-general in April 1808. At the close of this year the great war with
                    the French in the Peninsula began, and Lord Paget was sent, with two brigades of
                    cavalry, to join the division of the army under Sir David Baird, who was then
                    marching to join Sir John Moore in his advance on Salamanca. He landed at
                    Coruna, and in the face of very great difficulties succeeded in effecting the
                    junction. It was during this march that the first conflict with the French in
                    Spain took place,—a small party of French posted at Rueda being surprised and
                    cut off by Lord Paget. In the retreat ordered by Sir John Moore, after the fall
                    of Madrid, Lord Paget was charged with the protection of the rear, and,
                    notwithstanding the frequent harassing attacks of the enemy, the losses of the
                    British were trifling. He especially distinguished himself by brilliant and
                    successful encounters with the French at Sahagun, Mayorga, and Benevente. His
                    spirited repulse of the advanced guard of the French at Benevente, where he also
                    captured the commander of the imperial guard, General Lefebvre Desnouelles,
                    especially contributed to the safe arrival of the British at Coruna. At the
                    battle of Coruna, fought on the 16th January 1809, and mournfully memorable for
                    the fall of the brave Sir John Moore, Lord Paget had the command of the-reserve;
                    and while the dying commander was being carried from the field, his lordship, by
                    a swift, courageous movement, repulsed a superior force of the enemy, thus
                    deciding the fate of the day and securing the safe embarkation of the British
                    army. With this action his services in the Peninsular war terminated, and in the
                    autumn he returned to England, where he applied himself to his parliamentary
                    duties as member for Milbourne Port. He sat for that borough six years (1806 to
                    1812). In 1810 he obtained a divorce from his wife, by whom he had had eight
                    children, but with whom he had not lived a happy life. The same year he married
                    Lady Cowley, who had about the same time been divorced from Lord Cowley. Lady
                    Paget was soon after married to the Duke of Argyle. In 1812 he succeeded his
                    father and took his seat in the House of Lords as Earl of Uxbridge. Three years
                    later his services as general were called for on a grander field, and his
                    reputation was raised to the highest pitch. In the spring of 1815 all Europe was
                    startled by the news of the escape of Napoleon I. from his island prison, Elba,
                    of his reappearance in France at the head of an army, and of his reassumption of
                    the imperial dignity. Without delay the armies of the allies were sent again
                    into the field, the English under the Duke of Wellington as commander-in-chief,
                    and the English cavah ’ y under the command of the Earl of Uxbridge. At the
                    decisive battle of Waterloo (18th June), after twice leading the guards to the
                    charge, he placed himself at the head of the heavy brigade, and, by a third
                    rapid and terrific charge, completely overwhelmed the trusted French guards, led
                    by Count D’Erlon, making 3000 prisoners, and killing most of the rest. Other
                    brilliant feats followed, which won for the Earl of Uxbridge on that day a place
                    of honour second only to that of the great duke himself. In the confusion which
                    followed, Napoleon, from a low rising ground, directed the fire of four guns,
                    and by one of their discharges, almost the last shot that was fired, the earl
                    was struck on the knee, and amputation of the limb was found to be necessary.
                    This was effected in a private house at Waterloo, and the limb was buried in the
                    garden. Visitors are shown the chair in which the earl sat during the operation,
                    the boot taken from the amputated leg, and the monument over its burial-place. A
                    pension of £1200 a year was voted to him on account of the loss of his limb, but
                    he generously declined to accept it. Five days after the battle the services of
                    the earl were rewarded by the dignity of Marquis of Anglesey, conferred on him
                    by the Prince Regent; and he was soon after nominated Knight Grand Cross of the
                    Bath. Similar honours were bestowed on him by the emperors of Austria and Russia
                    and the king of Hanover. In 1818 he was elected Knight of the Garter. He
                    attained the full rank of general in the following year. This support of the
                    proceedings against Queen Caroline made him for a time unpopular, and when he
                    was on one occasion beset by a crowd, who compelled him to shout “The Queen,” he
                    added the wish, “May all your wives be like her.” At the coronation of George
                    IV. the Marquis of Anglesey filled the post of lord high steward of England. At
                    the close of April 1827 he became a member of the Canning administration, taking
                    the post of master-general of the ordnance, previously held by Wellington. He
                    was at the same time sworn a member of the privy council. Under the Wellington
                    administration he accepted the appointment of lord-lieutenant of Ireland (March
                    1828), and in the discharge of his important duties he greatly endeared himself
                    to the Irish people. The spirit in which he acted, and the aims which he
                    steadily set before himseif, contributed to the allaying of party animosities,
                    to the promotion of a willing submission to the laws, to the prosperity of
                    trade, and to the extension and improvement of education. On the great question
                    of the time his views were opposed to those of the Government. He saw clearly
                    that the time was come when the relief of the Catholics from the penal
                    legislation of the past was an indispensable measure; and in December 1828 he
                    addressed a letter to the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland distinctly
                    announcing his view. This led to his recall by the Government, a step sincerely
                    lamented by the Irish. He pleaded for Catholic emancipation in parliament, and
                    on the formation of Earl Grey’s administration, in November 1830, he again
                    became viceroy of Ireland. The times were changed; the great act of emancipation
                    had been accomplished, and the task of the viceroy in his second tenure of
                    office was to resist the agitation commenced and carried on by O’Connell. He
                    felt it his duty now to demand Coercion Acts for the security of the public
                    peace; his popularity was diminished, differences appeared in the cabinet on the
                    difficult subject, and in July 1833 the ministry resigned, the viceroy retiring
                    at the same time. To the Marquis of Anglesey Ireland is indebted for the Board
                    of Education, the origination of which may perhaps be reckoned as the most
                    memorable act of his viceroyalty. For thirteen years after his retirement he
                    remained out of office, and took little part in the affairs of government. He
                    joined the Russell administration<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0041-0032"/> in July 1846 as master-general of the ordnance,
                    finally retiring with his chief in March 1852. His promotion in the army was
                    continued by his appointment to the command of the horse guards in 1842, and
                    completed by his advancement to the rank of field-marshal in 1846. A life of
                    brave service and faithful devotion to duty was closed by a peaceful death on
                    the 29th April 1854. The character of the Marquis of Anglesey, appreciated and
                    admired by all classes and parties, was sketched by a contemporary journalist in
                    the following terms :—“Seldom have bravery, gentleness, and generosity been
                    combined in such noble proportions. In his character there was not a fold, it
                    was all open as the day. His politics were thoroughly liberal, and with more
                    far-sighted and sound statesmanship in them than the world has perhaps given him
                    credit for. . . . He had a sound, shrewd understanding, a judgment seldom at
                    fault, often acting like an instinct, and accompanied with a moral courage not
                    inferior to his brilliant physical bravery in the field of battle.” He
                    strenuously supported every measure of reform in church and state, and, with
                    sagacious forecast anticipating public opinion, earnestly advocated in their
                    days of unpopularity the great measures of Catholic emancipation, parliamentary
                    reform, and free trade. The marquis had a large family by each of his two
                    wives,—two sons and six daughters by the first, and six sons and four daughters
                    by the second. His eldest son, Henry, succeeded him in the marquisate (w. <hi
