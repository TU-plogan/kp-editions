                    ancient, and <hi rend="italic">λόγος,</hi> a description. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaeology,</hi> like that of <hi rend="italic">Antiquities,</hi>
                    has been employed, until a very recent period, in a sense so restricted and
                    arbitrary as strikingly to contrast with the latitude admissible according to
                    the original derivation of the word. Literally it signifies the study of
                    antiquity or ancient things; but its precise significance has been determined
                    from time to time by the range of study and research most in favour. To some
                    extent it has always been recognised as embracing whatever pertained to the
                    early history of any nation, but in its details it was applied almost
                    exclusively to the study of Greek and Roman art, or of classical antiquities
                    generally. The progress of geology, and the application of sound principles of
                    induction to the study of primitive antiquities, have wrought a great
                    revolution, and few studies now rival archaeology in comprehensive interest.</p>
                <p>In looking at the succession of strata of the earth’s crust it was assumed till
                    recently that the student of man and his remains is limited to the latest
                    superficial formation of post-tertiary strata. To the palaeontologist was
                    assigned all ancient animal life of the fossiliferous strata, while the
                    archaeologist treated of man and his works as things essentially distinct. The
                    diverse functions of the two sciences are still clearly recognised; but the
                    archaeologist is no longer supposed to be excluded either from quaternary or
                    tertiary strata in his search not only for the remains of human art, but for the
                    osteological evidences of man’s presence contemporaneous with the fauna of such
                    geological periods. One class of archaeologists, accordingly, confidently
                    anticipate the recovery not only of works of art, but of the fossil remains of
                    man himself, in the pliocene, or even the miocene strata. So far, however, as
                    any reliable evidence can guide opinion, it scarcely admits of question that
                    neither has hitherto been found in older deposits than the later tertiary, or
                    quaternary.</p>
                <p>The actual remains of man, the specific form of his osseous structure, and above
                    all of his skull, now receive the minutest attention; and the department of
                    anthropology to which such investigations are specially assigned has latterly
                    acquired a fresh interest from the inquiries suggested by novel theories as to
                    the possible evolution of man from lower animal organisations. Nevertheless, the
                    researches of the palaeontologist and of the archaeologist are based on
                    essentially distinct evidence. The life of geological periods is investigated by
                    means of the fossil bones and teeth which alone survive. Or if to these have to
                    be added such illustrations of habits, food, and structure as are furnished by
                    means of footprints, coprolites, and the like subsidiary evidence, still all are
                    traceable, directly or indirectly, to the living organism. Man, on the contrary,
                    in times altogether preceding history, is chiefly studied by means of his works.
                    Archaeology thus forms the intermediate link between geology and history, though
                    the reaction, at the revival of learning in the 16th century, which tended for a
                    time to subordinate arts and science alike to classical authority, reduced it
                    within greatly narrower limits. Nevertheless, the fitness of the term for the
                    most comprehensive definition in relation to all which pertains to the past
                    could not be entirely overlooked, and it is even employed repeatedly by Dr
                    Prichard as nearly synonymous with palaeontology. In this, however, he has not
                    been followed, and the name is now universally adopted to designate the science
                    which deduces the history of man from the relics of the past. So comprehensive a
                    subject necessarily admits of great subdivision. The most important general
                    division will be treated of separately in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Classical</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Archaeology</hi> (p. 343, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqq.),</hi> while interesting branches of the study will be reviewed under the
                    heads of Egyptian, Etruscan, Assyrian, Mexican, and Indian antiquities.
                    Numismatics, pottery, heraldry, hieroglyphics, palaeography, and other
                    subdivisions in lie manner deal with important details, and help to illustrate
                    the comprehensiveness of the subject.</p>
                <p>The innate cravings of the human mind for an insight into the future have shaped
                    themselves into many forms of divination and astrology. But this desire is not
                    more universal than that which prompts man to aim at a recovery of the secrets
                    of the past. The question <hi rend="italic">Whence</hi><hi rend="italic">Ï</hi>
                    even more than that of <hi rend="italic">Whitheri</hi> is found to give shape to
                    the mythic legends of the rude barbarian, and to constitute an important element
                    in the poetry and mythology of every nation’s oral and written history. With the
                    progress of society such indices of the past are subjected anew to critical
                    analyses; and we accordingly find abundant trace» of an archaeological spirit in
                    the literature of every civilised nation. The influence of the same craving for
                    a mastery of the past is seen adapting itself to the spirit of the age at every
                    epoch of great progress. The revival of art and letters in the 14th and 15th
                    centuries was signalised by a renewed appreciation of Greek and Roman models;
                    and while the progress of opinion in the 16th century was accompanied by an
                    abandonment of mediaeval for classic art, the tendency of Europe in our own day,
                    amid many elements of progress, has been singularly consentaneous in the return
                    not merely to mediaeval art, but to mediaeval modes and standards of thought,
                    and in the attempt to attain to higher excellence than has been yet achieved by
                    a more perfect development of the ideal of the middle ages.</p>
                <p>The alliance of archaeology with geology, and the direction of geological
                    research to the evidences of the antiquity of man, have largely contributed to
                    its expansion, until in its comprehensive unity it embraces the entire range of
                    human progress from the infantile stage of primeval arts to the earliest periods
                    of written records. It has thus been developed into a systematic science, by
                    which the intelligent investigator is enabled to pursue his researches with the
                    aid of evidence older than all written chronicles, and tσ recover chapters of
                    national infancy and youth heretofore-deemed beyond recall. The geologist, with
                    no aid from written records, follows out his inquiries through successive
                    periods of the earth’s history, and reveals the change» it has undergone, and
                    the character of the living being» which animated epochs of the globe ages
                    before man was-called into being. Beginning with the traces of life in the
                    primary fossiliferous strata, he passes on from system to system, disclosing a
                    vast succession of long extinct life, until in the latest diluvial formations he
                    points to the remains of animals identical with existing species, and even to
                    traces of human art—the evidence of the close of geological and the beginning of
                    archaeological periods. Hero-archaeological science ought to be ready to take up
                    the narrative, and with a more comprehensive minuteness of detail and greater
                    certainty as to the conclusions arrived at. Such, however, until very recently,
                    has not been the case. The geologist himself long confused the records of the
                    transitional period by his mistaken reference of all diluvial traces to the
                    Noachian deluge; and when, pausing, as he thus believed, at the dawn of the
                    historic period, he turned to the archaeologist for the subsequent chapters of
                    the history of life on our globe, it was only to receive a record of Roman
                    traces at best but meagrely supplementing the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0353-0334"/> minuter details of the historian. Nearly the same
                    was the case with all historic antiquity, with the single exception of the
                    wonderful monuments of Egypt, which preserve to us the records of a civilisation
                    in which we can recognise the origin of arts, letters, and all else to which the
                    culture of the oldest historical nations may be traced.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the evidences of the primitive arts, and the traces of a native
                    civilisation originating among the prehistoric races of Europe, had been long
                    familiar to the antiquary, though he failed to form any intelligent conception
                    of their significance as historical records. Their interpretation on an
                    intelligent and systematic principle is mainly due to the archaeologists and
                    ethnologists of Denmark and Sweden, who from their very geographical position
                    were happily freed from the confusing element of classical prejudices, and were
                    compelled to seek in other than Roman sources an origin for the abundant traces
                    of metallurgic art. Zealous British coadjutors speedily caught the hint, and
                    freed themselves from the trammels which had so long narrowed their aim; the
                    remains of primitive art were referred to true sources, or at least arranged
                    under an intelligent system of chronological sequence; and thus the desultory
                    and often misdirected labours of the antiquary have given place to researches
                    characterised by scientific accuracy.</p>
                <p>The system of primitive archaeology thus introduced has since been modified and
                    carried out into ampler details, as the fruit of more extended discoveries,
                    chiefly effected in France and England; but the three primary divisions, the
                    Stone, the Bronze, and the Iron Periods, are still retained. The arrangement is
                    warranted alike by evidence and by its practical convenience, though later
                    research has given to the stone period a comprehensiveness undreamt of before,
                    and so led to its subdivision into two ages of prolonged duration, with
                    distinctive characteristics of primitive art. (1.) The Stone Period, as the name
                    implies, is that in which the rude aboriginal arts, which the commonest
                    necessities of man call into operation, are assumed to have been employed
                    entirely on such available materials as stone, horn, bone, &amp;c. (2.) The
                    Bronze Period may in like manner admit of subdivision, though the term is
                    conveniently employed, in its most comprehensive sense, for that era of progress
                    in which the metallurgic arts appear to have been introduced and slowly
                    developed—first, by the simple use of native copper, followed by the application
                    of fire, the construction of moulds, and the discovery of such chemical
                    processes as the alloying of copper and tin, and the consequent production of
                    the beautiful and useful alloy which gives name to this the earlier metallurgic
                    era. (3.) The Iron Period marks the era of matured metallurgic arts, and the
                    accompanying progress consequent on the degree of civilisation which is the
                    inevitable concomitant of such a state of things. While, however, those
                    divisions hold good in their general application, they must not in every case be
                    applied too rigidly. The archaeologist is constantly recalled to the*
                    distinction between the researches of the palaeontologist, as dealing with the
                    traces of organic life, and his own study of the works of a rational being
                    marked by all the diversities traceable to the reasoning and volition of the
                    individual workman. Local facilities have also modified the arts of primitive
                    man in various ways. In some localities, as in North America, pure native copper
                    abounds; while on the other hand, in certain districts of Africa iron occurs in
                    such a condition that it appears to have been wrought by the primitive
                    metallurgist from very remote times.</p>
                <p>All those periods embrace eras concerning which no contemporary written records
                    exist; and in relation to most of them nearly as little is known directly as of
                    the older periods with which the geologist exclusively deals. It need not
                    therefore excite surprise that the process of induction established on this
                    basis has been challenged by historical writers of high standing, but whose
                    exclusive labours on the records of periods admitting of documentary evidence
                    and charter proof render them little disposed to sympathise with a course of
                    reasoning relative to the history of man, such as has, in the hands of the
                    geologist, revealed so much in relation to more ancient life. The further,
                    however, that research is pursued, alike into the habits of living races of
                    savages, and into the characteristics of the oldest traces of primitive art, the
                    more clearly does such a process of development, from the first rude working in
                    stone to the highest arts of the skilled metallurgist, become manifest.</p>
                <p>The Australians, the Maories of New Zealand, and the whole widely-scattered races
                    of the Polynesian Islands, the Caribs and other natives of the American
                    archipelago, with all the nomade tribes of the New World, from Patagonia to the
                    Arctic circle, were, when first discovered, without any knowledge of the metals
                    as such, and supplied their wants by means of implements and weapons of stone,
                    shell, bone, or wood. The civilised Mexicans and Peruvians, on the contrary,
                    when first visited by the Spaniards in the 16th century, were familiar with the
                    working of copper as well as gold,—though totally ignorant of iron, and also
                    retaining for common purposes many of the primitive stone weapons and
                    implements, only substituting the abundant obsidian of their volcanic region for
                    flint. Greece passed from its bronze to its iron age within the period embraced
                    in its literary history; and the mastery of the art of working the intractable
                    iron ore is traceable with tolerable clearness in the early history of Rome, not
                    very long before it came in contact with the trans-Alpine barbarians. Among most
                    of the Germanic and Celtic tribes iron appears to have been already known when
                    they first came in contact with the aggressive civilisation of the south; and
                    from one of them, the Norici (in whose country, in the Austrian valleys of the
                    Danube, this metal is still wrought with the highest skill), there is reason to
                    believe that the Romans acquired the art of making steel.</p>
                <p>If history is only to begin, as that of Britain has been made to do, with the
                    date of the first collision with invading Rome, then, no doubt, stone and bronze
                    periods are as meaningless as are eocene and miocene periods to the geologist
                    who assigns the Mosaic deluge as the source of the earliest phenomena of his
                    science. To those, however, who are willing to follow inductive reasoning to its
                    legitimate conclusions it must be apparent that it is no visionary theory, but a
                    system founded in well-established truth, which arranges the archaeological
                    records of primitive history and the remains of human art into stone, bronze,
                    and iron periods. Even here, however, an important distinction in the employment
                    of such materials as a basis of inductive reasoning indicates the greatness of
                    the revolution involved in the introduction among the living creatures
                    inhabiting this earth of a being endowed with intelligence, and supplementing
                    the natural resources of animal life by arts even of the most primitive kind. It
                    must indeed be borne in remembrance that geological and historical chronology
                    are very different things, and that the idea implied in the contemporaneousness
                    of strata bears a very slight approximation to the coincidence of
                    contemporaneous events and productions of an historical era. The doctrine of
                    geological continuity is indeed challenged in certain respects; but on the
                    whole, the geological formations, with their included organic remains, may be
                    assumed to obey a natural and unvarying order; and so, within the compass of
                    geological periods, to be of contemporaneous origin. But, notwithstanding
                    certain extreme assumptions, based on the theory of evolution, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n354/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0354-0335"/> involving the consequent existence of man in
                    remote geological eras, so far as all actual evidence can yet guide us, it is
                    correct to say that, geologically speaking, the entire history of man is
                    embraced in one period. But in the works of art, which form the bases of
                    archaeological induction, a new element—that of mind, or the reasoning faculty,
                    along with the imitative and social arts—is introduced, and greatly complicates
                    its subdivisions. The stone period of Britain or Denmark is analogous to that of
                    the Polynesian Islands. So closely do their tools and weapons resemble each
                    other that it requires a practised eye to distinguish the stone axe or flint
                    lance-head found in an ancient British barrow from implements brought by some
                    recent voyager from the islands of the Southern Ocean. Nor could the most
                    experienced archaeologist undertake in every case to discriminate between the
                    flint arrow-head dug from some primitive barrow of undated centuries before the
                    Christian era, and the corresponding weapon brought by some recent traveller
                    from Tierra del Fuego or regions beyond the Rocky Mountains. The inference is
                    therefore legitimate, that in those Polynesians, Fuegians, or Indians of the
                    North-West, we have examples of tribes in the same primitive stage as were the
                    aborigines of Europe during its stone period. Chronologically, however, the
                    stone period of Europe and that of the Pacific islands or the American continent
                    are separated by thousands of years. In like manner, the bronze age of Mexico
                    was undisturbed by all later elements when first brought into contact with the
                    matured civilisation of Europe in the 16th century, while the close of that of
                    Britain preceded the 1st century of our era. The same rule is applicable to the
                    primitive archaeology of all countries; and a fertile source of error and
                    misconception has already had its rise in the assumption that because Greece and
                    Italy, Germany, Gard, Scandinavia, and Britain, have all had their primitive
                    stone and bronze periods, therefore the whole must have been contemporaneous. It
                    cannot therefore be too strongly enforced as one of the most essential points of
                    variance in the reasoning of the geologist and the archaeologist, that the
                    periods of the latter, though synonymous, are not necessarily synchronous; but
                    that, on the contrary, nearly all the phenomena which pertain to the <hi
                    rend="italic">natural history</hi> of man, and to the historic development of
                    the race, may be witnessed in their various stages in contemporary races of our
                    own day—from rudimentary barbarism, and the absence of all arts essential to the
                    first dawn of civilisation, to a state of greatest advancement in the knowledge
                    and employment of such arts.</p>
                <p>Some progress has already been made in an approximation to certain chronological
                    data of much importance relative to such primitive periods of the history of
                    nations. But the archaeologist, as well as the geologist, is learning to deal
                    with periods of time which cannot always be measured either by years or
                    centuries, but rather must be gauged by those chronological stages in the
                    history of our planet in which epochs and periods take the place of definite
                    subdivisions of solar time. Nevertheless, geological evidence of changes which
                    are known to have occurred within the historic period supplies an important key
                    to the approximate duration of certain eras characterised by traces of human
                    art; and while by the intelligent observation of such remains in the superficial
                    strata, mingling with the fossil evidences of extinct and familiar species of
                    animal life, the link is supplied by which man takes his place in an unbroken
                    chain of creative existence, sweeping back into so remote a past, the evidences
                    of matured art pertaining to periods unrecorded by history supply later links of
                    the same chain, and reunite the present with all former ages.</p>
                <p>The system of primitive archaeology which is found applicable to British
                    antiquities so closely corresponds in all its essential features to that of
                    Europe prior to the era of authentic history, that the purpose of such an
                    abstract as this will be most conveniently accomplished by presenting its
                    leading points as examples of the whole, illustrating these in passing by the
                    analogous remains discovered in other countries. The apparent simplicity of a
                    primitive stone period has been considerably modified by recent research; and
                    the careful study of the remains of ancient art, in their relation to
                    accompanying geological phenomena, or of the evidences of artificial deposition
                    in caves, barrows, chambered cromlechs, cairns, or other sepulchral structures,
                    suggests the subdivision of prehistoric archaeology into a succession of epochs
                    included within the period of non-metallurgic arts.</p>
                <p>But before defining the archaeological subdivisions of time it is indispensable
                    to glance at the palaeontological elements of the question, and the evidences
                    they supply in relation to comparative chronology. One of the most remarkable
                    phenomena affecting the conditions of life in Europe in recent geological epochs
                    is the existence of a period, of long duration throughout the northern
                    hemisphere, of a temperature resembling that of the Arctic regions at the
                    present time. After a period more nearly approximating in its conditions the
                    heat‘of the tropics at the present day, though otherwise under varying states
                    towards the end of the tertiary epoch the temperature of the whole northern
                    hemisphere gradually diminished, until the mountainous regions of Scotland and
                    Wales—then probably of a much higher elevation—resembled Greenland at the
                    present time; and this Arctic temperature gradually extended southwards to the
                    Alps and the Pyrenees. The glaciers formed under the influence of perpetual
                    frost and snow descended froπi those and other mountains into the valleys and
                    plains over the greater portion of central Europe and northern Asia; and this
                    condition of things, pertaining to what is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glacial period,</hi> was one of greatly prolonged duration.</p>
                <p>After some partial modifications of this low temperature, and a consequent
                    advance and retrocession of the glacial influences in France and elsewhere,
                    along what was then the border lines of a north temperate zone, the glacial
                    period drew to a close; a gradual but persistent rise of temperature carried the
                    lines of ice and perpetual snow further and further northward, excepting in
                    regions of great elevation, as in the Swiss Alps. This was necessarily
                    accompanied by the melting of the vast glaciers accumulated in the mountain
                    valleys throughout the protracted period of cold. The broken rocks and soil of
                    the highlands were swept into the valleys’by torrents of melted ice and snow;
                    the lower valleys were hollowed out and re-formed under this novel agent; and
                    the landscape received its present outlines of valley, estuary, and river-beds
                    from the changes wrought in this <hi rend="italic">diluυian epoch.</hi> The
                    enormous power of the torrents thus acting continuously throughout a period of
                    prolonged duration, and the vast deposits of sand, gravel, and clay, with the
                    embedded remains of contemporaneous animal and vegetable life with which they
                    everywhere covered the plains, were viewed till recently solely in relation to
                    the Mosaic narrative of a universal deluge, and were referred implicitly to that
                    source. But recent though the epoch is when compared with older geological
                    periods, its antiquity is enormous in relation to historic chronology; and
                    instead of being the product of a sudden cataclysm of brief duration, it
                    represents phenomena which required a period of long protracted centuries for
                    their evolution.</p>
                <p>Within this late tertiary, or quaternary, period are found the remains of animal
                    life contemporary with primeval nιs,n and his earliest arts. The very
                    characteristics of some of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n355/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0355-0336"/> the fossil mammals of the period, so diverse from
                    all that vve have been accustomed to associate with man, help to suggest ideas
                    of even an exaggerated antiquity for the era to which they are assignable, and
                    to relegate it to the remotest conceivable antiquity consistent with all other
                    evidence of the oldest traces of man or his arts seemingly contemporaneous with
                    them. Of those now wholly extinct, the mammoth or <hi rend="italic">Elephas
                    primigenius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Elephas antiquus,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinoceros tichorinus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Hippopotamus
                    major,</hi> and such great cave carnivora as the <hi rend="italic">Ursus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">speloeus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Felis spelaea,</hi> are
                    most noticeable for their great size, and in some cases for their enormous
                    destructive powers, in striking contrast to the seemingly helpless condition of
                    primitive man. Yet even some of those formidable mammalia probably owed their
                    extinction fully as much to the presence of man as to any change in temperature
                    and consequent alteration in the required conditions of climate and habitat. We
                    are accustomed to regard the lion, tiger, leopard, panther, and others of the
                    great <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> as pertaining exclusively to tropical
                    countries. They are in reality limited to tropical jungles and uncultivated
                    regions of great extent, where the abundance of wild vegetablefeeding animals
                    supplies their food. The existence of neither is compatible with the presence of
                    man in any great numbers; but in his absence those beasts of prey greatly extend
                    their range. The Indian tiger not only follows the antelope and deer in the
                    Himalayan chain to the verge of perpetual snow, but the tiger, leopard, panther,
                    and cheetah hunt their prey beyond that mountain range, even into Siberia.</p>
                <p>The influence of man in the extirpation of the wild fauna is illustrated by
                    another class of extinct animals of many historical regions, which yet survive
                    in more favourable localities. The discovery of abundant evidence of a period in
                    the history of central and southern France when the reindeer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">tarandus)</hi> formed one of the chief sources
                    both for the food of man and for the materials from which his weapons and
                    implements were made, seems to carry us back to an era, inconceivably remote,
                    when central France was in the condition of Lapland in mediaeval or still
                    earlier centuries. But the climate of North Britain is not even now incompatible
                    with the existence of the reindeer, and its favourite moss abounds in many parts
                    of the Highlands. It need not therefore surprise us to learn that traces of the
                    reindeer are by no means rare in Scotland; and numerous examples of its horns
                    have recently been recovered in more than one Caithness locality, with the marks
                    of sawing and cutting for artificial use, and lying among other remains i⅛
                    stone-built structures of a primitive population of North Britain. How old they
                    are may not be strictly determinable, but they help us to the acceptance of a
                    very modem date for the presence of the reindeer there; for Torfaeus states that
                    so recently as the twelfth century the Jarls of Orkney were wont to crose the
                    Pentland Firth to chase the roe and the reindeer in the wilds of Caithness. At
                    the same date also we find the skin of the beaver rated for customs duties
                    amongst articles of Scottish export specified in an Act of the reign of David
                    I.</p>
                <p>Another very characteristic animal pertaining to the prehistoric era of European
                    man is the <hi rend="italic">Megcbceros Hibernicus,</hi> or gigantic Irish elk.
                    Its bones occurred with those of the <hi rend="italic">Elephas primigenius,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros tichoτimιs,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">speloeus,</hi> and other extinct mammals, alongside
                    of human remains and works of art, in the famous Aurignac cave of the Pyrenees;
                    and in the recently-explored Brixham cave, on the Devonshire coast, similar
                    remains of the fossil rhinoceros, horse, and reindeer, as well as of several
                    extinct carnivora, lay embedded in the same breccia with flint knives. And not
                    only have the horns and bones of the <hi rend="italic">Megaceros Hibernicus</hi>
                    been recovered from Irish bogs and marl-pits, with marks of artificial cutting,
                    but a rude Irish lyre, found in the moat of Desmond Castle, Adare, has been
                    pronounced by Professor Owen to be made from the bone of this extinct deer.</p>
                <p>So is it with the ancient <hi rend="italic">Bovidae,</hi> not only adapted for
                    the chase, but suitable for domestication; such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">primigenius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Bos
                    longifrons,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bison</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >priscus.</hi> Their remains have been found in submarine forests, or mingling
                    in the drift or cave deposits with the <hi rend="italic">Elephas
                    primigenius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >speloea,</hi> and others of the most gigantic fossil mammals; while abundant
                    traces reveal their existence not merely contemporaneous with man, but within
                    definite historical periods.</p>
                <p>The great alluvial valley of the river Forth has yielded another class of relics
                    connecting the gigantic fossil mammalia of a prehistoric epoch with man. The
                    disclosures of the Carse of Falkirk have repeatedly included remains of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elephas primigenius:</hi> and in at least one case its tusks were
                    found in such perfect condition as to be available for the ivory-turner, though
                    lying embedded at a depth of 20 feet in the boulder clay. But in the
                    neighbouring valley of the Forth the fossil whale <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Balaenoptera)</hi> has not only been repeatedly found far inland, buried in
                    the alluvial soil, at levels varying from 20 to 25 feet above high-water mark,
                    but in at least two instances the rude lance or harpoon of deer’s horn lay
                    alongside of the skeletons; and near another of them were found pieces of stag’s
                    horn, artificially cut, and one of them perforated with a hole about an inch in
                    diameter. Flint implements, an oaken quern, and other ingenious traces of
                    primitive art, recovered from the same alluvial soil, all tell of a time when
                    the British savage hunted the whale in the shallows of a tide at the base of the
                    Ochil hills, now between 20 and 30 feet above the highest tides and 7 miles
                    distant from the sea.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the disappearance of the whale from the British shores,
                    like the reindeer from its northern valleys, is due far more to the presence of
                    man than to any change of temperature so greatly affecting the conditions of
                    life as to involve their extinction. Nevertheless it is convenient to recognise
                    in the disappearance of-such emigrant species from the historic areas the close
                    of the palaeontological age. The Urus, the Aurochs, the <hi rend="italic">Bos
                    longifrons,</hi> or native ox of the Roman period, and others of that important
                    class of animals which man first began to turn to account for domestication,
                    have also ceased to exist among European fauna; but this is clearly traceable to
                    the destructive presence of man. Within three or four centuries the Urus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">primigenius')</hi> was still known in
                    Germany; the Aurochs <hi rend="italic">(Bos</hi><hi rend="italic">priscus)</hi>
                    is even now preserved under special protection in Lithuania; and herds of
                    British .wild cattle in Cadzow forest, Lanarkshire, and at Chillingham Park,
                    Northumberland, perpetuate varieties otherwise extinct.</p>
                <p>Reverting, then, to the classification which prehistoric archaeology admits of,
                    in the light of its most recent disclosures, it appears to be divisible into
                    four distinct epochs, of which the first two embrace successive stages of the
                    age of stone implements.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">Palaeolithic Period</hi> is that which has also been
                    designated the Drift Period. The troglodytes, or cave-dwellers, of this
                    primitive era were to all appearance contemporaneous with the mammoth, the
                    woolly-haired rhinoceros, and the great cave carnivora already named. In
                    England, France, Belgium, and other countries of Europe, numerous caves have
                    been explored which were undoubtedly the habitations and workshops of the men of
                    this period. These caverns vary in character and dimensions according to the
                    geological features of the localities where they occur; but all alike involve
                    the simple feature <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n356/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0356-0337"/> of recesses, more or less ample, affording
                    comparatively dry and commodious shelter, and so being resorted to as places of
                    habitation alike by wild animals and by man himself. But the most valuable for
                    the purposes of the archaeologist are a class of caverns which occur in
                    limestone districts, and which, from the combined mechanical action of the water
                    operating on a rock easily eroded, and its chemical action when charged with a
                    certain amount of carbonic acid in dissolving the calcareous rock, are found
                    expanded into long galleries and chambers of large dimensions. There the same
                    chemical agents, acting under other circumstances, have dissolved the limestone
                    rock, and sealed up the ancient flooring at successive intervals, thereby
                    furnishing a test of the duration of long periods of alternate action and
                    repose, and yielding evidence of the most indisputable kind as to the order of
                    succession of the various deposits and their included bones and implements.</p>
                <p>In Belgium, at Dordogne, and in some parts of the south of France, the caves and
                    rock-recesses are of a much simpler character. Yet there also favouring
                    circumstances have preserved contemporary deposits of the ancient cave-dwellers,
                    their works of art, the remains of their food, and even their cooking
                    hearths.</p>
                <p>The caves of the drift period accordingly present peculiarly favourable
                    conditions for the study of the postpliocene period. Some of these caverns were
                    evidently first occupied by the extinct carnivora of that period, as in i he
                    case of the famous Kent’s Hole Cave of Devonshire, of which the lowest deposit
                    is a breccia of water-worn rock and red clay, interspersed with numerous bones
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">speloeus,</hi> or great
                    cave-bear. Over this a stalag-mitic flooring had been formed, in some places to
                    a depth of several feet, by the long-protracted deposition of carbonate of lime
                    held in solution in the drippings from the roof. Above this ancient flooring,
                    itself a work of centuries, later floods had superimposed a thick layer of
                    “cave-earth,” in some cases even entirely filling up extensive galleries with a
                    deposit of drift-mud and stones, within which are embedded the evidences of
                    contemporaneous life—bones and teeth of the fossil elephant, rhinoceros, horse,
                    cave-bear, hyaena, reindeer, and Irish elk; and along with these, numerous
                    weapons and implements of chipped flint, horn, and bone—the unmistakable proofs
                    of the presence of man. These, again, have been sealed down, in another
                    prolonged period of rest, by a new flooring of stalagmite; and thus the peculiar
                    circumstances of those cave deposits render them specially favourable for the
                    preservation of a coherent record of the period. Here are the evidences of the
                    animal life contemporaneous with the men of the caves during the drift period;
                    here also are many of their smaller flint implements—the flint-cures and the
                    chips and flint-flakes, showing where their actual manufacture was carried on;
                    and the lances, bodkins, and needles of bone, which could only have been
                    preserved under such favouring circumstances.</p>
                <p>But besides the actual deposits in the caves, the river gravels of the same
                    period have their distinct disclosures. The spear-heads, discs, scrapers, and
                    other large implements of chipped flint are of rare occurrence in the cave
                    breccia. Their size was sufficient to prevent their being readily dropt and
                    buried beyond reach of recovery in the muddy flooring of the old cave dwelling;
                    and the same cause preserved them from destruction when exposed to the violence
                    involved in the accumulation of the old river drifts. In the north of France,
                    and in England from Bedfordshire southward to the English Channel, in beds of
                    ancient gravel, sand, and clay of the river valleys, numerous discoveries of
                    large flint implements have been made—from the year 1797, when the first noted
                    flint implements of the drift were discovered in the same stratified gravel of
                    Hoxne, in Suffolk, in which lay bones of the fossil elephants and other extinct
                    mammalia. The characteristics of the river-drift implements, as well as of the
                    whole art of the stone age, have been minutely described and illustrated in
                    various works, but especially in Evans’s <hi rend="italic">Ancient Stone
                    Implements, Weapons, and Ornaments of Great Britain.</hi> It is sufficient,
                    therefore, to refer to such authorities for details.</p>
                <p>But besides the numerous specimens of the manufactures in flint, horn, and bone,
                    illustrative of the mechanical ingenuity of this primitive era, special
                    attention is due to the actual evidences of imitative and artistic skill of the
                    sculptors and draughtsmen of the same period.</p>
                <p>Different attempts have been made, especially by French <hi rend="italic"
                    >savans,</hi> to subdivide the palaeontologic age of man into a succession of
                    periods, based chiefly on the character of the mammalian remains accompanying
                    primitive works of art; and the two great subdivisions of the elephantine or
                    mammoth age and the reindeer age have been specially favoured. Among the works
                    of art of the cave-men of Perigord, in central France, contemporary with the
                    reindeer, various drawings of animals, including the reindeer itself, have been
                    found incised on bone and stone, apparently with a pointed implement of flint.
                    But the most remarkable of all is the portrait of a mammoth, seemingly executed
                    from the life, outlined on a plate of ivory found in the Madelaine Cave, on the
                    river Vezère, by Μ. Lartet, when in company with Μ. Verneuil and Dr Falconer. If
                    genuine—and the circumstances of the discovery, no less than the character of
                    the explorers, seem to place it above suspicion—this most ancient work of art is
                    of extreme value. The skulls and other remains of five individuals have been
                    found to illustrate the men of this period. The cerebral development is good,
                    and alike in features and form of head they compare favourably with later savage
                    races. Their drawings embrace animals, single and in groups, including the
                    mammoth, reindeer, horse, ox, fish of different kinds, flowers, ornamental
                    patterns, and also ruder attempts at the human form. They also carved in bone
                    and ivory. Some of the delineations are as rude as any recent specimens of
                    savage art, others exhibit considerable skill; but the most remarkable of all is
                    the representation of the mammoth. It has been repeatedly engraved, and as, to
                    all appearance, a genuine contemporary effort at the portraiture of that
                    remarkable animal, its worth is considerable. But this sinks into insignificance
                    in comparison with its value as a gauge of the intellectual capacity of the men
                    of that remote age. It represents the extinct elephant, sketched with great
                    freedom of hand, and with an artistic boldness in striking contrast to the
                    laboured efforts of an untutored draughtsman. Whatever other inference be
                    deduced from it, this is obvious, that in intellectual aptitude the palaeolithic
                    men of the reindeer period of central France were in no degree inferior to the
                    average Frenchman of the 19th century.</p>
                <p>2. This first or palaeolithic period, with its characteristic implements of
                    chipped flint, belonging to an epoch in which man occupied central Europe
                    contemporaneously with the mammoth, the cave-bear, and other long-extinct
                    mammals, was followed by the second or <hi rend="italic">Neolithic Period,</hi>
                    or, as it has been sometimes called, the Surface-Stone Period, in contradiction
                    to the Drift Period, characterised by weapons of polished flint and stone. The
                    discovery and exploration of the ancient <hi rend="italic">Pfahlbauten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> qt</hi> lake villages of Switzerland and other
                    countries, including the crannoges of Ireland and Scotland, and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">kjökken-möddings</hi> or refuse-heaps of Denmark, Scotland, and
                    elsewhere, have greatly extended the illustrations of this period, and given
                    definiteness to the evidences of its antiquity. But while it thus includes works
                    of a very remote epoch, it also <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n357/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0357-0338"/> embraces those of later regular sepulture, with
                    the sepulchral pottery of rudest type, the personal ornaments and other remains
                    of the prehistoric races of Europe, onward to the dawn of history. It even
                    includes the first traces of the use of the metals, in the employment of gold
                    for personal adornment, though with no intelligent recognition of its
                    distinction from the flint and stone in which the workmen of this neolithic
                    period chiefly wrought.</p>
                <p>The nearly indestructible nature of the materials in which the manufacturers
                    alike of the palaeolithic and the neolithic period chiefly wrought, helps to
                    account for the immense number of weapons and implements of the two prolonged
                    ages of stone-working which have been recovered. The specimens now accumulated
                    in the famous collection of the Christiansborg Palace at Copenhagen amount to
                    several thousands. The Royal Irish Academy, the Society of Antiquaries of
                    Scotland, the British Museum, and other collections, in like manner include many
                    hundreds of specimens, ranging from the remotest periods of the cave and drift
                    men of western Europe to the dawn of definite history within the same European
                    area. They include hatchets, adzes, gouges, chisels, scrapers, discs, and other
                    tools in considerable variety; axes, lances, spear and arrow heads, mauls,
                    hammers, and other weapons and implements of Avar and the chase; besides a
                    variety of utensils, implements, and ornaments, with regard to which we can but
                    vaguely guess the design of their construction. Many of these are merely chipped
                    into shape, sometimes with much ingenuity, in other cases as rudely as the most
                    barbarous and massive implements of the palaeolithic period. But from their
                    association, in graves or other clearly-recognised deposits of the later period,
                    with ground and polished implements, and even occasionally with the first traces
                    of a time when the metals were coming into use, there is no room to question
                    their later origin. In part they may be legitimately recognised, like the whole
                    elements of archaeological classification, to mark different degrees of rudeness
                    in successive steps towards civilisation; in part they indicate, as in
                    manufactures of our own day, the economy of labour in roughly-fashioned
                    implements designed only for the rudest work, or for missiles the use of which
                    involved their loss.</p>
                <p>To the same primitive period of rude savage life must be assigned the rudiments
                    of architectural skill pertaining to the <hi rend="italic">Megalithic Age.</hi>
                    Everywhere we find traces, alike throughout the seats of oldest civilisation and
                    in earliest written records, including the historical books of the Old Testament
                    Scriptures, of the erection of the simple monolith, or unhewn pillar of stone,
                    as a record of events, a monumental memorial, or a landmark. There is the Tanist
                    Stone, or kingly memorial, like that set up in Shechem when Abimelech was made
                    king; the Hoar Stone, or boιmdary-stone, like “the stone of Bohan, the son of
                    Reuben,” and other ancient landmarks of Bible story; the Cat Stone, or
                    battle-stone, a memorial of some great victory; and the stone set up as the
                    evidence of some special treaty or agreement, like Laban and Jacob’s pillar of
                    witness at Galeed. To the same primitive stage of architecture belong the
                    cromlech, the cairn, the chambered baιτow, and other sepulchral structures of
                    unhewn stone; as well as the weems, or megalithic subterranean dwellings common
                    in Scotland and elsewhere, until, with the introduction of metals and the
                    gradual mastery of metallurgic art, we reach the period of partially hewn and
                    symmetrical structures, of which the great temple of Stonehenge is the most
                    remarkable example. But it is in Egypt that megalithic architecture is seen in
                    its most matured stage, with all the massiveness which so aptly symbolises
                    barbarian power, but also with a grandeur, due to artistic taste and refinement,
                    in which the ponderous solidity of vast megalithic structures is relieved by the
                    graces of colossal sculpture and of an inexhaustible variety of architectural
                    detail. There appears to be a stage in the development of the human mind in its
                    progress towards civilisation when an unconscious aim at the expression of
                    abstract power tends to beget an era of megalithic art. The huge cromlechs,
                    monoliths, and circles still abounding in many centres of European civilisation
                    perpetuate the evidence of such a transitional stage among its prehistoric
                    races. But it was in Egypt that an isolation, begot by the peculiar conditions
                    of its unique physical geography, though also perhaps ascribable in part to
                    certain ethnical characteristics of its people, permitted this megalithic art to
                    mature into the highest perfection of which it is capable. There the rude unhewn
                    monolith became the graceful obelisk, the cairn was transformed into the
                    symmetrical pyramid, and the stone circles of Avebury and Stonehenge, or the
                    megalithic labyrinths of Carnac in Brittany, developed into colonnaded avenues
                    and temples, like those of Denderah and Edfu, or the colossal sphinx avenue of
                    Luxor.</p>
                <p>Elaborately-finished axes, hammer-heads, cups, and vases of the late neolithic
                    era serve to illustrate the high stage to which the arts of a purely stone
                    period could be advanced, in the absence of any process of arrestment or change.
                    But long before such a tendency to development into ornamental detail and
                    symmetrical regularity of construction could be brought to bear on the
                    megalithic architecture of the same era, the metallurgic sources of all later
                    civilisation had begun to supersede its rude arts. To such remote eras we strive
                    in vain to apply any definite chronology. At best we work our way backwards from
                    the modem or known into the mysterious darkness of remotest antiquity, where it
                    links itself to unmeasured ages of geological time. But by such means science
                    has been able to add a curious chapter to the beginnings of British and of
                    European story, involving questions of mysterious interest in relation to the
                    earliest stages in the history of man. The very characteristics which
                    distinguish him in his rudest stage from all other animals have helped from
                    remotest times to perpetuate the record of his progress.</p>
                <p>The evidences of the various acquirements and degrees of civilisation of the
                    prehistoric races of Britain are derived not only from weapons, implements,
                    pottery, and personal ornaments found deposited in ancient dwellings and
                    sepulchres; but from still older traces supplied by chance discoveries of the
                    agriculturist, miner, and builder, such as the implements of the ancient whalers
                    of the Forth, or the monoxylous oaken canoes dug up from time to time in the
                    valley of the Clyde, or even beneath some of the most ancient civic foundations
                    of Glasgow. Both alike pertain to areas of well-defined historical antiquity,
                    from the very dawn of written history, or of literate chronicles in any form;
                    and both also have their geological records, preserving the evidence of changes
                    of level in unrecorded centuries subsequent to the advent of man, when the
                    whales of the Forth and the canoes of the Clyde were embedded in the alluvium of
                    those river-valleys, and elevated above the ancient tide-marks of their
                    estuaries. Another change of level, possibly in uninterrupted continuance of the
                    ancient upheaval, has been in progress since the Roman invaders constructed
                    their military roads, and built their wall between the Forth and the Clyde, in
                    the 1st and 2d centuries of the Christian era.</p>
                <p>By evidence such as this a starting-point is gained whence we may confidently
                    deduce the colonisation of the British Islands, and of the north of Europe, at
                    periods separated by many centuries from that in which our island first figures
                    in history. The researches of the ethnologist add to our knowledge of this
                    unrecorded era, by disclosing some of the physical characteristics of the
                    aboriginal <pb break="no"

                    cave-drifts, ancient mining shafts, bogs, and marl-pits, or found in the most
                    ancient sepulchres, accompanied by rudest evidences of art; and the researches
                    of Nillson, Eschricht, Gosse, Rathke, Broca, and other Continental ethnologists,
                    along with those which have been carried on with minute care in the British
                    Islands, disclose characteristic cranial types indicating a succession of
                    prehistoric races different from the predominant types belonging to the
                    historical period of Europe; and some of them probably contemporaneous with the
                    changes indicated in the periods of archaeological time.</p>
                <p>The very latest stage of archaeological antiquity, when it seems to come in
                    contact with the dawn of historic time, was unquestionably one of complete
                    barbarism, as is sufficiently apparent from its correspondence to that which the
                    intercourse with European voyagers is bringing to a close among the islands of
                    the Pacific. The ancient Scottish subterranean dwellings termed weems (Gaelic
                    <hi rend="italic">uamluιlι,</hi> a cave), or “Picts’ houses,” have been
                    frequently found, apparently in the state in which they must have been abandoned
                    by their original occupants; and from those we learn that their principal
                    aliment must have been shellfish and Crustacea, derived from the neighbouring
                    sea-beach, along with the chance products of the chase. The large accumulations
                    of the common shell-fish of our coasts found in some of those subterranean
                    dwellings is remarkable; though along with such remains the stone quern or
                    handmill, as well as the ruder corn-crusher or pestle and mortar, repeatedly
                    occur; supplying the important evidence that the primitive nomade had not been
                    altogether ignorant of the value of the cereal grains.</p>
                <p>The source of change in Britain, and throughout Europe, from this rude state of
                    barbarism, is clearly traceable to the introduction of metals and the discovery
                    of the art of smelting ores. Gold was probably the earliest metal wrought, both
                    from its attractive appearance, and from its superficial deposits, and the
                    condition in which it is frequently found, rendering its working an easy
                    process. Tin also, in the south of Britain, was wrought at the very dawn of
                    history: and, with the copper which abounds in the same district of country,
                    supplied the elements of the new and important compound metal, bronze.</p>
                <p>3. This accordingly indicates the transition from the later stone age to the
                    third or <hi rend="italic">Bronze Period,</hi> which, beginning apparently with
                    the recognition of the native copper as a malleable metal, and then as a
                    material capable of being melted and moulded into form by the application of
                    heat, was followed up by the art of smelting the crude ores so as to extract the
                    metal, and that of mixing metals in diverse proportions so as to prepare an
                    alloy of requisite ductility or hardness, according to the special aims of the
                    artificer.</p>
                <p>Along with the full mastery of the working in copper and bronze the skill of the
                    goldsmith was correspondingly developed; and the ornaments of this period,
                    including torques, armlets, beads, and other personal decorations and insigma of
                    office, wrought in gold, are numerous, and often of great beauty. The pottery of
                    the same period exhibits corresponding improvement in material, form, and
                    ornamentation; though, considering the mimetic and artistic skill shown in the
                    drawings and carvings of the remotest periods, it is remarkable that the
                    primitive pottery of Europe is limited, alike in shape and decoration, to purely
                    arbitrary forms. This in its crudest conventionalism consists almost exclusively
                    of varieties of zigzag patterns scratched or indented on the soft clay. This
                    primitive ornamentation seems so natural, as the first esthetic promptings of
                    the human mind, that it is difficult, if not in some cases impossible, to
                    distinguish between the simple pottery of comparatively recent origin, recovered
                    on the sites of old American Indian villages, and primitive pottery obtained
                    from British barrows pertaining to centuries long prior to the Christian era.
                    But the fictile ware exhibits an improvement in some degree corresponding to
                    that of the metallurgic art, which everywhere throughout Europe furnishes
                    weapons, implements, and personal ornaments of the bronze period, characterised
                    by much grace and delicacy in form, and by an ornamentation peculiar in style,
                    but not unworthy of the novel forms and material.</p>
                <p>It was long assumed, alike by historians and antiquaries, that the beautiful
                    bronze swords, spear-heads, shields, torques, armillae, &lt;fcc., so frequently
                    discovered, were mere relics of foreign conquest or barter, and they were
                    variously assigned to Egyptian, Phoenician, Roman, or Danish origin. But this
                    gratuitous assumption has been disproved by the repeated discovery of the moulds
                    for making them, as well as of the refuse castings, and even of beds of
                    charcoal, scoriae, and other indications of metallurgy, on the sites where they
                    have been found. It has not escaped notice, however, that the transition appears
                    to be an abrupt one from stone to bronze, an alloy requiring skill and
                    experience for its use; and that few examples are recorded of the discovery of
                    copper tools or weapons, though copper is a metal so easily wrought as to have
                    been in use among the Red Indians of America. The inference from this fact is
                    one which all elements of probability tend to confirm, viz., that the
                    metallurgic arts of the north of Europe are derived from a foreign source,
                    whether by conquest or traffic; and that in the beautiful bronze relics so
                    abundant, especially in the British Islands and in Denmark, we see the fruits of
                    that experience which the more ancient civilisation of Egypt and Phoenicia had
                    diffused. The direct intercourse between the countries on the Mediterranean and
                    the Cassiterides, or Tin Islands,—as the only known parts of the British Islands
                    are called in the earliest allusions which are made to them by Herodotus,
                    Aristotle, and Polybius,— abundantly accounts for the introduction of such
                    knowledge to the native Britons at a veιy remote period. Phoenician and
                    Carthaginian merchant ships traded to Cornwall centuries before the white cliffs
                    of Albion were first seen from the Roman war-galleys. Greece also, not
                    improbably, proved a mediator in this all-important transfer. It is at least to
                    be noted that the forms of weapons, and especially of the beautiful “leaf-shaped
                    sword,” as figured on the most ancient painted Greek vases, closely correspond
                    to the most characteristic relics of the bronze period in the north of Europe
                    and the British Isles.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the characteristics of tlιis bronze period, the disclosures of
                    native art on the American continent supply some singularly interesting and
                    suggestive illustrations. There, throughout the whole northern regions of the
                    North American continent and in the ruder areas of South America, as well as in
                    the West Indian archipelago, a population was found consisting exclusively of
                    rude nomad hunters, in a pure stone period of primitive savage art. Nor does it
                    at all conflict with this that they were to a certain extent familiar with the
                    resources of the rich copper regions of Lake Superior, where that metal is found
                    in enormous masses in a malleable state. This they procured, and not only
                    themselves employed it in the manufacture of weapons, implements, and personal
                    ornaments, but distributed it by barter far down the Ohio and Mississippi
                    valleys, and eastward to the great lakes, to the St Lawrence valley, and to the
                    Hudson river. Silver and lead are also found in the same rich mineral region in
                    metallic crystals, and were not unknown to the nativo tribes. But everywhere
                    those metals were cold-wrought, as a mere malleable stone capable of being
                    hammered into any desired shape, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0359-0340"/> but in total ignorance of the influence of fire
                    or the use of alloys.</p>
                <p>But wholly distinct from its rude Indian tribes, North America had its
                    semi-civilised Mexicans and South America its more highly civilised Peruvians,
                    who had learned to mine and smelt the ores of the Andes, and make metallic
                    alloys wherewith to fashion for themselves bronze tools of requisite hardness
                    for quarrying and hewing the solid rock. With these they sculptured the statues
                    of their gods, and reared palaces, temples, and pyramids, graven with elaborate
                    sculptures and hieroglyphics by a people wholly ignorant of iron, which have not
                    unjustly suggested many striking analogies with the megalithic art of ancient
                    Egypt. The <hi rend="italic">huacas,</hi> or tombs of the Incas of Peru, and
                    also their royal depositories of treasure, have disclosed many remarkable
                    specimens of elaborate metallurgic skill,—bracelets, collars, and other personal
                    ornaments of gold; vases of the same abundant precious metal, and also of
                    silver; mirrors of burnished silver, as well as of obsidian; finely-adjusted
                    silver balances; bells both of silver and bronze; and numerous common articles
                    and tools of copper, or of the more efficient alloy of copper and tin,—all
                    illustrative of the arts and civilisation of a purely bronze age.</p>
                <p>4. The fourth or <hi rend="italic">Iron Period</hi> is that in which the art of
                    Smelting the ores of the most abundant metal had at length been mastered; and so
                    iron superseded bronze for arms, sword-blades, spear-heads, axes, daggers,
                    knives, &amp;c. Bronze, however, continued to be applied to many purposes of
                    personal ornament, home furniture, the handles of swords and other weapons; nor
                    must it be overlooked that flint and stone were still employed for lance and
                    arrow-heads, sling-stones, and other common purposes of warfare or the chase,
                    not only throughout the whole bronze period, but far into the age of iron. Tho
                    discovery of numerous arrow-heads, or flakes of black flint, on the plain of
                    Marathon, has been assumed with good reason to point to the use of such rude
                    weapons by the barbarian host of Darius; and the inference is confirmed by the
                    facts which Herodotus records, that Ethiopian auxiliaries of the army of Xerxes,
                    ten yeara later, were armed with arrows tipped with stone.</p>
                <p>The essential change resulting from the maturing of the iron period lies in the
                    unlimited supply of the new metal. Had bronze been obtainable in sufficient
                    quantity to admit of its application to the endless purposes for which iron has
                    since been employed, the mere change of metal would have been of slight
                    significance. But the opposite was the case. The beautiful alloy was scarce and
                    costly; and hence the arts of the neolithic period continued to be practised
                    throughout the whole duration of the age of bronze. But iron, though so abundant
                    in its ores, requires great labour and intense heat to fuse it; and it needed
                    the prolonged schooling of the previous metallurgic era to prepare the way for
                    the discovery of the properties of the ironstone, and the processes requisite to
                    turn it to account. Iron, moreover, though so abundant, and relatively of
                    comparatively recent introduction, is at the same time the most perishable of
                    metals. It rapidly oxidises unless protected from air and moisture, and hence
                    few relics of this metal belonging to the prehistoric period have been preserved
                    in such a state as to illustrate the skill and artistic taste of the fabricators
                    of that last pagan era, in the way that the implements of the three previous
                    periods reveal to us the habits and intellectual status of those older
                    times.</p>
                <p>But the iron is the symbol of a period in which pottery, personal ornaments of
                    the precious metals, works in bronze, in stone, and other durable materials,
                    supply ample means of gauging the civilisation of the era, and recognising the
                    progress of man in the arts, until we come at length to connect their practice
                    with definite historical localities and nations, and the names of Egypt and
                    Phoenicia, of Gadir, Massilia, the Cassiterides, and Noricum, illuminate the old
                    darkness, and we catch the first streak of dawn on a definite historical
                    horizon. Thus, with the master}’ of the metallurgic arts is seen the gradual
                    development of those elements of progress whereby the triumphs of civilisation
                    have been finally achieved, and man has advanced towards that stage in which the
                    inductive reasonings of the archaeologist are displaced by records more
                    definite, though not always more trustworthy, as the historian begins his
                    researches with the aid of monumental records, inscriptions, poems, and national
                    chronicles.</p>
                <p>Within the later iron period, accordingly, we reach the era of authentic history.
                    There is no room for doubt that, whatever impetus the Roman invasion may have
                    given to the working of the metals in Britain, iron was known there prior to the
                    landing of Julius Caesar. Within this archaeological period, however, the
                    examples of Roman art and the influences of Roman civilisation begin to play a
                    prominent part. To this period succeed the Saxon and Scandinavian eras of
                    invasion, with no less characteristic peculiarities of art workmanship, as well
                    as of sepulchral rites and social usages. In these later periods definite
                    history comes to the aid of archaeological induction, while those intermediate
                    elements of historical re-edification, the inscriptions on stone and metal, and
                    the numismatic series of chronological records, all unite to complete a picture
                    of the past replete with important elements for the historian.</p>
                <p>The connection between archaeology and geology has been indicated, but that
                    between archaeology and ethnology is of much more essential significance, and is
                    every day being brought into clearer view. By the investigation of the tombs of
                    ancient races, and the elucidation of their sepulchral rites, remarkable traces
                    of unsuspected national affinities are brought to light; while a still more
                    obvious correspondence of arts in certain stages of society, among races
                    separated alike by time and by space, reveals a uniformity in the operation of
                    certain <hi rend="italic">human instincts,</hi> when developed under nearly
                    similar circumstances, such as goes far to supply a new argument in proof of the
                    unity of the human race.</p>
                <p>The self-evident truths confirmatory of the principles upon which this system of
                    primitive archaeology is based, may be thus briefly summed up :—Man, in a savage
                    state, is to a great extent an isolated being; co-operation for mutual and
                    remote advantage, except in war and the chase, is scarcely possible; and hence
                    experience at best but slowly adds to the common stock of knowledge. In this
                    primitive stage of society the implements and weapons which necessity renders
                    indispensable are invariably supplied from the sources at hand; and the element
                    of time being of little moment, the rude workman fashions his stone axe or
                    hammer, or his lance of flint, with an expenditure of labour such as, with the
                    appliances of civilisation, woιdd suffice for the manufacture of hundreds of
                    such implements.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the metallurgic arts, by diminishing labour and supplying a
                    material more susceptible of varied forms as well as of ornamentation, and also
                    one originating co-operation by means of the new wants it calls into being,
                    inevitably begets social progress. The new material, moreover, being limited in
                    supply, and found only in a few localities, soon leads to barter, and thence to
                    regular trade; and thus the first steps towards a division of labour and mutual
                    co-operation are made. So long, however, as the metal is copper or bronze, the
                    limited supply must greatly restrict this social progress, while the facilities
                    for working <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0360-0341"/> il admit of that isolation so natural to man in a
                    rude state; and these, added to the frequent discovery of copper, in its natural
                    condition much more nearly resembling a ductile metal than the ironstone,
                    abundantly account for its use having preceded that of the more abundant
                    metal.</p>
                <p>Great experience must have been acquired in earlier metallurgy before the iron
                    ore was attempted to be wrought. In this, co-operation was indispensable; but
                    that once secured, and the first difficulties overcome, the other results appear
                    inevitable. The supply is inexhaustible, widely diffused, and procurable without
                    excessive labour. The material elements of civilisation were thereby rendered
                    available, and all succeeding progress might be said to depend on the capacity
                    of the race.</p>
                <p>The simplicity which characterises the archaeological disclosures of Scandinavia,
                    Germany, Ireland, and other regions of trans-Alpine Europe lying outside of the
                    range of ancient Greek or Roman influences, has contributed some important aids
                    to the study of prehistoric arts; but the full significance of their teachings
                    has yet to be tested by comparison with the primitive arts pertaining to Egypt,
                    Greece, Asia Minor, and other ancient centres of earliest civilisation. To this
                    certain singularly interesting disclosures of very recent date, which some have
                    regarded as at variance with the foregoing classification of archaeological
                    epochs, help to furnish the desired materials. The researches of Dr Heinrich
                    Schliemann on one of the most memorable sites which epic poetry has selected for
                    the mythic beginnings of history, have brought to light what he believes to be
                    actual remains of the Troy of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Dr Schliemann
                    began his systematic explorations in 1871, and pursued them, during the
                    available seasons, till the month of June 1873. With patient assiduity the
                    accumulated debris on the scene of ancient civic settlement was sifted and
                    opened up by regular excavations, till the natural rock was exposed at a depth
                    of upwards of 50 feet. Throughout the whole of this, abundant traces of former
                    occupation were brought to light; and so great an accumulation of debris and
                    rubbish upon an elevated site affords undoubted evidence of the vicissitudes of
                    a long-settled centre of population. To this specific evidence lent additional
                    confirmation. The foundations of a temple, supposed to be that of the Ilian
                    Athena of the time of Alexander, along with coins, inscriptions, and numerous
                    remains of architecture and sculpture, combined to fix the era of an ancient,
                    but strictly historical, period. At a further depth of upwards of 6 feet, broken
                    pottery, implements of bronze, and charred wood and ashes, showed the traces of
                    an older settlement which had perished by fire. But the artificial character of
                    the debris encouraged further research; and when the excavations had been
                    carried to about double the depth, Dr Schliemann came upon a deposit rich in
                    what may be styled neolithic remains: axes, hammers, spear-heads, and other
                    implements of polished diorite or other stone, weights of granite, querns of
                    lava, and knives and saws of flint abounded, associated with plain,
                    well-executed pottery, but with only two pins of copper or bronze to indicate
                    any knowledge of metal. Continued excavations brought to light additional stone
                    implements and weapons; until at a depth of some 33 feet, well-wrought
                    implements and weapons of bronze, and pottery of fine quality and execution,
                    revealed the traces of au earlier civilisation on the same ancient site.</p>
                <p>In all this, while there is much to interest, there is nothing to surprise us.
                    Here, near the shores of the Hellespont, at a point accessible to the oldest
                    known centres of civilisation,—to Egypt, Phoenicia, Assyria, Greece, Carthage,
                    and Rome,—a civilised community, familiar with the arts of the bronze period of
                    the Mediterranean shores, appears to have yielded to vicissitudes familiar
                    enough to the student of ancient history. After a time the desolated locality
                    tempted the settlement of some barbarian Asiatic horde, such as the steppes of
                    that continent could furnish even now. They were ignorant of metallurgic arts;
                    though probably, like the savage tribes of the New World at the present time,
                    not wholly unaware of the manufacture of implements and weapons of bronze or
                    other metals. Such a local alternation of bronze and stone periods in a region
                    lying in close proximity alike to vast areas of Asiatic barbarism, and to the
                    most important centres of ancient civilisation', in no degree conflicts with a
                    general system of succession of archaeological periods. Mexico and Peru, while
                    in a purely bronze age, were overthrown by Spanish invaders. Large portions of
                    their ancient territories were abandoned to utter barbarism, and even now are in
                    the occupation of savage tribes. But the ancient city of Montezuma has been made
                    the capital of a civilised state; the beds of its canals have been filled up,
                    buιying therein obsidian, stone, and bronze implements, pottery, sculptures, and
                    much else pertaining to its ante-Columbian era; and it only requires such a fate
                    as its modem history renders conceivable enough, to leave for future ages the
                    buried strata of a civic site revealing similar evidences of the alternation of
                    semi-civilised, barbarian, and civilised ages, on the same long-inhabited site
                    of Toltecans and Aztecs, Indian savages, and modern Mexicans and Spaniards.</p>
                <p>That man has everywhere preceded history is a self-evident truth. So long as no
                    scientific evidence seemed to conflict with a long-accepted chronology in
                    reference to the antiquity assigned to the human race, it remained unchallenged,
                    though the like computation had been universally rejected in reference to the
                    earth as the theatre of his history, and we were content to regard the
                    prehistoric era of man as no more than a brief infancy of the race. But the
                    investigations and disclosures of recent years in reference to the whole
                    prehistoric period have involved of necessity a reconsideration of the grounds
                    on which a definite antiquity of comparatively brief duration has been assigned
                    to man; and the tendency at present is rather to exaggerate than to diminish the
                    apparent antiquity of the race. The nature and extent of the evidence which has
                    thus far rewarded intelligent research have been sufficiently indicated above;
                    and as it is still far from complete, the student of archaeology will act wisely
                    in pushing forward his researches, and accumulating and comparing all available
                    evidence, without hastily pronouncing any absolute verdict on this question.
                    But, without attempting to connect with any historic chronology the men of the
                    English drift, or the troglodytes of the mammoth or reindeer periods of France,
                    it may be useful, in concluding this summary of primitive archaeology, to glance
                    at the origin of civilisation, and the evidences of the antiquity of what appear
                    to constitute its essential elements.</p>
                <p>Everywhere man seems to have passed through the same progressive stages: First,
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">savage</hi> or purely <hi rend="italic">hunter
                    state;</hi> a condition of precarious instability, in which man is most nearly
                    in the state of a mere animal subsisting on its prey. It is the condition of
                    nomad life, incompatible with a numerous or settled population; exhausting the
                    resources of national being in the mere straggle for existence, and therefore
                    inimical to all accumulation of the knowledge and experience on which human
                    progress depends. In tins primitive state, man is disclosed to us by the
                    evidence with which the archaeologist now deals. He appears everywhere in this
                    first stage as the savage occupant of a thinly-peopled continent, warring with
                    seemingly inadequate means against gigantic carnivora, the contemporary
                    existence of which is known to us only by the disclosures of geological strata
                    or ossiferous <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n361/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0361-0342"/> cave3, where also the remains of still more
                    gigantic herbi-vora confirm the idea of man’s exhaustive struggle for existence.
                    The nearest analogy to such a state of life is that of the modern Esquimaux,
                    warring with the monstrous polar bear, and making a prey of the gigantic
                    cetaceae of Arctic seas. Through how many ages this unhistoric night of European
                    man may have preceded the dawn of civilisation it is at present vain to
                    speculate. But this is noticeable, that there is no inherent element of progress
                    in a people in the condition of the Esquimaux. To all appearance, if
                    uninfluenced by external impulse, or unaffected by any great amelioration of
                    climate, they are likely to prolong the mere struggle for existence through
                    unnumbered centuries, armed, as now, with weapons and implements ingeniously
                    wrought of bone, ivory, and stone, the product of the neolithic arts of this
                    19th century.</p>
                <p>To this succeeds the second or <hi rend="italic">pastoral state,</hi> with its
                    flocks and herds, its domesticated animals, and its ideas of personal property,
                    including in its earlier stages that of property in man himself. It pertains to
                    the open regions and warmer climates of the temperate zone, and to the elevated
                    steppes and valleys of semi-tropical countries, where the changing seasons
                    involve of necessity the wandering life of the shepherd. This accordingly
                    prevents the development of the arts of settled life, especially those of
                    architecture; and precludes all idea of personal property in the soil. But the
                    conditions of pastoral life are by no means incompatible with frequent leisure,
                    reflection, and consequent intellectual progress. Astronomy has its origin
                    assigned to the ancient shepherds of Asia; and the contemplative pastoral life
                    of the patriarchs Job and Abraham has had its counterpart in many an Arab chief
                    of later times.</p>
                <p>The third or <hi rend="italic">agricultural stage</hi> is that of the tillers of
                    the soil, the Aryans, the ploughers and lords of the earth, among whom are
                    developed the elements of settled social life involved in the personal homestead
                    and all the ideas of individual property in land. The process was gradual. The
                    ancient Germans, according to the description of Tacitus, led the life of
                    agricultural nomads; and such was the state of the Visigoths and Ostrogoths of
                    lateι∙ centuries. But this was in part due to the physical conditions of
                    trans-Alpine Europe in those earlier centuries. Long ages before that, as the
                    ancient Sanscrit language proves, the great Aryan family, of which those are
                    offshoots, had passed from the condition of agricultural nomads to that of lords
                    of the soil among a settled agricultural people. They had followed up the art of
                    ploughing the soil with that of shipbuilding and “ploughing” the waves. They
                    were skilled in sewing, in weaving, in the potter’s art, and in masonry. Their
                    use of numbers was carried as high at least as a hundred before they settled
                    down from their nomad life. They had domesticated the cow, the sheep, the horse,
                    and the dog; and their <hi rend="italic">pasu</hi> or feeders already
                    constituted their their wealth, before the <hi rend="italic">pecunia</hi>
                    assumed its later forms of currency. They had also passed through their <hi
                    rend="italic">bronze</hi> and into their <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> period; for
                    their language shows that they were already acquainted with the most useful
                    metals as well as with the most valuable grains.</p>
                <p>The whole evidence of history points to the seats of earliest civilisation in
                    warm climates, on the banks of the Nile, the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Indus,
                    and the Ganges. The shores of the Mediterranean succeeded in later centuries to
                    their inheritance, and were the seats of long-enduring empires, whose
                    intellectual bequests are the life of all later civilisation. But trans-Alpine
                    Europe, which is now yielding up to us the records of its prehistoric ages, is
                    entirely of modern growth so far as its historic civilisation is concerned, and
                    wherever it extends towards the northern verge of the temperate zone it is even
                    now in its infancy. Here, then, we trace our w ay back to the first progressive
                    efforts of reason, and find man primeval, in a state of nature, in the midst of
                    the abundance pertaining to a genial and fertile climate, which rather
                    stimulates his aesthetic faculty than enforces him by any rigorous necessity to
                    cultivate the arts for the purposes of clothing and building. Thus employing his
                    intellectual leisure, he begins that progressive elevation which is as
                    consistent with his natural endowments as a rational being as it is foreign to
                    the instincts of all other animals. He increases and multiplies, spreads abroad
                    over the face of the earth, clears its forests, drains its swamps, makes its
                    rivers and seas his highways, and its valleys and plains his fertile fields and
                    pasture-grounds. Cities rise, with all the fostering influences of accumulated
                    wealth and settled leisure, and with all the stimulating influences of acquired
                    tastes and luxurious desires. The rude pictorial art—not ι*uder on the graven
                    ivory of the troglodytes of the Aladelaine cave than on many a hieroglyphic
                    drawing of the catacombs and temples of Egypt— employed in picture-writing,
                    passes by a natural and inevitable transition from the literal representations
                    of objects to the symbolic suggestion of ideas, to a wordalphabet, and then to
                    pure phonetic signs. The whole process is manifest from the very infancy of
                    Egyptian picture-writing, as crude as that with which the Indian savage still
                    records his deeds of arms on his buffalo-robe, or carves the honours of the
                    buried warrior on his grave-post Letters lie at the foundation of all high and
                    enduring civilisation, yet we can thus trace them back to their infantile
                    origin; and so onward in their slow transformations, as in the mingled pictorial
                    and phonetic writing of the Rosetta stone hieroglyphics of the age of the
                    Ptolemies. Through Phoenician, Greek, and Roman modifications, they have come
                    down to us as the arbitrary symbols of sounds which the voice combines into
                    articulate speech.</p>
                <p>And as it is with letters so it is with man’s <hi rend="italic">arts,—</hi> his
                    drawing, carving, sculpture, architecture, weaving, pottery, metallurgy; and so
                    with his <hi rend="italic">science,</hi> —his astrology, astronomy, geometry,
                    alchemy, and all else. The beginnings of all of them lie within our reach. We
                    can trace back the measurements of solar time to the crudest beginnings of more
                    than one ancient nation, with a year of 360 days. This, corrected to the
                    definite approximation to the true solar year of a period of 365 days, became
                    the vague year of the Egyptians, with the great Sothiac cycle of 1460 years,
                    clearly pointing to a system of chronology which could not have been perpetuated
                    through many centuries without conflicting with the most obvious astronomical
                    phenomena as well as with the recurring seasons of the year.</p>
                <p>Alan is, after all, according to the boldest speculations of the geologist, among
                    the most modern of living creatures. If indeed the theory of evolution from
                    lower forms of animal life is accepted as the true history of his origin, time
                    may well be prolonged through unnumbered ages to admit of the process which is
                    to develop the irrational brute into man. But regarding him still as a being
                    called into existence as the lord of creation, endowed with reason, the
                    demonstration of a prolonged existence of the race, with all its known
                    varieties, its diversities of language, and its wide geographical distribution
                    under conditions so diverse, tends to remove greater difficulties than it
                    creates. No essential doctrine, or principle in morals, is involved in the
                    acceptance or rejection of any term of duration for the human race; and the idea
                    of its unity, which for a time was scornfully rejected from the creed of the
                    ethnologist, is now advocated by the evolutionist as alone consistent with the
                    physical, mental, and moral characteristics common to savage and civilised man,

                    among the most diverse races of living men.</p>
                <p>The process of research and inductive reasoning thus applied by the archaeologist
                    to the traces of primitive art and the dawn of civilisation, is no less
                    applicable to all periods. The songs and legends of the peasantry, the
                    half-obliterated traces of ancient manners, the fragments of older languages,
                    the relics of obsolete art, are all parts of what has been fitly styled
                    “unwritten history,” and furnish the means of recovering many records of past
                    periods which must remain for ever a blank to those who will recognise none but
                    written or monumental evidence.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to the investigation of this later and, in most of the higher
                    requirements of history, this more important branch of historical evidence, the
                    archaeologist lias still his own special departments of investigation. Tracing
                    the various alphabets in their gradual development through Phoenician, Greek,
                    Roman, and other sources, and the changing forms which followed under the
                    influences of Byzantine and mediaeval art, a complete system of palaeography has
                    been deduced, calculated to prove an important auxiliary in the investigation of
                    monumental and written records. Palaeography has its own rules of criticism,
                    supplying an element of chronological classification altogether independent of
                    style in works of art, or of internal evidence in graven or written
                    inscriptions, and a test of genuineness often invaluable to the historian.</p>
                <p>Architecture, sculpture, and pottery have each their historical value, their
                    periods of pure and mixed art, their successions of style, and their traces of
                    borrowed forms and ornamentation, suggestive of Indian, Assyrian, Egyptian,
                    Phoenician, Punic, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, Arabian, Byzantine, Norman, or
                    Renaissance influences. Subordinate to those are the pictorial arts combined
                    with sculpture and pottery, from earliest Egyptian, Greek, or Etruscan art to
                    the frescoes and paintings of mediaeval centuries; and the rise of the art of
                    the engraver, traceable through ancient chasing on metals, mediaeval
                    niello-work, graven sepulchral brasses, and so on to the wood blocks, whence at
                    length the art of printing with movable types originated. And a3 in the Old
                    World so in the New, the progress of man is traceable from rudest arts of stone
                    and copper to the bronze period of Mexico and Peru, where also architecture,
                    sculpture, and pottery preserve for us invaluable materials for the elucidation
                    of that prehistoric time which only came to an end there in the year 1492 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>Heraldry is another element by means of which archaeology provides trustworthy
                    canons of criticism in relation to written and unwritten mediaeval records. The
                    seals and matrices, sepulchral sculptures, and engraved brasses, along with an
                    extensive class of the decorations of ecclesiastical and domestic architecture,
                    all supply evidence whereby names and dates, with confirmatory collateral
                    evidence of various kinds, are frequently recoverable. From the same sources
                    also the changing costume of successive periods can be traced, and thus a new
                    light be thrown on the manners and customs of past ages. The enthusiastic
                    devotee is indeed apt at times to attach an undue importance to such auxiliary
                    branches of study; but it is a still greater excess to pronounce them valueless,
                    and to reject the useful aids they are capable of affording.</p>
                <p>No less important are the illustrations of history, and the guides in the right
                    course of research, which numismatics supplies, both in relation to early and
                    mediaeval times. But on this and other sections into which th? study of
                    antiquities is divided, the requisite information will be found under the
                    several heads of research. On many of those points the historian and the
                    archaeologist necessarily occupy the same field; and indeed, when that primitive
                    period wherein archaeology deals with the whole elements of our knowledge
                    regarding it, as a branch of inductive science, and not of critical history, is
                    past, the student of antiquities becomes to a great extent the pioneer of the
                    historian. He deals with the raw materials: the charters, deeds, wills, grants
                    of land, of privileges or immunities, the royal, monastic, and baronial accounts
                    of expenditure, and the like trustworthy documents; by means of their
                    palaeography, seals, illuminations, and other evidence, he fixes their dates,
                    traces out the genealogical relationships of their authors, and in various ways
                    prepares and sifts the evidence which is to be employed anew by the historian in
                    revivifying the past. Architecture and all departments of the fine arts, in like
                    manner, supply much evidence which, when investigated and systematised by a
                    similar process, adds valuable materials to the stock of the historian, and
                    furnishes new sources for the illumination of past ages. Such is a sketch of the
                    comprehensive investigations embraced under the name of archaeology, which,
                    carried on by many independent labourers, and in widely varied fields of
                    research, have contributed important chapters of human history, and revivified
                    ages long buried in oblivion, or at best but dimly seen through distorting media
                    of myth and fable. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. w.)</hi></p>
                <p>CLASSICAL ARCHAeOLOGY.</p>
                <p>The province of classical archaeology is to investigate and determine the results
                    of artistic activity among the Greeks and Romans, so far as that activity
                    manifested itself in works of form and substance as opposed to the artistic
                    expression of thought by unsubstantial means, as in the case of poetry or music.
                    It ranges from the Greek temple as the highest form of artistic expression in
                    this sense to the other extreme of the simplest object shaped for a purpose by
                    human hands. A stone, rudely hewn with some design, an artificial tumulus, and
                    common clay utensil, each represent, in a humble fashion, a thought artistically
                    expressed in substance, and each reflect more or less accurately the artistic
                    spirit of the time at which they were made. It ranges also from the earliest
                    examples of workmanship down through the historical periods of development-and
                    decline. So far classical archaeology may properly be called a section of the
                    general history of art. It owes its independent position entirely to the
                    peculiar circumstances under which its investigations are conducted. For
                    example, when called upon to determine the date of an inscription from the forms
                    and disposition of its letters, which, as works of art, must reflect the taste
                    of the period in which they were incised, it has to bring to bear on the
                    question a knowledge of palaeographical eccentricities. Or when the date of a
                    coin has to be fixed, the standard on which it has been struck and the
                    historical circumstances connected with it must be taken into consideration.
                    Such, at least, is the practice of journals and societies devoted to classical
                    archaeology. On the other hand, recent writers desire to confine these
                    collateral inquiries to within tho narrowest possible limits. They have agreed
                    to dismiss altogether mythological researches, which in Gerhard’s time formed
                    one of the principal occupations of archaeologists. Most of them consent to
                    epigraphy being classed under philology. With regard to numismatics, however,
                    opinions are still divided as to whether it should be included under
                    archaeology, on the ground of the immense importance of coins as monuments of
                    art, or whether, on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n363/mode/1up"

                    them should be classed under philology. A similar question has been raised
                    regarding topography. (See Conze, <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The material for the study of classical art consists of literary records and
                    actual remains, among the former being included, though from another point of
                    view belonging to the latter class, the inscriptions which have been found
                    incised on sculptures, or more frequently on the bases left behind in Greece as
                    worthless by the plundering Homans. The literary records have been collected by
                    Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Antike Schriftquellen,</hi> Leipzig, 1868, and the
                    inscriptions alone more recently by Hirschfeld, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Til·uli</hi><hi rend="italic">Statuariorum Sculptorumque,</hi> Berlin, 1871.
                    The actual remains may be arranged under the three classes of architecture,
                    sculpture, and painting, with the first mentioned being included the industrial
                    arts, in which principles of construction were applied, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the furniture of temples and dwelling-houses, as opposed to the
                    imitative arts. In the case of architecture proper, owing to the immovable
                    nature of its monuments, dependence has to be placed on the trustworthiness of
                    drawings and descriptions made on the spot by travellers. Sculpture, on the
                    other hand, being comparatively easy of transport in all .cases, and having been
                    for centuries the object of extraordinary avidity among cultivated people, is
                    now fairly represented in all its important stages in any one of the principal
                    museums of Europe. Painting, in its highest sphere, may be said to exist only in
                    the record supplied by the occasional statements of ancient writers. But these
                    statements embody the opinions of those whose judgment in regard to sculpture we
                    have the means of verifying, and unless there were reason to suppose that
                    persons accustomed to exact the greatest refinement in sculpture were lightly
                    gratified in the matter of painting, their desultory remarks will furnish some
                    idea of the ancient manner for which the remains of wall painting at Pompeii
                    will serve as a foundation, though apparently executed by workmen rather than
                    artists, and that at a time when the art had sunk to its lowest ebb. The skill
                    in drawing attained by ordinary workmen is amply displayed in the painted
                    vases.</p>
                <p>Without attempting to subject the history of art to systematic study, the Greeks
                    and Romans nevertheless devoted much attention to special branches of it. The
                    fruits of their labours have in great part perished; but from what remains, and
                    from the notices of what is lost, it appears that their researches took the
                    direction either of explaining the principles of art, and especially those of
                    architecture, or of collecting facts concerning artists and their works, or of
                    describing the works of art which existed in this or that place, as in a
                    catalogue. Of the first class of works we have lost all—and they were many—
                    except Vitruvius. Of the second the losses are known to have been great, and,
                    poor though the substitute for them undoubtedly is, we are still fortunate in
                    possessing such in the notices collected by Pliny in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia Naturalis.</hi> We have besides a long series of epigrams, for which
                    there was no dearth of point, in the works of well-known artists. For a similar
                    purpose the rhetoricians chose frequently to draw comparisons from or to
                    describe works of art; but owing to the object they had in view, they have left
                    little that is of much practical good for the history of ancient art.</p>
                <p>The same applies to the epigrammatists. (See O. Benndorf, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Anthologioe Graecae</hi><hi rend="italic">Epigrammatis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quoe ad</hi><hi rend="italic">artes spectant,</hi> Bonn, 1862.) With regard to
                    Pliny, it seems that, though himseif destitute of all critical faculty in
                    matters of art, he frequently drew his notices from excellent authorities. The
                    third class of ancient writers on works of art were the Periegetae, of whom only
                    Pausanias survives <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.d.</hi> 160-180), his 'Ελλάδος
                    Πίριζ/γτ/σις, in ten books, being of the highest value from an antiquarian point
                    of view. For the criticism of art it brings little benefit.</p>
                <p>As to the fate of works of art during the early centuries of Christianity, the
                    first record we possess is that of Nicetas Acominatus, of Chonae in Phrygia, who
                    died in 1216 <hi rend="italic">{Narratio</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi

                    1830). In 1460 we have an anonymous description of Athens (Tà <hi rend="italic"
                    >θέατρα</hi> και διδασκαλεία των <hi rend="italic">Αθηνών,</hi> see L. Ross, <hi
                    rend="italic">Archäologische Aufsätze,</hi> i. p. 245), from which may be
                    gathered a tolerable idea of the deep ignorance of the times. In Rome the rule
                    was to destroy as far as possible all ancient sculptures, except such as were in
                    some way identified with Christianity. The reaction against this manner of
                    proceeding at first took the form of collecting ancient sarcophagi for the
                    modern purposes of burying-grounds. By the 15th and 16th centuries this taste
                    had developed into an enthusiasm, which spread even into the south of Germany,
                    for the possession of ancient sculptures as models for the study of artists. In
                    the beginning of the 17th century this enthusiasm gave way to a habit of viewing
                    ancient works of art only as so many illustrations of ancient beliefs and modes
                    of life, a habit in which the French and the Dutch were distinguished, and of
                    which the results are nowhere more apparent than in Montfaucon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">L'</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquité expliquée et représentée en
                    figures,</hi> Paris, 1722, with its uncritical text and inaccurate engravings.
                    The taste of the times preferred literature to art, and accordingly the
                    collection of ancient monuments, adapted to the illustration of classical
                    writers, and especially the poets, was assiduously followed. A typical example
                    of the one-sidedness of this tendency is to be seen in Spence’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Polymetis, or an Enquiry concerning the Agreement between the
                    Works of the Boman Poets and the Remains of the Ancient Artists,</hi> London,
                    1755, fol. A really valuable work of the period, however, was the collection of
                    passages in the ancient writers bearing upon artists, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus Artificum,</hi> by Fr. Junius (François Dujon), which retained the
                    position of a standard work until supplanted by Sillig’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogus Artificum,</hi> Dresden, 1827, which in turn held its ground until
                    the appearance of H. Brunn’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Griechischen

                <p>Up to the middle of the 17th century no steps had been taken to visit and explore
                    the monuments of Greece. The pioneers in this work were J. Spon, a physician of
                    Lyons, and George Wheler, an Englishman, who travelled together in 1675-76
                    through Italy, Dalmatia, and Greece, and published each a separate account of
                    their journey (J. Spon, <hi rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Journey into Greece,</hi> London, 1682). In the year previous to
                    their arrival in Greece, the Marquis de Nointel, French ambassador at the Porte,
                    had paid a short visit to Athens, and set Carrey, a French artist, to&gt; work
                    to draw the sculptures of the Parthenon and some of the buildings of the town.
                    These drawings are now in the Bibliothèque at Paris, and though mostly sketched
                    hurriedly, or from an awkward point of view, form an invaluable record of the
                    sculptures of the Parthenon, destroyed shortly after (1687) by the bombardment
                    of Athens by the Venetians under Morosini.</p>
                <p>The discovery of Herculaneum in 1720 and of Pompeii in 1748 opened a new era in
                    the history of archaeology. The antiquarian spirit gave way to an historical and
                    scientific method, of which Count Caylus <hi rend="italic">{Recueil</hi><hi

                    may be regarded as the forerunner, and Winckelmann (1717-1768) as the actual
                    founder. The fame of the latter rests on his two great <pb break="no"

                    Rome, 1767, 2 vols. fol. It was in the former that he elaborated his two
                    theories—first, that the quality of artistic productions is always in harmony
                    with the character and the events of the times; and, secondly, that ideal beauty
                    originates in the union of individually-beautiful forms observed singly and
                    apart in nature. Whatever may be said of the narrowness or want of precision in
                    his artistic and philosophical speculations, it still stands to his great praise
                    and renown that he was the first to undertake a vigorous examination of the
                    terms, beauty and ideal, in their relation to nature. It was through his
                    influence that the history of ancient art was introduced into the course of
                    academical study by Heyne, that Goethe, Lessing, and Herder turned each the
                    force of his consummate genius to ancient art, and that the pubheation of
                    ancient monuments with critical apparatus received a new impulse. Among the
                    immediate disciples of Winckelmann were Zoëga (1755-1809), Visconti (1751—
                    1807), and Millin. After Winckelmann, the next history of ancient art that
                    appeared was Meyer’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der bildenden Künste bei den
                    Griechen und Römern,</hi> Dresden, 1824-36, 3 vols.; contemporary with which the
                    only important contributions to the subject were those of C. A. Bυttiger and
                    Hirt.</p>
                <p>While German activity was engaged on theories of art based principally on the
                    monuments existing in Italy, a practical view of the subject was taken in
                    England, the first issue of which was that Stuart and Revett went to Athens in
                    1751, and spent nearly three years in exploring and drawing its remains, the
                    result appearing in the work <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi> voL
                    i., 1762; vol. ii, 1787; vol. iii., 1794; and vol. iv., 1816. The task begun by
                    them was taken up by the Society of Dilettanti (founded 1734), whose first
                    expedition under Dr Chandler, Revett, and Pars, an artist, in Greece and Asia
                    Minor, was productive of two works—(1.) <hi rend="italic">Ionian

                    researches of William Gell, in 1797); and (2.) <hi rend="italic">Unedited
                    Antiquities of Attica,</hi> 1817. At this time, Lord Elgin, then British
                    ambassador at the Porte, had a large force of workmen employed in removing the
                    sculptures of the Acropolis of Athens, which, after years of tossing hither and
                    thither in London, at last, in 1816, found a resting-place in the British
                    Museum, of which they continue to form the greatest ornament. In 1811-12 a
                    number of English, German, and Danish travellers (Cockerell, Forster,
                    Stackelberg, Haller, Linckh, and Brönstedt) undertook the exploration of Aegina
                    at their own expense, and were fortunate in the recovery of the sculptures of
                    the temple of Athene, now in Munich.</p>
                <p>In 1812 the temple of Apollo Epicurius at Phigalia was explored by Cockerell, its
                    sculptured frieze recovered and obtained for the British Museum, qnd its
                    architecture elucidated in the still unapproached work of Cockerell, <hi

                    researches undertaken about this period were—(1.) The French Expédition
                    scientifique de la Morée, the chief result of which was the discovery of some
                    fragments of the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. (2.) The excavations
                    on the Acropolis of Athens, directed by L. Ross, in 1834-36. (3.) The
                    excavations of Angell and Harris on the Acropolis of Selinus in Sicily in
                    1822-23, resulting in the recovery of three sculptured metopes of a very archaic
                    style, and fragments of three more metopes (Samuel Angell and Thomas. Harris,
                    <hi rend="italic">Sculptured Metopes of the Ancient City oj</hi><hi

                    1834), with the further gain of four metopes sculptured in a more advanced style
                    (O. Benndorf, <hi rend="italic">Die Metopen von Selinunt,</hi> Berlin, 1873).
                    These sculptures are in the Museum of Palermo. /5.) The extensive operations in
                    Etruria from 1828 onwards, the enormous spoils of which, consisting of painted
                    vases, bronzes, &amp;c., led to the foundation of the Instituto di
                    Corrispondenza Arche-ologica at Rome, which has continued uninterruptedly, with
                    the support of the Prussian Government, its publication of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Monumenti,</hi> furnishing a complete repertory of archaeological research up
                    to the present day. (6.) The removal of the sculptures on the Acropolis of
                    Xanthos (Fellows, <hi rend="italic">Asia Minor,</hi> 1839, and <hi rend="italic"

                    national collection, which, however, has been immensely enriched in objects of
                    minor artistic importance, but of great archaeological interest, from
                    excavations in Greece, at Camirus and Jalyssus in Rhodes, in Sicily, in the
                    Cyrenaica, and in Cyprus. In the Crimea the excavations of the Russian
                    Government have brought very important treasures to light <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The rapid and vast accumulation of new material after the time of Winckelmann
                    required a new informing spirit. The first to assume this function was Thiersch,
                    in three articles, “Ueber die Epochen der bildenden Kunst unter den Griechen,”
                    1816, 1819, 1825, in which he endeavoured to prove the influence of the
                    Egyptians and Phoenicians on early Greek art. Against him appeared K. 0. Müller,
                    denying altogether an exoteric influence, and comparing the development of Greek
                    art to the organic development of plants, its various periods being coincident
                    with the marked periods of political history. These opinions he propounded first
                    in a series of articles <hi rend="italic">(Kleine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Schriften,</hi> ii. pp. 315-398), and afterwards in the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch der Archäologie</hi> (1830; 2d ed. 1835; 3d ed. 1848,
                    with additions by Weicker), which, with the plates by Oesterley <hi
                    rend="italic">(Denkmäler der alten</hi><hi rend="italic">Kunst),</hi> is still
                    unsurpassed in its kind. Müller’s view has continued to be adopted by all the
                    leading archaeologists since his time, among whom may be here mentioned Gerhard,
                    Weicker, Otto Jahn, and the historians of art generally, Schnaase, Kugler, and
                    Lübke. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Handbuch,</hi> however, with its additional
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler</hi> by Wieseler, it is necessary, for the
                    most recent information, to consult Brunn’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der

                    books that may be consulted with profit; but it is hoped that no essentially
                    important work has been overlooked.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The oldest remains of workmanship in Greece, if we except the series of stone
                    implements discovered within the last few years in various localities, are the
                    ruined walls of Tirynth and several other ancient citadels, the stupendous
                    masonry of which, together with the primitive manner of construction by means of
                    unhewn polygonal blocks of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n367/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0367-0346"/> immense size, led the later Greeks to believe
                    that they had been the work of a mythical race of giants, Cyclopes, and to
                    designate such masonry as Cyclopean. It was further said that these Cyclopes had
                    come from Lycia, between which and Argolis, where the most remarkable of these
                    walls are, there existed (whatever may be the value of this belief) a very
                    frequent intercourse in the heroic times. Pausanias (iL 25, 8), speaking of the
                    walls of Tirynth, which still, apparently, present the same aspect as when he
                    saw them, remarks that the smallest of the blocks would be more than a load for
                    a yoke of mules. Again (ix. 36, 5) he compares them with the pyramids of Egypt
                    as regards the difficulty of the task of building and their colossal dimensions.
                    Instead of the unsatisfactory Cyclopes, the Pelasgians, who preceded the Greeks
                    in the occupation of the soil, are now accredited the authors of this primitive
                    masonry, to which accordingly the much-abused term Pelasgic is applied.
                    Pausanias (i. 28, 3) describes the oldest part of the walls of the Acropolis at
                    Athens as the work of Pelasgic settlers there. In what relation of blood this
                    race may have stood to the Greeks who succeeded them cannot be determined, but
                    it is known that the Greeks adopted from them, among other religious beliefs and
                    rites, those of Dodona; and since even this primitive style of masonry commended
                    itself to them for a time, the Pelasgians must be regarded as having in some
                    degree assisted in the artistic progress of their successors. The walls of
                    Mycenae furnish an example of the fine skill with which the Greeks afterwards
                    employed the Pelasgic construction, the blocks of stone being carefully jointed
                    and hewn on the outer surface, while the interior of the wall is filled up with
                    mortar and small stones. Mycenae claimed to be one of the very oldest towns of
                    Greece, and its walle may fairly be regarded as the oldest known monument of
                    Greek workmanship. A considerable advance of skill is noticeable in the masonry
                    of the treasure-houses <hi rend="italic">(thesauri),</hi> or dome-shaped and
                    partly subterraneous buildings, which occur in several districts of Greece, and
                    of which the treasury of Atreus (so named by Pausanias) at Mycenae is a typical
                    example. It is built of circular courses of evenly hewn and jointed stones, the
                    courses narrowing towards the top, and there held together by a keystone. It is
                    not, however, an instance of vaulting in the true sense. The most remarkable
                    features in the building are— first, the pilasters and tablets of coloured
                    marble, decorated with a peculiar style of ornament, the elements of which are
                    spirals and zigzags; and secondly, the sheets of bronze √vith which the interior
                    walls were plated. Of the latter little more than the nails have been found with
                    which they were attached. Of the former a number of fragments, some of which are
                    now in the British Museum, have come to light. The disposition, and especially
                    the profusion of ornament which they display, differ strikingly from the
                    simplicity of Greek work as we know it, and have given rise to a theory which is
                    now accepted as proved, that the Greeks at this time must have been strongly
                    influenced by the example of Oriental artists (Schnaase, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte der bildenden Künsten,</hi> ii., fig. 28, Diisseldorf, 1866).
                    Meanrime, it is a fact of the first importance that this building, which
                    Pausanias appears to have had good grounds for naming the treasury of Atreus,
                    and thus assigning it to the heroic age before the time of Homer, furnishes a
                    remarkable illustration of the descriptions of princely palaces given by the
                    poet, according to whom the walls were plated with dazzling bronze, and the
                    cornices, pillars, and doors enriched with work in other metals. When,
                    therefore, a building in the remains of which a complete absence of Greek
                    simplicity and a powerful suggestion of Oriental influence have been unanimously
                    recognised, was found to correspond accurately with the descriptions of Homer,
                    it was both time to inquire whether the frequent notices of works of art in his
                    pages also point in the same direction, and reasonable to assume that his
                    testimony elsewhere in matters of art was equally reliable. From the poet’s
                    evidence on the condition of art in his time we gather that the various
                    processes of working in gold, silver, iron, tin, and bronze <hi rend="subscript"
                    > j</hi> were known, with the exception of casting and soldering in the
                    last-mentioned material, and of welding iron. Wood and ivory were carved and
                    jointed, the art of pottery was known, and weaving and embroidery, the
                    foundation of pictorial art, were practised. We hear of richly-ornamented
                    articles of furniture, armour, and dresses. We read of the τeκτωv, χαλκ∈υs, and
                    σκυτοτό/tos. Occasionally the names of particular artists are mentioned, as of
                    Tychius, who made the shield of Ajax <hi rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi> vii. 222),
                    and of Icmalius, who made Penelope’s chair <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xix.
                    60). On the other hand, the work of amateurs is often praised, as the couch made
                    by Odysseus <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xxiii. 189), and the figured
                    garments worked by Andromache and Helena <hi rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi> iii.
                    125, and xxii. 441). When the workmanship of an object is of surpassing beauty
                    and the artist unknown, as in the case of the Sidonian crater <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Odyssey,</hi> iv. 617), it is ascribed to the artist god Hephaestus, to whom
                    also the same honour is done when the work, as in the case of the shield of
                    Achilles, was a poetic creation. That Homer should in the same breath speak of
                    an object as Sidonian and the work of a Greek god, is a singular mistake, which
                    would hardly have been committed had the articles imported from the Phoenicians
                    differed in style from articles of the same class produced by native workmen. So
                    far, artistic feeling seems to have been directed exclusively to the decoration
                    of objects of daily use. It had not yet aspired to the production of one object
                    which could rest on its merits as a mere work of art,—as, for example, a statue.
                    We have, indeed <hi rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi> vi. 301), mention of a statue of
                    Pallas at Troy; but the fact that women are described as placing drapery on its
                    knees is sufficient proof of its having been a mere rude Xoanon, such as we find
                    frequently represented on the painted vases. The same phenomenon occurs in the
                    remains of Assyrian art, among which, with all the wealth of sculpture in relief
                    and of the highest excellence, there are only three or four statues, and those
                    of such exceeding rudeness that we are compelled to suppose that they were
                    intended to be draped like the figure of Pallas just mentioned. We have seen
                    that the ornaments of the treasury of Atreus at Mycenae pointed clearly to an
                    Oriental origin. It is agreed that the relief of two rampant lions from above
                    the gateway to the citadel of Mycenae (Muller’s <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler der
                    alten</hi><hi rend="italic">Kunst),</hi> which is the solitary existing instance
                    of Greek sculpture from about Homeric times, is of an Oriental character in the
                    composition, in the flatness of the relief, and in the design of the pillar
                    which stands between the lions. We find further, as was pointed out by Layard
                    <hi rend="italic">(Nineveh,</hi> Appendix), among the many remains of the
                    inferior arts from Nineveh, illustrations of the references to such matters in
                    Homer, which are admirable in themselves, and are found nowhere else, except
                    occasionally in the oldest Etruscan tombs. Now, as Assyrian art reached its
                    culmination by about the 9th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> we may
                    assume that, contemporary with Homer, it was being practised with great
                    activity. On the testimony of Herodotus we know that Assyrian wares were
                    imported into Greece by the Phoenicians and sold in the heroic times; and, on
                    the testimony of Homer, these same Phoenicians were in the habit of selling
                    costly articles of furniture and dress to the Greeks of his time. Of early
                    Phoenician art, however, we have no authentic remains, nor indeed any proof of
                    its having had an independent existence at any time. We know the Phoenicians
                    mainly as traders, and it is highly probable that in matters of art their <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0368-0347"/> trade lay chiefly between the Assyrians on the
                    one hand and the Greeks on the other. “It was the Phoenicians/’ says Brunn <hi
                    rend="italic">(DieKunstbei Homer,</hi> München, 1868), “-who brought from the
                    East to the Greeks an alphabet which they modified and employed for a language
                    peculiar to themselves; and it was the Phoenicians who brought to them from the
                    same quarter an alphabet, so to speak, of art, which they also modified and
                    employed for a language of art equally their own.” lie proceeds to define this
                    alphabet of art as consisting of a knowledge of the processes of weaving and
                    embroidery, of working in wood, ivory, and the various metals, with the
                    exception of casting in bronze —with which and with sculpture in marble, which
                    he also excludes, commenced the art of statuary, and commenced, therefore, the
                    independence of true Greek art. Besides these processes of working, the Greeks
                    derived from the same source at least some of the decorative patterns which we
                    find in use in later times, though greatly modified. But, above all, they
                    obtained from the Assyrians that manner of sculpture in low flat relief, and in
                    parallel horizontal bands, which they appear to have practised almost
                    exclusively down to the 7th century B.C.,—that is, down to the collapse of the
                    Assyrian empire,—and after that to have retained as one of the charms of their
                    architecture. If, then, an intercourse such as is assumed actually took place in
                    Homer’s time between the Greeks and the Assyrians, who were then artistically in
                    a very advanced condition, it will be necessary, before lightly calling the
                    shield of Achilles a poetic dream, as has frequently been done, to see whether
                    the poet may not have had before his mind some manner of a counterpart for it in
                    Assyrian art. We need not suppose that such a shield ever existed. But a poet
                    cannot create out of nothing; and it is clear from his division of the shield
                    into five concentric bands, resembling the large bronze shields found at Caere
                    some years ago in a tomb of very high antiquity, that he had before his mind the
                    customary arrangement of ornaments in works of this kind. Now, on an Assyrian
                    bronze bowl in the British Museum (Layard, plate 61), which exactly resembles in
                    shape and is of about the same size as a boss of a shield, we have a
                    representation of the earth and heavens which very strikingly recalls the
                    decoration of the boss on the shield of Achilles; -while in the comparatively
                    few remains of Assyrian sculpture we have cities at war, cities at peace, and
                    many scenes from daily life, which vividly illustrate the Homeric description of
                    the shield (see Brunn <hi rend="italic">Die Kunst</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bei</hi><hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, who deals with the various subjects in
                    detail). It should be observed, however, that though the evidence of the Homeric
                    poems and the remains of Greek art from the Homeric age both point to an
                    Assyrian influence, the Greeks of later times looked ratheι-to Egypt as the land
                    whence their ancestors had experienced their first impulse both in religion and
                    in art. They believed that Daedalus, the first Greek sculptor who knew how to
                    give movement to his figures, and was regarded as the father of Greek sculpture,
                    had learned his art in Egypt. Diodorus of Sicily asserted that Telecles and
                    Theodorus of Samus had visited Egypt, and on their return executed a statue of
                    Apollo in the Egyptian style for a temple in Samus, each having made a half of
                    it, and that apart from the other. Strabo (p. 806) compares the old Greek
                    sculpture with the Egyptian; while Pausanias in several places (ii. 19, 3; iv.
                    32, 1) speaks^of Egyptian statues in Greek temples, or (i. 42, 3; yii. 5, o) of
                    statues resembling the Egyptian in style. According to another theory, the
                    influence of Egypt on Greek art, though admitted, is relegated to the time of
                    Psammetichus, in whose service it is known many Greek mercenaries were employed,
                    and through -whose inclination towards the Greeks an active intercourse sprang
                    up between the two countries. Among the Greeks who visited Egypt at that ’ time
                    were Thales, Cleobulus, Solon, and Pythagoras.</p>
                <p>Of the connection which is assumed to have existed between the earliest monuments
                    of Greek art and the contemporary art of Assyria, evidence is cited from remains
                    of undoubtedly early workmanship in the countries of Asia Minor, Lycia, Lydia,
                    and Phrygia, of which the two latter were intimately associated with the oldest
                    traditions and religious beliefs of Greece. The peculiar feature of Lycian art
                    is its tombs cut in the rock, of which the oldest class are direct imitations of
                    wooden structures such as we may conceive the primitive temples of an Oriental
                    race to have been. In Phrygia we have another class of rock-cut tombs of very
                    remote antiquity, of which that of Midas (Semper, <hi rend="italic">Der
                    Stil,</hi> i. p. 429) is the best preserved example. Here the style of
                    decoration is obviously derived from Assyrian tapestry. In Lydia we have tombs
                    again, but they are in the form of immense tumuli,—as, for instance, that of
                    Alyattes near Sardis, which astonished Herodotus by its size, being 1300 feet in
                    diameter at the base, and over 250 feet high. Similar tumuli occur among the old
                    Chaldeans.</p>
                <p>With the immigration of the Dorian race commenced the development of an
                    independent style of architecture in Greece, the first step apparently being the
                    invention of a house supported by columns as the design for a temple. From the
                    description given by Pausanias (v. 16) of one of these early Doric temples—that
                    of Hera at Olympia, erected shortly after the Dorian immigration—we gather that
                    it had the form of a temple <hi rend="italic">in antis,</hi> surrounded by
                    columns, and with not only a <hi rend="italic">pronaos</hi> led into by two
                    columns, but also a similar chamber at the back. One of the two columns of this
                    latter chamber was of wood, apparently a reminiscence of a former style of
                    construction in that material. About the same time originated also, it is
                    supposed, the Ionic order, which though presenting a certain Asiatic richness of
                    ornament strongly opposed to the severe simplicity of the Doric, was still a
                    pure Greek invention. The fact of it having first appeared among the Greeks of
                    Asia Minor is enough to account for its admission of a greater softness and flow
                    of lines than was admitted in the Doric. With the new movement in architecture a
                    fresh impetus was given to the art of sculpture. At first the reports sound
                    somewhat fabulous,—as, for example, that in which Butades the Corinthian potter
                    is described as having hit on the idea of modelling a face in clay and baking it
                    along with his vases. Butades himself, however, is an historical person, and
                    Corinth is known to have been a flourishing seat of potters and other artists as
                    early as the time of the tyrant Cypselus (650 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>),
                    through whose oppression it is said the artists, Eucheir, Diopus, and Eugrammus
                    emigrated to Etruria, which afterwards became celebrated for its sculptures in
                    terra-cotta. At the commission of Cypselus, or of his successor Periander, a
                    colossal statue of Jupiter was executed at Corinth, and dedicated at Olympia.
                    But the most remarkable specimen of early sculpture, presumably Corinthian, was
                    the chest in which the infant Cypselus was concealed, and of which a detailed
                    description is given by Pausanias (v. 17, 5, foL) The chest, itself of cedar,
                    was ornamented with a wealth of figures in gold and ivory, arranged in parallel
                    horizontal bands, and representing heroic legends and scenes from daily life,
                    the names of the individual figures being inscribed <hi rend="italic"

                    in what Pausanias calls very ancient letters. The François vase in Florence <hi

                    Artistic activity was not then confined to Corinth. A school of sculpture in
                    marble existed in Chius as early <pb break="no"

                    also Glaucus is said to have discovered the art of welding iron (692 B.C.), the
                    substitute for which had previously been nails. At this period we have frequent
                    mention of splendid metal utensils, as, for instance, the enormous cauldron
                    (Herodotus, iv. 152), with projecting gryphons’ heads and a support formed of
                    kneeling figures, seven ells in height. As the oldest example of sculpture in
                    bronze which he had seen, Pausanias (iii. 17, 6) describes a statue of Jupiter
                    at Sparta, the work of Clearchus of Rhegium, whom some called a pupil of
                    Daedalus. It was made of plates of bronze, beaten out to express the whole
                    figure, and then fastened together with fine nails, the arts of soldering and of
                    casting being still unknown. Of sculpture in this manner we possess only one
                    example, the bronze bust found at Polledrara, near Vulci, and now in the British
                    Museum. Throughout this early period the statues or images of deities seem to
                    have retained their helpless primitive form, feelings of piety and gratitude
                    being apparently expressed rather in gifts of metal utensils to the temples than
                    in statues of the gods as in later times. No such statues exist now, but we have
                    sufficient evidence of their want of artistic merit in the numerous
                    representations of them which occur on the painted vases of a later period, when
                    the sanctity of a spot is frequently indicated by such a figure. Apparently to
                    this early and as yet barely historical period belongs a class of painted vases
                    decorated with figures of animals and flowers arranged in parallel horizontal
                    bands, and therefore both in the choice and disposition of the decorations
                    presenting a marked instance of Assyrian influence. From their shape it appears
                    that many of these vases were made to hold precious liquids, such as perfumes;
                    and it is very probable that they were imported from the East with those
                    perfumes, the names of which in the Greek language have an obvious Oriental
                    origin. A considerable advance is noticeable in a second class of these vases,
                    in which the human figure is introduced as the principal subject in the
                    decoration, the designs being in general chosen from the heroic legends of
                    Greece. These vases still retain the shape of the former class, the method of
                    disposition in parallel bands, and the choice of subordinate ornaments. The
                    names of the heroes are frequently written beside them, and sometimes the artist
                    adds his own name. The alphabet in which these names are written is the old
                    Corinthian, and hence the vases in question are also styled Corinthian. As to
                    their date, it is agreed that they cannot be later than 620 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> With the introduction of the human figure as the subject most worthy
                    of artistic rendering, commenced in vase painting also the independence of the
                    potter’s art in Greece (Brunn, <hi rend="italic">Probleme</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>From the date of the earliest historical notices of sculptors, backward to that
                    usually assigned to the Homeric poems, there is an interval of several
                    centuries, during which it would at first sight appear that the art of sculpture
                    had made no sensible advance, if indeed it had not declined. This being
                    improbable, an explanation must be sought for, either with Ulrichs <hi
                    rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Anfänge der Griechischen
                    Künstlergeschichte,</hi> Würzburg, 1871) in the confusion which seems to reign
                    among the dates of the earliest sculptors, or with Brunn <hi rend="italic">(Die
                    Kunst</hi><hi rend="italic">bei</hi><hi rend="italic">Homer)</hi> in the theory
                    that the art of sculpture in Greece during that interval was, like the
                    contemporary art of Assyria, strictly confined to working in relief, and that in
                    this direction it may well have made steady progress, though particular artists
                    are not singled out for praise. It is with sculpture in the round, and with some
                    particular invention, as that of welding iron or casting bronze, or with some
                    new technical procedure, as the working of marble, that the first records of
                    artists begin. With regard to the confusion in the dates of these records, it is
                    true that in ancient times the artistic faculty was handed down in certain
                    families, among whom there was also a partiality for certain names. But to
                    assume on the strength of this, as Ulrichs does, that later writers, finding a
                    recurrence of the same name, generally identified it with the most distinguished
                    and hence probably the latest of the artists who bore it, is a means of peopling
                    an apparent void which ought to be supported with better evidence than that
                    which Brunn has controverted at almost every point. For example, in treating of
                    Theodorus of Samus, of whom it is said that he invented the process of casting
                    in bronze, and supposed that he was a contemporary of Polycrates, Ulrichs argues
                    that there must have been two artists of that name (and suggests that there may
                    have been several), because the one who invented bronze-casting must have lived
                    before <hi rend="smallcaps">576b,c.,</hi> previous to which date this art may be
                    inferred to have been known from the remark of Herodotus (v. 82), that the
                    Epidaurians were ordered by an oracle to obtain figures of Damia and Auxesia,
                    not χαλκού τ) <hi rend="italic">λίθον,</hi> but £υλου. W hy <hi rend="italic"
                    >-χαλκόν</hi> should not refer to hammered as well as to cast bronze, Brunn is
                    unable to see. Again, it was Theodorus of Samus who built the substructure of
                    the temple of Diana at Ephesus, and Ulrichs is at a loss to conceive how the
                    people of that town could have remained till 576 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    without a temple worthy of their goddess. That the previous temple was unworthy
                    of Diana cannot be proved by us, who are ignorant of the feelings of the Greeks
                    in these matters, and who are aware that Jupiter himself had not even in his
                    favourite Olympia a great temple till 456 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The view taken by Brunn is, as has been said, that until the invention of casting
                    in bronze the Greek sculptors continued to work in relief except when images
                    were required for the purposes of worship, and that in these cases, whether <pb

                    rude helpless form of ancient times was preserved. Stimulated, it may be
                    supposed, by the achievements of the newly-invented art, sculptors now began to
                    look to the possibility of producing in marble also a resemblance to the human
                    figure in its substantial roundness. The scene of the first success in this
                    direction was Chius, where a family which for three generations (Melas,
                    Micciades, and Archermus) had been celebrated for its workers in marble, was at
                    this time represented by the brothers Bupalus and Athenis. Works from their
                    hands were to be seen in their native place, in Delus, Iasus, and Smyrna, and
                    consisted, so far as we know, of draped figures of goddesses, with the one
                    memorable exception of a statue by Bupalus intended as a caricature of the poet
                    Hipponax, which was set up in Clazomenae. The poet took his revenge by
                    circulating some verses which stung the sculptor so severely as to drive him to
                    suicide by hanging. The school of Chius had a rival in that of Magnesia on the
                    Maeander, at the head of which was Bathycles, whose fame is associated with the
                    reliefs and figures on the colossal throne of Apollo at Amyclae (Pausanias, iii.
                    18, 9; Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Gesell, d. Griech. Plastik,</hi> i. p. 86).
                    He and a number of his pupils or assistants had been purposely invited to the
                    task, and what they accomplished was probably the best that could then be done,
                    however short of the standard of later times it may have fallen in the eyes of
                    Pausanias. One noticeable fact is, that after completing their work, they left
                    behind portraits of themselves, and this, in connection with the portrait of
                    Hipponax, may serve to show that sculptors had already begun to direct their
                    attention to the individual features of the human face. As to the date of
                    Bathycles, Pausanias was uncertain and modem critics are divided, some supposing
                    him to have left Magnesia before its destruction, 636 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    favour of the latter date is the statement (Pausanias, iii. 10, 8) that the gold
                    received from Croesus (563-549 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> by the
                    Lacedaemonians was made a gift of by them for the decoration of the figure of
                    Apollo at Amyclae.</p>
                <p>The new phase of art thus entered on, according to tradition, by the Ionians, was
                    now taken up vigorously by the Doric sculptors, among whom the first to attain
                    distinction were Dipoenus and Scyllis, natives of Crete, and members of the
                    ancient guild of sculptors there, which took its name from the mythic Daedalus.
                    Leaving Crete, they settled in Sicyon, probably on the invitation of the tyrant
                    Clisthenes, and were there commissioned to execute at the public cost a group of
                    statues of deities. Their work was, however, intemιpted by a disagreement which
                    ended in the artists having to leave the town. They established themselves in
                    Aetolia, and were allowed to remain there until, a plague having fallen on
                    Sicyon, the oracle traced it to the wrath of the gods at seeing their statues
                    incomplete. Dipoenus and Scyllis were recalled, and finished their work at a
                    greatly increased price, from which it may be inferred, perhaps, that the
                    original dispute lay in the matter of payment. Among the many sculptures which
                    they executed in Sicyon and other Greek towns, as Cleonae, Argus, Tirynth, and
                    Ambracia, some, it is said, were of wood and ivory, a combination of material
                    which may be regarded as having suggested the chryselephantine sculpture of
                    later times (Pliny, xxxvi. 4, 9, 14; Pausanias, ii. 15,1; 22, 5; Brunn, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Künstler,</hi> i. p. 43).
                    l·or determining their date, we have a passage of Pliny in which he says, “Primi
                    omnium inclaruerunt marmore sculpendo;” adding, “Before Cyrus ascended the
                    throne of Persia, about 576 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.”</hi> From their school
                    proceeded Doryclidas and Dontas, who executed several figures and groups of
                    deities in cedar and gold at Olympia for the Heraeum and the treasuries of the
                    Epidaurians and Megaraeans; Clearchus of Rhegium, who worked in bronze; and
                    Tectaeus and Angelion, from whom Callon, the celebrated Aeginetan sculptor,
                    learned his craft. As a work of Tectaeus and Angelion, Pausanias (ii. 32, 5; ix.
                    35, 3) mentions a figure of Apollo at Delus, representing the god in a rigid
                    attitude, the upper arms close to the sides and the fore-arms advanced, in his
                    right hand a bow, and in his left a diminutive group of the three Graces.
                    Contemporary with Doryclidas were Smilis of Aegina and Gitiades of Sparta, the
                    former of whom is known to have executed a group of the Horae, to be placed with
                    a figure of Themis by Doryclidas. From his hand was also a figure of Hera at
                    Samus. Gitiades, who was at once sculptor, architect, and poet, erected the
                    temple of Athene Chalkioikos, and made the figure of the goddess for it. The
                    temple was coated with plates of bronze, on which were reliefs representing
                    scenes from the legends of Hercules and Perseus, and from mythical incidents,
                    among them being the birth of Athene.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the remains of Greek sculpture, which may with more or less
                    certainty be assigned to the period in which the foregoing sculptors were at
                    work, we begin with the three metopes from the oldest of the temples on the
                    Acropolis of Selinus, in Sicily, which up to now have been regarded as
                    furnishing the first authentic, and as yet the clearest, glimpse of that early
                    stage of Greek art when the foreign elements with which it had grown up were
                    being fast eliminated, and the basis laid of a perfectly independent art. It is
                    not within the range of absolute proof, though it is nearly so, that these
                    metopes belonged to the temple erected by the Selinuntians soon after their
                    settlement as colonists, 651 B,c., or, as others prefer, 628 (Benndorf, <hi
                    rend="italic">Die Metopen von Selinunt.')</hi> They are sculptured in tufa, and
                    represent —(1), Perseus cutting off the head of Medusa in the presence of
                    Athene; (2), Hercules carrying the Cercopes, bound by the heels, over his
                    shoulders; and (3), a quadriga to the front. In the first two, while the
                    movement proceeds from left to right, the faces are all turned broadly to the
                    front, as if looking to the spectator for applause. It may be that the artist,
                    in thus rendering the grimness and grotesqueness of his subjects with a more
                    staring and vivid effect, had recourse, as is argued, to an innovation on the
                    older manner of representing the figures altogether in profile. This much
                    appears to be certain, from the minute attention w hich he has devoted to the
                    structure of the knees, the lower parts of the legs, the feet, and the movement
                    of the flesh on the shoulders, that the loss of half a face, entailed by a
                    position in profile, would have grieved him. The drapery is stiff, and
                    studiously arranged in neat folds, which are not always produced by the manner
                    in which it is worn. The hair is disposed in a system of circular locks
                    independent of each other. Tho proportions of the figures vary considerably,
                    though uniformly characterised by a sohdity and heaviness which, from the
                    similar appearance of Doric columns, has been designated as Doric in style. The
                    remains of colour found on these sculptures showed that the aegis of Athene had
                    been sketched on the breast with a reddish brown, and that the same colour had
                    been applied to the ground of the relief. The maeander pattern on the broad fold
                    of Athene’s chiton was painted brown, her eyes and eyebrows black. The eyes of
                    the Gorgon were red. The folds of the short chiton worn by Hercules were
                    partially left to be indicated by colour. The muscles are strongly exaggerated,
                    so as to mark the extraordinary physical strength attributed to the heroes of
                    the subject.</p>
                <p>Markedly contrasting with these metopes is a marble relief found in Samothrace in
                    1790, and now in the Louvre, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n371/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0371-0350"/> distinguished for the flatness of the figures,
                    which present the appearance of sections of men (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 18). The subject, as we learn from the names inscribed by
                    each figure, consists of Agamemnon seated, with the herald Talthybius, and
                    Epeius, the sculptor of the wooden horse, standing behind him. The figures are
                    lean and spare compared with those of Selinus; the folds of the draperies are
                    merely indicated, and appear to have been completed in colour. The character of
                    the inscriptions, which are in the old Ionian dialect, corresponds with that of
                    the early vases. That this relief cannot be later than 500 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> there is no doubt; but all means of determining its date beyond that
                    period fail. Nor is it safe to assign it higher antiquity than the Selinus
                    metopes, on the ground that the figures are all in profile; for a position in
                    profile was by no means an invariable characteristic of early sculpture, as may
                    be seen by reference Co fie. 2, in which are given two examples of the extremely
                    early gold ornaments from Camirus in the British Museum, in all of which the
                    figures are placed full to the front (Millingen, <hi rend="italic">Ancient
                    Unedited Monuments,</hi> ii. pl. 1; Müller, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi>
                    pl. 11, No. 39). From the sacred way leading up to the temple of the Branchidae
                    at Miletus there are ten marble statues of seated figures now in the British
                    Museum, for which they were obtained by C. T. Newton. Apart from their
                    importance as works of ail assignable to this early period, one of them
                    possesses the additional interest of being, as we learn from the inscription on
                    it, a portrait of Chares, a ruler of the neighbouring Teichiousa. The other
                    important examples of sculpture in this period are—(1), the architrave of the
                    temple at Assus, in the Troad (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i.
                    p. 9); (2), three statues of Apollo—one found at Thera, and now in Athens, the
                    second found at Tenea, and now in Munich, the third in the British Museum, where
                    it is known as the Strang-ford Apollo. All three stand in the Egyptian manner,
                    resting the weight of the body on both legs. The head sits rigidly on the
                    shoulders, the brow retires, the eyes project and slope inward towards the nose,
                    the lips are close, and the corners of the mouth turned up, producing something
                    like a smile. The hair appears to have been completed with colour (Overbeck, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Plastik,</hi> 2d ed., i.
                    fig. 8; Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 5).</p>
                <p>In the course of our notice of this early period certain facts have assumed a
                    prominence which calls for remark. First, it is to be observed that the earliest
                    important schools of sculpture arose in the islands, particularly the islands of
                    Chius, Crete, and Aegina. To what circumstance this was due—whether, for
                    example, to a more active intercourse with Oriental nations—remains unexplained.
                    Next to the islands, the coast of Asia Minor, Magna Graecia, and Sicily were
                    productive of artists. From Crete the new impulse spread to the Peloponnesus,
                    Sicyon, Argus, and Corinth. Secondly, for some reason, the sculptors then mostly
                    worked in pairs. Thirdly, the various materials—bronze, marble, wood and ivory,
                    and gold and ivory—were already in use as in later times. Fourthly, the subjects
                    were—(1), religious and mythological, the epos being the main source; and (2),
                    portraits and statues of successful athletes. Individual artists had at last
                    begun to assert their peculiarities in the conception of the human form. They
                    had begun to give up those general types which bear the same resemblance to a
                    man as does his shadow cast by the sun. In the infancy of art, as in the early
                    morning, the shadows are grotesque. As it advances they improve, till at noon
                    the shadow is lost in the living figure.</p>
                <p>In the earlier part of our period it is to be observed that the Dorian race still
                    continued to furnish the sculptors of distinction, but the main centres of the
                    art were now in the Peloponnesus instead of the islands. In Sicyon the
                    reputation acquired by Dipoenus and Scyllis was enlarged by Canachus, whose
                    works were spoken of in later times (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Brut.</hi> 18,
                    70) as models of the severe restrained style of the early schools. Statues of
                    deities were his favourite subjects. His material consisted sometimes of wood,
                    as in the figure of Apollo Ismenius at Thebes (Pausanias, ix. 10, 2); sometimes
                    of gold and ivory, as in the figure of Aphrodite at Sicyon (Pausanias, ii. 10,
                    4); and sometimes of bronze, as in his celebrated statue of Apollo Philesius at
                    Miletus, which is said to have differed from the Apollo at Thebes only in the
                    material. A figure of Apollo answering in general terms to the description of
                    this statue, occurs on certain coins of Miletus and in a remarkable bronze
                    statuette in the British Museum. The attitude of the statuette is stiff, but
                    less pervaded with rigidity than, for example, the Apollo of Tenea. The form,
                    which is quite nude, shows an advance in the study of proportions. The shoulders
                    are still square, but the chest is much fuller, and apparently rendered as if
                    with a reminiscence of its expansion and heaving after athletic exertion.
                    Canachus worked with his brother Aristocles, also a sculptor of high reputation,
                    though of his works all we know is that he took part with Ageladas in the
                    execution of three statues of Muses.</p>
                <p>The schools of Argus and Aegina appear to have mostly confined themselves to
                    working in bronze. At the head of the former stood Ageladas, whose principal
                    reputation consists in his having been the instructor of the three great
                    masters, Myron, Polycletus, and Phidias. Nine of his works are mentioned,
                    including two statues of Zeus, but no description of his style is added, nor is
                    anything regarding it to be inferred from the very diverse manner of his three
                    great pupils. His date falls between 508 and 452 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    Argus had also Aristomedon, Glaucus, and Dionysius. In Aegina, where the quality
                    of the bronze (Aeginetica aeris temperatura—Pliny, A <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxxiv. 2, 5, 10; 8, 19, 75), as well as the
                    artistic excellence of its sculptors, obtained a wide recognition, the first
                    name of importance is that of Callon, a pupil, as has been said, of Tectaeus,
                    and Angelion of Sicyon, and a contemporary of Canachus (Pausanias, vii. 18, 10),
                    with whom, in respect of the severity of his style, he has been compared. Of his
                    works we know only of a statue of Athene at Troezene, and a tripod with a figure
                    of Cora at Amyclae. Possibly, like his contemporaries, his chief study was that
                    of the finely-developed forms of successful athletes. Greatly beyond him in
                    distinction was Onatas, under whose hands the art of Aegina achieved a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0372-0351"/> reputation which was perhaps only surpassed by
                    that of Athens, and, owing to the political collapse of the island, waβ never
                    obscured by the inferiority of later schools. His works, which appear to have
                    been mostly of bronze, consisted of large compositions as well as of single
                    statues of gods and heroes. After Onatas we have Anaxagoras, who was employed by
                    the united Greek states to execute the bronze statue of Zeus (15 feet high) for
                    Olympia, in commemoration of the battle of Plataeae. On the same occasion the
                    Greeks dedicated two other works of art—a bronze statue of Poseidon (10∣∙ feet
                    high) for his temple on the Isthmus; and a golden tripod, standing on a bronze
                    support formed of three serpents, for the entrance of the temple at Delphi. In
                    both cases the names of the artists are unrecorded, and probably it will not be
                    wrong to assume that they also were of Aegina. The golden tripod was melted down
                    during the Phocian war; but the support remained <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>
                    till the time of Constantine, by whose orders it was removed to Constantinople
                    and placed in the Hippodrome, where it still stands. In 1855 the earth which had
                    accumulated round its base was removed by C. T. Newton, and the names of the
                    Greek states inscribed on it revealed. (Newton, <hi rend="italic">Travels in the
                    Levant,</hi> ii. p. 25. For the discussion raised on the antiquity of this
                    monument, see Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 64.)</p>
                <p>In Athens we find in this period Endoeus, of whom the scanty records permit us to
                    know almost nothing, and Antenor, the author of a bronze group representing the
                    Tyrannicides, Harmodius and Aristogiton, and erected in the Agora at the foot of
                    the Acropolis. That these figures were executed shortly after the incident which
                    they were intended to commemorate, 550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is very
                    probable. It is recorded that Xerxes carried them off to Susa in 480 B.C., and
                    that they were restored to Athens by Alexander, or Seleucus, or Antiochus. In
                    the meantime, to repair the loss, two sculptors, Critius and Nesiotes, were
                    employed to replace the group (Pausanias, i. 8, 5; Arrian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exped. Alex.</hi> iii. 16, 7; vii. 19, 2; Pliny, xxxiv. 19, 70). Whether the
                    new sculptors were expected to reproduce the composition and the style of the
                    lost figures—as, for example, Onatas did in replacing the figure of the black
                    Demeter at Phigalia— cannot be ascertained. On the other hand, if the two marble
                    statues in the museum of Naples <hi rend="italic">{Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Borbon.,</hi> viii. pls. 7, 8) have been rightly described as copies of the new
                    group, and if it is right to conjecture that the group represented on certain
                    tetradrachms of Athens, and, we may add, on a Panathenaic prize vase in the
                    British Museum, was copied from the older group, on the ground that they were
                    executed about the time when it was recovered from Susa, and therefore probably
                    to commemorate that event, this much at least will be clear, that the
                    composition of both groups was very much the same. On the other hand, the
                    frequency with which statues and groups of statues of various kinds occur on the
                    late tetradrachms of Athens, would equally perhaps require to be explained on
                    the same hypothesis of a restoration, and for this we are not prepared. With
                    respect to the marble statues just mentioned, it is to be observed that the
                    expression of physical energy in them, side by side with a spareness and
                    sinewiness, recalls the characteristic of Myron, and accordingly may be better
                    ascribed to the later artist Critius, than to his predecessor Antenor. As
                    comparable in many respects with one of the statues in Naples we give fig.

                <p>At Rhegium, in lower Italy, the mantle of Clearchus had fallen on Pythagoras,
                    unless it be true, as is also stated, that he had received his instruction from
                    an otherwise unknown artist, Euchirus of Corinth. A list of the sculptures by
                    Pythagoras (Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Antike Schrift quellen,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">6.v.</hi> Pythag.) shows that he worked exclusively in bronze,
                    that his subjects, with the exception of a group of Europa on the bull, in
                    Tarentum, consisted of male figures, and these of a kind in which either a
                    strongly-pronounced muscular action, or a marked capacity for it, must have been
                    expressed. The most famous of them was his statuo of Philoctetes at Syracuse, of
                    which the epigram writers declared that the expression of pain in it was such as
                    to move the spectator. To disprove the conjecture that the pain might have been
                    expressed in the face alone, there is a gem in the Berlin Museum (Overbeck, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Plastik,</hi> 2d, fig. 42)
                    bearing what there is little doubt is a copy from the statue, from which
                    Philoctetes appears to be suffering contortion through every limb from the wound
                    in his foot as he tries to walk. And this, it may be added, while itself an
                    accurate observation of the effect of such a wound, is an admirable illustration
                    of the talent of Pythagoras for strained, and, what is more, a concentrated
                    straining of, muscular action. From a statement of Pliny, it appears that he was
                    the first to express the veins and sinews of the human form, and from Diogenes
                    Laertius wo gather that he was the first to apply rhythmus and symmetry to his
                    figures. The precise meaning of these latter words it is difficult to
                    understand, with nothing better before us than a gem copy of one of the artist’s
                    works. It will not, however, be far wrong if we take them to refer to that
                    concentration of the entire action of the body upon one point which has been
                    recognised in the figure of Philoctetes, and which we assume to have been the
                    key to the composition of his groups. This interpretation is further in harmony
                    with the statement of Pliny, seeing that an artistic purpose of this kind could
                    not be carried out without the studious expression of veins and sinews (Brunn,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Künstler,</hi> i. p.
                    132).</p>
                <p>We have seen how few of the existing monuments can be traced even conjecturally
                    to the artists of this early period, whose names and praises have been handed
                    down to us. Monuments of sculpture there are, manifestly assignable to this
                    period, and some of them worthy of the fame of a great master. But whether the
                    men who executed them were unhonoured in their time, or whether from the
                    insufficiency of our literary records names well known in antiquity may have
                    escaped us, cr whether, in fact, the best of these works at least may really
                    have come from the hands of men otherwise well known, remains unexplained<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0373-0352"/>. The last-mentioned possibility has been placed
                    in a strong light by Brunn’s discussion on the sculptures from the temple of
                    Athene at Aegina, now in Munich. Not that he would trace them directly to the
                    hands of the artists Callon and Onatas of Aegina. What he aims at is to connect
                    the characteristics of the sculptures intimately with the style recorded of
                    these two men, and to leave the rest for conjecture. <hi rend="italic"

                    western pediment, in which the combat over the dead body of Achilles was
                    represented, only one is lost. From the eastern only five complete figures
                    remain. The subject of it was a combat corresponding in its main features with
                    that of the other pediment. In both the central object of the strife is a fallen
                    hero; in both the goddess Athene appears on the scene. In the one group her
                    figure is entire; in the other only her head remains. In the eastern pediment
                    the only recognisable figure is that of Hercules, and from his presence it has
                    been supposed that the subject of the composition was the combat of that hero
                    and Telamon against Laomedon of Troy. The statues of this pediment are of a
                    bolder and more advanced style than the others, from which it has been inferred
                    that they may have been the work of a younger man, carried away by a new
                    movement in art, while the others may have been the work of an older artist,
                    hardened in the traditions of his school. One thing, however, is plain from the
                    remarkable uniformity which reigns among the figures of both groups, that the
                    artist or artists had hitherto been limited in their study to one type of the
                    human form, and that the nude form of finely-developed athletes. Nowhere is
                    there individuality, but everywhere an excessive carefulness in rendering the
                    forms. The goddess Athene has all the rigidity of the ancient figures intended
                    for a worship which little brooked innovations. The expression on the faces is
                    throughout the same, and the hair is always rendered in one conventional manner.
                    The figures are spare and hard, with as little flesh as possible. In both
                    pediments the scene—a combat over a fallen hero·—is intended to stir our
                    sympathy, but entirely fails. There is no straining of muscles, no expression of
                    grief, and no sense of the emergency. We turn from the figures as a whole to the
                    pleasing truthfulness with which the parts are rendered. To give them a greater
                    air of vitality, the lips and eyes of the statues, with such accessories as
                    drapery, sandals, and weapons, were originally coloured blue and red, while many
                    small holes remain to show that part of the armour and aegis on the breast of
                    Athene had been attached in metal, a fact which bears with great importance on
                    the question of the polychromy of ancient statues. With regard to the date of
                    these sculptures, the opinion is, that they could hardly have been executed more
                    than fifty years before the time of Phidias (engraved, Müller, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Denkmäler,</hi> i. pls. 6-8).</p>
                <p>Among the other existing examples of sculpture assignable to this period we would
                    select as most characteristic— (1.) A marble stele found (1838) in the east of
                    Attica, and now in the Theseum at Athens (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bausteine</hi> i. p. 26), representing an armed warrior standing in profile,
                    whose name, as appears from the inscription, was Aristion. The sculptor’s name,
                    which is also inscribed, was Aristocles. The relief is low and flat, and
                    executed with the greatest care and attention to details, particularly those of
                    the armour. The ground of the relief was painted red and the armour blue, the
                    ornaments on it being picked out with red. Remains of colour were also found on
                    the lips and eyes, while the crest of the helmet appears to have been added in
                    metaL Altogether, Aristion presents a touching picture of the old upright and
                    severe warrior who fought at Marathon. (2.) Another marble stele in Orcho-menus,
                    inscribed with the sculptor’s name, Anxenor of Naxus, and representing, in low
                    flat relief and in profile, a man of years wearing a mantle, and standing,
                    resting on his staff, holding a beetle towards the dog at his feet (Overbeck,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Plastik,</hi> 2d ed.,
                    i. fig. 23; Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 29). (3.)
                    Another marble stele in Naples <hi rend="italic">(Mus. Borbon.</hi>, xiv. pl.
                    10; Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 28), in which the
                    drapery and the forms are still archaic, though showing a considerable advance
                    on the stele of Aristion. (4.) Part of a metope from one of the temples of
                    Selinus in Sicily (Benndorf, <hi rend="italic">Die Metopen von Selinunt,</hi>
                    pl. 5), representing a goddess, either Athene or Artemis, trampling on an armed
                    male figure, probably a giant, whom she has hurled to the ground. As an example
                    of the archaic manner of relief in this period, this fragment has no equal among
                    existing monuments. The anguish on the face of the giant is depicted with deep
                    feeling; nor is our emotion interrupted by observing that the beard retains its
                    formal trimness, and that the hair remains in graceful ringlets, in no way
                    partaking of the confusion. (5.) Marble relief found on the Acropolis of Athens,
                    and preserved there, representing a female figure, possibly a goddess, stepping
                    into a car (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 25). This
                    relief has been supposed, but without sufficient reason, to be a fragment of the
                    frieze of the older pre-Periclean Parthenon. With more justice has it been
                    compared in point of style with (6), the reliefs of the so-called Harpy tomb
                    discovered at Xanthus in Lycia in 1838 by Sir Charles Fellows, and now in the
                    British Museum (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 37). (7.)
                    From Xanthus the British Museum possesses another archaic frieze of higher
                    merit, representing a procession of chariots, in which the horses are modelled
                    with extraordinary care <hi rend="italic">(Vr^chov,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquissima Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Xanthiaca,</hi> 1872). (8.) Marble
                    relief in Thasus representing Apollo,</p>
                <p>Hermes, and nymphs (Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plastik,</hi> 2d ed., i. fig. 28). The figures have an Ionic
                    slimness, such as we found on the architrave from Assus, but with finer
                    proportions than that early work. (9.) Three small reliefs in terra-cotta from
                    Melus (Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Plastik,</hi> 2d ed,,L figs. 27, 26α,and 26δ), representing Orestes and Electra
                    at the tomb of their father; Perseus mounted on Pegasus and carrying off the
                    head of Medusa; and Sappho, seated, resting from her lyre and looking up towards
                    Alcaeus, as at the moment when he said, “You sweet, black-haired, modest Sappho,
                    I have something to say to you.” A fourth relief of this style is given in fig.
                    4.</p>

                <p>The trimness and grace of these early reliefs had a charm for the artists and
                    patrons of later times, especially the times of the first emperors, such as has
                    been exercised in our day by the paintings of the pre-Raphaelite masters, and
                    between the imitations then produced and the original models it is frequently
                    difficult to draw a clear distinction. A critical list of these
                    imitations—whether sculptured in relief or in the round—is given by Friederichs,
                    <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. pp. 71-95; and, with illustrations, by
                    Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Plastik,</hi> 2d ed., i. pl. 14. As examples of early sculpture in its inferior
                    walk may be mentioned (10), a series of bronze statuettes which have served as
                    stands of mirrors or otherwise as decorations of furniture. Those which have
                    been or are still stands of mirrors are generally female figures, and it is to
                    be observed that the oldest of them, as distinguished from the later examples,
                    wear a heavy under-garment or chiton, apparently of worsted material, and over
                    this again an ample and by no means light peplos.</p>
                <p>If we are to credit the Greeks with having been introduced .by the Assyrians to
                    one branch of art more than another, we should say it was the art of
                    gem-engraving. Not that we possess Greek gems which compare in style and
                    antiquity with those of Assyria, but, if for no other reason, because we find a
                    technical process of so great difficulty existing at all in Greece at an early
                    period. Perhaps the earliest examples of the art in Greece possessed of artistic
                    merit are two scarabs from Aegina, one with the figure of a bowman in pure
                    Aeginetan style, and the other bearing the inscription Kpeovτiδα <hi
                    rend="italic">iip.1 (Bullettino d. Inst. Arch.</hi> 1840, p. 140); three from
                    Asia Minor, two of them being inscribed, the one 2^/xovoç, the other <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Apκrτoτeiχης</hi> (Brunn, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic">Künstler,</hi> ii. pp. 633
                    and 604). The only glyptic artist mentioned in this early period is Mnesarchus
                    of Samus, the father of Pythagoras. In contrast with the paucity of early gems
                    from Greek soil is the immense number of scarabs yielded by the tombs of
                    Etruria, which at least reflect the style of this period. The material consists
                    principally of rock-crystal, carnelian, and banded agate, and the subjects, it
                    is worthy of remark, are mostly taken from the heroic legends of Greece, figures
                    of deities being exceedingly scarce, as indeed is also the case on the Etruscan
                    bronze mirrors, which, however, are obviously of a later date.</p>
                <p>Painting, or rather colouring, as it would be more properly described in its
                    earliest phase, in which it was entirely subservient to architecture and
                    ceramography, is said to have been first elevated to an art by Cleanthes of
                    Corinth, who introduced the drawing of figures in outline; by Telephanes of
                    Sicyon, who improved on this by indicating the principal details of anatomy; and
                    finally by Ecphantes of Corinth or .Craton of Sicyon, by the introduction of
                    colours (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N. H.,</hi> xxxv. 3, 15). Again we have
                    Eumarus of Athens, who is said to have first distinguished in his paintings men
                    from women, probably by the means adopted in the early vases, that is, by
                    painting the flesh white in the case of women. The historical truth of these
                    statements may be doubted; not so, however, those that refer to Cimon of
                    Cleonae, who made an unquestionable advance in the treatment of draperies, and
                    in exchanging the conventional manner of rendering the human form for an
                    approach to truthfulness to nature (Aelian, <hi rend="italic">Var. ∏ιst.,</hi>
                    viii. 8; Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N^. H.,</hi> xxxv. 8, 6). Cimon appears to
                    have been the founder of the early.Peloponnesian school <hi rend="italic"
                    >oi</hi> painting. As the task imposed on painters at that time was mostly the
                    decoration of the cella walls of temples, we must suppose that they executed
                    their paintings on the prepared stucco of the wall either when it was fresh <hi
                    rend="italic">(al fresco),</hi> or when it was dry, by means of some binding
                    material, <hi rend="italic">a tempera'.</hi> Like their followers down to the
                    time of Apelles, they used only the simple colours, white, yellow, red, and
                    bluish black, in the mixing of which to obtain other shades they seem to have
                    advanced very little, greater attention being directed to the drawing than to
                    the colouring. From the school of Asia Minor, which, from the proximity of the
                    Lydians, Phrygians, and Phoenicians, with their long practice in working in
                    colours, may have arisen earlier than that of the Peloponnesus, the first name
                    we hear of is that of Bularchus, who, according to Pliny (√V. <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.,</hi> vii. 38, 126; xxxv. 8, 55), produced a large painting of the taking of
                    Magnesia, which he sold to Candaules, king of Lydia, for its weight in gold.
                    From the coast of Asia Minor our records of painting pass to Samus, an island
                    which was conspicuous in early times for the grand scale of its undertakings.
                    There Mandrocles, who made the bridge of boats across the Bosphorus by which
                    Darius crossed with his army 515 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> executed a
                    large historical painting of this passage of the Persians across the bridge,
                    with Darius seated, enthroned, on the shore. This picture, according to
                    Herodotus (iv. 88), was placed in the Heraeum of Samus. To the Samian school
                    belonged Calliphon and Agatharchus. It is also not unlikely that it had
                    exercised some influence on Aglaophon of Thasus, the father and instructor of
                    Polygnotus. From Corinth the art of painting, coupled with that of modelling in
                    clay, passed to Etruria, lower Italy, and Sicily. At present the only examples
                    of early Greek painting which we can adduce are furnished by the vases, a branch
                    of the art which the ancients themselves regarded, it appears, with sufficient
                    disrespect. For us, the vases, which have been preserved in great numbers, have
                    this special value, that they present in an unbroken line, if in a comparatively
                    degraded form, the various stages of Greek painting from its first beginnings
                    under Oriental influence to its decline. The class which belongs to the period
                    now before us is distinguishable from the others by the fact that the figures
                    upon them are first scratched in outline on the red ground of the vase, and then
                    filled in with black, the whole being covered with a varnish which seems to have
                    lost nothing of its brilliancy. The other colours employed are white for the
                    flesh parts of women and the hair of old men, white and a dark purple for the
                    details of draperies and other accessories. The eyes are always placed full in
                    profile, and the drawing of the figures is exceedingly, stiff and angular. By
                    far the greater part of this class of vases have been found in the tombs of
                    Etruria, and for this reason they were called Etruscan, a designation which they
                    retained till the frequency of Greek inscriptions, recording the artists’ names
                    upon them, contrasted with the total absence of Etruscan inscriptions, led to
                    their being correctly traced to Greek workshops. As to their date, it has
                    recently been argued by a high authority (Brunn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Probleme</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">der Geschichte der
                    Vasenmalerei)</hi> that the greater part of these vases—in fact, all that have
                    been found in Etruria, with at most two or three exceptions—are the production
                    of Greek vase painters at a period not earlier than the end of the 3d century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when a taste for the archaic manner must have
                    revived. This theory has encountered much opposition. Applying it to the large
                    collection of vases of this class from Etruria in the British Museum, one vase
                    alone remains as a genuine example of the work of an early period. Whether we
                    regard these vases as spontaneous productions or as imitations, they will serve
                    to convey at best a dim idea of early Greek painting as a fine art. Of the next
                    class of vases—those with red figures on black ground—some appear, from the
                    severity of the drawing, to belong to the end of this period. The whole question
                    of ancient vase-painting has been very fully and ably discussed by Otto Jahn in
                    his Introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Vasen-</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>In temple architecture the principles of both the Doric and Ionic orders were
                    already fully established, the latter in Asia Minor and the former in Greece
                    proper; and it is characteristic of the national importance attached to this
                    branch of art, that not only was the best available talent of the time procured,
                    irrespective of local connection, but also that architects appear to have found
                    a public for the writings in which many of them narrated their proceedings, and
                    described the appliances used by them in building, as did Chersiphron and his
                    son Metagenes in regard to the temple of Diana at Ephesus; or laid down the
                    principles they had followed, as did Theodorus with regard to the temple of Hera
                    at Samus. Among the remains of Doric architecture assignable to this period, the
                    first to be mentioned are the two temples at Paestum (Major, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les Ruines de Paestum, ou de Posidonie,</hi> 1768; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi>
                    Schnaase, <hi rend="italic">Bildende Künste,</hi> ii. fig. 36), of which the
                    larger derives a special interest from the two rows of columns, one above the
                    other, with which it is furnished in the interior, for the purpose of
                    supporting, as it appears, a hypaethral roof. Differing in many details from the
                    Paestum temple is that of Selinus, the sculptured metopes of which have already
                    been described, and assigned to the commencement of this period. The columns are
                    here slimmer, being 41 times the lowest diameter in height; but the architrave
                    has gained in height and heaviness. A transition from the heaviness of the old
                    Doric temples—of Paestum and Selinus, for example—to the graceful proportions of
                    the Doric order in Attica is presented by the temple of Athene in Aegina, the
                    columns of which, however, are still too short, being a little over 5 times the
                    lowest diametèr in height, and the architrave and frieze too high for the
                    Attic-Doric style. Of the Ionic order during this period the principal example
                    was the temple of Diana at Ephesus, the construction of which, begun by
                    Theodorus of Samus, was carried on by Chersiphron of Crete and his son
                    Metagenes, and completed by Demetrius and Paeonius about the time of Croesus,
                    565-551 B.C., 120 years having, it is said, from first to last been consumed on
                    the work (Strabo, xiv. 640; Vitruvius, vii. praef.; Pliny, A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xxxvi. 14, 95). This
                    temple having been burned by Herostratus, was restored under the direction of
                    Alexander’s architect Dinocrates. The oldest instance of the Ionic order in
                    Greece proper, so far as we know, was found in the treasury erected at Olympia
                    by Myron, the tyrant of Sicyon, after his chariot victory, 658 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This building consisted of two chambers, the walls
                    overlaid in the ancient manner with bronze plates, and the one executed in the
                    Ionic, while the other was of the Doric order. The architects of this early time
                    were not, however, restricted to the erection of temples, but had other problems
                    to solve, as, for example, in the Scias of Sparta, a round building with
                    tent-shaped roof, used originally for musical performances and afterwards for
                    public assemblies. Theodorus of Samus was the architect of the Scias. Probably
                    the Odeum erected at Athens by Solon or Pisistratus had the same round form, and
                    was intended for meetings of the same kind. Then followed the construction of
                    theatres, that in Athens, which was of stone, having been commenced shortly
                    after 500 B.c.</p>

                <p>The splendid victories of Salamis, Plataeae, and Mycale, gave an immediate and
                    powerful impulse towards public undertakings, and especially, so far as we are
                    at present concerned, towards the erection of temples and monuments worthy of
                    the just pride of the nation. A sense of freedom and relief from long and
                    troublous fears must have been the ruling feeling of the time; and of the
                    efforts, both intellectual and artistic, which such new-born feelings engender,
                    history has its examples. Of all the Greeks, the Athenians had in that crisis
                    earned the best title to patriotic emotions, and in Athens, above all Greece
                    besides, the aspirations were highest. Nor were means wanting to second the
                    boldest designs. The Peloponnesians had loitered in the great conflict with the
                    Persians, and in sharing the new impulse they loitered also. The Persian
                    invasion had not, however, been hurled back by a stroke of fortune, but, on the
                    contrary, by the united action which discipline and sev,ere habits of life gave
                    to the Greek forces; and in the same way the men who thereafter achieved the
                    first triumphs in art, who diffused freedom throughout its realm, were men who
                    had been trained in severe schools, where close study, no less than respect for
                    popular feeling, restrained the exercise of the imagination. Accordingly, before
                    we can appreciate the artistic freedom established by Phidias, we must see how
                    far his early training prepared him to fight the battle. This can only be done
                    by examining the works of other sculptors, either pupils of the same master, as
                    were Myron and Polycletus, or probably contemporary, though more hardened in the
                    traditions of their school, as was Calamis the Athenian, with whom we begin,
                    remarking that the only known approximate date in his lifetime is from 468 to
                    464 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The works of Calamis extended over a
                    tolerably wide field of subject, and were executed partly in marble and partly
                    in bronze; but with the exception of two copies of his statue of Hermes
                    Criophorus at Tanagra, on the coins of that town, and in a marble figure in
                    Wilton House, none of our remains of ancient sculpture have as yet been
                    identified with his style. Cicero <hi rend="italic">(Brut.,</hi> 18, 70) and
                    Quintilian (xii. 10, 7) speak of him as less rigid and hard in his rendering of
                    the human form than Callon and Canachus; but the real advance with which his
                    name is associated was in the rendering of expression in the female face, and in
                    the treatment of draperies. A figure of Alcmene by him was highly praised
                    (Pliny, A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">II.,</hi> xxxiv. 19,
                    71), while his statue of Sosandra, on the Acropolis of Athens, is spoken of in
                    the highest terms by Lucian <hi rend="italic">(Imag.,</hi> 4, 6; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dial. Meretr.,</hi> 3, 2) for its chaste and tender expression,
                    for its taste in dress, and for the noble bearing of the whole figure. His
                    horses were always incomparable. To have attained the power of expressing
                    modesty and mobile character in a figure was to have laid the foundation for
                    idealism in its true sense; and Calamis was therefore on the same path with
                    Phidias.</p>
                <p>We come now to Myron, a native of Eleutherae in Attica, and a pupil of Ageladas
                    of Argus. With rare exceptions, he worked in bronze, and that of the Aeginetan
                    kind, while Polycletus émployed the bronze of Delus. His works, which were
                    numerous, and scattered from Asia Minor to Sicily, may be divided into the four
                    classes of deities, heroes, athletes, and animals, with a considerable variety
                    ranging within’ each of the classes. He avoided female figures almost
                    throughout; and though he was the author of statues of Dionysus and Apollo, it
                    should be remembered that these deities had not become soft of form till
                    Praxiteles made them so. He preferred the well-knit figures of athletes, or of
                    Perseus or Hercules. His animals were marvels to the ancients; and the human
                    figures in which he succeeded best were those in which purely physical qualities
                    were pronounced. “Corporum tenus curiosus, animi sensus non expressit,” says
                    Pliny of him. But, according to the same authority, he was careless in rendering
                    the hair, from which it is to be inferred that his study of the human form did
                    not lead him, as it did Pythagoras, to an anxious reproduction of all its
                    details. Then we have the further statement of Pliny—“Primus hic multiplicasse
                    veritatem videtur, numerosior in arte quam Polycletus, et in symmetria
                    diligentior.” As we understand “multiplicasse veritatem,” it would mean that he
                    exaggerated the truth of nature to give effect to the momentary attitude of his
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0376-0355"/> figures. “Symmetria” we take to refer to the
                    manner in which every member and part of the body was made to work together for
                    the expression of one moment of action. Such a style at least presents a very
                    obvious contrast to that of Polycletus, and would answer our expectations when
                    we read that Myron’s statue of Ladas seemed about to leap from its base to seize
                    the victor’s wreath, the last breath leaving his lips. (For a different
                    interpretation see Brunn, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Griech.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Künstler,</hi> sub Pythagoras). Among his figures of animals, that
                    of a bronze cow which stood on the Acropolis of Athens, and was afterwards
                    removed to the temple of Peace in Rome, was celebrated by numerous epigrams. Of
                    his other works, some have been preserved in copies down to our own time. A copy
                    of the figure of Marsyas (from his group of Athene and Marsyas) has been
                    recognised in a marble statue in the Lateran Museum <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(JZom.</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Inst.,</hi> vi. pl. 23; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annali,</hi> xxx. p. 374). Of his bronze statue of a Discobolus, famous in
                    antiquity (Quintilian, ii. 13, 10; Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Philops.,</hi> 18)
                    for the boldness of its movement and the carefulness of its execution, we have
                    several copies, of which the best is the marble statue in the palace Massimi at
                    Rome (Müller, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi> i. pl. 32, No. 139, ό). Another
                    marble copy in the British Museum has not only had its head (if original) placed
                    on the shoulders the wrong way, but has been made smooth on the surface by a
                    vigorous rubbing down, which has destroyed the original lines. A third copy of
                    bronze, about a foot high, is in Munich. (For a list of his other works, known
                    only by name, see Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Ant.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Schriftquellen</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Myron. ) F rom the few copies of
                    his statues which we possess, and the few ancient remarks as to his style, it
                    seems impossible to frame a conception of his work which would justify the
                    extraordinary reputation he enjoyed. We can picture the action of his figures,
                    but we cannot estimate the equivalents for actual life and organism which he
                    must have employed to have almost completely satisfied eyes accustomed to the
                    .work of Phidias. This, however, we gather from the remarks on his statue of
                    Ladas and .the Discobolus, that he seized for his representation the moment when
                    the whole breath was held back for a final effort of strength—that moment, in
                    fact, when the human figure is most truly statuesque. For an instant the body is
                    then lifeless, so to speak, like the statue itself: the spectator suspends
                    breathing, in sympathy.</p>
                <p>We have reached the time of Phidias, and have now done with imperfections in
                    sculpture, so far at least as they originated in want of knowledge either of the
                    huinan form or of technical means. Phidias, the son of Charmides, was an
                    Athenian, and must have been born about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> or a
                    little before, if we can trust the statement (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pericl.,</hi> 31) that in the portraits of himself and Pericles, which he
                    placed on the shield of Athene Parthenos, he appeared a bald-headed old man,
                    while Pericles appeared handsome and full of vigour (K. O. Müller, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Phidioe</hi><hi rend="italic">Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Operibus Commentationes Tres,</hi> Gotting. 1827; Brunn, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler,</hi> i. p. 157). A fragment of a marble shield in
                    the British Museum, found on the Acropolis of Athens, and representing a combat
                    of Greeks and Amazons, in which a bald-headed old man appears, has been
                    recognised as a rough copy of the shield in question. Phidias began his career
                    as a painter; then turning to sculpture, studied first under his townsman
                    Hegias, and afterwards under the Argive master Ageladas. It may have been due to
                    his training in this school that his first two important works were executed in
                    bronze The first was a large group, commissioned by the Athenians to be paid for
                    out of their booty from the Persian war, and to be dedicated at Delphi. The
                    second was a colossal statue of Athene, the Promachos, also commissioned by the
                    Athenians out of the Persian booty, and when finished erected on the Acropolis,
                    between the Propylaea and Erechtheum, the top of the spear which she held, and
                    the crest of her helmet being visible at sea from Cape Sunium (Pausanias, i. 28,
                    2). On certain coins on which the Acropolis is figured occurs a statue which
                    seems to correspond with the description, except that the goddess there stands
                    placidly, an attitude that does not suit the idea of a Promachos. This idea is
                    finely embodied in a small bronze statuette (fig. 5), found on the Acropolis and
                    now in the British Museum, representing the goddess striding forward. Otherwise
                    it has little of Phidias in it. Possibly the Promachos statue was wrongly
                    ascribed to Phidias in ancient times. Again profiting by the Persian spoils, he
                    was employed by the Plataeans to execute a figure of Athene Areia for their new
                    temple (Pausanias, ix. 4, 1). The figuré was of wood, covered with gold; the
                    face, hands, and feet, of Pentelic marble; the whole being of colossal
                    proportions. He had previously made a figure of Athene in gold and ivory for a
                    temple at Pallene in Achaea, and this must be regarded as the first of his works
                    executed in the material in which he afterwards achieved his greatest triumph
                    (Pausanias, vii. 27, 2).</p>
                <p>We must suppose that his faculties were now at their best, that he was fully
                    aware of the peculiarities of treatment required by the different materials in
                    which sculptors then worked, and had found the best scope for his own talent in
                    chryselephantine sculpture. The two works with which his fame was chiefly
                    associated were in gold and ivory,—the colossal statues of Athene for the
                    Parthenon at Athens, and of Zeus for the temple at Olympia. After the completion
                    of the former statue, Phidias accepted the invitation of the people of Elis to
                    exert his highest power in fashioning for their temple of Zeus at Olympia a
                    statue worthy of the majesty and grandeur of the supreme god of Greece. His
                    workshop was near the Altis or sacred grove, where through successive centuries
                    down to the 2d <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it was preserved and pointed out
                    with feelings of reverence. The finished work was over 40 feet high, and
                    represented the god seated on his throne, his right hand holding forward a
                    figure of Victory, and his left resting on a sceptre on which the eagle was
                    perched. On his head was a wreath of olive. The drapery was of gold, richly
                    worked with flowers and figures in enamel, in the execution of which he was
                    assisted by his brother or cousin Panaenus. On the footstool was inscribed the
                    verse—</p>
                <p>ΦetδiftS Xαpμiδoυ uiδs <hi rend="italic">'Mηvaios</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >μ'</hi><hi rend="italic">iιrolησe</hi></p>
                <p>(Pausanias, v. 10, 2). The throne was mostly of ebony and ivory, inlaid with
                    precious stones, and richly sculptured with reliefs, and in parts painted. Of
                    this, the greatest work of Phidias, nothing but the description now remains
                    (Pausanias, v. 15). The figure of Zeus seated on a throne, which occurs on coins
                    of Elis struck in Roman times, may have been intended as a reminiscence of it.
                    On the other hand, there is in the British Museum a silver coin of Elis, struck
                    in the best period of Greek art, on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n377/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0377-0356"/> which is a head of the god so singularly powerful
                    iu type that we are tempted to believe it to be a copy from the head of the
                    statue of Phidias, appealing to the analogy of the coins of Argus with what is
                    accepted as a copy of the head of the figure of Hera by Polycletus. Among the
                    existing examples of Greek sculpture there is only one which claims to be a
                    direct work of Phidias, and that is one of the two colossal marble statues on
                    the Monte Cavallo at Rome, inscribed respectively “opus Phidiae” and “opus
                    Praxitelis” (Clarae, <hi rend="italic">Musée de Sculpture,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >yλ,</hi> 812 A,No. 2043). Grand as both are, the marking of the pupils of the
                    eyes and the treatment of the armour prove them to have been executed in Roman
                    times, probably as copies of celebrated statues. The originals must clearly have
                    been the work of one master, and the inscriptions being thus wrong in ascribing
                    them to two, must be held as worthless. On the other hand, we possess in the
                    sculptures of the Parthenon a large series of works in marble at least designed
                    or modelled by Phidias, and executed under his immediate care, if not in many '
                    cases finished by his own hands. These sculptures consist of figures in the
                    round from the pediments, the metopes in high relief, and the frieze in low flat
                    relief. The statues of the pediments have suffered most, and that mainly from
                    two causes—the antipathies or necessities of the early Christians, who converted
                    the temple into a church; and the fatal explosion produced by the falling of a
                    shell among the powder stored in it during the Venetian bombardment under
                    Morosini, 1687. The extent’ of the mischief on this occasion is known from the
                    drawings previously made of the temple as it stood, 1674, by Carrey, an artist
                    in the employment of the French ambassador at the Porte. In 1805, Lord Elgin,
                    then British ambassador at the Porte, removed all the sculptures that could be
                    removed with safety to the building, shipped them to London, where, after a long
                    dispute as to their merits, they at last, in 1815, found a permanent
                    resting-place in the British Museum. (For a narrative of these proceedings, but
                    especially for an exhaustive work on the Parthenon, see Michaelis, <hi

                    >Parthenon,</hi> pls. 26-28). The subject of the eastern pediment was the birth
                    of Athene; of the western, her contest with Poseidon for supremacy over Attica;
                    but beyond the simple statement of Pausanias to this effect, we have no ancient
                    record to enable us to identify the personages before whom these events took
                    place. Hence the many different names which have been proposed from time to time
                    for the surviving figures, especially for those of the eastern pediment, from
                    which all the principal statues had disappeared before Carrey’s time. Assuming,
                    however, with the most recent authority (E. Petersen, <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Kunst des Pheidias,</hi> 1874), that the birth of Athene took place in Olympus,
                    and that the deities assembled at the birth of Aphrodite, as represented by
                    Phidias on the base of the statue at Olympia, were the recognised Olympians of
                    his time, we obtain, beginning from Helios on the left, Dionysus, Demeter, and
                    Core, Iris [Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus, Athene, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon], Nike
                    [Ares, Hermes], Hestia, Peitho, Aphrodite, and Selene, those in brackets being
                    missing. The western pediment has suffered a much harder fate, though the
                    difficulty of recalling the lines of the original composition is less, owing to
                    the preservation of drawings made by Carrey before the bombardment which
                    destroyed it. The metopes were ninety-two in number; those of the east and west
                    only remain on the building, but have suffered severely from malicious
                    destruction. Those of the north side, which survived the explosion, remain in
                    Athens in bad condition; those of the south were removed by Lord Elgin, with the
                    exception of one now in the Louvre and some fragments in Copenhagen. The
                    subject—a favourite one in the decoration of Greek architecture—was a combat
                    between Centaurs and Lapithae. Traces of red colour were found on the ground of
                    the relief and of green on the draperies. The armour had been attached in metal,
                    as is proved by the existing holes for that purpose. Differences in style as
                    well as in execution prove the variety of hands employed in the work, though
                    everywhere is apparent the oneness of design which bespeaks the overseeing
                    master. The variety of hands is equally manifest in the frieze, but here it
                    takes the form of insufficiency of execution, which no doubt arose from the
                    difficulty of supervising work which had to be done up on the building. The
                    subject of the frieze is a long festal procession, in which, though every
                    variety of movement of horse and foot, of young and old, of men and women,
                    perhaps of gods and goddesses, is introduced, the calm dignity of national pride
                    and the knowledge of national worth reign supreme. Its entire length is 524
                    feet, its height from the ground 40 feet, its relief very low and flat. About
                    two-thirds of it is preserved, nearly the half being in the British Museum. As
                    to the procession itself, there are two opinions: either it is the procession
                    with which it was usual to accompany annually the newly-made robe for Athene
                    Polias, or it is the procession in which the victors at the Panathenaic games
                    advanced to the Parthenon to receive their prizes and to attend a sacrifice in
                    honour of Victory.</p>
                <p>The mantle of Phidias fell on his pupil Alcamenes (Pausanias, v. 10, 8), an
                    Athenian, or, as others said, a Lemnian, the lofty conception in his figures of
                    deities being highly praised (Quintilian, xii. 10, 8), while in point of
                    gracefulness in womanly forms he appears to have excelled his master. His most
                    celebrated work was a statue of Aphrodite for her temple, <hi rend="italic">εv
                    κηπoι&lt;s,</hi> of which, however, the merit of the last touch was ascribed to
                    Phidias (Pliny, xxxvi. 5, 16). Her cheeks, hands, and fingers were specially
                    admired; but as to the attitude and general effect we have no information, and
                    are not justified in accepting the Aphrodite of Melus in the Louvre as a copy of
                    it, much less the original work. How far he may have been possessed of the power
                    of creating new ideal types is not expressly recorded, except in the instance of
                    his statue of a triple Hecate, probably such as we know her in later works. On
                    the other hand, there was doubtless scope for extending the new influence of
                    Phidias in such types as those of Aesculapius, Hephaestus, and Ares, and 'it has
                    been conjectured that in his statues of these deities he succeeded in infusing
                    the spirit of his master.</p>
                <p>Scarcely less famous was another pupil of Phidias, Agoracritus of Parus, who so
                    far identified himself with the master’s style that two marble statues of
                    deities by him were sometimes ascribed to Phidias. The one was a figure of
                    Nemesis in Rhamnus; the other, a statue of Rhea in the Metroon at Athens
                    (Pausanias, i. 3, 5). From his hand were also, the bronze statues of Athene
                    Itonia and of Zeus, in the temple of that goddess between Alal-comenae and
                    Coronea (Pausanias, ix. 34, 1). Next we have Colotes and Thrasymedes of Parus,
                    both of whom occasionally aspired to retain the chryselephantine technique of
                    the master; and finally, Theocosmus of Megara.</p>
                <p>How far the immediate successors of Phidias remained, whatever their
                    peculiarities or eccentricities, still faithful to the general sentiment and
                    manner of the master, merely varying but always preserving essentially the theme
                    struck by him, cannot be ascertained, unless we take the sculptures of the
                    temple of Athene Nike at Athens, or of the Erechtheum, as typical examples of
                    their work. And indeed they are well calculated to produce the impression of
                    having been executed during the lull which must have followed his great impulse.

                    stiffness and formality of an early period, and become flowing, as in the style
                    of the best times, but with the addition of a studied grace which seems due to a
                    desire to elaborate more and more the simplicity of the draped figures of the
                    Parthenon. The most probable date as yet suggested for this temple is 407 B.c.
                    As to the Erechtheum, we have 406 B.C., on the authority of an inscription, as a
                    year in which a report was made concerning the amount of work that remained to
                    be done upon it. Of its sculptures the chief remains are the statues of the
                    Caryatides, and certain fragments of the frieze, which had this peculiarity,
                    that the reliefs were executed in Pentelic marble, and then attached to a ground
                    of black Eleusinian stone. Of the original six Caryatides which supported the
                    portico, five were in position in the time of Stuart and Revett in the first
                    half of last century; the sixth, having been broken to pieces, was recovered in
                    1837. One of the five was removed by Lord Elgin, and is now in the British
                    Museum. In the arrangement of the draperies vertical lines prevail; but only
                    enough to show the architectural purpose of the figures, not to destroy their
                    character as robes, or to affect their gracefulness. It is usual to compare with
                    the sculptures of these two temples another series of reliefs which, though not
                    found in Attica, are stated to have been the work of Ictinus, the architect of
                    the Parthenon. We refer to the frieze from the temple of Apollo at Phigalia
                    which was discovered in 1812, and is now in the British Museum. The subjects
                    represented are combats between Greeks and Amazons and between Centaurs and
                    Lapithae. In the composition the old ethos has given way to pathos; but the
                    figures are still large in conception, and obviously studied with a view to
                    truth as well as effect, though in the execution probably by provincial hands,
                    many minor details have been overlooked. The energy of action throughout is not
                    equalled in any other ancient sculpture now in existence, while the sense of
                    pain in the w ounded, or of fright in the helpless women who run with their
                    infants in their arms, makes the spectator shudder. From the fact that such
                    vigour of action and intensity of pathetic expression have not been found in the

                    same subject, but recur in a less degree in the frieze of the Mausoleum, there
                    is an inclination to place the Phigalian reliefs by Ictinus in as late a period
                    as possible after the erection of the Parthenon. (Engraved, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The difference of temperament between the Athenians and Peloponnesians was
                    strongly marked in the schools of sculpture peculiar to each. Political rivalry
                    had its exact counterpart in artistic rivalry, in which Phidias represented
                    Athens, and Polycletus the Peloponnesus. The works of the latter appear to have
                    been always chastened with an hereditary severity, to have been attractive by
                    the purity of their style and the finish of execution, but not commanding in
                    aspect. “Non explevisse deorum auctoritatem videtur,” the judgment of Quintilian
                    (xii. 10, 7) is endorsed by the statement, that his great w ork, the
                    chryselephantine statue of Hera at Argus, yielded to the statue of Zeus at
                    Olympia by Phidias in grandeur and imposing aspect, but out-rivalled it in
                    finish (Strabo, viii. p. 372). Copies of the head of this statue have been
                    identified on coins of Argus, and in three marble heads of colossal size. The
                    first, in Naples, is severe in style, and may have been executed about the time
                    of Polycletus; the second, in the British Museum, has more freedom, but is still
                    chastened by a severe expression; the third, in the Villa Ludovisi, bears the
                    marks of having been executed at a still later period. It was not, however, in
                    producing statues of deities that Polycletus delighted most; and if surpassed by
                    Phidias in that instance, he was quite without a rival in his own province, the
                    rendering of the form of ideal athletes. Of this class were his Diadumenus, his
                    Doryphorus, and a third figure (unless the Doryphorus was meant by Pliny) known
                    as the Canon. Of the first, several presumed copies in marble exist, two of them
                    in the British Museum (fig. 7), but in no case furnishing an adequate
                    illustration of his style. The same may be said of the copies of the Doryphorus.
                    More in the nature of <hi rend="italic">genre</hi> work was his bronze group of
                    boys playing with knuckle-bones (ασ∙τpαγαλ⅛ovτ∈ς), which afterwards stood in the
                    palace of Titus in Rome, and was by some regarded as the most perfect work of
                    the master. This motive occurs in several existing sculptures, in no case
                    characterised by a trace of the hand of Polycletus. Among them are, in the
                    British Museum, a small group in terra-cotta of two women playing at this game,
                    and a marble figure of a boy, part of a group, biting his companion’s hand.
                    Coupled with his statue of Hera, that of an Amazon, executed by him for Ephesus,
                    in competition with the foremost of his contemporaries, and adjudged the prize,
                    will prove that the range of his talent was by no means confined to figures of
                    athletes; and this is made further apparent by his bronze statues of maidens
                    carrying sacred vessels on their heads, afterwards in the possession of Heius
                    the Mamertine, from whom they were taken by Verres (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">In
                    Verr.,</hi> iv. 3, 5), as also by his statue of the Samian, Artemon, nicknamed ό

                <p>None of the pupils of</p>
                <p>Polycletus arrived at distinction. On the other hand, his style appears to have
                    been closely followed by his younger contemporary, Naucydes of Argus, who
                    executed a chryselephantine statue of Hebe, to accompany that, of the same
                    material, by the master already described (Pausanias, ii. 17, 5; Kekulé, <hi

                    of several statues of victors at Olympia, and of a statue of Zeus Philius
                    (Pausanias, viii. 31, 4), in which the expression resembled that of
                    Dionysus.</p>
                <p>In addition to the existing sculptures already mentioned in connection with one
                    or other of the ancient masters, there are others which, though their authorship
                    has not been ascertained, undoubtedly belong to the period now before us. From
                    these w e select—(1.) A marble relief in Athens, found at Eleusis in 1859, and
                    representing Demeter, Cora, and boy, for whom the name either of Triptolemus or
                    Jacchus would be applicable (Jfonwwιβnii, vi. pl. 45.) With the exception of a
                    marked severity both in the composition and in the details, which may be due
                    either to archaism or to a studied solemnity, this relief compares admirably
                    with the frieze of the Parthenon. (2.) From Eleusis also comes the upper part of
                    a female figure supporting a basket on her head (Calathephorus), now in
                    Cambridge, in a large fine style (Wieseler, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi>
                    ii. pl. 8, No. 92). (3.) Marble relief of Orpheus and</p>
                <p>Eurydice, in the Villa Albani, with its two replicas in Naples and Paris. (4.)
                    Fragments of the metopes from the temple of Zeus at Olympia, found in 1829, and
                    now in Paris. Doubtless these reliefs were executed at the time when Phidias was
                    at Olympia engaged on the statue for this temple, and when his pupil Alcamenes
                    was at work on the figures for the western pediment of it. In style, however,
                    they differ considerably from that of the Attic sculptors; nor are there any
                    means of identifying them with the style of Paeonius of Mende, who executed the
                    statues for the eastern pediment <hi rend="italic">(Expédit.

                    Athens are still in their original place, the style being compared with that of
                    the metopes of the Parthenon, though the temple itself is usually believed to
                    have been built by Cimon (Stuart’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi>
                    2d ed.. ii pl. 19)</p>
                <p>Examples of what may be called a lower branch of sculpture (gem-engravingS are
                    exceedingly rare in this period. So far as Athens is concerned, this will appear
                    less remarkable if we suppose that gem-engraving and die-sinking were one
                    profession, and remember that at least the latter must have been, with few
                    exceptions, unpractised there in the best period, the coins being allowed,
                    probably for commercial reasons, to retain the old stamp with which people were
                    familiar. Possibly also the high ideal of the times was above the grasp of such
                    artists, though it was seized pretty generally by the sculptors of stelae, who
                    could hardly have been men of note. In the British Museum is a carnelian (fig 8)
                    representing a youthful figure, seated, and playing on a harp-shaped instrument,
                    which, with a little severity, admirably reflects the style of the Parthenon
                    frieze. Of the coins of Sicily, the large piece known as the Demaretion, and
                    struck in the year 479 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> furnishes an example of
                    the rendering of horses, which compares finely, if more advanced, with the
                    archaic frieze from Xanthus. Similarly w orthy of study are the coins of Gelon,
                    which are probably as early as 470 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and certainly
                    are anterior to 410 B.c.</p>
                <p>In the records of painting during the previous period it was noticeable that
                    painters even then, in what appeared to be one of the earliest stages of the
                    art, were accustomed to execute large compositions, such as battle scenes. The
                    essentially decorative character of the art required that it should be so, just
                    as in early sculpture, in which also the decorative element prevailed, our
                    principal records are those of large compositions, such as the chest of Cypselus
                    or the shield of Achilles. While the epos flourished, and the country was full
                    of heroic legends, there can be little doubt but that the principal pleasure
                    derived from works of art lay in the variety of the subject and the manner in
                    which it was presented, that is, in the composition, and not in the truthful
                    rendering of individual forms. To heighten the interest of the spectator, it was
                    usual to write the name beside each of the persons that appeared in a picture,
                    as we see it done on the early vases. The same was the case with the sculptured
                    reliefs on the chest of Cypselus, which on this account presents a remarkable
                    contrast to the shield of Achilles, on which, as in Assyrian sculptures, there
                    is no prominence of individuals, and therefore no accurate study of the human
                    form. It is not to be supposed that in the early stage of Greek painting
                    individual forms "were studied with any other view than that of rendering the
                    characters more intelligible; but with this a beginning was made to lift the art
                    into a higher sphere. At this stage appeared Polygnotus, a native of Thasus, and
                    a son of the painter Aglaophon, of whose probable connection with the early
                    Samian school mention has already been made. Attracted to Athens by the
                    opportunity presented by the new buildings which were then being erected,
                    Polygnotus, either owing to some family tie or through the recommendation of his
                    own ability, found favour with Cimon, to whose zeal and taste the new impulse
                    for the improvement of the city was due. In company with, or perhaps rather with
                    the assistance of, the Athenian painters Micon and Panaenus (the brother or
                    cousin of Phidias), he was employed to execute wall paintings for the Stoa
                    Poecile, the Theseum, and the Anaceum, or temple of the Dioscuri at the northern
                    foot of the Acropolis. For his services, and especially for the
                    disinterestedness of his character, Polygnotus received what was then regarded
                    as the highest distinction—the freedom of the city of Athens. His friendship
                    with Cimon was intimate, and led, it was said (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cimon,</hi> 4), to an affectionate acquaintance with Cimon’s half-sister, the
                    beautiful Elpinice. From Athens he w as called to Delphi to execute a series of
                    paintings for the two long walls of the Lesche, a building erected there by the
                    people of Cnidus. The paintings, however, appear to have been commissioned by
                    the Amphictyonie council, if it is right to be guided to that conclusion by the
                    statement that the painter was rewarded with the rights of hospitality
                    throughout the states included in the Amphictyonie league. On the wall to the
                    right after entering the Lesche were painted scenes illustrative of the old epos
                    of the taking of Troy (’Ιλίου 7rεpσtς). On the left was the visit of Ulysses to
                    the lower world, as described in Book xi. of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi>
                    The names of most of the persons were written by the side of the figures. The
                    various groups and incidents depicted we know from the description of Pausanias
                    (x. 25-31); and with the help of existing works of art in which the same subject
                    recurs, we can form an idea of the composition (0. Jahn, <hi rend="italic"

                    pregnant with pathos as no other vase in existence, cannot well be identified
                    with the style of Polygnotus, unless perhaps as regards the composition. He was
                    employed at Thespiae on a stoa or temple, but from some defect his work had
                    perished so far within a century after it was <pb break="no"

                    Sicyon. At Plataeae he painted for one of the walls of the pronaos of a temple
                    the scene in which Ulysses appeared with the dead suitors at his feet. The
                    companion picture was by an otherwise unknown artist, Onasias, the subject of it
                    being the Expedition of the Seven against Thebes (Pausanias, ix. 4, 2). Lastly,
                    Pausanias (i. 22, 6) ascribes to Polygnotus a series of paintings in the
                    so-called Pinako-theke on the Acropolis of Athens. If he is right, the painter
                    must then have been full seventy years of age. The subjects were—(1.) Ulysses
                    carrying off the bow of Philoctetes; (2.) Diomede carrying off the Palladium of
                    Troy; (3.) Orestes and Pylades slaying Aegisthus and the sons of Nauplius, who
                    had come to his aid; (4.) Polyxena about to be sacrificed to the manes of
                    Achilles; (5.) Achilles in Scyrus; and (6.) Ulysses meeting Nausicaa and her
                    maids. The other pictures had become unrecognisable through the effects of time.
                    This second mention of the decay of his works reminds us of the fleeting nature
                    of the material with which the fame of the great painter was bound up. It was
                    well that high honours were paid him in his lifetime. The enduring marble in
                    which Phidias worked has preserved his fame to our times, to mock the
                    indignities which he suffered in life. As regards the style of Polygnotus,, we
                    have the distinction drawn by Aristotle <hi rend="italic">(Poet.,</hi> 2, 6; <hi
                    rend="italic">Polit.,</hi> viii. 5) between it and that of Zeuxis—a distinction
                    which he expressed by the words <hi rend="italic">ethos</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pathos.</hi> By ethos, as applied to the paintings of Polygnotus,
                    we understand a dignified bearing in his figures, and a measured movement
                    throughout his compositions, such as the Parthenon frieze presents, compared
                    with the pathetic rendering of scenes in the frieze from the temple of Apollo at
                    Phigalia, or in the frieze of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. It was also said
                    (Pliny, A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> XXXV. 35,
                    58) that in place of the old severity and rigidity of the features he introduced
                    a great variety of expression, and was the first to paint figures with the lips
                    open; and further, he was accredited (Lucian, <hi rend="italic">Imag.,</hi> 7)
                    with great improvements in the rendering of drapery, so as to show the forms
                    underneath. He painted in monochrome on a white ground; so that, in fact, the
                    principal charm of his work must have been in the drawing. His brother
                    Aristophon appears to have also inherited an elevated conception and a power of
                    carrying out large compositions. Among the younger contemporaries of Polygnotus
                    were Dionysius of Colophon, laboriously accurate, and Pauson, the butt of
                    Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">(Thesmoph.,</hi> v. 949, and elsewhere),
                    remarkable for his talent of caricature and animal painting.</p>
                <p>The works of these painters have entirely perished, nor in what remains of the
                    work of their humble imitators, the vase painters, is there much that can be
                    justly regarded as reflecting their style. Besides the Athenian lecythi, which
                    give some sort of an idea of the effect of colours as employed by Polygnotus,
                    there is a class of vases, with red figures on a black ground, which, by the
                    treatment of the drapery as a transparent substance, recall the statement to the
                    same effect made in respect of the great painter. In many cases, also, the

                <p>The history of architecture during tlιis period is an unexampled record of great
                    undertakings throughout Greece, but more especially in Athens, which, if. it had
                    suffered most from the Persian invasion, had also in the end acquired the most
                    ample means of repairing its ruins and adding fresh lustre to its aspect.
                    Themistocles having been banished, the administration and the carrying out of
                    works begun by him—such, for example, as the long walls connecting the city with
                    the harbour—fell to Cimon. The city walls on the south side of the Acropolis
                    were rebuilt, and a tower erected to command the entrance, which, however, being
                    afterwards rendered useless by the ereoti on of the Propylaea, was removed to
                    make way for the temple of Athene Nike. Among the new temples the first to be
                    mentioned is the Theseum, which is not only well preserved still, but is also
                    the oldest existing example of the Attic-Doric order (Stuart and Rivett, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi> iii. pl. 7). The other temples, the
                    erection of which may with great probability be traced to Cimon, are the
                    Anaceum, or temple of the Dioscuri, at the foot of the Acropolis, on the north
                    side; and a small temple, now quite destroyed, on the left bank of the Hissus,
                    which existed in Stuart ’ ε time, and, from his drawing <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Antiquities of Athens,</hi> L pl. 7), is seen to have been of the Ionic order,
                    differing from the Attic-Ionic in wanting the dentils of the cornice, in having
                    the base of its columns composed of a trochilus between two spirals, and in
                    having its architrave quite plain. Cimon was succeeded by Pericles, under whose
                    administration the resources of the city, not only in means, but in the talent
                    of using the existing means, were applied with the greatest judgment and energy,
                    foremost among his advisers being Phidias. According to Plutarch <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pericl.,</hi> 133), Phidias exercised a general supervision over
                    all the public works then going on. Apparently at this time was erected the
                    Odeum, a building intended for musical performances, circular in form, and, as
                    appears from the records of it (Vitruv., v. 9; Pausanias, i. 20, 4), brilliantly
                    decorated with numerous columns in the interior, and with a tent-shaped roof of
                    wood. It was the Acropolis, however, that was reserved for the crowning effort
                    of architecture in this period. Within the space of probably not more than five
                    or six years there rose on the site of an old temple of Athene, which had been
                    destroyed by the Persians, the Parthenon, a model for all time of the Doric
                    order, pure and perfect in its architectural forms and proportions. The
                    architect was Ictinus, who was assisted by Callicratidas (Stuart, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi> ii. pl. 7; Penrose, <hi rend="italic"

                    undertaking was the so-called Propylaea, a building which, though practically
                    serving as an entrance to the Acropolis, aspired to a highly decorative
                    character (Stuart, <hi rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi> ii. pl. 42).
                    The architect was Mnesicles. Contemporary with the building of the Propylaea, it
                    appears, was that of the small temple of Athene Nike, on the Acropolis, which,
                    on the removal of a Turkish structure in 1835, was recovered in almost all its
                    parts, except some slabs of the frieze, brought by Lord Elgin to England, and
                    now in the British Museuni (Beulé, <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">des Niketempels}.</hi> Outside of Athens the example of the
                    Periclean activity was felt at Eleusis, where a great temple for the Mysteries
                    was commenced, from designs by Ictinus, and carried to completion by the three
                    successive architects, Coroebus, Metagenes, and Xenocles. The small temple, <hi
                    rend="italic">in antis,</hi> of Artemis Propylaea at Eleusis probably belongs to
                    this period, as does also the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus, of which we have
                    still important remains. There is yet to be mentioned the Erechtheum, or temple
                    of Athene Polias, on the Acropolis of Athens, which, though the only date we
                    possess of it falls after the death of Pericles, bears the strongest impress,
                    both in its architectural and sculptured forms, of the great age. The date
                    referred to is the twenty-third year of the Peloponnesian war, and occurs in an
                    inscription found on the Acropolis in several pieces, in which is given the
                    report drawn up by a commission appointed to inspect the progress of the works
                    (Inwood, <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Erechtheum</hi><hi

                    In the British Museum, besides part of this inscription, are several specimens
                    of the architectural decoration, and one of the Caryatides (or draped female
                    figures who supported the portico), in which the simplicity of the drapery and
                    the dignity of the pose are quite in the spirit of the Parthenon sculptures. The
                    temple of Apollo Epicurius at Phigalia, in Arcadia, the work of Ictinus, the
                    architect of the Parthenon, necessarily belongs also to this period (Cockerell,
                    <hi rend="italic">Temples of Jupiter at</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">and Apollo at Phigalia).</hi> The great temples at Olympia and
                    Delphi, though begun earlier, may also be reckoned among the works of this
                    period, to which also belongs a large series of Doric temples in the Greek towns
                    of Sicily and Magna Graecia, particularly those of Syracuse, Agrigentum,
                    Selinus, Egesta, and Metapontum. Of these the most remarkable are the southern
                    temple in the lower town of Selinus, and the somewhat more recent temple of Zeus
                    at Agrigentum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fourth Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the beginning of our last period, the political and social circumstances of
                    Greece have suffered a marked change. More or less it was then accepted as a
                    dogma that, provided the state was flourishing, the prosperity of individuals
                    mattered little. All were for the state, and by their union in the state’s
                    emergency had achieved a glorious freedom, the sense of which filled the
                    national mind, and prepared it to respond with a fostering sympathy to the
                    efforts of artists, whom it also inspired. Yet, conscious as they must have been
                    of their own services, the men of that generation turned rather in pride to the
                    deeds of their ancestral heroes, and in humility to the assistance of the gods.
                    They sought to frame their conduct on the traditions of the past. They were
                    rigorous and strong in thought. Passion was a thing to deplore, not to study,
                    analyse, and represent. The national history was still unchequered. Nor was the
                    house of Hellas as yet to any degree openly divided against itself. There was no
                    need of artists—whether poet, as Aeschylus, or sculptor, as Phidias—to depict
                    the struggles of passion or other conditions of the mind. Now this is all
                    changed. The nation has lost its unity, and the Peloponnesian war has made havoc
                    of its resources. Aeschylus has given way to Sophocles and Euripides, Phidias to
                    Scopas and Praxiteles. Poets and sculptors of the new generation have chosen as
                    their theme the representation of pathos and of the conditions of the mind
                    generally. That such was the character of what is called the second Attic school
                    of sculpture is known principally from the records of artists. Of works directly
                    from the hand of any of the masters of this school there is no example in
                    existence, so far as we know at present. On the other hand, there are many
                    copies of their works, from which, with the aid of records, some idea may be
                    formed of their style.</p>
                <p>The first of the artists of this school λvas Scopas, a native of Parus, and, as
                    it would seem, the son and pupil of Aristandrus, a worker in bronze, in which
                    material the son appears to have commenced his career as a sculptor. An example
                    of his work in bronze was the statue of Aphrodite sitting on a goat, in Elis
                    (Pausanius, vi. 25, 2). This subject occurs on a fragmentary cameo in the
                    British Museum. Marble, however, was a material more congenial to his style. The
                    first years of his activity were spent in the Peloponnesus, and particularly at
                    Tegea in Arcadia, where the erection of a temple, in honour of Athene Aiea, in
                    the place of one that had been burned 395 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was
                    under his direction as regards both the architecture and the sculpture. About
                    380 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he settled in Athens, where for nearly thirty
                    years he maintained a reputation for an unparalleled power of rendering the
                    human or divine figure, not imposing, but attractive by the charm of bearing,
                    and the expression of that feeling which for the moment the person was most
                    sensitive to. Sometimes this feeling was one of excited passion accompanied by
                    great bodily agitation, as for example, in the case of his statue of a Maenad at
                    Athens, in the attitude of rushing with head thrown back and streaming hair, and
                    holding a slain kid in her hand. At other times the passion he sought to express
                    was one of peaceful inspiration, as in the statue of Apollo Citharoedus, with
                    long flowing robe and head thrown back as in a dreamy enjoyment of the strains
                    from his lyre. When considerably advanced in life, possibly over sixty years of
                    age, Scopas was invited by Artemisia, the queen of Caria, to assist or direct
                    the sculptures for a monument which she was erecting at Halicarnassus in memory
                    of her husband Mausolus. Accompanied by Bιyaxis, Leochares, and Timotheus (or
                    Praxiteles, as others said), he proceeded thither, but as to what part he had in
                    the work we have no information. The site of the Mausoleum was discovered and
                    excavated by Mr C. T. Newton in 1856-7, the result being the recovery of an
                    important part of the sculptures, which, with the slabs of the frieze previously
                    known, now constitutes the principal illustration of the art) of that time
                    (Newton, <hi rend="italic">Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Branchidae,</hi> 1862). While occupied on the Mausoleum, or after
                    its completion, Scopas executed several sculptures for other towns in Asia
                    Minor, as at Cnidus, Ephesus, and Chryse in the Troad. In a temple of Neptune,
                    erected in Rome by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was a large com-, position by
                    Scopas, representing Poseidon, Thetis, and Achilles, attended by nereids riding
                    on dolphins and hippocamps, and by tritons and other marvellous creatures of the
                    sea. Not as a copy of tlιis work, but as reflecting vividly the manner of this
                    scιrlptor, has been accepted the large marble relief in Munich (O. Jahn, <hi
                    rend="italic">Berichte der Sächs.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ges. d.</hi> JJ‰, 1854,
                    pls. 3-8), representing the marriage of Poseidon and Amphitrite. How far the
                    merit belongs to Scopas of having introduced into.Greek art the ideal types of
                    those marine beings who personified the element of the sea, is unknown. In a
                    temple of Apollo at Rome there was further a large composition, representing the
                    slaughter of the children of Niobe, about the authorship of which there were two
                    opinions,—the one ascribing it to Scopas, the other to Praxiteles. While this
                    dubiety is itself proof that the two artists were rivals in the power of
                    expressing pathos and suffering, there is a considerable probability that the
                    composition in question was more adapted, of the two, to the genius of Scopas.
                    Of this work there exists what is believed to be a more or less complete copy in
                    the series of marble statues in the gallery of the Uffizi at Florence. The work
                    is very uneven throughout, as might be expected in Roman copies; but the
                    dramatic character of the action, and the powerful rendering of pain and
                    suffering in the faces, still bespeak the style of the original sculptor, who,
                    whether Scopas, Praxiteles, or another, was certainly an Athenian artist of the
                    first half of the 4th century B.C. (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bausteine,</hi> i. pp. 230- 246). Another example of the style of this period,
                    in the combination of beauty with a lovable and touching expression of face, is
                    the so-called statue of Leucothea, in the Glyptotheke of Munich, which there are
                    grounds for assigning to Cephisodotus, the father, it would seem, of Praxiteles,
                    who is recorded to have made for Athens a statue of Irene with the boy Plutus in
                    her arms, which, as it appears on the coins of Athens, closely resembles the
                    Leucothea. This Cephisodotus, standing as he did in the period between the old
                    and the new Attic schools, seems to have shared the qualities of both, but to
                    have inclined rather to the latter.</p>
                <p>That Praxiteles was directly a pupil of Scopas is not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0382-0361"/> proved even by the fact that he worked in the
                    same artistic vein and spirit, with a result which rendered his style
                    undistinguishable from that of the older master to the eyes of Roman
                    connoisseurs. Still, it will be safe to assume that he was largely influenced in
                    his youth by the then favourite sculptures of Scopas. The scene of his labours
                    was mostly Athens and the neighbouring towns. That he accompanied Scopas to
                    Halicarnassus to assist with the sculptures of the Mausoleum, as is stated, is
                    probably true; but from the fact that elsewhere in place of his name occurs that
                    of Timotheus, it has been inferred that he may there have abandoned his original
                    intention, and confined himself to the execution of those statues for towns in
                    that district of which we have records. About 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    he returned to Athens, and there remained till his death, studying, with Phryne
                    as his model, the expression of sensual beauty in its highest type. Like Scopas,
                    he had little taste for bronze in comparison with marble, with its surface
                    finely sensitive to the most delicate modulation. Unsatisfied with even this, he
                    endeavoured to soften the asperity of the marble in the crude parts by a process
                    of encaustic, in which, or perhaps rather in the colouring of the draperies, he
                    employed in difficult cases the contemporary painter Nicias (Pliny, A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. 7∕.,xxxv. 39, 122). That he was peculiar in thus
                    tinting the marble, and an exception among other Greek sculptors, cannot be
                    meant, in the face of so many instances as we now have of the application of the
                    <hi rend="italic">circumlitio</hi> in the remains of Greek sculpture and
                    architecture (Semper, <hi rend="italic">Der Stil,</hi> i. pp. 498 and 514). The
                    fact, however, of his being mentioned in connection with it may be taken as a
                    proof that the process was an exceedingly refined one, since his favourite
                    subjects were those of youthful or feminine ideal beauty, in w hich it is to be
                    supposed that the tints corresponding to those in nature would appear almost
                    evanescent in their delicacy. Of his works, the number of which was unusually
                    large, the most celebrated were—(1.) The marble statue of Aphrodite at Cnidus,
                    of which the more or less modified copies, as the Venus of the Capitoline Museum
                    and the Venus de Medicis, together with the ancient records, show that the
                    goddess was represented standing nude at the moment when she has left her bath,
                    and, being sensitive to the air, presses her left leg against her right, and
                    looks towards the drapery which she has already laid hold of with her left hand.
                    Originally commissioned by Cos, but declined on account of its nudity, this
                    statue was replaced by another of Aphrodite, with which the marble statue in the
                    Louvre, found in Melus in 1820, has frequently been compared. But before
                    accepting it as an illustration of the type of Aphrodite by Praxiteles, or of
                    the more highly praised figure of the goddess by Scopas, it is necessary to bear
                    in mind that on a base found with it, which, though now lost, is vouched for on
                    creditable authority, was inscribed the name of the artist, Alexandrus, son of
                    Menides of Antioch, who must have lived after Alexander the Great (Friederichs,
                    <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. pp. 331-334). (2.) A statue of Aphrodite
                    at</p>
                <p>Thespiae; beside which was placed (3) a portrait statue of Phryne; and (4), a
                    statue of Eros, in Parian marble, of which there are two accounts,—either that
                    it was given by him to Phryne in token of his admiration, or that she contrived
                    to obtain it by a ruse, and then dedicated it at Thespke. The figure of Eros was
                    here not that of a boy, as in later art, but was taken from the period of youth
                    at which love is purely ideal, and the whole being is pervaded by an elevating
                    ardour. Apparently exhibiting the same refinement of youthful form was his
                    statue known as the " Celebrated Satyr,” in Athens. Of his Apollo Sauro-ctonus
                    several copies of inferior merit exist. His statue of Artemis Brauronia at
                    Athens had a mouth inviting to a kiss.</p>
                <p>The ablest of the contemporaries of Scopas and Praxiteles were Bryaxis,
                    Timotheus, and Leochares, of whom the last worked chiefly in bronze, and
                    travelled over a wide field of conceptions, including deities, portraits,
                    mythological and allegorical subjects. Another new type which belongs to this
                    period is that of Serapis by Bryaxis. From the time of Philip and Alexander the
                    Great, portrait statues furnished a large part of the occupation of sculptors,
                    and in this they were not confined to living models, as we gather, for example,
                    from the portraits of Sappho and Corinna by Apollodorus, a sculptor of this
                    time,—a fact from which it may be inferred that portraiture was still inclined
                    to idealism, though doubtless a strong tendency to realism had already set
                    in.</p>
                <p>The development of the art of sculpture in the Argive-Sicyonian school,
                    corresponding to that just described in the second Attic school, was begun by
                    the Corinthian Euphranor, whose principal study was directed with the view of
                    modifying the hitherto canonical proportions of Polycletus, to suit the changed
                    tastes with which he had probably become impregnated during his long stay in
                    Athens. To this end he introduced a smaller head and a slimness of the arms and
                    legs -which gave a greater lightness to the figure, and which, under the hand of
                    his follower Lysippus, became the favourite type of ideal athletic statues.
                    Lysippus, a native of Sicyon, and originally employed as an ordinary worker in
                    bronze, rose by dint of study to the position of a sculptor of the first order.
                    Nor was the quality of his work more surprising than the quantity. About 1500
                    statues and groups in bronze were counted as having been produced in his
                    workshop, and among them two at least of colossal size—the statue of Jupiter at
                    Tarentum, 60 feet high, and that of Hercules in the same place. The masterpieces
                    which he appears to have studied most were those of his townsman Polycletus.
                    Like Euphranor, however, he was compelled to seek a new system of
                    proportions,—to exchange the immovable dignity and repose by which the old
                    masters suggested the possession of physical power, for new attitudes, in which
                    the exercise of physical power should be made apparent by its effect on the body
                    and on the face. The colossal frame of Hercules was a favourite study with
                    Lysippus, for this reason especially, we presume, that of all the ancient heroes
                    he was represented in the legends as bearing about with him always the effect of
                    the arduousness of his labours. There was no gaiety or elasticity in his
                    composition. A figure of an athlete in the act of scraping the sweat and dust
                    from his body, Apoxyomenus, which enjoyed a high reputation in Rome, where it
                    stood before the baths of Μ. Agrippa, has an additional interest for us in the
                    fact that a marble copy of it still exists, which, though of inferior work,
                    forms an admirable illustration of the statements re-gardiιιg<pb break="no"

                    times in the production of allegorical figures may be gathered from the
                    description (see Overbeck, <hi rend="italic">Schriftquellen,</hi> Lysippus) of
                    his bronze statue of Cairus, a personification of what is vulgarly called the
                    “nick of time.” It remains to point out, with reference to the style of
                    Lysippus, that he confined himself mostly to the rendering of male forms, and
                    that in regard to the few female figures by him there is no mention of the charm
                    of sensual beauty which characterised the second Attic school; nor, again, do we
                    find that other characteristic of theirs, the expression of pathos, in the male
                    figures by him. His <hi rend="italic">animosa</hi><hi rend="italic">signa</hi>
                    must be taken as expressing physical life— <hi rend="italic">anima,</hi> not <hi

                <p>Among the remaining sculptures which belong to this period the most remarkable
                    are—(1.) The sculptures of the so-called Nereid monument discovered at Xanthus,
                    in Lycia, by Sir Charles Fellows, and now in the British Museum. These
                    sculptures consist of (a) a series of female figures in the round, about the
                    size of life, wearing a thin long drapery through which the forms are entirely
                    visible; (δ and c) a broad and a narrow frieze, both representing battle scenes.
                    While the design of the narrow frieze is singularly Assyrian in conception, that
                    of the broader frieze and the statues in the round is purely Greek, at Qne time
                    suggesting the style of the Parthenon sculptures, at another the refining and
                    movement of the second Attic school (Fellows, <hi rend="italic">An Accoujιt of
                    the Ionic Trophy Monument excavated at</hi><hi rend="italic">Xanthus,</hi>

                    1845). (2.) The reliefs on the monument of Lysicrates, a round building in
                    Athens, popularly known as the Lantern of Demosthenes. The victory which it was
                    erected to commemorate was gained in the year 334 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    The subject is Bacchus and his suite transforming the Tyrrhenian pirates into
                    dolphins. The figures are powerful, but light of foot and tall. The unusually
                    large spaces between the groups and figures is suggestive of the lonely
                    distances on the sea-shore, and in this respect the frieze seems to encroach on
                    the province of painting <hi rend="italic">{Marbles of the British Museum,</hi>
                    ix. pls. 22-26). (3.) A series of portrait sculptures, for which reference is
                    made to Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. pp. 290-308. The great
                    bronze head (fig. 10) placed here may, on further consideration, require to be
                    moved to an earlier period, though the many carelessnesses in details which it
                    exhibits seem at present to render such a step unadvisable.</p>
                <p>Besides sculptors, otherwise famous, who applied themselves to toreutic art,
                    there were others who made this their principal occupation. Of these we know
                    Mys, who executed the designs on the shield of the bronze Pallas of Phidias on
                    the Acropolis of Athens; and, more celebrated, Mejtor, who worked chiefly on
                    silver bowls and cups, for wh'ιch fabulous sums were afterwards paid by Roman
                    collectors. He must have lived before the time of Alexander the Great, since
                    some of his works perished in the burning of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> other caelatores apparently of this period were
                    Acragas and Boethus.</p>
                <p>A branch of art allied to the caelatura is that of die-sinking and gem-engraving.
                    Of the former the finest examples during this period are the silver coins of
                    Syracuse, especially the decadrachms with the head of Arethusa on the obverse
                    and a quadriga on the reverse. The presence of the engraver’s name on many of
                    these coins is testimony of the value attached to their work. From this source
                    we know the engravers Cimon and Euaenetus. Other names, such as Euclides,
                    Eumenus, Eumelus, Phrygillus, and Sosion, also occur on smaller silver coins.
                    With the exception of Athens, where the archaic type was preserved, there is a
                    general feeling for beauty throughout the Greek coinage of this period, the
                    specimens most deserving of study being those of Arcadia, of the Opuntian Locri,
                    of the Macedonian kings Philip and Alexander, of the Chalci-deans of Thrace, of
                    Cydonia in Crete, w here the name of the engraver Neuantus occurs, and of
                    Lesbus. In gemengraving during this period the fame of Pyrgoteles is <pb

                    his name it may be questioned whether one reflects adequately his style. It may
                    be taken as certain that some of them are from his hand. He was the court
                    engraver of Alexander the Great, whose portrait he made on an emerald. The
                    marble head here given (fig. 11) shows a distinctly realistic tendency, compared
                    with the head on the coins. Possibly the portrait of Alexander which appears on
                    the coins of his successor Lysimachus was in some way drawn from the gem (Brunn,
                    <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">each. d. Griech.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Künstle)’,</hi> ii. p. G29). Among the few examples of gems that can be
                    unhesitatingly assigned to this period is the chalcedony with the figure of a
                    crane found in Kertch, and now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg, bearing the
                    signature of Dexamenus of Chius, ΔEΞAMEN02 EΠOIE XIO2 <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In painting, the transition from the style of Polygnotus to that of the new
                    school was again, as has been said, a transition from ethos to pathos, from
                    character and noble bearing to beauty and effect. The change, as elsewhere, was
                    in harmony with the spirit of the times; but of the steps by which it was
                    brought about two deserve attention; the first is the exigencies of
                    scene-painting, on which Sophocles, and, after his example, his older
                    contemporary Aeschylus, laid great value. In this direction the artist of the
                    day was Agatharchus of Samus, who also wrote an account of the decorations
                    executed by him, and by this led to the investigation of the principles of
                    perspective in painting by Democritus and Anaxagoras. The second step was the
                    gradation of light and shade and of colours introduced by Apollodorus, who for
                    this service is regarded as the founder of the new school. At the door opened by
                    Apollodorus entered Zeuxis, as he himself is reported to have said, into the
                    sanctuary of art. Not that Zeuxis was directly a pupil of the older master. All
                    that is known of their relations to each other consists of mutual compliments.
                    That the charm of Zeuxis’s popularity was in great part due to novelty of
                    situation and effect might be inferred from the statement regarding his picture
                    of a centauress suckling her young, the spectators of which forgot the painter
                    in the subject. On the other hand, the story of his having constantly before his
                    eyes five of the most beautiful maidens of the town of Croton while he was
                    painting his figure of Helena, suggests that he must have been a close student
                    of form and perhaps also of colour. His figures were of a large mould, as in the
                    earlier school, and for this reason his heads and limbs appeared a little coarse
                    to Roman connoisseurs accustomed to the elegance of a later time. In this
                    direction a great step in advance . was made by his contemporary Parrhasius of
                    Ephesus, who like Zeuxis also lived some time in Athens, enjoying the society of
                    Socrates, and vaunting his personal appearance as well as his artistic powers.
                    The dominant faculty of drawing in Parrhasius led him to choose his subjects
                    from male heroic figures, and led him also, it will be charitable and not
                    without analogy to conjecture, to produce the immoral scenes with which his name
                    is connected. From excellence in drawing and colouring the next step was towards
                    a just conception of the subject on hand, and this step was taken by Timanthes,
                    of the island of Cythnus. One of his great pictures was the tragic scene of the
                    sacrifice of Iphigenia, in which the expression of sorrow was rendered with a
                    masterly gradation, from the bystanders (Calchas, Ulysses, Ajax, and Menelaus)
                    up to Agamemnon, in whom the deep grief of a father was expressed by his
                    covering his face and turning it away from the spectator. This subject, with
                    various modifications, and particularly with the absence of the gradation of
                    grief among the bystanders, but still obviously preserving the profound pathos
                    of a great original, occurs in Pompeian paintings, and on a Greek relief in the
                    gallery of Florence (0. Jahn, <hi rend="italic">Archäol. Beiträge,</hi> p. 378).
                    Whether or not a resident at Ephesus, the centre of Asiatic painting, it is
                    clear that Timanthes stood in close relation to the school there. Contemporary
                    with the Asiatic school existed in Greece proper two schools of painting, of
                    which the one, with its seat in Sicyon, seems to have studied most drawing and a
                    system of form and proportions; while the other, centred at Athens, but
                    including some Theban painters, looked rather to the expression of pathos and
                    the emotions of the mind. The founder of the Sicyonian school was Eupompus (401-
                    381 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) It was, however, to his pupil Pamphilus that
                    it owed most of its reputation, and became a school for practical instruction
                    which attracted students from remote quarters. From his distinction in
                    mathematics and geometry, and from the fact of his having introduced drawing as
                    a general element of instruction for youth, it is inferred that his teaching was
                    mainly directed to the reproduction of form. On the other hand, it is also known
                    that his researches led to an improvement in the colours employed in encaustic
                    painting, and further that this art was carried to its highest perfection by his
                    pupil Pausias. In a middle position between the Sicyonian and Attic schools
                    stood Eιiphranor the Corinthian, of whom as a sculptor mention has already been
                    made. His subjecte were of the higher grade of historical painting, being mostly
                    large compositions of mythological scenes or historical events, of which an
                    example was to be seen on the portico of Zeus Eleutherius in the Agora of
                    Athens. In Thebes, where since the recovery of freedom from the Lacedaemonians a
                    new impulse for art as well as politics had been felt, a school of painting was
                    formed, apparently at first under the influence of that of Sicyon. At its head
                    was Nicomachus, a son and pupil of Aristiaeus. A greater fame was achieved by
                    his son Aristides, as an example of whose work, Pliny (A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >7I.,</hi> xxxv. 36, 98) quotes a picture from the capture of a town in which a
                    mother appeared mortally wounded, and with a harrowing expression of dread
                    on.her face lest the child clinging to her breast should suck blood instead of

                    subjects; but he worked by preference in the encaustic process, the credit of
                    inventing which has been wrongly ascribed to him. Among the other painters of
                    note who followed the manner of the second Attic school of sculpture there
                    remains only Nicias, a son of Nicomedes of Athens, and a pupil of Antidotus,
                    from whom he learned the extreme care of execution originally taught by
                    Euphranor.</p>
                <p>In the person of Apelles, the son of Pytheas, a native of Colophon, were
                    combined, if we may judge from his reputation, all the best qualities of the
                    hitherto existing schools of painting. It should, however, be remembered that
                    what we know of him comes entirely from Roman and late Greek sources, and
                    represents rather the taste of these times than a critical judgment on his
                    works. He was a pupil of the otherwise unknown painter Ephorus of Ephesus, which
                    town, already celebrated as a centre of painting, he adopted as his home. But so
                    high was then the reputation of the Sicyonian school, headed by Pamphilus and
                    Melanthius, that on completing his studies at Ephesus he repaired to Sicyon,
                    either to see for himself or to profit by the fame of these masters. From Sicyon
                    ho proceeded, perhaps through the influence of Melanthius, to the court of
                    Macedonia, where he was employed, first by Philip, and afterwards, under
                    circumstances of the greatest intimacy, by Alexander, whom he accompanied as far
                    as Ephesus on his expedition into Asia. Of the figures of deities painted by him
                    the most renowned was that of Aphrodite Anadyomene, originally in the temple of
                    Aescu-lapius in Cos, represented rising out of the sea, and wring·- <pb

                    her eyes. A second figure of the goddess, also intended for Cos, remained
                    unfinished at his death. Of personifications and allegorical figures or groups,
                    such as delighted the age in which he lived, we have examples—of the former in
                    his group of Bronte, Astrape, and Ceraunobolia; and of the latter in his famous
                    picture of Calumny. Partly of this character also were his two pictures of
                    Alexander grouped with Castor, Pollux, and Victory; and Alexander in a triumphal
                    car, beside a personification of war, in the form of a captive with hands bound
                    behind back and seated on armour. The execution of subjects of this nature, for
                    which thought and reflection are mainly required as opposed to the poetic and
                    spontaneously creative faculty of a true artist, has been urged as detracting
                    from the greatness of Apelles, and to this extent, no doubt, he was subject to
                    the weakness of his times. Like Correggio, with whom he has been compared, he
                    Hved at a time when the great creative spirit had passed away, and it remained
                    for him, as for the Italian master, to discover the last resources of his art
                    for the attainment of powerful effect and absolute finish simultaneously. To
                    refine the harmony of his light and tones, as well as to protect his paintings
                    from dirt, he employed a peculiar black glaze λvhich broke the sharp contrasts
                    of colours (Pliny, A". <hi rend="italic">II.,</hi> xxxv. 97) required for such
                    powerful effects as the appearance of Zeus hurling lightning. With regard to his
                    colours little is known. The statement that he used only four (Pliny, <hi
                    rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">II.,</hi> xxxv. 50, 92) may or may not be
                    correct (Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Brut.,</hi> 18). Of his mere skill we have an
                    example in the figure of Hercules, afterwards in Rome, of which it was said that
                    the face, though turned away from the spectator, was suggested almost as vividly
                    as if it had been actually painted (Wustmann, <hi rend="italic">Apelles'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leben und Werke,</hi> 1870). In technical skill Apelles confessed
                    himself equalled by his contemporary Protogenes the Rhodian, claiming, however,
                    as his own special superiority, that he knew when to stop. The fault of
                    Protogenes was over-elaboration. On one painting he is said to have worked seven
                    or eleven years, finishing it with four separate glazes to protect it from
                    injury. Of the painters of this period there are still to be mentioned
                    Antiphilus, a native of Egypt, and a pupil of Ctesidemus; Theon of Samus, who
                    was praised for his happy choice of the right moment at which to seize an
                    action; and Aetion.</p>
                <p>Though the works of the masters of this period have wholly perished, there remain
                    two sources from which some idea may be gathered of their manner,—first, a
                    number of Pompeian paintings, which, though executed in a later age, and often
                    intentionally varied from the originals, are still copies of the spirit and
                    manner of the works of this time; and secondly, a large series of painted vases,
                    which, though the production of inferior workmen, display a wonderful facility
                    of execution, a splendour of glaze, and an application of colours which show
                    that the example of the great painters had not been neglected. The figures stand
                    out in red from the black ground of the vase; for the accessories, red, yellow,
                    violet, black, blue, green, and gilding are employed. It is not, however, alone
                    from their possession of certain traits which are assumed to have characterised
                    the style of painting in this period that these vases are assigned to it. There
                    exists a small but increasing series of painted vases which had been gained at
                    the Panathenaic games at Athens, on several of which is inscribed the name of
                    the archon for the year in which they were obtained. We have thus the exact
                    years in which these vases were made, and at the same time specimens of the art
                    of the time, from which a comparison is easily made with the larger series of
                    undated vases (see Catalogue of the Vases of the British Museum).</p>
                <p>[CLASSICAL—FOURTH</p>
                <p>With the close of the Periclean period in Athens the Aιchitec-public desire for
                    more temples seems to have ceased; soture. that the architecture of the period
                    now before us is to be traced rather in works of utility, whether public or
                    private. Of the former class are—(1), the stadium at Agrae for the athletic
                    competitions at the Panathenaic festival; (2), the gymnasium; (3), the
                    store-house at the Piraeus, built to contain the equipments of 1000 ships. From
                    private sources were (4), the temple of the Muses, said to have been erected by
                    Plato, in the Academy; and (5), the choragic monument of Lysicrates, which is
                    the only existing example of Athenian architecture of this time (Stuart, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of Athens,</hi> i. pls. 23-30). A greater
                    architectural activity prevailed in the Peloponnesus. At Tegea was erected,
                    under the direction of Scopas, a temple which scarcely yielded in splendour to
                    that of Zeus at Olympia. The laying out and building of new towns which followed
                    upon the recovery of freedom by Thebes under Epaminondas, gave abundant scope
                    for architects. A remarkable example of this was Megalopolis in Arcadia, which
                    was built in an elliptical form, on the principle laid down by Hippodamus of
                    Miletus, and carried out in the Piraeus, Thurium, and Rhodes. A more magnificent
                    example of a new town erected in this period was Alexandria, founded by
                    Alexander to be the first city of the world of which he was master, and built in
                    that spirit by his favourite architect Dinocrates. The model of Alexandria was
                    adopted by the successors of Alexander for the many new towns raised by them,
                    as, for example, Antioch on the Orontes, the architect of which was Xenaeus. The
                    temples of Asia Minor erected in the time of Alexander may be judged from the
                    ruins of those of Athene Polias at Priene, of Artemis at Magnesia on the
                    Maeander, and of Artemis at Ephesus, of which last the site has lately been
                    excavated, with the result of confirming the few existing statements regarding
                    its dimensions and style. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and the Nereid
                    monument of Xanthus, are instances of temple architecture modified for the
                    purposes of a tomb.</p>

                <p>The conquests of Alexander had opened to the Greek gaze the East, gorgeous in its
                    personal attire and equipments, and unlimited in its resources for the
                    encouragement of personal vanity. Alexander appeared in Asiatic costume, and
                    what became the monarch was shortly found becoming to the subject. Under his
                    successors, in what is called the Macedonian, or, better, the Hellenistic
                    period, the opulence and taste for luxury of the times led artists to aim at
                    producing works conspicuous for picturesqueness; not, however, that
                    picturesqueness which is born of a fine fancy, but that which originates in a
                    studied effort to throw a gleam of romance over a plain historical incident. The
                    creation of ideal types of deities ceased, and the production of allegorical
                    figures, which had found acceptance in the preceding age, took its place. These
                    figures were simply studies of character, and implied a faculty of observation
                    which the existing portraits of this period on coins and in marble warrant us in
                    estimating highly. To this, no doubt, was added a power of generalisation which
                    enabled the artist to deduce a type from a number of individuals, as, for
                    example, in the type of Gauls introduced by the school of Pergamus. In figures
                    of deities or heroes the old types were retained. It was in portraiture that the
                    essential characteristic of the time consisted. With art in this condition
                    Graecia Capta enthralled her Roman captors, and the further development of this
                    phase of art was transferred to Rome. For this reason we shall here follow the
                    unusual plan of classing the Hellenistic and Roman art under one period.</p>

                    great masters of each,—the Athenian school by the sons of Praxiteles,</p>
                <p>Cephisodotus and Timarchus, who worked together. The former appears to have been
                    the more gifted of the two, if we may judge from the pains bestowed on certain
                    statues of deities by him alone. Of their contemporaries little is known beyond
                    that their chief occupation was in portrait sculpture. The traditions of the
                    Sicyonian school were left in the hands of the sons and pupils of Lysippus, of
                    whom the ablest was Euthycrates, who preserved the severity of the older schools
                    in opposition to the tastes of his times. The effect of this upon his pupil
                    Tisicrates led to so close a reproduction of the manner of Lysippus, that in
                    many cases it was difficult to distinguish his work from that of the old master.
                    In the same spirit, and with greater success, worked Eutychides of Sicyon, and
                    Chares of Lindus in Rhodes. From the hands of Eutychides we know of a bronze
                    statue of the river Eurotas, in which the mobility of water was finely suggested
                    in the human form (Pliny, A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.,</hi> xxxiv. 8, 78), and a highly-praised statue of Tyche (Pausanias, vi. 2,
                    7) for the town of Antioch, of which several copies exist, including a small one
                    in silver in the British Museum. Chares Î3 known mainly as the author of the
                    bronze Colossus of Helius at Rhodes, a statue 105 feet high, which after
                    standing a marvel to all for fifty-six or sixty-six years, was broken across the
                    knees and thrown to the ground by an earthquake. The rising importance of Rhodes
                    encouraged the foundation of a school of sculpture which adopted the manner of
                    Chares, and aimed at effect by colossal proportions and picturesque situations.
                    To this school belonged Apollonius and Tau-riscus, the authors of a colossal
                    marble group which has been identified with that in the museum of Naples, known
                    as the “Farnese Bull,” and representing Amphion and Zethus in the act of binding
                    Dirce to the horns of a bull in presence of their mother Antiope, and, whether
                    copy or original, an admirable illustration of the Rhodian school. The moment
                    seized by the artists is one of profound pathos; but, justly deserved as the
                    punishment of Dirce may have been, it is impossible to look upon it without
                    pain. The same feeling, it may be imagined, was awakened in the spectator by the
                    bronze group of Athamas seized with insanity after slaying his son Learchus, by
                    Aristonidas, another artist of the Rhodian school. From the instances of
                    subjects in which cruelty and deep emotion'were combined, it has been argued
                    that the group of Laocoön, which was the work of three Rhodian
                    artists—Agesander, Athenodorus, and Polydorus—may properly be assigned to the
                    Rhodian school of this period. On the other hand, it is argued by critics of
                    seemingly equal competence, that the subject of the Laocoön is too harrowing for
                    the Greek taste even then, and must have been executed under the influence of
                    the favourite cruelties practised in the Roman circus. The decision between
                    these two opinions is left entirely to taste, owing to the ambiguity of the
                    words of Pliny. From Rhodes we pass to Pergamus, where, under the courtly
                    influence of Attalus I. (241-197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) and Eumenes II.
                    (197-159 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> was formed a school of sculp ture
                    which derived a vigorous impulse as of a new life from the strange class of
                    subjects it was called upon to undertake. It was called upon to glorify the
                    decisive victory of Attalus over the Gauls (239 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    by groups and large compositions of battle scenes, in which the first difficulty
                    was to produce the type of these barbarians, and to carry it out consistently in
                    the various attitudes and incidents of a battle; as, for example, in their
                    dogged submission under captivity, or their grim expression under pain; or,
                    again, the abject misery of their wives when a battle had been lost. Nor was
                    Attalus content to adorn his own capital with artistic productions. To Athens he
                    made a present of four groups representing battles between gods and giants,
                    between Athenians and Amazons, between the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, and
                    between his own army and the Gauls in Mysia, showing in each case the defeat of
                    a barbarous race. The height of the figures was 31 feet, and that there must
                    have been a considerable number of them is clear from this, that the occurrence
                    of Bacchus in the group of the Gigantomachia presupposes the existence of the
                    other superior deities. Of the entire series nine figures have been identified
                    in various museums (Engraved, <hi rend="italic">Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Gaul in the Capitoline Museum, known as the “Dying Gladiator,” and the group of
                    a Gaul and his wife in the Villa Ludovisi (Müller, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Denkmäler,</hi> i. pl. 48, No. 218).</p>
                <p>After the loss of national independence little remained for the Greeks to do but
                    to profit by the liberal patronage of their Roman masters, whose cupidity in
                    matters of art was by no means satisfied with carrying off as many as possible
                    of the existing sculptures. The increased demand led to a new energy, of which
                    Athens was at first naturally the centre, whence the term “-New Attic” is
                    applied to the sculpture of this period. As, however, this new energy was
                    chiefly directed to the reproduction of the favourite types of the old masters,
                    the result was not, as under other circumstances it might have been, the
                    formation of a new school properly so called. At this time the principal
                    sculptors were Polycles of Athens, his son Timarchides, his grandson Dionysius,
                    and another Dionysius, all of whom, after earning a reputation by their work in
                    various parts of Greece, appear to have followed Metellus to Rome, which now
                    became the artistic centre of the world. Towards the end of the republic there
                    lived in Rome a sculptor, Pasiteles, who, if not superior to the artists of the
                    new Attic'period in point of creative power, was certainly more gifted than they
                    with skill and carefulness in the execution of his work, which ranged over
                    statuaria, sculptura, and <pb break="no"

                    for which a taste had revived. As, however, none of his works exist now, we can
                    only judge of his manner by that of his pupil Stephanus, from whose hands we
                    have the statue of Orestes in the Villa Albani <hi rend="italic">(Annali</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dell’</hi><hi rend="italic">Inst.</hi> 1865, pl. D; Friederichs,
                    <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 112). It is called Orestes from its
                    resemblance to the male figure in the group of Orestes and Electra in Naples,
                    with which, as an imitation of the archaic style, it may be compared. In both,
                    however, it has been observed that the archaism is limited to the proportions,
                    attitude, and general aspect, but that the details of anatomy have been worked
                    in from the living model. This, which constituted the peculiarity of Stephanus,
                    is assumed to have characterised the school of Pasiteles, first, because
                    Stephanus, in an unusual manner, describes himself on the base of the statue as
                    a pupil of Pasiteles; and secondly, because the same peculiarity to some extent
                    is found in the group of Orestes and Electra in the Villa Ludovisi by the
                    sculptor Menelaus, who again describes himself as a pupil of Stephanus
                    (Friederichs, <hi rend="italic">Bausteine,</hi> i. p. 427). Doubtless this
                    affectation of archaism was to meet the taste of the time, for which also
                    archaic works were collected from Greece. By the extreme elaboration of his
                    work, Arcesilaus, who lived in Rome in Caesar’s time, obtained considerable
                    fame, but', on the other hand, limited greatly his productivity. Of his two
                    principal statues, the Venus Genetrix and the Felicitas, the latter was never
                    finished. Copies of both exist, but they are of too mean a kind to suggest a
                    proper estimate of the sculptor’s merit. While in ideal sculpture the artists of
                    this time were content to copy, with trifling varieties of detail, the works of
                    the old masters, they appear to have disclosed considerable original talent in
                    realistic sculpture, that is, in portraiture and in the historical
                    representations with which triumphal arches and other like buildings were
                    decorated, though here again they had models ready to hand in portraits, battle
                    scenes, and triumphs of the Hellenistic period. A sculptor who had to celebrate
                    a Roman victory over barbarians had his model in works of the same class by the
                    school of Pergamus. When he introduced an ideal figure, as that of Victory
                    writing on a shield, he adopted an old type. In the grouping of his figures
                    there is this peculiarity, that they are frequently arranged on the principles
                    of painting rather than of sculpture, and it is supposed that this originated in
                    the earlier Roman custom of celebrating victories by paintings hung up in public
                    places, which paintings appear to have been based on those of the Alexandrian
                    period, and, at any rate, were sometimes executed by Greek artists. (For a
                    thorough investigation of this subject see Helbig, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campanische</hi><hi rend="italic">Wandmalerei,</hi> Leipzig, 1873.)</p>
                <p>When public encouragement of art takes the form of a desire for reproduction from
                    ancient masterpieces, it is natural that such minor arts as those of caelatura
                    and gemengraving should flourish. The production of silver vases adorned with
                    subjects in relief had become a profitable occupation in the wealthy times of
                    Hellenism. It was not, however, till the latter half of this period that truly
                    fabulous sums came to be paid for work of this kind, in which Pasiteles and
                    Arcesilaus, already mentioned as sculptors, achieved great success. Besides them
                    we hear of Posidonius of Ephesus, Zopyrus, Pytheas, and Teucrus. Among the many
                    existing examples of silver work of this period, one—a vase found in 1761 at the
                    Porto d’Anzo, and belonging to the Corsini family—has been identified as a copy
                    of the silver vase by Zopyrus representing the acquittal of Orestes before the
                    Areopagus. The immense number of existing statuettes, vases, utensils of various
                    kinds <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> in bronze and silver, dating from this
                    period, are evidence of its artistic activity, and at the same time of the
                    closeness with which Greek models wero adhered to.</p>
                <p>Under the influence of the luxurious tastes in the times of the Ptolemies,
                    gem-engravers aimed mostly at effect, and to this end sought out specimens of
                    onyx and sardonyx which from their own splendour would lend a charm to the work.
                    A gem was now a thing to be worn flauntingly.. Hence the chief examples of the
                    art are the cameos, of which from the latter half of this period we have still
                    some magnificent examples. Of these, the most important, artistically, is the
                    large cameo, now in Vienna, representing, in a partly allegorical and partly
                    literal fashion, the suppression of the Pannonian revolt by Tiberius and
                    Germanicus (Müller, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi> i. pl. 69, No. 377).
                    Larger and richer in figures, but much inferior in work, is the cameo in ∙the
                    cabinet of medals in Paris (Müller, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi> No. 378).
                    Besides producing cameos for personal ornament, the gem-engravers of this period
                    were also employed on the production of drinking-cups of onyx and other precious
                    stones, of which the tazza Farnese in Naples is the best existing example <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Borb.,</hi> xii. pl. 47). When stones
                    were too costly, glass was used, as in the famous Portland vase in the British
                    Museum, and in numerous cameos. Compared with the cameo-engravers, who, as if
                    conscious of the inferiority of their work, withheld their names from it, the
                    engravers of intaglios very frequently asserted their merit by adding their
                    names. Among the names thus handed down are those of Dioscu-rides, his son
                    Eutyches, Athenion, Protarchus, Solon, Euodus, and others of lesser note.</p>
                <p>In the history of painting during this period few names of importance occur. In
                    the earlier part of it the traditions of the school of Sicyon were maintained by
                    Nealces, from whose hands we know of a picture of Venus, and of a naval
                    engagement between Persians and Egyptians on a river which was localised as the
                    Nile, by the presence of a crocodile and an ass drinking at the edge; and
                    Timanthus, who painted a battle between the troops of Aratus and the Aetolians.
                    In the Athenian school, Athenion, though dying young, produced some works which
                    were favourably compared with those of the older master, Nicias. About this time
                    the production of painted vases, driven out of fashion by vases in silver and
                    other metals, so far ceased to attract skilled workmen, that it can hardly be
                    fair to regard the large number of so-called Apulian vases belonging to this
                    period as evidence of the contemporary style of painting. The ornament and the
                    colours are always florid, the figures are drawn mechanically as from a set
                    design, and thu dimensions are very frequently large. According to the theory
                    advanced by Brunn <hi rend="italic">(Probleme</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Gesch.</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Vasenmalerei),</hi> almost the whole of the vases found in Italy with black
                    figures on red ground, which previously were considered archaic, were produced
                    about this time, and are but feeble imitations of the early style made to please
                    the Roman taste for archaic work. As to the general feebleness that prevails
                    among them there can be little question. It remains to be seen, however, whether
                    Brunn has' not placed them at too late a period.</p>
                <p>With the scanty records of painters, and the depreciatory remarks in regard to
                    the art of their time made by Pliny and Petronius, we have to compare the
                    immense series of paintings from this period still existing in Italy, and
                    particularly those of Pompeii and Herculaneum, an examination of which will show
                    that the painters then, like the contemporary sculptors, drew their inspiration,
                    and apparently to a tolerably close extent their models, from more ancient
                    works. Had they been gifted with original genius, they could not have excluded,
                    when painting landscapes, the views of the immediate neighbourhood; and yet on
                    all the walls of Pompeii or Herculaneum there is perhaps not <pb break="no"

                    identified as local. Nor would they have avoided so systematically as they have
                    done subjects from the national Roman legends, which were then in high favour,
                    and attracted poets like Virgil and Ovid. But while a complete dearth of
                    imaginative power may be denied them, these painters w ere possessed of a fine
                    eye for pictorial effect, and of a refined taste in the management of their
                    colours (Helbig, <hi rend="italic">Wandgemälde</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Closely allied to painting is the art of mosaic-working, which, though
                    occasionally employed for the pavements of the earlier temples, as in the
                    pronaos of the temple at Olympia <hi rend="italic">{Expédition de la Morée,</hi>
                    i. pl. 63), did not till after the time of Alexander assume an importance which
                    entitled it to be ranked as an independent art. The first mosaic artist of
                    consequence whom we hear of is Sosus of Pergamus, celebrated as having
                    introduced the practice of decorating floors of houses with imitations of
                    characteristic objects, such, for example, as the accompaniments of a feast in a
                    dining-room. From Pergamus, Ephesus, Alexandria, and the chief towns of the
                    Macedonian period, the art was afterwards transferred to Rome, where the
                    numerous villas and palaces furnished it with abundant occupation. As an example
                    of the work of this later time we have the large mosaic found on the Aventine in
                    1833, and now in the Lateran, which bears the name of Heraclitus as its author,
                    and which, with its representations of all manner of remains from a feast, is an
                    illustration of the class of subjects introduced by Sosus. We still possess a
                    splendid example of their rendering of historical subjects in the mosaic found
                    in 1831 in the Casa del Fauno at Pompeii, representing a battle between
                    Alexander and the Persians (Müller, <hi rend="italic">Denkmäler,</hi> i. pl. 55,
                    No. 273).</p>
                <p>What was said of the progress of architecture at the close of last period should
                    be here borne in mind, as it continues to apply to the first half of the period
                    now before us. While the building of Alexandria supplied a model and an impulse,
                    which the successors of Alexander availed themselves of, in the construction of
                    new towns, the example of boundless luxury, in the decoration of even temporary
                    monuments, which was set by Alexander in the erection of a funeral pyre for
                    Hephaestion in Babylon, was also eagerly followed by his successors. From the
                    work of Callixenus on Alexandria we have (Athenaeus, v. p. 196) a description of
                    the tent erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus for a Dionysiae festival, and of the
                    splendid colossal barge of Ptolemy Philopator on the Nile <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.</hi> p. 204, d). Still more magnificent and stupendous in its dimensions
                    was the ship of Hiero of Syracuse, with its granaries, dwelling-houses, towers,
                    gymnasium, and park, for the construction of which Archimedes and the Corinthian
                    Archias were employed. Greece proper, however, shared little in this
                    prodigality. Thebes was, indeed, restored after its destruction by Alexander;
                    and Athens, still the eye of Greece, obtained many marks of favour from the
                    princes of the time, w ho sought to identify their names with her glory by
                    erecting public monuments of various kinds.</p>
                <p>The presence of countless specimens of Greek art in Rome, carried off by
                    plunderers like L. Mummius, produced a general craving for Greek architecture
                    also. The first step in this direction was taken by Q. Caecilius Metellus, who
                    brought a Greek architect, Hermodorus of Salamis, to Rome to build a temple to
                    Jupiter Stator in the pure Greek style. The public favour w ith which this was
                    riewed may be gathered from the fact, that shortly after we find D. Junius
                    Brutus employing Hermodorus to build a temple to Mars. Of the Roman architects
                    who during the republic adopted the Greek style, the most distinguished were
                    Cossutius and C. Mutius. The Greek had either supplemented or become blended
                    with the native Roman architecture when the extraordinary activity in building,
                    of w hich Pompey and Caesar were the leaders, set in, not only in Rome, but
                    throughout the provinces of the empire. The building of temples and monuments,
                    which under Augustus had been the chief occupation of architects, gave way under
                    his immediate successors to constructions of a more useful and sometimes of a
                    colossal type, such as bridges, canals, aqueducts, and harbours. The enlargement
                    of the imperial palaces on the Palatine, particularly the construction of the
                    golden house of Nero, gave scope to the boldness of design and extravagance of
                    execution possessed by the architects Celer and Severus. In the following times
                    those of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian were characterised by a series of
                    buildings which had not their equal in the architectural history of Rome, as,
                    for example, the Colisseum, a building erected to contain 87,000 spectators, and
                    still in its ruins the most striking monument of imperial Rome. While the chief
                    interest of Trajan was in the construction of roads, bridges, and harbours, his
                    successor, Hadrian, was not only himself ambitious as an architect, but gave a
                    new impetus to the erection of splendid buildings throughout the empire. From
                    this time onward Roman architecture began to sink rapidly, its original tendency
                    to florid decoration obtaining more and more free rein, till finally
                    discrimination was abandoned. The ruins of Palmyra and Baalbec (R. Wood, London,
                    1827), the arch of Severus, the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, and the arch
                    of Constantine, are evidence of this.</p>
