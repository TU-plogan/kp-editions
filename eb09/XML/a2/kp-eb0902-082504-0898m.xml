                    law considered him illegitimate. He obtained, however, the kingdom of Quito,
                    whether by stratagem or not is uncertain. A jealous feeling soon sprang up
                    between him and Huascar, who insisted that Quito should be held as a dependent
                    province <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n899/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0899-0826"/> of his empire. A civil war broke out between the
                    brothers, and, though the details of it are not accurately known, it appears
                    that just about the time when Pizarro was beginning to move inland from the town
                    of San Miguel, Huascar had been defeated and thrown into prison, and Atahuallpa
                    had become Inca. Pizarro set out in September 1532, and made for Cassamarca,
                    where the Inca was. Messengers passed frequently between them, and the Spaniards
                    on their march were hospitably received by the inhabitants. On the 15th
                    November, Pizarro entered Cassamarca, and sent his brother and Fernando de Soto
                    to request an interview with the Inca. On the evening of the next day,
                    Atahuallpa entered the great square of Cassamarca, accompanied by some five or
                    six thousand men, who were either unarmed, or armed only with short clubs and
                    slings concealed under their dresses. Pizarro’s artillery and soldiers were
                    planted in readiness in the streets opening off the square. The interview was
                    carried on by the priest Vicente de Valverde, who addressed the Inca through an
                    interpreter. He stated briefly and dogmatically the principal points of the
                    Christian faith and the Roman Catholic policy, and concluded by calling upon
                    Atahuallpa to become a Christian, obey the commands of the Pope, give up the
                    administration of his kingdom, and pay tribute to Charles V., to whom had been
                    granted the conquest of these lands. To this extraordinary harangue, which from
                    its own nature and the faults of the interpreter must have been completely
                    unintelligible, the Inca at first returned a very temperate answer. He pointed
                    out what seemed to him certain difficulties in the Christian religion, and
                    declined to accept as monarch of his dominions this Charles, of whom he knew
                    nothing. He then took a Bible from thé priest’s hands, and, after looking at it,
                    threw it violently from him, and began a more impassioned speech, in which he
                    exposed the designs of the Spaniards, and upbraided them with the cruelties they
                    had perpetrated. The priest retired, and Pizarro at once gave the signal for
                    attack. The Spaniards rushed out suddenly, and the Peruvians, astonished and
                    defenceless, were cut down in hundreds. Pizarro himself seized the Inca, and in
                    endeavouring to preserve him alive, received, accidentally, on his hand the only
                    wound inflicted that day on a Spaniard. Atahuallpa, thus treacherously captured,
                    offered an enormous sum of money as a ransom, and fulfilled his engagement; but
                    Pizarro still detained him, until the Spaniards should have arrived in
                    sufficient numbers to secure the country. While in captivity, Atahuallpa gave
                    secret orders for the assassination of his brother Huascar, and also endeavoured
                    to raise an army to expel the invaders. His plans were betrayed, and Pizarro at
                    once brought him to trial. He was condemned to death, and, as being an idolater,
                    to death by fire. Atahuallpa, however, professed himself a Christian, received
                    baptism, and his sentence was then altered into death by strangulation. His body
                    was afterwards burned, and the ashes conveyed to Quito. From the reports of the
                    Spanish historians, it is impossible to gain an accurate idea of the character
                    and abilities of the Peruvian monarch, and we have no other notices by which to
                    test their account. (See Prescott’s <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Peru,</hi> and
