                    Having filled with more than usual success the offices of quaestor and praetor,
                    he obtained the consulship in 120 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi> was next
                    chosen one of the four consulars for Italy; greatly increased his reputation by
                    his conduct as proconsul of Asia; acquired much influence with the emperor
                    Hadrian, by whom he was at length adopted as his son and successor in February
                    138 A.D.; and a few months afterwards, on Hadrian's death, was enthusiastically
                    welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once, were not disappointed
                    in their anticipation of a happy reign. For Antoninus came to his new office
                    with simple tastes, kindly disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained
                    intelligence, and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead
                    of plundering the provinces to support his prodigality, he emptied his private
                    treasury to assist the provinces. Instead of exaggerating into treason whatever
                    was susceptible of unfavourable interpretation, he turned the very conspiracies
                    that were formed against him into opportunities of signalising his clemency.
                    Instead of stirring up the persecution of the Christians, and gloating over the
                    sufferings of their martyrs, he extended to them the strong hand of his
                    protection through all the empire. Rather than give occasion to that oppression
                    which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor’s progress through his
                    dominions, he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its
                    neighbourhood. Under his patronage the science of jurisprudence was cultivated
                    by men of high ability, and a number of enactments were passed in his name that
                    are equally characteristic of his humanity and his justice. Of the public
                    transactions of this period we have but scant information, but, to judge by what
                    we possess, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful. No conquests of
                    importance were attempted, and there were no very dangerous attacks to repel,
                    though all round the frontiers a kind of simmering hostility produced a
                    succession of minor invasions and revolts. The one military result which is of
                    interest to us now is the building of the wall of Antoninus from the Forth to
                    the Clyde. In his domestic relations Antoninus was not so fortunate. His wife,
                    Faustina, has almost become a by-word for her lack of womanly virtue; though,
                    either through his ignorance of her conduct, or in spite of his being aware of
                    it, she seems to have kept her hold on his affections to the last. On her death
                    he did honour to her memory in many ways; but in none more remarkable than by
                    the foundation of a charity for orphan girls, who bore the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Alimentariae</hi><hi rend="italic">Faustiniance.</hi> He had by
                    her two sons and two daughters; but they all died before his elevation to the
                    throne, except Annia Faustina, who became the wife of his successor, Marcus
                    Aurelius, and deepened the infamy of the name she inherited from her mother.
                    Antoninus died of fever on the 7th of March 161, giving, as we are told, the
                    keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when the tribune of the
                    night-watch came to ask the password— <hi rend="italic">Aequanimitas.</hi> The
                    only account of his life handed down to us is that of Julius Capitolinus.</p>
