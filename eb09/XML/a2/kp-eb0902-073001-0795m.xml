                    name of a principle of explanation put forward by an important school of

                    expression, from the time of Locke, who seems to have first employed it, has
                    been Association of Ideas; but it is allowed or urged on all hands that this

                    above noted, extending beyond ideas or thoughts proper to every class of mental
                    states. In the long and erudite Note D**, appended by Sir W. Hamilton to his
                    edition of <hi rend="italic">Reid’s Works,</hi> and offered as a contribution
                    towards a history of the doctrine of mental suggestion or association, many
                    anticipations of modern statements are cited from the works of ancient or
                    mediaeval thinkers, and for Aristotle, in particular, the glory is claimed of
                    having at once originated the doctrine and practically brought it to perfection.
                    Aristotle’s enunciation of the doctrine is certainly very remarkable. As
                    translated by Hamilton, but without his interpolations, the classical passage
                    from the tract <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Memoria et
                    Reminiscentia</hi> runs as follows :—</p>
                <p>“When, therefore, we accomplish an act of reminiscence, we pass through a certain
                    series of precursive movements, until we arrive at a movement on which the one
                    we are in quest of is habitually consequent. Hence, too, it is that we hunt
                    through the mental train, excogitating from the present or some other, and from
                    similar or contrary or coadjacent. Through this process reminiscence takes
                    place. For the movements are, in these cases, sometimes at the same time,
                    sometimes parts of the same whole, so that the subsequent movement is already
                    more than half accomplished.”</p>
                <p>The passage is obscure (leaving open to Hamilton to suggest a peculiar
                    interpretation of it, that may be noticed in connection with the elaborate
                    doctrine of association put forward by himself, as if to evince the shortcomings
                    rather than the perfection of Aristotle’s), but it does in any case indicate the
                    various principles commonly termed Contiguity, Similarity, and Contrast; and,
                    though the statement of these cannot be said to be followed up by an effective
                    exposition or application, it quite equals in scope the observations of many a
                    modern inquirer. Zeno the Stoic also, and Epicurus, according to the report of
                    Diogenes Laertius (vii. § 52, x. § 32, overlooked by Hamilton), enumerated
                    similar principles of mental association. By St Augustin, at the end of his long
                    rhapsody on the wonders of memory in book x. of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessions,</hi> it was noted (c. 19) that the mind, when it tries to remember
                    something it knows it has forgotten, has, as it were, hold of part and thence
                    makes quest after the other part. Meanwhile and later, Aristotle’s doctrine
                    received a more or less intelligent expansion and illustration from the ancient
                    commentators and the schoolmen; and in the still later period of transition from
                    the age of scholasticism to the time of modern philosophy, prolonged in the
                    works of some writers far into the 17th century, Hamilton, from the stores of
                    his learning, is able to adduce not a few philosophical authorities who gave
                    prominence to the general fact of mental association—the Spaniard Ludo-yicus
                    Vives (1492-1540) especially being most exhaustive in his account of the
                    conditions of memory. This act of justice, however, once rendered to earlier
                    inquirers, it is to modern views of association that attention may fairly be
                    confined.</p>
                <p>In Hobbes’s psychology so much importance is assigned to what he called,
                    variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train,
                    &lt;fcc., of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse, that he has not
                    seldom been regarded, by those who did not look farther back, as the founder of
                    the theory of mental association. He did, indeed, vividly conceive and
                    illustrate the principle of Contiguity, but, as Hamilton conclusively shows, he
                    reproduced in his exposition but a part of the Aristotelian doctrine, nor even
                    this without wavering; representing the sequence of images, in such states as
                    dreams, now (in his <hi rend="italic">Unman Nature)</hi> as casual or
                    incoherent, now (in <hi rend="italic">Leviathan),</hi> following Aristotle, as
                    simply unguided. Not before Hume, among the moderns, is there express question
                    as to a number of distinct principles of association. Locke had, meanwhile,
                    introduced the phrase Association of Ideas as the title of a supplementary
                    chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay,</hi> meaning it, however, only as the name of a principle accounting for
                    the mental peculiarities of individuals, with little or no suggestion of its
                    general psychological import. Of this last Hume had the strongest impression,
                    and thinking himself, in forgetfulness or ignorance of Aristotle’s doctrine of
                    reminiscence, the first inquirer that had ever attempted to enumerate all the
                    modes of normal association among mental states, he brought them to
                    three—Resemblance, Contiguity in time and place, Cause and (or) Effect. Without
                    professing to arrive at this result otherwise than by an inductive consideration
                    of instances, he yet believed his enumeration to be exhaustive, and sought to
                    prove it so by resolving Contrast—one of Aristotle’s heads, commonly received—
                    as a mixture of causation and resemblance. Viewed in relation to his general
                    philosophical position, it must always remain a perplexing feature of Hume’s
                    list of principles, that he specified Causation as a principle distinct from
                    Contiguity in time, while otherwise the list has no superiority to Aristotle’s.
                    Hume’s fellow-countrymen, Gerard and Beattie, in opposition to him, recurred
                    accordingly to the traditional enumeration; and, in like manner,. Dugald Stewart
                    put forward Resemblance, Contrariety, and Vicinity in time and place, though he
                    added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of
                    Words, and farther noted three other cases of relation, namely, Cause and
                    Effect, Means and End, and Premisses and Conclusion, as holding among the trains
                    of thought under circumstances of special attention. Reid, preceding Stewart,
                    was rather disposed, for his own part, to make light of the subject of
                    association, vaguely remarking that it seems to require no other original
                    quality of mind but the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of
                    trains of thinking, when become familiar by frequent repetition <hi
                    rend="italic">{Intellectual Powers,</hi> p. 387). The counter-observation of his
                    editor, Hamilton, that we can as well explain habit by association as
                    association by habit, might with reason have been pointed more sharply.</p>
                <p>Hamilton’s own theory of mental reproduction, suggestion, or association, given
                    in outline in Note D***. following the historical note before mentioned, at the
                    end of his edition of <hi rend="italic">Reid’s Works,</hi> calls for more
                    special notice, as perhaps the most elaborate expression yet devised for the
                    principles involved in the phenomena of mental representation. It is a
                    development, greatly modified, of the doctrine expounded in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Metaphysics</hi> (vol. ii. p. 223, <hi rend="italic"
                    >seq.),</hi> which in agreement with some foreign authorities, reduced the
                    principles of association first to two—Simultaneity and Affinity, and these
                    farther to one supreme principle of Redintegration or Totality. In the ultimate
                    scheme he posits no less than feur general laws of mental succession concerned
                    in reproduction: (1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Associa</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0796-0731"/> bility or possible co-suggestion (all thoughts of
                    the same mental subject are associable, or capable of suggesting each other);
                    (2.) Repetition or direct remembrance (thoughts coidentical in modification, but
                    differing in time, tend to suggest each other); (3.) Redintegration, direct
                    remembrance or reminiscence (thoughts once coidentical in time, are, however,
                    different as mental modes, again suggestive of each other, and that in the
                    mutual order which they originally held); (4.) Preference (thoughts are
                    suggested not merely by force of the general subjective relation subsisting
                    between themselves, they are also suggested in proportion to the relation of
                    interest, from whatever source, in which they stand to the individual mind).
                    Upon these follow, as special laws;—A, Primary—modes of the laws of Repetition
                    and Redintegration—(1), law of Similars (Analogy, Affinity); (2), law of
                    Contrast; (3), law of Coadjacency (Cause and Effect, &amp;c.); B,
                    Secondary—modes of the law of Preference, under the law of Possibility—(1), laws
                    of Immediacy and Homogeneity; (2), law of Facility. Such is the scheme; and now
                    may be understood what interpretation Hamilton desires to put upon Aristotle’s
                    doctrine, when he finds or seeks in it a parallel relation to that established
                    by himself between the general laws, more especially Redintegration, and his
                    special ones. But, though the commentary of The-mistius, which he cites, lends
                    some kind of support to the position, it cannot be maintained without putting
                    the greatest strain on Aristotle’s language, and in one place it is as good as
                    surrendered by Hamilton himself (footnote, p. 900, δ). Nor is the ascription of
                    such a meaning at all necessary to establish Aristotle’s credit as regards the
                    doctrine of mental association.</p>
                <p>Thus far the principles of association have been considered only as involved in
                    mental reproduction and representation. There has grown up, however, especially
                    in England, the psychological school above mentioned, which aims at explaining
                    all mental acquisitions, and the more complex mental processes generally, under
                    laws not other than those determining simple reproduction. Hamilton also, though
                    professing, in the title of his outline just noticed, to deal with reproduction
                    only, formulates a number of still more general laws of mental succession—law of
                    Succession, law of Variation, law of Dependence, law of Relativity or
                    Integration (involving law of Conditioned), and, finally, law of Intrinsic or
                    Objective Relativity—as the highest to which human consciousness is subject; but
                    it is in a sense quite different that the psychologists of the so-called
                    Associationist School intend their appropriation of the principle or principles
                    commonly signalised. As far as can be judged from imperfect records, they were
                    anticipated to some extent by the experientialists of ancient times, both Stoic
                    and Epicurean <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Diogenes Laertius, as above). In the
                    modern period, Hobbes is the first thinker of permanent note to whom the
                    doctrine may be traced. Though he took, as has been seen, anything but an
                    exhaustive view of the phenomena of mental succession, yet, after dealing with
                    trains of imagination, or what he called mental discourse, he sought in the
                    higher departments of intellect to explain reasoning as a discourse in words,
                    dependent upon an arbitrary system of marks, each associated with, or standing
                    for, a variety of imaginations; and, save for a general assertion that reasoning
                    is a reckoning—otherwise, a compounding and resolving—he had no other account of
                    knowledge to give. The whole emotional side of mind, or, in his language, the
                    passions, he, in like manner, resolved into an expectation of consequences based
                    on past experience of pleasures and pains of sense. Thus, though he made no
                    serious attempt to justify his analysis in detail, he is undoubtedly to be
                    classed with the associationists of the next century—Hartley and the others.
                    They, however, were wont to trace the first beginnings of their psychological
                    theory no farther back than to Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay.</hi> If this
                    seems strange, when Locke did little more than supply them with the word
                    Association, it must be remembered in what ill repute the name of Hobbes stood,
                    and also that Locke’s work, though not directly concerned with the question of
                    psychological development, being rather of metaphysical or logical import, was
                    eminently psychological in spirit, and might fairly be held to contain in an
                    implicit form the principle or principles evolved later by the associationists.
                    Berkeley, dealing, immediately after Locke and altogether in Locke’s spirit,
                    with the special psychological problem of visual perception, was driven to posit
                    expressly a principle of suggestion or association in these terms :—“That one
                    idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they have been
                    observed to go together, without any demonstration of the necessity of their
                    coexistence, or so much as knowing what it is that makes them so to coexist” <hi
                    rend="italic">(New Theory of Vision,</hi> § 25); and to support the obvious
                    application of the principle to the case of the sensations of sight and touch
                    before him, he constantly urged that association of sound and sense of language
                    which the later school has always put in the foreground, whether as illustrating
                    the principle in general or in explanation of the supreme importance of language
                    for knowledge. It was natural, then, that Hume, coming after Berkeley, and
                    assuming Berkeley’s results, though he reverted to the larger inquiry of Locke,
                    should be more explicit in his reference to association; and, not only explicit,
                    he was original also, when he spoke of it as a “kind of attraction which in the
                    mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural,
                    and to show itself in as many and as various forms” <hi rend="italic">(Human
                    Nature,</hi> i. 1, § 4). Other inquirers were, in fact, appearing about the same
                    time, who conceived of association with this breadth of view, and set themselves
                    to track, as psychologists, its effects in detail.</p>
                <p>Hartley’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on Man,</hi> published in 1749 (eleven
                    years after the <hi rend="italic">Human Nature,</hi> and one year after the
                    better-known <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> of Hume), opened the path for all
                    the investigations of like nature that have since that time become so
                    characteristic of the English name in psychology. According to his own
                    statement, his attention was first turned to the subject about eighteen years
                    before, through what he heard of an opinion of the “Rev. Mr Gay,” that it was
                    possible to deduce all our intellectual pleasures and pains from association.
                    Gay is known only by a dissertation on the fundamental principles of virtue,
                    prefixed, at first anonymously, in 1731, to Archdeacon (afterwards Bishop) Law’s
                    translation of King’s <hi rend="italic">Origin of Evil,</hi> wherein it was
                    maintained, with considerable force, that by association the feelings belonging
                    to ends may come to attach themselves to means, and give rise to action for the
                    means as if they were ends, as seen (the instance has become a commonplace) in
                    the passion for money-making. In this vein, but on a very different scale,
                    Hartley proceeded to work. A physician by profession, and otherwise well versed
                    in science, he sought to combine with an elaborate theory of mental association
                    a minutely detailed hypothesis as to the corresponding action of the nervous
                    system, based upon the suggestion of a vibratory motion within the nerves thrown
                    out by Newton in the last paragraph of the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> So
                    far, however, from promoting the acceptance of the psychological theory, this
                    physical hypothesis proved to have rather the opposite effect, and it began to
                    bo dropped by Hartley’s followers (as Priestley, in his abridged edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Observations,</hi> 1775) before it was seriously impugned from
                    without. When it is studied in the original, and not taken upon the report of
                    hostile critics, who would not, or could not—at all events, who did not—
                    understand it, no little Importance must still be accorded to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0797-0732"/> the first attempt, not seldom a curiously
                    felicitous one, to carry through that parallelism of the physical and psychical,
                    which since then has come to count for more and more in the science of mind. Nor
                    should it be forgotten that Hartley himself, for all his paternal interest in
                    the doctrine of vibrations, was careful to keep separate from its fortunes the
                    cause of his other doctrine of mental association. Of this the point lay in no
                    mere restatement, with new precision, of a principle of coherence among
                    “ideas,’' but in its being taken as a clue by which to follow the progressive
                    development of the mind’s powers. Holding that mental states could be
                    scientifically understood only as they were analysed, Hartley sought for a
                    principle of synthesis to explain the complexity exhibited not only in trains of
                    representative images, but alike in the most involved combinations of reasonings
                    and (as Berkeley had seen) in the apparently simple phenomena of objective
                    perception, as well as in the varied play of the emotions, or, again, in the
                    manifold conscious adjustments of the motor system. One principle appeared to
                    him sufficient for all, running, as enunciated for the simplest case, thus: “Any
                    sensations A, B, C, &lt;fcc., by being associated with one another a sufficient
                    number of times, get such a power over the corresponding ideas (called by
                    Hartley also vestiges, types, images) <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> ιtc., that
                    any one of the sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be able to excite in
                    the mind <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi> &lt;fcc., the ideas of the rest.” To
                    render the principle applicable in the cases where the associated elements are
                    neither sensations nor simple ideas of sensations, Hartley’s first care was to
                    determine the conditions under which states other than these simplest ones have
                    their rise in the mind, becoming the matter of ever higher and higher
                    combinations. The principle itself supplied the key to the difficulty, when
                    coupled with the notion, already implied in Berkeley’s investigations, of a
                    coalescence of simple ideas of sensation into one complex idea, which may cease
                    to bear any obvious relation to its constituents. So far from being content,
                    like Hobbes, to make a rough generalisation to all mind from the phenomena of
                    developed memory, as if these might be straightway assumed, Hartley made a point
                    of referring them, in a subordinate place of their own, to his universal
                    principle of mental synthesis. He expressly put forward the law of association,
                    endued with such scope, as supplying what was wanting to Locke’s doctrine in its
                    more strictly psychological aspect, and thus marks by his work a distinct
                    advance on the line of development of the experiential philosophy.</p>
                <p>The new doctrine received warm support from some, as Law and Priestley, who both,
                    like Hume and Hartley himself, took the principle of association as having the
                    like import for the science of mind that gravitation had acquired for the
                    science of matter. The principle began also, if not always with direct reference
                    to Hartley, yet, doubtless, owing to his impressive advocacy of it, to be
                    applied systematically in special directions, as by Tucker (1768) to morals, and
                    by Alison (1790) to aesthetics. Thomas Brown (d. 1820) subjected anew to
                    discussion the question of theory. Hardly less unjust to Hartley than Reid or
                    Stewart had been, and forward to proclaim all that was different in his own
                    position, Brown must yet be ranked with the associationists before and after him
                    for the prominence he assigned to the associative principle in sense-perception
                    (what he called external affections of mind), and for his reference of all other
                    mental states (internal affections) to the two generic capacities or
                    susceptibilities of Simple and Relative Suggestion. He preferred the word
                    Suggestion to Association, which seemed to him to imply some prior connecting
                    process, whereof there was no evidence in many of the most important cases of
                    suggestion, nor even, strictly speaking, in the case of contiguity in time where
                    the term seemed least inapplicable. According to him, all that could be assumed
                    was a general constitutional tendency of the mind to exist successively in
                    states that have certain relations to each other, of itself only, and without
                    any external cause or any influence previous to that operating at the moment of
                    the suggestion. Brown’s chief contribution to the general doctrine of mental
                    association, besides what he did for the theory of perception, was, perhaps, his
                    analysis of voluntary reminiscence and constructive imagination — faculties that
                    appear at first sight to lie altogether beyond the explanatory range of the
                    principle. In James Mill’s <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Phenomena of the
                    Human Mind</hi> (1829), the principle, much as Hartley had conceived it, was
                    carried out, with characteristic consequence, over the psychological field. With
                    a much enlarged and more varied conception of association, Professor Bain has
                    re-executed the general psychological task in the present generation, while Mr
                    Herbert Spencer has revised the doctrine from the new point of view of the
                    evolution-hypothesis. John Stuart Mill made only occasional excursions into the
                    region of psychology proper, but sought, in his <hi rend="italic">System of
                    Logic</hi> (1843), to determine the conditions of objective truth from the point
                    of view of the associationist theory, and, thus or otherwise being drawn into
                    general philosophical discussion, spread wider than any one before him its
                    repute.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that the Associationist School has been composed chiefly of
                    British thinkers, but in France also it has had distinguished representatives.
                    Of these it will suffice to mention Condillac, the author of the sensationalist
                    movement in the 18th century, who professed to explain all knowledge from the
                    single principle of association <hi rend="italic">(liaison)</hi> of ideas,
                    operating through a previous association with signs, verbal or other. At the
                    present day the later English school counts important adherents among the
                    younger French thinkers. In Germany, before the time of Kant, mental association
                    was generally treated in the traditional manner, as by Wolff'. Kant’s inquiry
                    into the foundations of knowledge, agreeing in its general purport with Locke’s,
                    however it differed in its critical procedure, brought him face to face with the
                    newer doctrine that had been grafted on Locke’s philosophy; and to account for
                    the fact of synthesis in cognition, in express opposition to associationism, as
                    represented by Hume, was, in truth, his prime object, starting, as he did, from
                    the assumption that there was that in knowledge which no mere association of
                    experiences could explain. To the extent, therefore, that his influence
                    prevailed, all such inquiries as the English associationists went on to
                    prosecute were discounted in Germany. Notwithstanding, under the very shadow of
                    his authority a corresponding, if not related, movement was initiated by
                    Herbart. Peculiar, and widely different from anything conceived by the
                    associationists, as Herbart’s metaphysical opinions were, he was at one with
                    them, and at variance with Kant, in assigning fundamental importance to the
                    psychological investigation of the development of consciousness, nor was his
                    conception of the laws determining the interaction and flow of mental
                    presentations and representations, when taken in its bare psychological import,
                    essentially different from theirs. In Beneke’s psychology also, and in more
                    recent inquiries conducted mainly by physiologists, mental association has been
                    understood in its wider scope, as a general principle of explanation.</p>
                <p>Associationists differ not a little among themselves in the statement of their
                    principle, or, when they adduce several principles, in their conception of the
                    relative importance of these. Hartley took account only of Contiguity, or the
                    repetition of impressions synchronous or immediately successive; and the like is
                    true of James Mill, though, incidentally, he made an express attempt to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n798/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0798-0733"/> resolve the received principle of Similarity, and
                    through this the other principle of Contrast, into his fundamental law—law of
                    Frequency, as he sometimes called it, because upon frequency, in conjunction
                    with vividness of impressions, the strength of association, in his view,
                    depended. In a sense of his own, Brown also, while accepting the common
                    Aristotelian enumeration of principles, inclined to the opinion that “all
                    suggestion may be found to depend on prior coexistence, or at least on such
                    proximity as is itself very probably a modification of coexistence,” provided
                    account be taken of “the influence of emotions and other feelings that are very
                    different from ideas, as when an analogous object suggests an analogous object
                    by the influence of an emotion which each separately may have produced before,
                    and which is, therefore, common to both.” (Upon which view it obviously occurs
                    to remark, that, except in the particular case, plainly not intended, where the
                    objects are experienced in actual succession with the emotion common to both, a
                    suggestion through <hi rend="italic">similar</hi> emotions must still be
                    presumed.) To the contrary effect, Mr Spencer maintains that the fundamental law
                    of all mental association is that presentations aggregate or cohere with their
                    like in past experience, and that, besides this law, there is in strictness no
                    other, all further phenomena of association being incidental. Thus in
                    particular, he would explain association by Contiguity as due to the
                    circumstance of imperfect assimilation of the present to the past in
                    consciousness; a presentation in as far as it is distinctly cognised is in fact
                    recognised through cohering with its like in past experience, but there is
                    always, in consequence of the imperfection of our perceptions, a certain range
                    within which the classing of the present experience with past is doubtful—a
                    certain cluster of relations nearly like the one perceived, which become nascent
                    in consciousness in the act of assimilation; now contiguity is likeness of
                    relation in time or in space, or in both, and, when the classing, which, as long
                    as it is general, goes easily and infallibly forward, becomes specific, a
                    presentation may well arouse the merely contiguous, instead of the identical,
                    from former experience. Midway between these opposed views should be noted,
                    finally, the position of Professor Bain, who regards Contiguity and Similarity,
                    logically, as perfectly distinct principles, though in actual psychological
                    occurrence they blend intimately with each other; contiguous trains being
                    started by a first (it may be, implicit) representation through Similarity,
                    while the express assimilation of present to past in consciousness is always, or
                    tends to be, followed by the revival of what was presented in contiguity with
                    that past.</p>
                <p>That Similarity is an ultimate ground of mental association cannot seriously be
                    questioned, and to neglect or discount it, in the manner of the older
                    representatives of the school, is to render the associationist theory quite
                    inadequate for purposes of general psychological explanation. It is simply
                    impossible to over-rate the importance of the principle, and, when Mr Spencer,
                    by way of supporting his position, maintains farther, that the psychological
                    fact of conscious assimilation corresponds with the fundamentally simple
                    physiological fact of re-excitation of the same nervous structures, the force as
                    well as pertinence of the observation is at once evident. Nevertheless, it is
                    one question whether a representation, upon a particular occasion, shall be
                    evoked by Similarity, aud another question what shall be raised into
                    consciousness along with it; nor for this is there any help but in positing a
                    distinct principle of Contiguity. The phenomena of presentative cognition or
                    objective perception on which Mr Spencer bases his argument, are precisely those
                    in which the function of Contiguity is least explicitly manifested, but only
                    because of the certainty and fixity it has assumed through the great uniformity
                    and frequency of such experience. Let the series of presentative elements, as in
                    formal education, be less constant in composition, and less frequently
                    recurrent, than are those aggregates of sensible impressions that, in the
                    natural course of experience, become to us objects in space with a character
                    comparatively fixed, and then the function of Contiguity starts out with
                    sufficient prominence, being found as often as not to fail in determining a
                    revival ef the corresponding representative series. All the phenomena, too, of
                    coalescence, in which a variety of elements become fused to a result in
                    consciousness as heterogeneous as any chemical compound in relation to its
                    constituents—phenomena that have remained the very property of the
                    Associationist School since they first were distinctly noted by Hartley—how are
                    these to be explained by the principle of Similarity Î Involved as it
                    incontestably is in every repeated apprehension, whether of the elements, or of
                    the product, or of the relation between them, Similarity of itself is powerless
                    to determine a relation the essence of which lies not more in the heterogeneous
                    character of the result than in the diversity of the elements brought together.
                    Nor, in order to support the claim of the principle of Contiguity to an equally
                    fundamental position with that of Similarity, is it more difficult to find an
                    expression in terms of physiology corresponding with the subjective process. The
                    fact that different nerve-centres are excited together, synchronously or
                    successively, along definite lines of connection, will leave them, being so
                    connected, in a state of relative instability, which, other things equal, will
                    vary in proportion to the frequency and strength of the excitation; and thus,
                    when one of them is, in whatever way, again aroused, the rest will tend to be
                    reaffected also by reason of the instability that has remained. The process of
                    psychological representation, running parallel with the nervous events here
                    supposed, involves assimilation at every stage from and including the first; it
                    is also constantly happening, in contiguous trains, that a break occurs at a
                    particular stage through an express suggestion, by Similarity, of something
                    foreign to the train. But in the one case, as in the other—alike coincident with
                    the implicit action of Similarity, and in the pauses of express assimilation—the
                    principle of Contiguity has a part to play, not to be denied or confounded with
                    any other.</p>
                <p>A minor question, also disputed, is whether by the side of Contiguity and
                    Similarity, Contrast should be held, as by Aristotle, an independent principle
                    of association. That things contrasted may and do often suggest each other in
                    consciousness is on all hands allowed, but ever since Hume attempted, however
                    infelicitously, to resolve the principle into others, its independence has not
                    ceased to lie under suspicion. When the question is approached without
                    prejudice, it cannot but appear strange that mental states which suggest each
                    other because of likeness, should suggest each other because of unlikeness also.
                    In that case anything might suggest everything else, since like and unlike
                    con&gt;- scious states are all that are possible; nay, unlike sta <hi
                    rend="superscript"> +</hi> es alone are all, as there must always be some
                    difference between any two. Now it is true, in one sense, that anything may
                    suggest anything be it ever so unlike, namely, if the· things have been once or
                    repeatedly experienced in conjunction; but then the bond of association is the
                    contiguity, and not the unlikeness, which obviously cannot be a ground for
                    suggesting this one other thing more than any other thing. By contrast, however,
                    is not generally meant bare unlikenes3. Genuine contrasts, as black-white,
                    giant-dwarf, up-down, are peculiar in having under the difference a foundation
                    of similarity, the two members lying within the sphere of a common higher
                    notion, and only being distinguished the more impressively by reason of the
                    accompanying unlikeness. Clearly, in the case of mutual suggestion, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n799/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0799-0734"/> if it be not the similarity itself that is here
                    the ground of association, it may again be Contiguity, the sharpest experience
                    of each member of the contrast having been when there was experience also of the
                    other; or both grounds may conspire towards the result, the association being
                    then what Professor Bain has marked as Compound. On the whole, it must be
                    concluded that only in a secondary sense can Contrast be admitted as a principle
                    of mental association.</p>
                <p>The highest philosophical interest, as distinguished from that which is more
                    strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called
                    Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, as it had been
                    assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms :—</p>
                <p>“Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined that
                    they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it in spite
                    of whatever effort we make to disjoin them.”— <hi rend="italic">{Analysis of the
                    Human Mind,</hi> 2d ed. vol. i. p. 93.)</p>
                <p>J. S. Mill’s statement is more guarded and particular :— “When two phenomena have
                    been very often experienced in conjunction, and have not, in any single
                    instance, occurred separately either in experience or in thought, there is
                    produced between them what has been called inseparable, or, less correctly,
                    indissoluble, association; by which is not meant that the association must
                    inevitably last to the end of life—that no subsequent experience or process of
                    thought can possibly avail to dissolve it; but only that as long as no such
                    experience or process of thought has taken place, the association is
                    irresistible; it is impossible for us to think the one thing disjoined from the
                    other. ”— <hi rend="italic">{Examination of Hamilton's Philosophy,</hi> 2d ed.
                    p. 191.)</p>
                <p>Even this statement, however, is somewhat lacking in precision, since there never
                    is any impossibility of thinking the things apart, in the sense of considering
                    them as logically distinct; the very fact of association implies at least such
                    distinctness, while there may be evident, besides, a positive difference of
                    psychological origin, as when, in the case of visual extension, the colour of
                    the field is referred to the passive sensibility of the eye, and the expanse to
                    its mobility. The impossibility is of representation apart, not of logical
                    consideration or thought. It is chiefly by J. S. Mill that the philosophical
                    application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious
                    application is to so-called necessary truths—such, namely, as are not merely
                    analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same
                    thinker has sought, in the work just cited, to prove Inseparable Association the
                    ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application,
                    especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is
                    supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and
                    transmissible as original endowment to individuals—endowment that may be
                    expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence, or, objectively, as
                    fixed nervous connections. Mr Spencer, as before suggested, is the author of
                    this extended view of mental association.</p>
                <p>For a detailed exposition of the psychological theory of the Associationist
                    School, the reader is referred to the works of its latest representatives named
                    above. The question is still under discussion, how far the theory avails to
                    account for the facts of intelligence, not to say the complex phases of mental
                    life in general in all their variety; nor, were the theory carried out farther
                    than it has yet been by any one, and formulated in terms commanding more general
                    assent than any expression of it has yet obtained even from professed adherents,
                    is it likely to be raised above dispute. Yet it must be allowed to stand forward
                    with a special claim to the scientific character; as already in his' time
                    Laplace (who, though an outsider, could well judge) bore witness, when, speaking
                    of the principle of association (Contiguity) as applied to the explanation of
                    knowledge, he declared it <hi rend="italic">la partie réelle de la métaphysique
                    {Essai phil. sur les Probabilités, Oeuvres,</hi> vol. vii. p. cxxxvii.) If in
                    the physical sciences the object of the inquirer is confined to establishing
                    laws expressive of the relations subsisting amongst phenomena, then, however
                    different be the internal world of mind— however short such treatment may seem
                    to come of expressing the depth and fulness even of its phenomenal nature— a
                    corresponding object is as much as the scientific psychologist can well set to
                    himself. The laws of association express undoubted relations holding among
                    particular mental states, that are the real or actual facts with which the
                    psychologist has to deal, and it becomes a strictly scientific task to inquire
                    how far the whole complexity of the internal life may receive an explanation
                    therefrom. Understood in this sense, Hume’s likening of the laws of mental
                    association to the principle of gravitation in external nature is perfectly
                    justifiable. It is to the credit of the associationists to have grasped early,
                    and steadily maintained, such a conception of psychological inquiry, and,
                    whatever their defects of execution may have been or remain, their work retains
                    a permanent value as a serious attempt to get beyond barren description of
                    abstract mental faculties to real and effective explanation. The psychologists
                    that, in the related point of view, have earned the title of the Analytical
                    School, from holding before their eyes the exemplar of the method of the
                    positive sciences, are precisely those that have fastened upon the principles of
                    association as the ground of mental synthesis; and, till it is shown that the
                    whole method of procedure is inapplicable to such a subject as mind, their
                    conception is entitled to rank as a truly scientific one. <hi rend="smallcaps"
