                    Mosaic account of the Creation, existed before the sun and moon were placed in
                    the sky. In the first stage of her character, in which, like the other deities
                    of Olympus, she was directly identified with an element of nature and supposed
                    to act as it acted, Athena bore the name of Pallas, and was thought of more in
                    connection with the storms than with the serenity or light of the heavens. The
                    obvious counterpart of a storm was a raging battle, and, accordingly, she became
                    a goddess of war, armed with spear and helmet, and with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aegis,</hi> or stormshield, of her father, resistless among men, hurling to the
                    ground the giant Enceladus, and even superior in might to Ares himself, the god
                    of war. The storm sweeps sorest round high citadels, where also the storms of
                    war rage fiercest; and on such places was her favourite abode. But a storm is
                    followed by serenity brighter than before, more enjoyable, and more exciting to
                    activity of every kind; and then the goddess lays aside her armour to encourage
                    and foster skill and industry. Her title is then Ergane. To ner was ascribed the
                    invention of spinning and weaving; of taming horses, bridling and yoking them to
                    the war-chariot; of the flute, and in some way of the healing art. This is the
                    second stage of her character, which the myth, agreeably to its principle,
                    explains in a different fashion, when it says that she sprang into existence
                    from the brain of the all-wise ruler of the world, Zeus, and that he had before
                    swallowed his wife, Metis (intelligence). She must therefore have been in a
                    measure a complement of him, created for the purpose of carrying out among men
                    what was in his mind, but what yet lie could not himself, as the supreme and
                    impartial ruler, execute. As his substitute, she lent her aid to Heracles in all
                    his hardships and adventures; to Theseus under similar circumstances; to the
                    Greeks in their war against Troy; to Perseus in slaying the Gorgon Medusa, whose
                    head she afterwards bore upon her <hi rend="italic">oegis,</hi> from which she
                    obtained the name of Gorgophone; and to the Argonauts on their expedition to
                    Colchis. She maintained always her character of a virgin, and, to express this,
                    bore, at Athens in particular, the name of Parthenos. Her birth took place in
                    Olympus, in presence of the other deities, Hephaestus aiding it, as it is
                    coarsely said, by splitting open with his hatchet the skull of Zeus, a subject
                    often represented on the ancient painted vases. This was also the subject of the
                    sculptures in the front pediment of her greatest temple, the Parthenon at
                    Athens. From the fact that in the other pediment the sculptures represented her
                    contest with Poseidon for divine supremacy over Attica, it might perhaps seem
                    that the first act of her existence was to claim this sovereignty. Foremost in
                    her character always is her protection of high citadels, like that of Athens.
                    Yet it was not for this, but for her causing an olive to grow on the bare rock
                    of the Acropolis, that she was chosen rather than Poseidon, whose claim was that
                    he had raised on the same rock a spring of brackish water. The olives of Attica
                    were a source of great wealth, and the light supplied by their oil may have
                    seemed not unlike the light of the ether. As the defender of citadels her title
                    was Polias.</p>
                <p>There is, however, a different account of her origin hinging on her name of
                    Tritogenea or Tritonis, and describing her as a daughter of Poseidon and the
                    Triton lake in Libya. But this is obviously a late invention, founded,
                    apparently, on traditions handed down in Libya from the early Minyae colonists,
                    in whose original seat at Orchomenos and Alal-comense in Boeotia was a very
                    early form of the worship of Pallas as a goddess in some way connected with
                    lakes and streams. In this district, in Arcadia, and in Crete also, were found
                    rivers bearing the name of Triton, and associated in very early traditions with
                    the birth of Athena.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0904-0831"/>
                <p>At one time, therefore, her relation to or control of the watery element must
                    have formed a considerable part of her worship. To this also is traced her
                    ancient name of *Oγγα or *0γκa at Thebes. How she came by the name of Glaucopis,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e., “</hi> owl-eyed,” by which she is so frequently
                    addressed in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> is not satisfactorily explained,
                    least of all by the recent theory, which, interpreting it as “owl-headed,”
                    maintains that the goddess had originally the head of an owl, and appeals to
                    certain rude clay vases and figures found on the supposed site of Troy, with
                    faces intended to be human, but yet not much unlike the face of an owl. As the
                    goddess of victory she was called Nike, and it was to her in this capacity that
                    the edifice known as the Temple of the Wingless Victory was erected on the
                    Acropolis of Athens. Hippia was her title as the tamer of horses. Erichthonius,
                    at Athens, was the first mortal whom she taught to yoke horses. For Bellerophon,
                    on the Acropolis of Corinth, she bridled the winged horse Pegasus. Besides
                    Corinth, the chief seats of her worship outside of Attica were Argos, Sicyon,
                    Troezen (in Arcadia, where, with the title of Aiea, warm, fostering, she had a
                    celebrated temple), Laconia, Elis, and in Asia Minor, at ∏ium, where it survived
                    after her image, the Palladion, which had fallen from heaven, had been removed
                    to Athens or Argos, both of which claimed to have received it. At Athens an
                    ancient image of her existed in the Erechtheum, and was regarded with peculiar
                    sanctity, even in the times when men were familiar with the splendid statue of
                    her by Phidias in the Parthenon. Except at Athens, little is known of the
                    ceremonies or festivals which attended her worship. There we have—(1.) The
                    ceremony of the <hi rend="italic">Three Sacred Ploughs,</hi> by which the signal
                    for seed-time was given, and, apparently, dating from a period when agriculture
                    was one of the chief occupations of her worshippers; (2.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Procharisteria,</hi> at the end of winter, at which all the magistrates offered
                    sacrifice; (3.) The <hi rend="italic">Skirophoria,</hi> with a procession from
                    the Acropolis to the village of Skiron, in the height of summer, the priests who
                    were to offer sacrifice to Athena walking under the shade of parasols held over
                    them; (4.) The <hi rend="italic">Oschophoria,</hi> at the vintage season, with
                    races among boys, and a procession, with songs in praise of Dionysus and
                    Ariadne; (5.) The <hi rend="italic">Chadkeia,</hi> with rites referring to her
                    as a goddes3 presiding jointly with Hephaestus over industrial arts; (6.) The
                    <hi rend="italic">Plynteria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Callyn-teria,</hi> at
                    which the ancient image in the Erechtheum was cleaned, with a procession in
                    which bunches of figs were carried; (7.) The <hi rend="italic">Arrhephoria,</hi>
                    at which four girls, between seven and eleven years of age, selected from noble
                    families, brought during the night certain sacred objects from the temple of
                    Aphrodite by an underground passage to the Acropolis; (8.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Panathenoea,</hi> at which the new robes for the image of the goddess were,
                    before being placed on it, carried through the city, spread like a sail on a
                    mast. The last festival was attended by athletic games, open to all who traced
                    their nationality to Athens. As to artistic representations of Athena, we have
                    first the rude figure which seems to be a copy of the Palladion; secondly, the
                    still rude, but otherwise more interesting, figures of her, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> when accompanying heroes, on the early painted vases;
                    and thirdly, the type of her as produced by Phidias, from which little variation
                    appears to have been made. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
