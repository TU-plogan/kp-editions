                    rend="italic">Asiat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.</hi> xi. p. 35). The Hebrew
                    transcript, occurring with slight differences of spelling in different passages

                    the English form is taken, is less correct, and 13 misleading through the
                    assimilation of the latter part of the name to the other royal name Xerxes, with
                    which the word before us has etymologically no connection. In later times the
                    name assumes the slightly modified forms of <hi rend="italic">Artachshetr</hi>
                    (De Sacy, <hi rend="italic">Antiquités</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Perse,</hi>

                    and meaning of the name there is a general consensus of opinion among modern
                    scholars. Herodotus (vi. 98) was misled by the Greek transcription, when, having
                    rendered Xerxes, <hi rend="italic">Warrior (apηio&lt;s),</hi> he rendered

                <p>It is known that throne-names, or names appropriated to royalty, were in use
                    among the Persians as among other Eastern nations <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi>

                    Agradatus before his accession to the throne. The second and third Darius had
                    both also private names, the one Ochus, and the other Codomannus. To the class
                    of royal names belongs the name Artaxerxes. To this use its significance is
                    alone suitable, and in the earliest times, at least, it is not found
                    appropriated by any save either the possessors of, or the pretenders to,
                    royalty. In regard to the most of those about to be mentioned, we have express
                    testimony that they took this name only when they ascended the throne.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient first to mention the Achaemenian kings thus designated in
                    the Greek historians and the old Persian inscriptions, and then consider the
                    questions connected with the identification of these with the kings of this name
                    occurring in Scripture.</p>
                <p>1. Artaxerxes, surnamed Μακρόχειρ, or Longimanus (by Persian authors,
                    Diraz-dest), the long-handed, so called, says Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">Vita
                    Artax.,</hi> i.), because his right hand was longer than his left, or perhaps
                    (see Malcolm, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of Persia,</hi> i. p. 66) the long-armed
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Edward Longshanks), was the son of the famous
                    Xerxes, the invader of Greece, and succeeded his father in 465 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> According to Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.
                    Jud.,</hi> xi. 6, 1), he was originally called Cyrus. His reign was marked by
                    the revolt of Egypt under Inarus, in which the Athenians were abettors of the
                    Egyptians, and which was quelled by the Persian general Megabyzus, in 455 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and by the ratification of the peace of Callias with
                    Athens in 449 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Of the architectural and inscribed
                    remains of the ancient Persian empire very little is recognisable as due to this
                    king. He is recorded in an inscription by his grandson, the next Artaxerxes, as
                    the <hi rend="italic">repairer</hi> (?) of the palace at Susa (Loftus, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chaldaea</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >Asiat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> xv. pp. 157-162). There is extant a
                    fragmentary inscription in old Persian, with an Assyrian translation, which
                    seems to have proceeded from him; and a legend upon a vase at Venice, of
                    Egyptian origin, which reads “Artaxerxes the great king,” may with considerable
                    assurance be also referred to this monarch (Oppert, <hi rend="italic">op.
                    cit.</hi> pp. 288-290). Artaxerxes died in 425 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    after a reign of forty years.</p>
                <p>2. The next sovereign that falls to be noticed here was the grandson of the
                    preceding, and the son of the intermediate monarch, Darius Nothus. His original
                    and private name was Arsaces, and he assumed that of Artaxerxes on ascending the
                    throne (Ctesias, <hi rend="italic">Exc. Pers.</hi> § 57; Plutarch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vita Artax.,</hi> c. 2). The date of his accession is 405 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is this Artaxerxes, commonly surnamed Mnemon, from
                    the retentiveness of his memory, whose reign was distinguished by the attempt of
                    his brother, the younger Cyrus, to gain possession of the crown, and by the
                    victory of Cunaxa 401 B.c., the death of Cyrus, and the retreat of the ten
                    thousand Greeks, immortalised by Xenophon. Other prominent events of this reign
                    were the peace of Antalcidas in 399 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the
                    Cyprian revolt, with the defeat of Evagoras its leader, about 380 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Artaxerxes Mnemon died in 359 B,c., after a reign of
                    forty-six years, The Greek sources for this reign are comparatively abundant.
                    Besides Xenophon, Ctesias, Diodorus, and others, Plutarch has furnished a
                    special life of this monarch. The only native memorial of his reign is the
                    inscription already referred to, found at Susa on the bases of pillars belonging
                    to the royal residence there, which runs thus :—“Says Artaxerxes, the great
                    King, the King of Kings, the King of the countries, the King of this earth, the
                    son of King Darius; Darius was the son of King Artaxerxes, Artaxerxes was the
                    son of Xerxes, Xerxes was the son of King Darius, Darius was the son of
                    Hystaspes, the Achaemenian. Darius, my ancestor, built this temple (or edifice),
                    and afterwards it was repaired (?) by Artaxerxes, my grandfather. By the help of
                    Ahuramazda I placed Anahita and Mithra in this temple. May Ahuramazda, Anahita,
                    and Mithra protect me.” (See Norris in Loftus, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>
                    p. 372; <hi rend="italic">Jour.</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiat.</hi><hi

                    65.) The inscription, compared with earlier texts, shows a certain negligence of
                    style, and is interesting for the prominence, unparalleled in previous records,
                    given to the worship of the subordinate deities Anahita, or Tanaitis, and
                    Mithra.</p>
                <p>3. This sovereign was succeeded by his son Ochus, who, on securing the crown,
                    took the same royal name, and is usually known as Artaxerxes Ochus. The

                    numerous formidable revolts throughout the western provinces of the empire,
                    which, however, were vigorously repressed, and after the re-subjugation of the
                    revolted countries, the power of the empire was advanced to an extent and to an
                    apparent stability unequalled since the time of the great Darius. This
                    Artaxerxes perished by poison in 338 B.C. He is known as the builder of one of
                    the palatial structures which stood on the platform of Persepolis; and an
                    inscription proceeding from him (wrongly ascribed to the previous Artaxerxes by
                    Benfey, <hi rend="italic">'Die</hi><hi rend="italic">persischen
                    Keilinschriften,</hi> p. 67) has been found there, marked, like that already
                    spoken of, and to a greater degree, by defects of style, and presenting his
                    genealogy in entire accordance with the preceding. (See Rawlinson, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit.</hi> x. p. 341; Oppert, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>

                <p>4. We find yet another instance in the classical writers of the use of Artaxerxes
                    as a royal name during the Achaemenian period. After Darius Codomannus, the
                    successor of Artaxerxes Ochus, had been finally and decisively defeated by
                    Alexander at Arbela, he was, while fleeing before the conqueror, traitorously
                    slain by Bessus, the satrap of Bactria, who thereupon, we are told, “assumed the
                    upright tiara and the royal robe, and the name Artaxerxes instead of Bessus,
                    proclaiming himself king of Asia” (Arrian, <hi rend="italic">Exp. Alex.,</hi>
                    iii. 25, 3, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Curtius, vi. 6,13).</p>
                <p>Such are the Achaemenian kings known to the classical writers by the name
                    Artaxerxes. But the name also occurs in the Scriptural books of Ezra and
                    Nehemiah, as well as in some of the Apocryphal books, and in Josephus; and it
                    remains to be considered whether the persons there referred to are to be
                    identified with any of the kings now mentioned, and if so, with whom 1 In the
                    book of Nehemiah, Artaxerxes, king of Persia, appears as the monarch to whom
                    Nehemiah acted as cup-bearer (L 2), from whom he received a commission, in the
                    twentieth year of the king, to rebuild the wall and other ruined edifices in
                    Jerusalem (it 1 ), and whose thirty-second year is also mentioned (v. 14, xiii.
                    6). In attempting to identify this Artaxerxes with one of those above named, our
                    choice is at once limited by the length of his reign to those surnamed
                    Longimanus and Mnemon. A sufficient proof that it is the former of these who is
                    meant, is found in the genealogy of Eliashib, the high priest when Nehemiah came
                    to Jerusalem (Neh. iii 1, and xiL 10). For Eliashib was the grandson of Jeshua,
                    and Jeshua was high priest when Zerubbabel led the first company of returned
                    exiles to Judah, in the days of Cyrus (Ezra ii. 2, iii. 2). Now, the reign of
                    Cyrus dates from 536 B.c.; and from this to the twentieth year of Artaxerxes
                    Longimanus, or 445 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is a period of ninety-one
                    years, leaving room for precisely three generations. The opinion, which is the
                    common one, that the Artaxerxes of Nehemiah is Artaxerxes Longimanus, is thus
                    fully warranted (though some, as De Saulcy, <hi rend="italic">Sept</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">siècles de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">histoire
                    judaïque,</hi> p. 28, identify him with Artaxerxes Mnemon), and this enables us
                    to proceed with confidence when inquiring into the reference of the name as it
                    occurs in the book of Ezra. Ezra was contemporary with Nehemiah (Neh. viii. 1),
                    and mention is made in his book of an Artaxerxes who was his own contemporary
                    (Ezra vii. 1, 7, 11; viii 1), in whose seventh year a decree was issued, giving
                    authority to Ezra to levy whatever supplies were needful for the service of the
                    temple at Jerusalem. This, therefore, must have been also Artaxerxes Longimanus,
                    and the year referred to is 458 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Hence, also, when
                    it is said (Ezra vi. 14) that “the elders of the Jews builded, and they
                    prospered, . . . according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and
                    Artaxerxes king of Persia,” it may without difficulty be understood that the
                    same monarch is here named, the writer singling out the three kings who, of all
                    the Persian monarchs, distinguished themselves by the favour shov.n to the
                    Jews.</p>
                <p>The name occurs again in an earlier part of the same book, chapter iv. In verse 5
                    of that chapter mention is made of efforts of the enemies of the Jews to hinder
                    the rebuilding of the temple, put forth “all the days of Cyrus, king of Persia,
                    even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.” Then in the two succeeding
                    verses Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes are specified as kings in whose reigns
                    representations adverse to the Jews were made at the court of Persia; and after
                    the detailed accounts of the second of these representations, and its success
                    with Artaxerxes, it is said (ver. 24), “Then ceased the work of the house of God
                    which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of Darius, king of
                    Persia.” The narrative has all the appearance of consecutive history, and the
                    natural interpretation obviously is that the two kings, Ahasuerus and
                    Artaxerxes, intervened between Cyrus and Darius. It is true, mention is made in
                    the memorial presented to king Artaxerxes of the building of the city and the
                    walls, rather than of the temple, the rebuilding of which was at the time the
                    great enterprise of the returned exiles; but this may be easily accounted for,
                    from the interest of the writers to make out the strongest possible case at the
                    Persian court. Besides, it is impossible to believe that the city and its walls
                    remained utterly desolate as the Chaldeans had left them while the temple was
                    being rebuilt. There is, indeed, express testimony to the contrary. Notice is
                    taken of the ‘‘ ceiled houses” of Jerusalem at this period (Haggai i. 4).
                    Mention is also made of a “wall” of defence for its inhabitants (Ezra ix. 9),
                    and Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant. Jud.,</hi> xi. 4, 4) records the “strong
                    walls about the city” while the temple was still unfinished. It has indeed been
                    argued, and that quite reasonably, that the wall mentioned in Nehemiah i. 3,
                    which was reported to Nehemiah as “broken down,” is that to which reference is
                    made in the passages just cited from Ezra and Josephus, built by the first
                    colony of returned Jews, and not that destroyed by the Chaldeans nearly a
                    century and a half before (see Kitto’s <hi rend="italic">Cyclopoedia,</hi>
                    article “Ahasuerus ”). There seems, therefore, to be nothing in the narrative to
                    hinder the two kings to whom it relates, and whom it places between Cyrus and
                    Darius, from being identified with the two kings who did actually intervene
                    between these monarchs, viz., Cambyses and the pseudo-Smerdis; and this is the
                    view which is taken of the matter by the great majority of interpreters. The
                    difference in the names, however, presents a difficulty which to not a few has
                    appeared insuperable, and from which escape has been sought in various ways.
                    Some, as Scaliger, Hottinger, Mill, believing that Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes in
                    Ezra iv. 6, 7, mean Xerxes and Artaxerxes Longimanus, suppose also that Darius
                    in chapters iv. 24,vi.l, &amp;c., means the successor of the latter, viz.,
                    Darius Nothus. But the identification of the Darius with the well-known Darius
                    Hystaspes is sustained by so overwhelming evidence (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Darius),</hi> that this opinion may be at once and without hesitation rejected.
                    Others, as Howes (see <hi rend="italic">Pictorial Biblt</hi> on Ezra iv.), Biley
                    <hi rend="italic">(Jour. Sac. Literature,</hi> July 1866), and many Germans,—as
                    Kleinert, Schultz, Hengstenberg, Au-berlen, Vaihinger, Bertheau, Keil,
                    &lt;kc.,—believe that the paragraph, Ezraiv. 6-23, forms an interpolation or
                    episode, in which the chronicler has summed up the attempts of the adversaries
                    of Judah to hinder the building of the temple, as well as what they did for the
                    obstructing of the building of the city under Xerxes and Artaxerxes, in order to
                    bring together in a compendious way all their machinations against the Jews (see
                    Keil, <hi rend="italic">ad locj)</hi> It is impossible, however, to reconcile
                    this view satisfactorily with the language of the narrative, especially of ver.
                    24, the plain meaning of which is that the interruption in the work of the house
                    of God caused by the decree of the king named Artaxerxes con·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0703-0642"/>
                <p>tinued until, and hence was previous to, the second year of king Darius. Some
                    German expositors, indeed, as Herzfeld <hi rend="italic">(Gesek, d.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Volkes</hi><hi rend="italic">lsr.</hi> i. 303), Merx, Schrader,
                    &lt;kc., admit the irreconcilability, and, believing that the two kings in
                    question were Xerxes and his son, maintain that the compiler of the book of Ezra
                    was guilty of a mistake in,referring the documents cited to the period
                    preceding, instead of to the period subsequent to, the reign of Darius. But,
                    apart from all questions about inspiration, this must be condemned as an
                    illegitimate procedure. Our only original witness to the events connected with
                    the return of the Jewish exiles is the book of Ezra, and it is not permissible
                    to alter its testimony, or to set it aside as erroneous, because it presents
                    some appearances of discrepancy with what is otherwise ascertained. It is to be
                    added that the Apocryphal 1st Esdras, in the version which it gives of the same
                    events, refers them and the king Artaxerxes to the period intervening between
                    Cyrus and Darius (Esdras ii. 16-30, V. 72, 73), and that Josephus also in so far
                    agrees that he assigns the events to the same period, though making no mention
                    of Artaxerxes, and naming Cambyses a» the king by whom the work at Jerusalem was
                    hindered <hi rend="italic">(Ant. Jud.,</hi> xi. 2).</p>
                <p>Retaining, therefore, the more common view, and identifying the Ahasuerus and
                    Artaxerxes of Ezra iv. with Cambyses and the pseudo-Smerdis, it remains to be
                    considered if the difference in the names presents any insuperable, or even any
                    serious, objection. Confining the discussion to the subject of the present
                    article (for the otter name see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ahasuerus),</hi> it has
                    been already abundantly evinced that Artaxerxes is a regal name, and was assumed
                    by all who are certainly known to have borne it, in addition to their private
                    and personal designation, on their accession to the regal power. There is no
                    difficulty in supposing that the Magian Gomates, when, in the absence of
                    Cambyses on his Egyptian expedition, he personated Bardiya or Smerdis, the
                    younger son of Cyrus, and usurped the throne, assumed also, like the later
                    usurper Bessus, this as his official name, under which, of course, the public
                    decrees of his administration would be couched, and which would naturally be
                    most current among those who, like the Jews, belonged to the foreign subjects of
                    the Persian monarchy <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Tyrwhitt, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Esther and Ahasuerus,</hi> p. 333). Nor are we destitute of express though
                    somewhat obscure testimony to the fact. Two other names are found applied in the
                    classical writers to the pseudo-Smerdis. He is called Tanyoxares by Xenophon <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gyrop.,</hi> viii, 7) and by Ctesias <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pers.,</hi> 8-13), and Oropastes by Justin (i. 9). The latter, as Ewald <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gesch. Israels,</hi> iv. p. 118) suggests, may well be supposed
                    to be a corruption derived from Ortosastes, which is an exact reproduction of
                    the Hebrew form of the name Artaxerxes <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> the rendering
                    Αp0ασασ0α in the LXX., Ezra iv. 7, &amp;c.) In regard to this identification two
                    additional and final remarks are to be made. On the one hand, it is unreasonable
                    to allege, as Keil and others do, by way of objection, that the reign of the
                    pseudo-Smerdis was too short (only seven months) to allow of representations
                    being made to his court, and an answer returned in reference to affairs at
                    Jerusalem. It is to be taken into account that the enemies of the Jews had begun
                    their machinations in the time of his predecessor, and their agents were
                    doubtless present in the Persian capital when the new king ascended the throne,
                    ready to avail themselves of the new opportunity. On the other hand, all that is
                    known of the policy of the usurper is in excellent harmony with the part
                    ascribed to him by the sacred writer. Belonging to the Magian tribe, and ruling,
                    probably, in the interest of Median as opposed to Persian supremacy, he
                    naturally set himself to subvert the policy of Cyrus; and we have express and
                    indisputable testimony, in the elaborate inscription at Behistun engraved by the
                    authority of his successor Darius, that his procedure, especially in regard to
                    religious interests, was of the nature of a revolution, which the son of
                    Hystaspes glories in having arrested and reversed <hi rend="italic">(of.</hi>

                <p>In the Sassanian dynasty there are three royal personages bearing the name now in
                    question :—(1.) The founder of the dynasty is called Artaxerxes, or Ardeshir,
                    surnamed Babegan, from the name of his father Babek. He was probably tributary
                    king of Persia under the Parthian rule, and he revolted against Artabanus, king
                    of Parthia, about 220 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Artabanus was defeated and
                    slain in a great battle in the plain of Hormuz, and Artaxerxes succeeded in
                    establishing the ascendency of Persia, and his own position as independent
                    sovereign in 226 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (see Malcolm, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Artaxerxes, belonging to the dynasty of the Sassanides, reigned for four years,
                    381-385 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; and (3.) immediately before the
                    Mahometan conquest, an infant prince was raised to the throne by the same name,
                    and nominally occupied it for five months, 629 A.D. For further details
