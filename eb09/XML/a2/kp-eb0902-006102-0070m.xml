                    carried on, while there is a considerable trade w ith England, the chief exports
                    being cured hams, cattle, sheep, and grain. The town, which is governed by a
                    provost and fourteen councillors, including three bailies, unites with Dumfries,
                    Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben, and Sanquhar, in returning one member to parliament.
                    In 1871 the population of the royal burgh was 4174, of the parliamentary,
                    3172.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Annan,</hi> a river rising near the source of the Tweed, in
                    the range of hills that lies on the confines of the counties of Dumfries,
                    Lanark, Peebles, and Selkirk. About two miles beyond Moffat it receives two
                    large tributaries, —-the Moffat Water, which flows westward from Loch Skene, a
                    mountain lake in the north-eastern corner of Dumfriesshire, and the Evan Water,
                    which flows eastward from the upper part of Lanarkshire. The Annan has a total
                    length of about 40 miles, and below its junction with the Moffat and the Evan it
                    is joined by the Kennel Water from the west and the Dryfe Water from the east.
                    Annandale was once the name of a stewartry which comprehended a large portion of
                    Dumfriesshire.</p>
                <p>. ANNAPOLIS, a seaport town of the United States, the capital of Maryland,
                    situated on the Severn, about 2 miles from its mouth in Chesapeake Bay, and
                    about 25 in a direct line from Washington, with which it is connected by
                    railway. It is a neat, regularly-built place, but the trade which at one time
                    seemed likely to enrich it has been transferred almost entirely to Baltimore,
                    and Annapolis is now little more than the political capital of the state. It
                    contains handsome Government buildings, a college, and the United States Naval
                    Academy, which was established at Annapolis in 1845, and was for a time removed
                    to Newport, Rhode Island. Providence, as Annapolis was first called, was founded
                    in 1649, but it did not get a charter until 1708, when it also received its
                    present name in honour of Queen Anne. It has been the seat of government since
                    1689. Population in 1870, 5744.</p>
