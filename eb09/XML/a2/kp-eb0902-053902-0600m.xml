                    xxvii. 21, &lt;fcc.), under conditions of time and place divinely appointed
                    (Exod. xx. 23, 24), and the idea of purely spiritual approach to God without any
                    local and symboh-cal point of <hi rend="italic">rapport</hi> between heaven and
                    earth was reserved for the New Testament (John iv. 21, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ffi)</hi> In accordance with this view, certain fixed sanctuaries, consecrated
                    by former revelations, were fit places for man to draw near to God. But the
                    constant presence of God with the nation in its wanderings could not be realised
                    without a portable sanctuary, the central point of which was very fitly the
                    chest in which was contained the “revelation” (Exod. XXV. 16, xl. 20), that is,
                    the tables of stone with the ten commandments (Exod. xxxi. 18; Deut. x. 5),
                    which formed the basis of the covenant. This meaning of the ark is symbolically
                    expressed by the addition of an upper piece called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >kapporeth</hi> (E.V. mercy-seat), which was wholly of gold, and surmounted by
                    two cherubim or symbolical winged figures, which, in the Old Testament, are
                    always associated with the idea of local manifestations of the God who, though
                    inaccessible to man, yet reveals himself to him. The space above the <hi
                    rend="italic">kapp6reth</hi> and between the cherubim was conceived as the point
                    of meeting between God and man (Exod. xxv. 22: Lev. xvi. 2); and the name <hi
                    rend="italic">kapp6reth,</hi> which has been very variously interpreted, is
                    probably derived from the atoning ordinances through which alone the high
                    priest, as the people’s representative, ventured to come face to face with this
                    awful spot (Lev. xvi.)</p>
                <p>The ark contained nothing but the tables of the law, 1 Kings viii. 9.. That the
                    pot of manna and Aaron’s rod were also contained in it is an opinion resting on
                    Heb. ix. 4, and Rabbinical tradition, but quite without evidence from the Old
                    Testament (Exod. xvi. 33; Num. xvii. 10). That the presence of God to his people
                    above the <hi rend="italic">kαpp0reih</hi> was marked not only by artificial
                    symbols, but by a miraculous cloud, is not certainly taught in Lev. xvi. 2,
                    where the cloud is, according to many interpreters, the incense cloud of verse
                    13.</p>
                <p>As the permanent pledge of God’s gracious presence, the ark preceded the people
                    in their march, and led them on to victory (Num. x. 33-36). During the conquest
                    of Canaan it stood in the headquarters of the invaders, first at Gilgal, and
                    then at Shiloh, nor does it appear to have ceased to move from place to place
                    during the insecure period of the Judges (compare 2 Sam. vii. 6 with 1 Chron.
                    xvii. 5), though the pre-eminence of the tribe of Ephraim seems to have kept it
                    for the most part within their territory. At the close of this period we find it
                    established in Shiloh. But the old tradition, that the ark is essentially the
                    sanctuary of the armed host of Israel, with the Levites for its body guard, was
                    not yet extinct, and it was brought into the field and captured by the
                    Philistines in the fatal battle of Ebenezer, which broke the supremacy of
                    Ephraim (1 Sam. iv.) Though soon restored by the Philistines who, smitten by a
                    plague, feared to retain it, the ark could not be replaced in the central
                    sanctuary, which had probably been destroyed in the war, and it remained in
                    obscurity till David brought it to Zion, and again gave to the nation a
                    religious as well as a political centre. Even in David’s time the ark was
                    carried into the field by the armies of Israel (2 Sam. xi. 11); but the king,
                    who had himself so long maintained his religious life in banishment from the
                    national sanctuaries, was the first clearly to express the conception, that
                    God’s help could reach forth to those who were far from Zion without any
                    material pledge (2 Sam. xv. 25; compare Psalm iii. 4, and the idea of a heavenly
                    temple, Psalm xviii.) So soon as this idea was reached, the importance of the
                    ark (which ceased to be carried beyond the temple) was lost in the gradually
                    increasing weight laid on the fixed sanctuary of Zion. Probably it was
                    altogether lost in the counterreformation of Manasseh, for soon after, in the
                    beginning of the reign of Josiah, Jeremiah (iii. 16) speaks of it as missing and
                    anxiously sought for, though 2 Chron. xxxv. 3 seems to imply that it was
                    subsequently restored. But Jeremiah teaches that the religious significance of
                    Jerusalem is quite independent of this symbol, and the wild legends of its
                    preservation at the taking of Jerusalem (2 Mac. ii. and elsewhere) only show
                    that the popular mind was unable to share the view that the ark was now an
                    obsolete relic. More poetical is the tradition that the ark was raised to
                    heaven, there to remain till the coming of the Messiah, which embodies the
                    spiritual idea that a heavenly pledge of God’s covenant faithfulness had
                    superseded the earthly symbol. Compare with this Rev. xi. 19. (Ample traditional
                    material will be found in the younger Buxtorf’s dissertation <hi rend="italic"
