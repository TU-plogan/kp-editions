                    view of obtaining initiation into religious mysteries. On a journey to
                    Alexandria he fell sick at Oea (Tripoli), and was received into the house of
                    Sicinius Pontianus, a former fellow-student. The widowed mother of Pontianus,
                    Puden-tilla, became enamoured of the handsome young philosopher, who, at her
                    son’s request, as he affirms, consented to marry her. The lady’s wealth rendered
                    this step distasteful to the other members of her family, by whom, after the
                    premature death of Pontianus, Apuleius was indicted on a charge of having gained
                    her affections by magical arts. He easily established his innocence, and his
                    spirited, highly entertaining, but inordinately long defence <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Apologia, sive de</hi><hi rend="italic">Magia),</hi> is our principal
                    authority for his biography. From allusions in his subsequent writings, and the
                    mention of him by St Augustine, we gather that the remainder of his prosperous
                    life was devoted to literature and philosophy; that he exercised the priestly
                    office, and frequently declaimed in public; and that statues were erected in his
                    honour by Carthage and other cities. Many errors have found their way into his
                    biography, from the supposition of his identity to a certain extent with Lucius,
                    the hero of his romance. The contrary appears from the introduction of Lucius as
                    a Greek, who professes to have only with great difficulty acquired Latin,
                    Apuleius’s own mother tongue. Lucius also takes a vow of poverty and chastity,
                    which must have been but ill observed by the spouse of the opulent and amorous
                    Pudentilla.</p>
                <p>There is little of Apuleius’s own invention in the work on which his fame
                    principally rests. The <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Golden Ass</hi> (which latter title seems not to be the author’s own, but to
                    have been bestowed in compliment), was founded on a narrative in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0229-0216"/> Lucius of Patrae, a work extant in the time of
                    Photius. From Photius’s account (impugned however by Wieland and P. L. Courier),
                    this book would seem to have consisted of a collection of marvellous stories,
                    related in an inartistic fashion, and in perfect good faith. The literary
                    capabilities of this particular narrative attracted the attention of Apuleius’s
                    contemporary, Lucian, who proceeded to work it up in his own manner, adhering,
                    as Photius seems to indicate, very closely to the original, but giving it a
                    comic and satiric turn. Apuleius followed this rifacimento, making it, however,
                    the groundwork of an elaborate romance, interspersed with numerous episodes, of
                    which the beautiful story of Cupid and Psyche is the most celebrated, and
                    altering the denouement to suit the religious revival of which he was an
                    apostle. There is no reason to conclude with Warburton, that he wrote in direct
                    antagonism to Christianity <hi rend="italic">; or</hi> with Thomas Taylor, that
                    “his intention was to show that the man who gives himself to a voluptuous life
                    becomes a beast.” The book is, nevertheless, a remarkable illustration of the
                    contemporary reaction against a period of scepticism, of the general appetite
                    for miracle and magic, and of the influx of Oriental and Egyptian ideas into the
                    old theology. It is also composed with a well-marked literary aim, defined by
                    Kretzschmann as the emulation of the Greek sophists, and the transplantation of
                    their <hi rend="italic">tours deforce</hi> into the Latin language. Nothing,
                    indeed, is more characteristic of Apuleius than his versatility, unless that it
                    be his ostentation and self-confidence in the display of it. The dignified, the
                    ludicrous, the voluptuous, the horrible, succeed each other with bewildering
                    rapidity; fancy and feeling are everywhere apparent, but not less so
                    affectation, meretricious ornament, and that effort to say everything finely
                    which prevents anything being said well. The Latinity has a strong African
                    colouring, and is crammed with obsolete words, agreeably to the taste of the
                    time. Few books accordingly suffer less by translation. When these defects are
                    mitigated or overlooked, the <hi rend="italic">Golden Ass</hi> will be
                    pronounced a most successful work, original in treatment though not in
                    invention, invaluable as an illustration of ancient manners, and full of
                    entertainment from beginning to end. The most famous and poetically beautiful
                    portion is the episode of Cupid and Psyche, adapted from a popular legend of
                    which traces are found in most fairy mythologies, which explains the seeming
                    incongruity of its being placed in the mouth of an old hag. As observed by
                    Friedländer, this discriminating recognition of the beauty of a wild flower of
                    folk lore is as much to the credit of Apuleius’s taste and feeling as the
                    invention of it could have been to his imagination. The allegorical purport he
                    has infused into it is his own, and entirely in the spirit of the Platonic
                    philosophy. Don Quixote’s adventure with the wineskins, and Gil Bias’s captivity
                    among the robbers, are palpably borrowed from Apuleius; and several of his
                    humorous episodes, probably current as popular stories long before his time,
                    reappear in Boccaccio.</p>
                <p>Of Apuleius’s other writings, the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> has been already
                    mentioned. The <hi rend="italic">Florida</hi> are a collection of excerpts from
                    his declamations, ingenious but highly affected, and in general perfect examples
                    of the sophistical art. of saying nothing with emphasis. The pleasing little
                    tract <hi rend="italic">On the God of Socrates</hi> expounds the Platonic
                    doctrine of beneficent daemons. Two books on Plato treat of his life, and his
                    physical and ethical philosophy; a third, treating of logic, is generally
                    considered spurious. Apuleius informs us that he had also composed numerous
                    poems in almost all possible styles, and several works on natural history, some
                    in Greek. In the preparation of these he seems to have attended more closely to
                    actual anatomical research than was customary with ancient naturalists.</p>
                <p>The character of Apuleius, as delineated by himself, is attractive; he appears
                    vehement and passionate, but devoid of rancour; enterprising, munificent,
                    genial, and an enthusiast for the beautiful and good. His vanity and love of
                    display are conspicuous, but are extenuated by a genuine thirst for knowledge,
                    and a surprising versatility of attainments. His place in letters is
                    accidentally more important than his genius strictly entitles him to hold. He is
                    the only extant example in Latin literature of an accomplished sophist in the
                    good sense of the term. The loss of other ancient romances has secured him a
                    peculiar influence on modem fiction; while his chronological position in a
                    transitional period renders him at once the evening star of the Platonic, and
                    the morning star of the Neoplatonic philosophy.</p>
                <p>The most complete edition of Apuleius is Oudendorp’s (Lugd. Bat. 1786-1823); the
                    best modem edition is Hildebrand’s (Leipsic, 1842). The translations and
                    imitations of the <hi rend="italic">Golden Ass</hi> in modern languages are
                    innumerable, The episode of Psyche has afforded the subject of a drama to Thomas
                    Heywood, and of narrative poems to Shakerley Marmion, and Mrs Tighe. There are
                    good English versions by Sir G. Head, and in Bohn’s Classical Library. The style
                    oi Apuleius has been thoroughly investigated by L. Kretzschmann, <hi
