                <p>THE Arachnida, or, popularly speaking, the Spiders -and their allied forms—from
                    <hi rend="italic">αράχνη,</hi> a spider, and eιδos, the form or outward
                    appearance—constitute a well-defined group within the great branch “Articulata”
                    of the animal kingdom, though on one side its boundary lines melt almost
                    insensibly into the Annelides, through the family of acarids— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pentastonιides.</hi> Linnaeus and others of the older systema-tists included
                    all Arachnids (as then recognised) under the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insecta,</hi> Lamarck first separating them into a distinct class. A few
                    general remarks, therefore, on the branch <hi rend="italic">Articulata,</hi> and
                    its subordinate groups, may be useful, to show the general relations of that
                    under consideration.</p>
                <p>As distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> the animals of the
                    branch <hi rend="italic">Articulata</hi> may be characterised generally as
                    having (besides the marked and uniformly different position of the chief organ
                    of circulation and the nervous chords) an external skeleton, the different parts
                    of which, of more or less solid consistency, are articulated, or jointed to each
                    other, and contain within their hollows the vital and other organs. Internally,
                    threads of nervous matter, springing from enlargements or knots <hi
                    rend="italic">(ganglia)</hi> upon two or more central longitudinal nervous
                    chords on the ventral side of the body traverse the different parts of it; these
                    chords, however, end in no <hi rend="italic">one</hi> special mass,
                    corresponding to the brain in the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata;</hi> and the
                    nervous systems composed by these ganglia vary considerably in their special
                    structure and arrangement in the different subordinate groups.</p>
                <p>This being the distinctive <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> of structure in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Articulata,</hi> a review of the whole group shows us that this
                    plan is carried out in two well-marked leading ways—first, <hi rend="italic"
                    >without,</hi> and secondly, <hi rend="italic">with, articulated legs,</hi> or
                    organs of locomotion and touch. Those <hi rend="italic">without</hi> articulated
                    limbs constitute the <hi rend="italic">Annelides</hi> of Lamarck, which, for our
                    present purpose, it is sufficient to characterise as having the articulate plan
                    of structure carried out in the general form of a more or less cylindrical,
                    lengthened body, composed of a number of rings, segments, or transverse folds,
                    of which the first forms the head, <hi rend="italic">but destitute of
                    articulated limbs.</hi> Those ' <hi rend="italic">τoith</hi> articulated legs
                    constitute the <hi rend="italic">Condylopa</hi> of Latreille, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta</hi> of Linnaeus; but the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insecta</hi> being now in general use to define a subordinate group, it will be
                    better to adopt here the name given by Latreille. In the “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Condylopa,’’</hi> then, the articulated plan of structure is carried out in the
                    form of a more or less hard body composed of different pieces, of which one,
                    two, three, or more, are generally <hi rend="italic">leading ones;</hi> to this
                    body (in general to the anterior portion of it) are attached <hi rend="italic"
                    >articulate organs of locomotion</hi> various in number, but never, or at least
                    very rarely, less than six. The organs of sight (when present) are always in the
                    head, and vary in number, position, and kind. To these two leading divisions of
                    the branch Articulata—the <hi rend="italic">Annelides</hi> of Lamarck, and <hi
                    rend="italic">the Condylopa</hi> of Latreille—we may give the designation of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Classes,</hi> since they are each respectively composed of
                    animals which thus primarily and markedly differ in the way in which their
                    common articulate plan of structure is carried out</p>
                <p>Leaving now the class Annelides, to which has been given the name “Anarthropoda,”
                    and confining our attention to the “Condylopa,” or “Condylopoda” (equivalent to
                    the “Arthropoda” of more modern authors), we find that the latter contains the
                    four following groups— <hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Insecta</hi><hi rend="italic">f “Myriapoda,” “Arachnida,”</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">“Crustacea.”</hi></p>
                <p>These all agree in the way in which, as above explained, their <hi rend="italic"
                    >general articulated plan of structure is carried out,</hi> but they differ in
                    the <hi rend="italic">f urther modifications of this plan,</hi> that is to say,
                    in the number, division, and size (both absolute and relative) of the different
                    articulations of the body (including the organs of locomotion, of manducation,
                    and of touch), and in the respective value and relation of these to each other,
                    as well as in the modifications of their respiratory and other internal systems,
                    and also in other important points. Differing thus from each other, these four
                    groups, usually (three at least of them) ranked as distinct classes, yet appear
                    to be entitled only to the rank of sub-classes, being each merely an equally
                    subordinate group of the class “Condylopoda."</p>
                <p>The four sub-classes of Condylopoda (or articulate-legged Annulosa) may be
                    separately and briefly characterised thus :— Sub-class I.— <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Insecta</hi>: subject in general to metamorphosis, more or less complete,
                    during the progress to maturity; organs of locomotion, six; body divided into
                    three principal parts— <hi rend="italic">car&gt;ut, thorax,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">abdomen;</hi> respiration wholly tracheal.</p>
                <p>Sub-class II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Myriapoda</hi>: not subject to metamorphosis,
                    properly so-called; organs of locomotion above six in number (twenty-four and
                    more) developed by degrees, and affixed to the abdominal as well as to the other
                    (numerous) segments into which the body is divided. Although occasionally some
                    of the anterior segments coalesce, and the head is stated to be formed by five
                    or more modified segments, yet no one or more parts of the body can be said to
                    be principal ones; respiration is tracheal.</p>
                <p>Sub-class III.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnida</hi>: not subject to
                    metamorphosis, properly so-called, though, as with the Myriapoda, some portions
                    of structure among certain acarids, and to a small extent even among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Araneidea,</hi> are progressively developed at the various
                    moultings of the skin. Organs of locomotion, eight; body in general divided into
                    <hi rend="italic">two</hi> principal parts, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cephalo-thorax</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abdomen;</hi> but where (as in some
                    groups) the abdomen is divided into more or less distinct segments no organs of
                    locomotion are ever attached to them; respiration, where distinct organs exist,
                    is either tracheal, pulmo-branchial, or the two coexistent.</p>
                <p>Sub-class IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Crustacea:</hi> without metamorphosis; organs
                    of locomotion various in number (not less than eight or ten), and attached to
                    some or all of the many segments, abdominal as well as others, into which the
                    body is divided; although in numbers of crustaceans no one part of the body can
                    be called a principal part, yet in some very large and leading groups, the
                    portion covered by the carapace (corresponding to the cephalo-thorax in
                    Arachnids) may well be termed the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> principal part; the
                    abdomen being in this case more or less rudimentary or subordinate. Respiration
                    in the Crustacea, where distinct organs are present, is branchial.</p>
                <p>In this view the following diagram shows the relative positions of the several
                    leading groups of the Articulata:—</p>

                <p>In this diagram the Myriapoda are placed, in the position ordinarily assigned to
                    them, between the Insects and Arachnids; but perhaps a more natural position
                    would be after the Crustacea, for they appear to connect the Insecta and
                    Crustacea more than they do the Insecta and Arachnida. The point, however, of
                    the special position of any large group in a linear series is tolerably
                    unimportant. A linear arrangement is of course the only one possible on paper,
                    but it cannot express the numerous cross relationships that become evident when
                    the affinities of special groups are closely studied. By placing the Myriapoda
                    after the Crustaceans, we seem to get an ascending series in respect to the
                    organe of locomotion: in the <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> six—always attached
                    to the thoracic segments; in the <hi rend="italic">Arachnida,</hi> eight—almost
                    always attached to the thoracic segments; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crustacea,</hi> eight, ten, and upwards—frequently attached to the abdominal as
                    well as to the thoracic segments; in the <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda,</hi>
                    twenty-four and more—always attached to the abdominal as well as other segments.
                    The relation of the Myriapoda to the Crustacea through the attachment of limbs
                    to the abdominal segments is thus expressed; and by the meeting of the two ends
                    of the line, the always acknowledged affinity of the former to the Insecta is
                    also expressed.</p>
                <p>Having thus briefly explained the most obvious relationships of the Arachnida,
                    let us now proceed to a more detailed, though still general, diagnosis of this
                    group. And first, in respect to their <hi rend="italic">external
                    organisation,</hi> Arachnids are articulate animals,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Embryology shows that the first pair of legs
                    in arachnids are homologous to the labial palpi of insects (Claparède, <hi
                    rend="italic">I. c. post).</hi> This is strictly true according to their use in
                    one order—Thelyphonidea; and in many of the Araneidea also these legs are
                    chiefly used for feeling and exploring the obstacles in their way.</p></note>
                    with eight articulated legs, each in general consisting of seven joints; the
                    head and thorax are soldered together into one piece (cephalo-thorax), from
                    which with few exceptions the legs invariably spring. In one group of the
                    Arachnida <hi rend="italic">(Solpugidea)</hi> the cephalothorax is separately
                    segmented, as it is also in one family of the <hi rend="italic">Thelyphonvdea
                    (Tartarides) ∙,</hi> the rest of the body forms also one more or less
                    homogeneous piece (abdomen). The abdomen is always more or less closely attached
                    to the cephalo-thorax; in some instances it is soldered to the thorax, and forms
                    with it one undivided piece, in other cases it is only joined to it by a narrow
                    pedicle. At times, also, the abdomen constitutes a simple unsegmented portion,
                    at other times a segmented or annulate portion of the body, occasionally, as in
                    the true scorpions, prolonged into a segmented tail: in one small but very
                    distinct group <hi rend="italic">tfΓhelyphonidea),</hi> the abdomen is prolonged
                    into either a simple button, a short jointed, or a more or less long setiform
                    tail · in another large group <hi rend="italic">(Araneidea)</hi> the abdomen
                    terminates with organs (spinners and spinnerets) for spinning threads. The <hi
                    rend="italic">eyes</hi> (when present) are simple, always sessile, and placed on
                    the fore part of the cephalothorax; they seem to represent the simple ocelli of
                    the Insecta; the large compound eyes of that order having here no
                    representation, the caput of Arachnids appearing to begin at a point posterior
                    to that which bears the antennae and compound eyes of insects. In Arachnida the
                    number of eyes varies from two to twelve. In front of and articulated beneath
                    the fore part of the cephalo-thorax, and moving in different planes in different
                    groups, are two independent, variously modified, organs for seizing and
                    compressing the insects or other substances on which Arachnids in general prey;
                    these organs are often called mandibles, but more generally, and very
                    appropriately, <hi rend="italic">falces</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> these are
                    considered by some systematists to be the true homologues of the antennae<note

                    derived from those portions of the insect organisation by long and unceasing

                    instance) is compared with that of a coleopterous or hymenopterous insect, in
                    which the mandibles are well developed, there seems far more reason to conclude
                    that the <hi rend="italic">antennae</hi> of the insect <hi rend="italic">have no
                    homologue at all in the Arachnid</hi> (Claparède, <hi rend="italic">l.c.
                    post),</hi> but that the falces of the latter are the true representatives of
                    the mandibles of the former. Behind the falces (and also used in manducation)
                    are two other large movable portions of structure called maxillae; these vary in
                    shape and size, and form in fact lateral and hinder boundaries to the mouth, as
                    well as an apparatus for comminuting and squeezing the food substances; from
                    each of these maxillae, on the outer side, springs a palpus of four or five
                    joints, varying in structure and use. Between the maxillae most Arachnids have
                    also a fixed piece <hi rend="italic">(labium)</hi> of various form, completing
                    the hinder limits of the mouth organs, and in some (perhaps in most) there is,
                    within the parts already named, another portion <hi rend="italic">(tongue),</hi>
                    not yet sufficiently observed either in regard to its form or use, but probably
                    acting so as to hinder choking. In some Arachni-dans these different parts of
                    the mouth are soldered together and form a tolerably simple sucking apparatus,
                    analogous to the mouth of some insects <hi rend="italic">(Hemiptera,</hi>
                    &amp;c.) As observed above, Arachnids are not, in a proper sense, subject to
                    metamorphosis: in most of them there is little real change after they leave the
                    egg; though, in some of the lowest forms, indeed, there are after-changes by
                    moultings of the skin, which approach the incomplete metamorphoses of some
                    insects.</p>
                <p>With respect to the <hi rend="italic">internal organisation</hi> of the
                    Arachnida, it might perhaps be enough here to refer to the more detailed
                    accounts given further on, where the separate <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> are
                    under consideration; but the following summary will probably make our general
                    view of the whole sub-class more complete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Muscular System.</hi> —Of this it is enough to say that it is
                    similar to that of the rest of the Articulata, consisting of flexor and extensor
                    muscles, situated within the hollows of the limbs, besides groups of fibres by
                    which the epidermis and parts within it are connected and held together. On the
                    outer surface these groups frequently show, at their points of union, boss-like
                    marks or foveae, or impressed spots of various forms and sizes, often presenting
                    by their position distinctive peculiarities of form; it is probable that many
                    others of the external specific.markings are dependent on the course and
                    position of the muscular fibres, as well as of the heart and other organs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Circulatory System.—</hi> The vital fluid is circulated by
                    means of an elongated muscular vessel or heart, varying in form, and, instead of
                    being placed, as in the Vertebrata, on the ventral side of the body, extending
                    along the back of the abdomen. This vessel is often divided into chambers<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>L. Dufour <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Savants étrangers,</hi> xiv. pp. 594-609) controverts this in respect to the
                    Scorpionides, and apparently with success, establishing the fact of the dorsal
                    vessel being simple and unchambered.</p></note> or compartments by valves,
                    having also valvular orifices on its upper side for the flowing in of the fluid
                    (Newport), and giving off vessels (arteries) for its distribution to the rest of
                    the body. In the lower forms, however, of Arachnids (among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aca-ridea)</hi> no such principal muscular vessel is found, the vital fluid
                    being in such cases supposed to circulate generally in the body, and to be
                    distributed irregularly into different portions by the muscular movements of the
                    intestinal canal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Respiratory System.—</hi> Arachnids breathe by means of <hi
                    rend="italic">tracheae</hi> (spiracular tubes, as in the Insecta), as well as by
                    <hi rend="italic">pulmo-branchiae,</hi> said to be a kind of compound of the
                    gill of fish and the lung of mammals, though in reality there seems better
                    reason, as we shall see further on (p. 293), to consider the pulmo-branchiae as
                    merely peculiarly modified tracheae; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n292/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0292-0273"/> both these organs have external orifices
                    (stigmata) variously situated, but commonly in some part of the abdomen. In some
                    Arachnids (certain groups of the <hi rend="italic">Araneidea)</hi> respiration
                    is effected by both of the above organs; while in others (certain of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acaridea)</hi> no distinct organs of respiration exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Digestive System.—</hi> Digestion is effected by a simple
                    alimentary tube or canal running from the mouth to the anus. This tube is
                    various in its form, as well as in the intestines issuing from it; in some
                    groups, as the <hi rend="italic">Araneidea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acaridea,</hi> the above canal has large lateral caecal appendages; in others
                    <hi rend="italic">(Scorpionides</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thelyphonides)</hi>
                    the alimentary canal has no such lateral enlargements. In some Arachnids there
                    have also been found a liver (or mass of substance in the abdomen exercising the
                    functions of a liver), an organ performing the part of kidneys, and salivary
                    glands, often of large size, while in others no distinct organs of digestion
                    exist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System.—</hi> This consists of ganglia or nerve-knots,
                    formed by enlargements of longitudinal nervous cords (generally two in number),
                    differing in position and in the nerves issuing from them. In one large group
                    <hi rend="italic">(Acaridea)</hi> where the abdomen usurps, as it were, the
                    place of all the rest of the body, there is no longitudinal nerve cord; a single
                    nerve mass occupies the interior of the abdomen, and sends forth nerves to the
                    various surrounding parts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Generative System.—</hi> Generation is effected by two distinct
                    and separate sexes, the single exception known being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tardigrada</hi>, a group of <hi rend="italic">Acaridea</hi> approaching nearly
                    to the Entozoa, and said to be hermaphrodite. In females the parts of generation
                    consist of two sacs (ovaria), one on each side of the alimentary canal. These
                    have a common external orifice (vulva), various in its shape, beneath the
                    anterior extremity of the abdomen; and connected with this opening there is
                    frequently an epigyne, or ovipositor, often of some length, and of
                    characteristic form. In <hi rend="italic">males</hi> (except among the
                    phalangids and scorpions) there is no intromittent organ,—the generative parts
                    consisting of two long tubes, similarly situated to the ovaria in females, in
                    which the seminal fluid is secreted; these tubes end in a simple external, very
                    minute orifice, in a similar situation to the vulva of the female.</p>
                <p>Arachnids are either oviparous or ovo-viviparous. As before observed, they
                    undergo no proper metamorphosis, but as growth takes place there are more or
                    fewer successive moultings of the skin; and complete development of all the
                    parts does not occur until the last moult, when the creature becomes adult, and
                    so fitted to perpetuate its kind.</p>
                <p>With regard to the position held by Arachnids in the great scheme of nature, it
                    seems, from the considerations shortly entered into above, undeniable that they
                    are very closely linked to the rest of the Articulata by much, both of external
                    and internal structure, common to the whole branch. The office they subserve is
                    evidently the keeping down of the superabundant supply of the insect world; some
                    even operating to check the too rapid advance of higher animals.</p>
                <p>Assuming that the operation, in some shape or other, of evolution has brought the
                    different groups of Articulata to the varied forms and conditions they now
                    respectively present, it is plain that the higher, at least, of the arachnidous
                    orders must, in all probability, have been modified from some one or more of the
                    other groups, perhaps in the main from the Insecta and Myriapoda,— certainly not
                    the Insecta, for instance, from the Arachnida. Thus, we should define Arachnids,
                    generally, to be insects modified for the purpose of preying upon their
                    congeners; while some of the lower forms of Arachnids, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Demodex,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tardigrada,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pentastoma,</hi> carry us back to the remote past, before the branch
                    Articulata, in any of its great groups, had attained more than a very slight
                    progress towards its present dignified and highly organised forms.</p>
                <p>The above being a general summary of the external and internal organisation of
                    the Arachnida, an examination of the whole group shows us that their different
                    characters, and the ways in which their articulated plan of structure is carried
                    out, are variously correlated and modified, forming structural complications of
                    several marked kinds, whence we get the different <hi rend="italic">orders,</hi>
                    being the next subordinate groups, into which Arachnids are divided. These <hi
                    rend="italic">orders</hi> are seven in number, and form so many well-defined
                    groups, but of very different extent. Advancing from the more simple to the more
                    highly organised, we begin with the <hi rend="italic">Acaridea,</hi> comprising
                    the mites and ticks, and including also the <hi rend="italic">Tardigradides,
                    Pentastomides,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">Demodex.</hi> The second order
                    is that of the <hi rend="italic">Pycnogonidea,</hi> marine parasites, which, in
                    a certain plane, appear to connect the Acaridea with the next or third order,
                    <hi rend="italic">Phalangidea;</hi> these last are popularly known as
                    “Harvest-men.” Next to them, and forming the fourth order, come the <hi
                    rend="italic">Solpugidea,</hi> a small but very distinct group, constituting a
                    link in one plane between the <hi rend="italic">Phalangidea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Scorpionidea,</hi> which last, including the Chelifers, or False
                    Scorpions, form the fifth order. Not far removed from these is the sixth order,
                    <hi rend="italic">Thelyphonidea,</hi> comprising groups which partake of the
                    characters both of the Scorpionidea and of the next— the seventh and last—order.
                    <hi rend="italic">Araneidea.</hi> or true Sniders.</p>

                <p>The following abstract shows the chief ordinal characters of these seven groups
                    of Arachnids :—</p>
                <p>Order I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Acaridea.</hi> —Cephalo-thorax and abdomen united
                    so as to form one piece, generally without mark of union; palpi and falces
                    variable in structure; the several parts of the mouth often united; legs
                    terminating variously, generally eight in number, sometimes only six in the
                    immature state, and in one or two instances but four, even when adult; eyes,
                    when present, variable in number (2 to 6), and placed on the cephalo-thorax;
                    respiration, when proper organs for it exist, wholly tracheal; nervous matter
                    gathered into one large mass, or ganglion; reproduction ovo-viviparous as well
                    as oviparous. Maturity is reached by quasi, or imperfect, metamorphoses in some
                    of the groups.</p>

                    linear; abdomen rudimentary, forming merely a small terminal segment to the
                    cephalo-thorax; the mouth consisting of the termination of a tubular article
                    forming the head, sometimes accompanied by some more or less distinct parts;
                    legs eight, multi-articulate; in females a supernumerary pair, between the first
                    two and used for bearing ova; organs of respiration, none; metamorphosis
                    imperfect, as in the last order.</p>

                    at the fore part of the head in the medial line; respiration tracheal;
                    legs'terminating with two curved fingers; manner of progressive growth
                    unknown.</p>

                    undivided piece, united to the abdomen throughout its entire breadth; abdomen
                    annulate, prolonged (in one of the families) into a segmented tail, ending with

                    others unknown.</p>
                <p>Order VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Araneidea.</hi> —Cephalo-thorax undivided, but
                    traces of segmentation commonly more or less visible, united to the abdomen by a
                    narrow pedicle; abdomen without segments or annuli, ending with organs for
                    spinning; falees monodactylous; palpi more or less filiform in males, with the
                    last joint more or less complicated in structure, and used in copulation,
                    terminating in females (but not invariably) with a claw or claws, sometimes
                    pectinated; legs terminating with two or three curved claws, and, except the
                    third (which is rarely so), generally more or less pectinated; ganglia two or
                    three in number; respiration tracheal, as well as pulmo-branchia); reproduction
                    oviparous.</p>
                <p>We have thus far obtained a general view of the leading groups of the sub-class
                    Arachnida, both in respect to its relation to collateral groups of equal value,
                    and the relation of its own members to each other, and also a synoptical view of
                    the leading characteristics of the seven orders into which Arachnids may be
                    divided. We now propose to touch shortly, but in greater detail, upon each of
                    those orders, and, as far as our limits will permit, upon the families and
                    genera comprised in them, adding a few general remarks upon each group.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order I.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Acaridea.</hi></p>
                <p>The inclusion in this order of such aberrant forms as Demodex, Pentastoma, and
                    Tardigrada, somewhat destroys its homogeneity; undoubtedly they indicate a
                    passage from the Annelides (Anarthropoda) to the Arthropoda, but whether it
                    would not be more consistent with a strict scientific method to separate the two
                    latter, at least, from the Acaridea, and make each the type of a distinct order,
                    is a point for the future consideration of systematists. At present the balance
                    of opinion appears to be for including them as the lowest transitional forms of
                    the lowest order of Arachnids. With regard to the position of Tardigrada, see
                    Packard’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to the Study of Insects,</hi> p. 668, where

                <p>Owing to the excessively small size of most of the Acaridea, and their obscure
                    mode of existence, much of their economy and internal structure is yet unknown.
                    The following is an endeavour to present their characters in somewhat greater
                    detail than in the short abstract given above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Structure.</hi> —In their general form the Acaridea
                    are more or less round, oblong, or oval; the integument in some is soft, in
                    others coriaceous, and some are quite hard, like a Coleopterous insect.</p>
                <p>The cephalo-thorax and abdomen are consolidated into one piece devoid of
                    articulations; not only is the head, as in other Arachnids, soldered to the
                    thorax, but the portion (cephalo-thorax) formed by this union is generally
                    joined invisibly to the abdomen, which is consequently merged in the general
                    covering of the body. In the family Bdellides, however, and also in some other
                    instances, the junctional points of the different parts of the body are visible
                    enough. The legs are eight in number in the mature acarid, except in Pentastoma,
                    which in a state of maturity has none (fig. 1)— the four abnormal-looking legs
                    visible in the young state disappearing in the adult (fig. 2). Many other
                    Acaridea have six legs only until the last moult, when maturity is attained, one
                    or two, even in the adult state, being said to have but four. Each leg consists
                    in general of seven joints, and the tarsi end, in some, with two movable hooks;
                    in others the tarsus is dilated at its extremity as if for feeling with, while
                    in some of those whose habits are aquatic it is expanded; in short, the
                    structure of this part is very various, and adapted to the habits of the
                    different genera.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ed. 2.</p></note> Dugès distinguishes the different kinds of legs as follows
                    :—1. <hi rend="italic">Palpatorii;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Gressorii;</hi> 3.
                    <hi rend="italic">Remigantes;</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Cursorii; 5.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Textorii;</hi> 6. <hi rend="italic">Carunculati.</hi></p>
                <p>The parts of the <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> consist of two movable pieces, or
                    falees, in front of which is another piece (labium); on each side of the labium
                    is a strong piece (maxilla), and from the outer side of each of the maxillae
                    springs a palpus of four or five joints. The different forms and structure of
                    these parts give good characters for the subordinate divisions of the Acaridea.
                    The mouth parts in the species of Acaridea present greater variety than is to be
                    found in any other order, no doubt owing to the greater variation in their mode
                    of existence. In some instances the falees, maxillae, and labium form, by their
                    union, a sort of tube or proboscis fitted for piercing, holding on to, and
                    sucking the juices of their prey; when not so united, the falees are terminated
                    variously by a didactyle claw, somewhat like the claw of crab, or by a movable
                    fang (sometimes twofold) as in the true spiders (Araneidea), or they consist of
                    “two long styles, which by moving backwards and forwards alternately, perforate
                    the substance of their prey.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> of Acaridians are also variously formed, and,
                    like the legs, have been minutely and well distinguished by Dugès, who (Z.c.)
                    divides them into seven kinds.— 1. <hi rend="italic">Rapaces,</hi> armed with

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> in very many Acaridians are entirely wanting;
                    When present they vary in number, being generally two, four, or six, and are
                    placed on the cephalo-thorax; sometimes, as in the family Hydrachnides, they
                    apparently consist of mere spots of pigment beneath the cuticle; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in some other cases there is but one eye, which is
                    composed of a varying number of small facets.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Internal Structure.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">Organs of
                    Digestion</hi> consist, in many species, of a short intestinal canal, which
                    branches out into lateral caeca, “<hi rend="italic">à sa partie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">stomachale,”</hi> and has an anal orifice on the lower side of the
                    abdomen, more or less near to its posterior extremity (Walck., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ins. Apt.,</hi> iii. 135). The researches of Dujardin <hi rend="italic">{Ann.
                    Sc. Fat.</hi> 1845, tom. iii. p. 14) show in two families (Hydrachnides and
                    Trombidides) a curious modification of these organs. In this, the juices upon
                    which these creatures exist are sucked in, apparently, into simple cavities in
                    the substance of the body; these cavities are without walls of any kind, and
                    from them the juices circulate through the body, and thus form its support.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Respiration</hi> consist generally of tracheae,
                    communicating outwardly with the air by means of minute orifices, “stigmata,”
                    which, in the genus Oribates, are situated between the first and second pairs of
                    legs. In one numerous family <hi rend="italic">{Acarides)</hi> no special organs
                    for breathing exist, respiration being apparently effected by the general
                    surface of the body. Different genera exhibit these two modes of respiration in
                    various forms of union. Μ. Dujardin <hi rend="italic">{l.c.,</hi> p. 17) speaks
                    of tracheae, in the family Trombidides, having an external orifice at the base
                    of the falces on their upper side,—the use of these tracheae being for
                    expiration, while inspiration is performed through the general surface of the
                    body and the plumose hairs attached to it, or, as in the family Hydrachnides, by
                    “stomata,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> apertures covered with very delicate
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nervous System</hi> in Acarids is ganglionic, as in the
                    rest of the Articulata; and, as we should expect from the simple form of the
                    body (occasioned, as we have seen, by the almost complete fusion of the head and
                    thorax in the abdomen) extremely simple. In the families Trombidides and
                    Acarides, and probably in the rest also, the nervous apparatus consists of “one
                    large globular ganglion, from which nervous filaments are given off, both before
                    and behind.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Circulatory System</hi> in the Acaridea too
                    little, apparently, is yet known to make it possible to speak certainly. It is
                    highly improbable but that, in some of the higher groups, distinct organs exist,
                    though such do not yet appear to have been discovered. The results hitherto are
                    negative; no traces of circulatory organs have been found in such of the lower
                    acarids as have been subjected to minute dissection, and hence the supposition
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> that the intestinal canal, by means of muscular
                    movements and contractions, operates in the irregular propulsion of the vital
                    fluid to various parts of the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Reproductive System</hi> of the Acaridea is very simple.
                    The external organs consist of an opening on the ventral surface, generally
                    between the coxae of the hinder pair of legs. Acarids are both oviparous and
                    ovo-viviparous; in the latter case the young are produced through a large
                    orifice or vulva nearly one-third of the length of the body, and closed by two
                    valves. Some are supposed to be hermaphrodite, but this, though true of the
                    Pentastomides, is uncertain in respect to others of this order. Parthenogenesis,
                    however, certainly exists in some species. The ova appear commonly to be
                    produced in the substance of the general tissue of the body without the presence
                    of auy ovarian apparatus with distinct walls; it is certain, however, that
                    ovaries are present in some species—in the family Trombidides, for instance, in
                    which a tubular double branched ovarium was discovered by Dujardin. Some of the
                    Acaridea, as Tetranychus, produce silk, and spin webs, but the silk-secreting
                    organs have yet to be discovered; neither do any external organs, such as
                    spinnerets, appear yet to have been noticed. The development of Acaridians from
                    the egg is a subject of great interest and importance, for which, see
                    Claparède’s <hi rend="italic">Studies on Mites</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Observations.</hi> —Acaridians are universally
                    distributed; they are to be found under stones, dead leaves, or bark of trees,
                    in the ground, in water, in unrefined sugar, upon dried meat, fruits, cheese,
                    and putrid animal matters, upon all of which they feed. Some are parasitic, both
                    externally and internally, in the flesh of different animals, living upon the
                    juices of the creatures they infest. One species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sarcoptes</hi><hi rend="italic">Scabiei,</hi> is the cause of tha disease
                    called the “itch;” another is our troublesome “Harvest-bug.” Some are parasitic
                    upon insects of different kinds; others are said to have been found in the brain
                    and eyes of man. All are small, great numbers almost microscopic; the smaller
                    kinds, particularly of the Acarides, are very difficult to preserve as cabinet
                    objects, and from this, as well as from their minuteness, the order, generally,
                    does not receive that attention to which, from their diversified forms and modes
                    of life, Acaridians are certainly entitled.</p>
                <p>From various considerations of structure, the Acaridea may be divided into ten
                    families, each containing one or more genera. These families may shortly be
                    characterised as follows :—</p>
                <p>Fam. 1. <hi rend="italic">Pentastomides.—</hi> Bodyannulate, vermiform,
                    lancet-shaped; the segments of the cephalo-thorax continuous with the body, and
                    furnished with four strong claws or rudimentary legs; this appears (Rolleston,
                    <hi rend="italic">Forms of Animal Life,</hi> p. 118) to be the larva or immature
                    state, the adult form being destitute of limbs (which are replaced by four
                    hooks—two on each side of the mouth), and reversing the ordinary progress of
                    many acarids, from a fewer to a larger number of legs; organs of respiration and
                    circulation, none (Huxley). On this abnormal·family, of which one genus and
                    eighteen species have been described, see Cobbold’s <hi rend="italic"

                    long and slender; the abdomen drawn out into a wormlike tail; the fore part or
                    cephalo-thorax has in the adult state four pairs of rudimentary legs, in the
                    immature state three pairs. This is one of the lowest forms of acaridians, and
                    presents in its adult state the immature vermiform appearance of the higher

                    are hermaphrodite, and are now generally held to be acarids of a very low grade
                    (Packard, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> p. 66S). Several genera have been
                    characterised. Fig. 4 represents <hi rend="italic">Milnesium</hi><hi

                    of Acaridea.</p>
                <p>The family Acarides have a soft, thin-skinned body, with the thoracic junction
                    often visible; falces either scissor-like or stylifoπu; maxillae obsolete; legs
                    of the two first pairs often widely distant from those of the hinder ones; in
                    some lowly organised forms, “face-mites,” four legs only are found; perhaps
                    these are the immature form of some other species (?); eyes, none. In this
                    family are included the cheese, itch, and sugar mites, with numerous others
                    parasitic on various animals. Some forms, as <hi rend="italic">IIeteropus
                    ventricosus</hi> (Newport), <hi rend="italic">Dermaleichus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Typhlodromus,</hi> particularly in the immature state, exhibit an
                    evident link between the last two families and the higher acarids; on the agamic

                    horny; the thoracic junctions visible; form of the abdomen, round, globular,
                    oval, quadrangular, or hemispherical; palpi, short; maxillae, large and toothed;
                    eyes, almost obsolete; cephalo-thorax, generally with two wing-like projections
                    and two or three cup-shaped pedicellated stigmata on the edge, leading to the
                    respiratory tubes. The Oribatides in general live on vegetable matter, and
                    several genera have been characterised. The immature forms of many species vary
                    greatly from the adults, so that numbers have been described as distinct
                    species. Seeon this family an elaborate paper by Μ. H. Nicolet, in the <hi

                    various animals.</p>
                <p>Fam. 7. <hi rend="italic">Ixodides.—</hi> Body, round, oval, or somewhat oblong,
                    of a leathery consistency; palpi, short, three or four jointed; falces,
                    saw-like, and, with the other parts of the mouth, joining in the formation of a
                    beak for thrusting into and holding on to their prey. Eyes, often obsolete; legs
                    weak. On the generation of Ixodes, see a paper by Prof. Gêné, communicated by A.

                    When gorged with the juices of their victim the abdomen attains an enormous
                    size, and appears almost to obliterate all the rest of the body. In this family
                    are comprised the “ticks” (Ixodes), which are ofteq so tormenting to mankind,
                    and domestic and other animals (figs. 5, 6). Among these ticks is included also
                    the noted genus <hi rend="italic">Argos,</hi> of which a species, <hi

                    two. These acarids are found in salt as well as in fresh water. Some are
                    parasitic, when immature, on water-bugs and water-beetles; others, through life,
                    on the gills of the fresh-water mussel.</p>
                <p>Fam. 9. <hi rend="italic">Trombidides.—</hi> Body, stout, round, or oval, and

                    the two fore pairs. Eyes, two. The colour of the species of this family is
                    generally of a bright red, scarlet, or yellowish. Among them is the red mite,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tetranychus telarius</hi> (Linn.), popularly called the

                <p>The creatures of this order form a small group which it appears now necessary to

                    to some extent still is) a matter of much difference of opinion among
                    naturalists. They seem to connect the more typical Arachnida with the Crustacea,
                    and also to form a passage from the Acaridea to the Phalangidea. It appears,
                    however, when their peculiar structure, both external and internal, is
                    considered, impossible to include them within either of those orders; it is
                    therefore proposed here to constitute them a separate order between the acarids
                    and phalangids. The characters of the order are—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Structure.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Body,</hi>
                    linear, composed of four segments; <hi rend="italic">caput,</hi> tubular, in

                    >legs,</hi> eight (each thoracic segment bearing a pair), very long, and
                    consisting of eight to nine joints, terminating with a claw or claws. In the
                    immature (so-called larval) state the legs are four only in number. The females
                    have a supernumerary pair between those of the first pair, used for carrying the
                    ova. <hi rend="italic">Palpi,</hi> when present, filiform, and composed of five

                <p>With regard to their <hi rend="italic">internal structure,</hi> the Pycnogonidea
                    have a dorsal vessel (circulatory apparatus) divided into chambers, a stomach
                    sending forth caecal prolongations into the legs and palpi, an abdominal
                    intestine with dilated cloaca, and a nervous system, consisting of a cephalic
                    and opththalmic ganglia, closely united together and joined by the cesophagian
                    fillet to the abdominal ganglia, which are four in number, of large size,
                    sessile, and emitting from their lateral extremities nerves into the legs
                    (Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic">Règn.</hi><hi rend="italic">An.,</hi> edition cited
                    <hi rend="italic">post,</hi> pl. 22), but no organs of respiration (Huxley, <hi

                    rend="italic">An., l.c. )</hi></p>
                <p>This order contains but one family, <hi rend="italic">Pycnogonides,</hi> divided
                    into several genera—Pycnogonunι, Phoxichilus, Nymphon, and Ammo-thsi. Some of
                    the species ere parasitic on cetaceous animals, others are found secreted among
                    seaweed along the sea-shore, and feed on small marine animals. Some are British,
                    and others exotic.</p>
                <p>The genera may be thus shortly characterised.</p>
                <p>Genus <hi rend="italic">Pycnogonum</hi> (Brunnich).—Body short and thick; legs,
                    short, strong; without either falces or palpi. The species of this genus are
                    parasitic on the cetacea. Figs. 7, 8, <hi rend="italic">P. littorale</hi>

                    length; falces present, but no palpi.</p>
                <p>Genus <hi rend="italic">Nymphon</hi> (Fabr.)-Besembles Phoxichilus in the narrow
                    body and long legs, which are also slender, as well as in having falces; but in
                    the present genus there are also two palpi, each of five joints. Fig. 9, <hi

                <p>Genus <hi rend="italic">Ammothca</hi> (Leach).— Body short and lather broad; legs
                    long; beak of great size and length; much longer than the falces, which are
                    short. Palj i 9-jointed, the third joint much the longest; terminal tarsal claws
                    double, and of unequal size. Supernumerary legs 9- jointed, and inserted under
                    the first pair of legs behind the beak.</p>

                    >i.c.,</hi> whether Crustacean or Arachnidan, is Dr Anton Dohm, who says in a
                    memoir, “Ueber Entwicklung und Bau der Pycnogoniden” (contained in a
                    publication, entitled <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen über</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Order</hi> Z7Z. <hi rend="smallcaps">—Phalangidea.</hi></p>
                <p>The Phalangidea present a very well defined and compact group, though the
                    transition, in one plane, from the Acaridea, through the families
                    Cyphophthalmides and Trogulides, is tolerably apparent, while in another plane
                    they show evident affinity to the Pycnogonides. The following are more detailed
                    characters of the order :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Structure.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">body</hi> is
                    of a more or less round, oval, or oblong, and sometimes quadrangular form; the
                    integument is either hard and horny, or coriaceous, and generally destitute of
                    hairs, but often tuberculous and armed with spines.</p>
                <p>Thé <hi rend="italic">cephalo-thorax</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> are
                    united throughout their whole breadth, the junction frequently shown by a slight
                    constriction, but always visible from a strongly-marked groove or ridge; the
                    upper side of the cephalothorax, and sometimes of the abdomen, is frequently
                    furnished with spines, sharp teeth, or tubercles. The abdomen is articulate, or
                    segmented in a modified form, from several more or less strongly developed
                    transverse foldings in the epidermis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">mouth organs</hi> are rather complex (fig. 11), consisting
                    of three pairs of maxillae, above which is a <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(languette)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and below the maxillae is
                    a membranous lip <hi rend="italic">(labium).</hi> From the first pair of these
                    maxillae there issue two five-jointed palpi, the intermediate joints of which
                    often exhibit processes or branches, the last or digital joints ending with a
                    claw. The other two pairs of maxillae support the basal joints of the two first
                    pairs of legs. The presence of these supernumerary, or crural, maxillae strongly
                    supports the idea long since advanced by Savigny and others, that the palpi are
                    but modified legs (see, however, note 1, p. 272 <hi rend="italic">supra);</hi>
                    the same idea being also raised in regard to the Thcly-phonidea and Solpugidea
                    by the use as palpi of the first pair of legs, which are in fact completely
                    palpifoπn, and differ markedly from the rest in their structure. Abo^e these
                    parts, directly in front of the upper extremity of the cephalo-thorax, are two
                    <hi rend="italic">falces,</hi> each of which consists of two, or (in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyphophthalmides,</hi> G. Joseph) three joints; <pb break="no"

                    or pair of pincers, formed by a movable claw acting in opposition to a fixed
                    one.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">falces</hi> vary greatly in their size and development. The
                    terminal joint is sometimes articulated to the basal one at the extremity of its
                    longer axis or at its end; at other times it is attached by its shorter axis, or
                    more or less near the middle. In some species they are furnished with processes
                    or horny prolongations, differing in size and form in different species; this
                    is, however, only a modification of the last mentioned mode of articulation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> are, in most species, very long and slender; in
                    some groups they are, however, shorter and stronger, while in others they are of
                    extreme length and tenuity. They are eight in number; the seven normal joints,
                    of which each is composed, may be more properly described as consisting of five
                    invariable and two variable ones; the sixth (or metatarsus) being divided into
                    several immovable divisions, and the seventh (or tarsus) subdivided into a
                    greater or less number of minute movable articulations, the terminal one
                    furnished with one or two fine claws. The legs are often armed (some, at least,
                    of their joints) with strong spines and spiny processes; this is particularly
                    the case in the family Gonylep tides. The first joint (coxa) of each leg is
                    immovable, being fixed to the side and under part of the cephalo-thorax. Between
                    the fixed (or basal) joints of the legs is an oblong, or at times somewhat
                    obtusely triangular, <hi rend="italic">sternal plate,</hi> divided at its base

                    beneath it is concealed (according to the sex) the penis of the male, or the
                    ovipositor of the female; in some species of Phalangides these organs are of
                    great length and varied in form; this sternal plate forms the lower side of the
                    cephalo-thorax. The <hi rend="italic">eyes,</hi> two or eight<note

                    System.—</hi> Every one who has seen the mode in which the Phalangides run would
                    naturally suppose that the muscles required to keep the body raised and balanced
                    between their long slender legs in rapid course must be exceedingly strong; and
                    this is found to be the case. The muscles are of large size, consisting of
                    numerous strong “fasciculi,” which arise from the interior of the basal joints
                    (coxae) of the legs, and, almost entirely filling up their hollows, pass on into
                    the next joint (trochanter), and so on to the end of the second part of the
                    tibiae; thence two long delicate tendons, continuing forwards, traverse the
                    whole length of the tarsal joints, running along their under surface. The
                    muscles by which the falces and palpi are worked consist of an <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Organs of Digestion.—</hi> These consist of a simple
                    longitudinal pouch forming the stomach or main intestinal canal, contracted at
                    each end, enlarged in the middle, and giving off on all sides numerous lateral
                    pouches or caeca of different sizes, to the number, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalangium opilio</hi> (Latr.), of thirty. These are minutely detailed by Tulk,
                    who divides them into—(1), those on the dorsal surface of the main canal; (2),
                    those on its ventral surface; (3), those on its sides. The pharyngeal tube and
                    oesophageal canal are modified so as to be qualified not only for the passage of
                    simple fluids, but also for solid substances; these first, ∣however, having
                    undergone a process of quasi-mastication by means of the external parts of the
                    mouth. At the opposite end of the alimentary canal a simple, short intestine
                    connects it with the anus, the external aperture of which is situated at the
                    hinder extremity of the abdomen. With regard to the office of the lateral caeca,
                    an examination of their contents has led to the suggestion that they secrete a
                    peculiar granular substance, which is thence discharged into the stomach, and
                    “agglutinates the particles of food together,” covering them with a membranous
                    integument which serves to protect the delicate coats of the intestine from
                    laceration by the sharp and spiny nature of their food-contents (Tulk, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.</hi> p. 248). Biliary tubes have been described by
                    Treviranus; but it seems probable that the anterioι pair of these, at least, are
                    tracheae connected with the stigmata or each side of the fore margin of the
                    cephalo-thorax. These stigmata were mistaken by Tulk for eyes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{l.c.</hi> p. 156).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Respiration</hi> are tracheal. The stigmata in
                    Phalan∙ gium (and Gonyleptes ?) are four in number,—two beneath the fore part of
                    the abdomen, situated one at the base of each of the posterioι legs, but usually
                    concealed by the coxal joints, and one on each side of the fore margin of the
                    cephalo-thorax; each of the former ρaiι opens into a large obliquely
                    longitudinal tracheal trunk; these twc trunks give off various smaller branches
                    and tubes, which convej the air to all parts of the body. With two of these
                    tubes, probably, the cephalic stigmata are connected.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Circulation</hi> are very simple, consisting, in
                    Phalangium, of an elongated dorsal vessel acting as a heart, lying in a groove
                    upon the upper surface of the alimentary canal, and divided into three chambers.
                    Ramifications from this vessel serve to carry the vital fluid to every portion
                    of the body /Tulk). From researches since made by Μ. Blanchard,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“De l’appareil circulatoire
                    et des organs de respiration dans les Arachnides,” <hi rend="italic">Ann. Sc.
                    Nat.</hi> 3 ser. “Zool.,” xii. 318-352, pis. 6-8.</p></note> it appears that
                    this fluid is recollected from the general circulation into two large lateral
                    vessels (vascular sinuses), from which it is returned by other channels to the
                    dorsal vessel, or heart itself. The structure of the heart consists oi a series
                    of transverse, curved, and muscular bands, leaving between them light and
                    membranous intervals (Tulk).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nervous System</hi> of phalangids is very similar in its
                    type to that of some other arachnids. Two large ganglia (cephalic and thoracic)
                    occupy the cephalo-thorax, and from these nerves issue to the various parts,
                    some of them leaving ganglionic enlargements in their course, whence again finer
                    nerves distribute themselves to the adjacent structures. Tulk mentions a
                    strildng peculiarity connected with the nervous system of phalangids, which is a
                    power possessed by them to move the nervous centres backwards or forwards at
                    will; this is effected by means of several large transversely striated muscular
                    fasciculi radiating from the sides of the thoracic ganglion, to which they are
                    attached by short tendons (Tulk, <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi> 326).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Generation</hi> in the Phalangidea (which are
                    oviparous), are different from all other arachnids in the large external parts
                    connected with them. In the female, the internal parts consist of an ovisac and
                    ovarium (Tulk); whence, by means of the oviduct, the ova are conducted into the
                    ovipositor. This is a long membranous tube; the first or basal part of it is
                    surrounded by annuli or rings of hairs or bristles; towards the extremity it is
                    scaly, and also furnished with some hairs, and the extreme point has two small
                    lateral tufts of hairs. The ovipositor is protruded, at the will of the animal,
                    from the vulva, which is situated at the fore margin of the sternal plate, or
                    else it is, when at rest, withdrawn into its sheath, leaving no outward trace of
                    it visible. In the male, the seminal vessels consist of a cluster of “slightly
                    tortuous caecal tubes,” whence the spermatic fluid is passed by a duct into a
                    penis of enormous length compared to the size of the animal (fig. 12, <hi
                    rend="italic">d, e, f).</hi> This organ is a slender curved tube, furnished at
                    its extremity with a recurved hook, and contained in a sheath; both the sheath
                    and penis when at rest lie in a longitudinal direction beneath the ventral
                    surface, of the thorax, but can be protruded at will from the external aperture,
                    which is similar, and similarly situated, to that of the female. The form of the
                    penis varies in different species, as also does the ovipositor of the female.
                    The organs of generation, both male and female, of <hi rend="italic">Phalangium

                    in all parts of the world, but though often very numerous in individuals, the
                    number of species as yet discovered is comparatively small. In the British
                    Islands, where about sixteen species have been observed, they are popularly
                    known by the name of “Harvest-men,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    harvest. They run with great rapidity over and among grass and low herbage, and
                    many live among the leaves and mossy covering of trees, among moss on the
                    ground, heath, and stems of herbage; also under stones, and among rubbish and
                    debris. Their prey is small insects, the young of the true spiders, and some
                    species of Acaridea. The small size of the body, compared with the inordinate
                    length of the legs, in some genera is exceedingly striking. In an undescribed
                    species of Leiobunus, from the Brazils, the length of the body is but a line and
                    a half, while that of <pb break="no"

                    the proportion of about 1 to 32. Phalangids part easily with their legs, or with
                    portions of them; and when detached these legs retain the power of motion for a
                    considerable time, due probably to sustained nervous energy. The order may be

                    longer, some jointsoften of great strength and length, and armed .with strong
                    spines, sometimes assuming, with the strong terminal movable claw, a raptorial
                    appearance. The legs are shorter and stronger, and those of the hinder pair are
                    usually armed with spiny processes, tubercles, and spines; the coxal joints
                    being often inordinately developed, reaching to the extremity of the abdomen, to
                    which, as well as to the cephalo-thorax, they are immovably attached. The tarsi
                    are not multi-articulate. The species are tolerably numerous, and all exotic.
                    Several genera have been characterised, on the species of the chief and typical

                    with descriptions of some new species, has been published by Mr A. G. Butler, in

                <p><hi rend="italic">Order IV.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Solγugidea∙</hi></p>
                <p>This order constitutes a small but very distinct and remarkable group of tropical
                    and semi-tropical Arachnids. At first sight they remind us a good deal of the
                    true spiders (Araneidea), but their position, when we examine their structural
                    details, seems to be more naturally assigned between the Phalangidea and the
                    next order (Scorpionidea) (figs. 14,15).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">External Characters.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">body</hi>
                    is elongated and clothed with hairs; it is divided, as in other Arachnids, into
                    two main portions (cephalo-thorax and abdomen), but each of these portions is
                    composed of several segments or articulations. The caput forms the first segment
                    of the cephalo-thorax; and this is followed by three others closely united to
                    each other, and of a somewhat quadrangular form. Close behind each coxal joint
                    of the legs of the second pair is a small transverse slit or stigma leading to
                    tracheae.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> are two in number, and seated on a tuberculiform
                    eminence on the fore part of the caput; this eminence is furnished with two long
                    slender spines, placed in a transverse line between the eyes, and projecting
                    forwards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs,</hi> articulated by a fixed joint to the lower
                    surface of the thoracic segments, are long and strong, furnished with hairs
                    (some of which are remarkably long), bristles, and spines, varying in length and
                    strength. The legs of the first pair are palpiform and not used in running,
                    probably having the sole office of feelers. The number of joints of those of the
                    first and second pairs is seven, while those of the third and fourth pairs have
                    eight, an extra joint being inserted between the basal and next adjoining
                    joints; the tarsi of the first pair are simple, or undivided, and terminate with
                    two small curved claws, while those of the other three pairs are often divided
                    into two, three, or more articulations, besides a small terminal or heel joint,
                    from which spring two long curved finger-like claws, each ending with a curved
                    (apparently movable) nail or talon. The number, however, of the tarsal joints
                    appears to differ in some species from others, and even in the different legs of
                    the same species. The legs of the second, third, and fourth pairs belong to the
                    three thoracic segments respectively, while those of the first pair are closely
                    united (and even soldered) by their basal joints to the basal joints of the
                    palpi beneath the caput, thus furnishing an additional reason for supposing them
                    to be more of a palpal than of a crural nature; between the bases of the first
                    pair is a small triangular piece (with its apex directed forwards), unnoticed by
                    authors hitherto (?) and which may be regarded as a rudimentary sternal lip
                    (labium); on the under sides of the three basal joints of each of the fourth
                    pair of legs is a longitudinal row of five curious scale-like or lamelliform
                    appendages, of a subtriangular or somewhat fish-tail form, each articulated to a
                    separate foot-stalk, which is again articulated to the surface of the leg joint;
                    beginning from the basal joint the form of the last two of these appendages
                    differs a little from that of the rest. That these remarkable portions of
                    structure have some special office is scarcely to be doubted, but as yet their
                    part in the animal economy has not even been conjectured. They appear to differ
                    slightly in structure in different genera.</p>
                <p>Articulated immediately below the fore-margin of the caput are two enormous,
                    massive <hi rend="italic">falces,</hi> each consisting of a single joint, and
                    ending with a didactyle claw or pair of toothed jaws, the upper fixed, the lower
                    movable, and articulated horizontally with a vertical movement, closing upon
                    each other like scissors or shears; these falces are projected in a line almost
                    parallel with the caput, and are generally equal in length to the whole of the
                    cephalo-thorax. From the fore part of the upper side of each of the falces are
                    often seen one or two curious elongate styliform appendages varying in size and
                    form; their use, if any, which may be doubted, is unknown; they are probably
                    distinctive of sex, and appear to be characteristic of species. Underneath the
                    caput, and forming the basal joints of two long strong five-jointed palpi, are
                    the <hi rend="italic">maxillae;</hi> these are strong, cylindrical, and have a
                    more or less strong blunt-pointed apophysis at the extremity on the inner side.
                    Like similar parts in other Arachnids, these maxillae, in conjunction with the
                    affixed basal joints of the first pair of legs, form the lower boundaries of the
                    mouth, the labium (mentioned above) being apparently too rudimentary to subserve
                    any practical purpose. The <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> are furnished with
                    hairs, spines, and bristles similar to the legs, and the last (digital) joint
                    consists of a kind of capsule containing a peculiar organ, said to be protruded
                    only when the animal is in a state of irritation, the use of which does not
                    appear to be known; doubtless it has some special function beyond that of a mere
                    palpus, and the analogy of the use of the palpi in the males of the Araneidea
                    would lead us to suspect a similar use in the present instance, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as connected in some way with the process of
                    generation. Between and within the maxillae is a portion of the <hi

                    and furnished with two slender feather-like appendages; this is called by
                    Walckenaer the lip (Al·re); but its place and office is undoubtedly more that of

                    united to the cephalothorax throughout its entire breadth. The external orifice
                    leading to the organs of generation is situated at the posterior margin of the
                    first articulation, and besides the two stigmata before alluded to, behind the
                    basal joints of the second pair of legs, there are two other stigmatic

                    note, of the present page.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Respiratory System</hi> is tracheal and complicated. Five
                    (according to Dr Kittary) openings at the hinder margins of the second, third,
                    and fourth sub-abdominal articulations, lead to the abdominal tracheae; these
                    consist of three longitudinal parallel tubes, into the outer one of which the
                    short branches from the external openings lead, and with these are connected
                    various other branches supplying air to the different parts of the body. The
                    abdominal tracheae also lead into those of the cephalo-thorax, which have their
                    outer openings (two in number) behind the basal joints of the second pair of
                    legs. The thoracic tracheae send branches into the legs, palpi, and falces.</p>
                <p>There is probably some variation in different species in the details of their
                    respiratory organs. <hi rend="italic">Galeodes Araneoides,</hi> for instance,
                    does not appear to have the fifth outward opening in the abdomen (fig. 15).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Circulatory System</hi> consists of an elongated dorsal
                    vessel or heart, running from the middle of the cephalothorax backwards through
                    the connection between the thorax and abdomen, but does not reach the hinder
                    extremity of the latter. The thoracic portion is of an oval form, but it
                    contracts in passing into the abdomen, enlarging again gradually as it runs
                    backwards. Dr Kittary does not appear to have traced the various vessels which,
                    no doubt, exist to convey the vital fluid from the heart to the different parts
                    of the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Digestion</hi> consist of an elongated stomach in
                    the cephalo-thorax, with lateral caeca; this stomach is continued backwards into
                    the abdomen in the form of a long single intestinal canal, leading into a cloaca
                    at its posterior extremity. A kind of branching network of minute vessels
                    secrete urine, and convey it from the whole abdominal mass by several main
                    branches into the hinder part of the intestinal canal. Beneath the stomach is an
                    organ described as probably the liver, and another answering to the
                    pancreas.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nervous System</hi> is not particularly complicated, but
                    bears great resemblance to that of other Arachnids, especially of the Araneidea.
                    It consists of one large principal ganglion, or united pair of ganglia, from
                    which branch nerves are sent off in all directions to the different parts and
                    extremities of the body; that which runs to the hinder extremity of the abdomen
                    has an enlargement or kind of ganglion in its course.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Generation</hi> are highly developed in the
                    female, consisting of ovanes, and an oviduct leading to the external orifice.
                    The male organs do not appear to be known. The Solpugidea are probably

                    the older work of Koch, <hi rend="italic">Die Arachniden.</hi> All the species,
                    though varying considerably in size, are remarkably similar in general form and
                    appearance, and nearly all are of sombre colouring.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Remarks.</hi> —The Solpugidea are nocturnal in their
                    habits, living by day secreted under stones, among debris and rubbish, and in
                    old ruined walls and buildings, in dry sandy places; from such retreats they
                    come forth at night, and run with great swiftness. A recent traveller in
                    Palestine relates, that when living in tents on the plains of the Jordan, near
                    Jericho, each night, as nearly as possible between half-past nine and ten
                    o’clock, several Solpugids entered the tent-door, running and racing with great
                    speed over everything—tables, chairs, and beds—just like mad creatures, but
                    apparently with no definite object, perhaps only attracted by the lights burning
                    in the tent. When disturbed in their diurnal hiding-places they showed fight and
                    were extremely pugnacious; but their being venomous is doubtful, though the
                    Arabs seemed to dread them quite as much as they dreaded the true scorpions,
                    which were also numerous under the large stones lying about. Some interesting
                    details of the voracity and habits in confinement of a species of Galeodes, are
                    given by Captain T. Hutton, <hi rend="italic">Ann. and Mag. N.II.,</hi> 1843,
                    vol. xii. p. 81. Like the Phalang-idea, it swallowed the solid parts of insects,
                    and even of a lizard five inches long. Captain H. assumes, as one use at all
                    events, of the palpal organ mentioned above, that it is “a retractile sucker,”
                    to enable it to ascend smooth surfaces. This, however, is veιy questionable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Order V.—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Scorpionidea.</hi></p>
                <p>In spite of differences in their internal anatomy, which appear to ally the
                    Pseudo-Scorpionides more to the spiders than to the true scorpions, some leading
                    features of external structure seem to stamp them at a glance as most nearly
                    related to the latter. The impression inevitably created on a comparison of the
                    true and false scorpions is that the latter are little scorpions without tails.
                    Including them, therefore, here in the same ordinal group as the true scorpions,
                    we may shortly characterise the order as follows: <hi rend="italic">—Body</hi>
                    elongated-oval; cephalo-thorax of one undivided piece, hard, homy, and often
                    tuberculated or granulose, while traces of thoracic segments soldered together
                    are generally more or less perceptible. <hi rend="italic">Abdomen</hi> united to
                    the cephalothorax throughout its entire breadth, and composed of several
                    segments formed by articulated transverse coriaceous plates on the upper and
                    under sides, united by two lateral cartilaginous membranes. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Falces</hi> didactyle; <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> terminating with a
                    didactyle claw or pair of pincers; the coxal joints of the legs, fixed to the
                    lower side of the thoracic segments, form a kind of <hi rend="italic"

                    in number, two to twelve. So far the true and false scorpions run together, but
                    when compared more closely, differences, especially of internal structure,
                    appear, which necessitate their subdivision into two groups or sub-orders. Menge
                    and others, on account of these differences, separate the two groups more widely
                    still; but one chief ground of this wider separation, the respiratory system,
                    being in one <hi rend="italic">tracheal,</hi> in the other (so-called) <hi
                    rend="italic">pulmonary,</hi> seems scarcely sufficiently well established to
                    warrant it. Not that there is not a wide difference in their respective
                    respiratory systems, but that the whole question of the respiration of Arachnids
                    is hardly so settled as to justify any broad lines of classification being based
                    upon it. In some groups of the first order, Acaridea, and also in the second
                    (Pycnogonidea), no traces have been yet found of a distinct respiratory system,
                    though perhaps this arises from the minuteness of the creatures themselves and
                    the extreme delicacy of the membranous walls of the air-vessels. This latter
                    especially, as has been lately observed in regard to some obscure Myriapodous
                    insects,— <hi rend="italic">Peripatus</hi> (H. N. Moseley, “Challenger”
                    Expedition, 1874, <hi rend="italic">Ann. and. Mag. N. H.,</hi> 4 ser. vol. xiv.
                    p. 225),—would make it almost impossible, by any means, to discover these
                    tracheal tubes, when once the air had been expressed from them. Then, again, the
                    so-called pulmonary organs of the true scorpions appear to be, simply, modified
                    tracheae, entirely destitute of that which specially stamps the true lung, that
                    is, the presence of blood-vessels bringing the vital fluid together, and
                    carrying it through the respiratory organs for aeration. The Araneidea,
                    moreover, have both the tracheal and so-called pulmonary systems combined; and
                    also in this (more extensively worked than any other) order—Araneidea—the
                    researches lately published on their organs of respiration by Philipp Bertkau
                    <hi rend="italic">(Arch. f. Nat.,</hi> xxxviii. 1872, Heft. 2, pp. 208-233, pl.
                    7), show how much has yet to be learnt concerning this part of their internal
                    structure. Considering, therefore, that the difference between the respiratory
                    systems of the true and false scorpions should not separate them from the same
                    ordinal group, these with other differences yet appear to necessitate a division
                    within the order. We propose, therefore, to distinguish them under two
                    sub-orders :—1. Pseudo-Scor-piones; 2. Scorpiones.</p>
                <p>Sub-Order I.— <hi rend="italic">Pseudo-Scorpiones.</hi></p>
                <p>These are distinguished from the Scorpiones chiefly by the absence of a tail and
                    by their mode of respiration (figs. 16, 17, 18). The <hi rend="italic">body</hi>
                    is of an oblong-oval form; the cephalothorax is coriaceous; the abdomen sessile
                    and, generally, composed above of eleven, underneath of ten segmental rings or
                    articulations, usually covered above and below with a double longitudinal series
                    of transverse corneous plates, united laterally by a membrane, the folds of
                    which correspond to the transverse plates. In the second sub-abdominal segmental
                    plate, on each side of the median line, there is (in some species) a small
                    spiracular opening, and in the lateral connecting membrane of the third segment,
                    opposite to the end of the third sub-abdominal plate, on either side, is another
                    similar opening. These four stigmata are the external apertures to the tracheary
                    system (fig. 18); behind and between the two first mentioned stigmata is a
                    spinning organ, furnished with minute tubes for the emission of the silken
                    threads; and close to this spinner, at the fore margin of the first abdominal
                    segment, is the genital aperture.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> are closely affixed by the coxal joints to the
                    lower side of the cephalo-thorax, and sit closely to each other, having a very
                    small longitudinal space between them analogous to a sternal plate, of which,
                    however, there is not even a rudimentary one, properly so-called. The number of
                    joints in the legs is seven (Menge), but there appears to be a variation in this
                    respect in some species. Each tarsus ends with two curved finger-like claws
                    terminating with a short nail, and beneath them is another claw, modified at its
                    extremity, gradually enlarging into a kind of conical form, probably acting as a
                    sucker for the purpose of adhesion to smooth objects (fig. 18, &lt;Z). The
                    tarsal claws spring from a small heel or claw-joint.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> are five-jointed, long and strong, terminating
                    with a digital joint of large size, more or less bulbous at its base, and drawn
                    out at its extremity into a jaw-like claw, furnished with hairs and bristles,
                    and generally serrated along its inner edge. Against this claw another,
                    articulated to the extremity of the bulbous portion, acts in opposition like tho
                    pincers of a crab. Supporting the palpi on either side are the maxillae, forming
                    the lower side of the mouth, the upper side being formed by two didactyle
                    falcee; besides the movable jaw of the falces, there are connected with them
                    some denticulate spines, or other spiny processes and bristles. Within the mouth
                    is a tongue, which also serves as a sternal <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0302-0283"/> labium, and differs in its form in different
                    species. The <hi rend="italic">eyes,</hi> two or four in number, are situated on
                    each side of the fore part of the cephalo-thorax, but there are none in the
                    medial line. In some instances eyes are wanting altogether.</p>
                <p>With regard to <hi rend="italic">internal structure,</hi> the Pseudo-Scorpi-ones
                    are very similar in their <hi rend="italic">muscular system,</hi> to the spiders
                    (Araneidea) (Menge). The <hi rend="italic">digestive apparatus</hi> is simple; a
                    large stomachal pouch contracted a little in the middle lies in the thoracic
                    cavity, and from it the alimentary canal runs through to the hinder extremity of
                    the abdomen, with a double crook in the course of its passage; this canal is
                    imbedded on all sides in a mass of substance serving the function of a liver.
                    The external spinning organs have already been mentioned; the internal apparatus
                    resembles that of spiders, consisting of a number of small elongated pear-shaped
                    sacs, communicating outwardly with the spinning tubes.</p>
                <p>Nothing certain appears to have been discovered in regard to the <hi
                    rend="italic">circulatory system</hi> of the pseudo-scorpiones, except that a
                    simple vessel runs along beneath the middle of the abdominal ridge; the vital
                    fluid being found free among all the other organs of the body, so that the air
                    is conveyed to the blood by numerous air-tubes, and not the blood to the
                    air.</p>
                <p>The tracheal character of the <hi rend="italic">respiratory system</hi> has been
                    just mentioned. The spiracular openings vary in number in different species, two
                    or four. From the two hindermost of the abdominal apertures, when four are
                    present, there issue more or less numerous thread-like tubes, which convey the
                    air to the different parts of the abdomen. From each of the two foremost
                    stigmata a main tube runs obliquely through the thoracic region, and from this
                    tube finer ones issue to the rest of the cephalo-thorax and its adjacent
                    parts—legs, palpi, and falces. When two spiracular openings only are present a
                    large tube runs from each forwards into the thorax, and finer ones backwards
                    into the abdominal parts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">reproductive organs</hi> are simple. The external parts in
                    both sexes are situated in the second (1) segment beneath the fore part of the
                    abdomen, and consist of two small oval openings close together. Into each of
                    these there opens in the male a curved horn-like sac, with a lateral direction,
                    as well as a smaller longitudinal duct, the latter leading from a common seminal
                    receptacle. In the female a two-branched oviduct leads from the ovaτia into the
                    external apertures; the mode of reproduction is oviparous, and the eggs are
                    carried by the female beneath the fore part of the abdomen, somewhat like those
                    of certain of the Araneidea.</p>

                    very small size; they do not appear to form more than one family group, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pseudo-Scorpionides,</hi> of which several genera and numerous
                    species have been described by various authors. They are widely distributed,
                    being found in tropical as well as in temperate climates. Europe possesses many
                    species, and even England has several— these being the sole representatives of
                    the Scorpionidea in this more northern latitude. Their habitat is under stones,
                    beneath the decaying bark of trees, on the damp soil, among moss and herbage;
                    some are found amongst old papers in houses, and in herbaria, and others are
                    said to be parasitic on the common house-fly. For more minute details of

                    the true spiders than to the former. Menge gives also a list of works on this
                    sub-order. A paper lately published by Dr Ludwig Koch, at Nuremberg, 1873, pp.

                    (Pseudo-Scorpiones) gives us an evident connecting link.</p>
                <p>In the present sub-order, <hi rend="italic">Scorpionidea,</hi> or true scorpi

                    The cephalo-thorax is tuberculate or granulose, and marked with various seams,
                    or grooves, and ridges, no doubt indicating the union of the caput and thoracic

                    central pair of eyes is placed. This groove possibly represents the union of the
                    two segments of a kind of duplex caput analogous to the duplex generative system
                    noted <hi rend="italic">postea</hi> (p. 285). The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi>
                    is sessile, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> united to the thorax throughout its
                    whole breadth, and composed of twelve segments, of which the five posterior ones
                    form a tail; these latter are segments in the strictest sense, while those of
                    the abdomen proper are, more correctly speaking, articulations covered above and
                    below with transverse horny plates. Articulated to the fifth joint of the tail
                    is a bulb terminating with a sharp curved sting. Poison secreted in the bulb is
                    injected into wounds through two minute perforations near the extremity of the
                    sting. The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> are not very robust, nor long, nor very
                    unequal in length; each consists of seven joints, of which the basal ones
                    (coxae), are fixed to the under side of the cephalo-thorax, and act partly as a
                    sternum; the only portion which can be said to represent a real sternal plate
                    being a very small sub-triangular, or in some genera, quadrangular piece
                    immediately behind the first segment of the abdomen between the extremities of
                    the coxae of the fourth pair of legs (fig. 20, <hi rend="italic">k).</hi> These
                    latter are soldered to those of the third pair, the junction being visible as a
                    more or less distinct groove. The coxae of the first and second pairs have
                    angular pieces attached to them, used in manducation, and hence called
                    supernumerary maxillae (fig. 20, o, o, <hi rend="italic">b, b)∙,</hi> but while
                    the pieces of the first pair might perhaps be so named, those of the second
                    pair, closing together as they do on their inner margins, rather form a kind of
                    sub-triangular sternal appendage representing the <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi>
                    of which there is none properly so-called. Each tarsus ends with two rather long
                    curved superior, and one short straight tooth-like inferior, claws. The first
                    and second segments of the abdomen underneath are almost rudimentary; between
                    them and the anterior edge of the first segment is situated the external
                    aperture to the organs of generation, the horny *plate protecting it being
                    divided longitudinally by a more or less distinct groove. From the second
                    segment, and articulated to it, spring two very conspicuous, curious, comb-like
                    appendages (fig. 20, <hi rend="italic">h, h),</hi> composed of a longitudinal
                    shaft of several distinct joints, with a number of slightly curved, bluntish
                    tooth-like processes, fitting closely together, and articulated to their hinder
                    edge, nearly at right angles, like the teeth of a comb. The shafts and teeth of
                    these appendages vary in the details of their form and structure; their use has
                    not yet been certainly ascertained, but their position points to some connection
                    with the process of generation, which is also the opinion of L. Dufour and
                    others; while they have also been thought to be intended to brush away
                    obstructions from the spiracular orifices and other parts; but as in no case are
                    they long enough to reach more than the first pair (out of four) of these
                    orifices, and every consideration of structure is against their being used to
                    clean other parts, this conjectured use is scarcely probable. The spiracular
                    orifices are situated on the under side of the abdomen in four pairs—one pair in
                    a transverse line on each of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth segmental
                    plates, and are in general easily seen.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> (six, eight, ten, or twelve in number) are placed
                    on the fore part and upper side of the cephalo-thorax,— two, generally large
                    ones, in a transverse line near the middle of the upper part of the caput, the
                    rest (much smaller and varying in size in different genera and species) in two
                    symmetrical groups, one on each side near its fore comers. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >falces</hi> form, as in other Arachnids, the upper side of the mouth; they are
                    strong, cylindrical, and didactyle, the outer jaw-like terminal claw being
                    articulated in opposition to the inner one; both are toothed, the denticulations
                    varying in number size and form. Below the falces (and forming with the
                    before-mentioned coxrl appendages a complete lower boundary to the mouth) are

                    joint) springs a long strong <hi rend="italic">palpus</hi> of four joints, the
                    last (digital) joint being more or less bulbiform at its base and didactyle at
                    its extremity. The outer claw is movable, and (like the fixed one) serrate or
                    denticulate on its inner edge. The size and form of this didactyle joint vary in
                    different species and genera; in some it is of enormous size, and its
                    denticulations very strong, while in others it is scarcely larger than the j
                    oint which precedes it. It is the possession, the position, and the office of
                    the exact counterpart of this palpus, which, apart from other considerations, so
                    plainly stamp the affinity of the two sub-orders of the Scorpionidea, in spite
                    of the differences of their respective internal anatomy. Within the mouth parts

                    segment of the tail. At the junction of the stomachal and intestinal portions
                    the biliary vessels are inserted, and from each side of the former (stomachal

                    another like the leaves of a book; the air is admitted to these through the

                    <hi rend="italic">Animal Kingdom,</hi> 2d ed., 416.) According, however, to L.
                    Dufour <hi rend="italic">(l.c.,</hi> p. 617), the lips of the stigmata are
                    immovable, and have a varied direction in different species. The air is admitted
                    to the pulmo-branchiae by the action of a linear opening in a supple membrane or
                    diaphragm within the space between the lips and the laminae (L. Dufour, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Organs of Circulation.—</hi> These,
                    according to Newport <hi rend="italic">(Philos. Trans.</hi> 1843, pp. 286-298),
                    consist of an elongated, dorsal muscular vessel (or heart) divided into eight
                    chambers, separated from each other by valves, and with auricular openings or
                    valvular orifices, at the division of each chamber, on its dorsal surface. From
                    both sides, and at each end of the dorsal vessel, arteries convey the vital
                    fluid for distribution to different parts of the body.</p>
                <p>This dorsal vessel apparently acts in a manner analogous to that of the heart in
                    vertebrate animals. The vital fluid is conveyed back to the “heart” from the
                    pulmo-branchiae, where it has been oxygenated by means of a great number of
                    slender canals, formed by the collection together of vessels that have their
                    origin at the hinder part of the inner side of the pulmo-branchiae. These canals
                    pass round the sides of the body in the hinder part of each segment, and pour
                    their contents into the dorsal vessel through the valvular orifices above
                    mentioned. The conveyance of the fluid from the general circulation to the
                    pulmo-branchiae is effected by means of an intricate system of anastomosing
                    pulmonic and capillary vessels, situated chiefly below the nervous chord on the
                    ventral surface of the body.</p>

                <p>From the above L. Dufour <hi rend="italic">(l.c.)</hi> dissents. According to his
                    researches, which appear to have been pursued under the great advantage of
                    having fresh as well as living examples to observe and dissect, the heart (or
                    dorsal vessel) is not divided into chambers at all; its chambered appearance,
                    which misled Newport and others, arising from inevitable changes in the form of
                    the organ after death, and long immersion in spirit of wine. Dufour pves very
                    exact figures and descriptions of these changes. According to him the heart is a
                    simple, undivided vessel running throughout the whole body, only narrowing at
                    the fore part of the caput, and in its passages through the tail; and from this
                    tube various lateral veins and arteries issue, those from the hinder or tail
                    portion being profusely branched. He dissents entirely from Newport, Blanchard,
                    and others, with regard to the mode above mentioned in which the vital fluid is
                    conveyed to and from the pulmo-branchiae, but he confesses that he has not been
                    able to find out how it is actually effected, though he believes that the pul
                    mo-branchial laminae are permeated by vascular ramifications spread out over
                    every one of their leaves, and that in these ramifications the fluid receives
                    the benefit of the air admitted to the laminae. Siebold, however, says that no
                    traces of blood-vessels have been found in the pulmonary lamellae of another
                    order, Araneidea; and it is hard to believe but that, if such details as those
                    given by Newport in regard to the scorpion actually existed, Dufour, with the
                    advantage of fresh examples to dissect, should have been unable to discover it.
                    On the whole, it seems too soon, even yet, to dogmatise on the position of the
                    scorpions from their respiratory and circulatory systems. That they have these
                    two systems, the first by means of a dorsal vessel, with lateral branches, the
                    latter by a kind of pouch containing a modification of tracheae, Î3 certain; and
                    that their system is different from that of some other groups is also certain,
                    but in the absence of a more perfect knowledge of the real nature of the
                    difference, its true value cannot well be yet ascertained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System.—</hi> A longitudinal row of nine—according to
                    Newport, eight—ganglia, connected by a double nervous chord, is situated in the
                    median line of the body, below the intestinal canal. The first ganglion consists
                    of two lobes, the upper one of which, occupying a position somewhat analogous to
                    that of the brain in the Vertebrata, is so called <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cerveau)</hi> by Dufour. From these lobes the optic and other nerves issue,
                    some of them being connected with the various parts of the mouth and the legs. A
                    nervous collar, according to some authors, surrounds the oesophagus. Dufour,
                    however, disputes the existence of this collar, and explains how the idea of it
                    arose, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> pp. 556, 557. Of the remaining ganglia four
                    are, according to Dufour, situated in the abdomen, and from these four there
                    spring on each side and underneath, branching nerves, which run to each of the
                    pulmo-branchiae respectively and their adjacent parts, as well as to the viscera
                    and tissues of the abdomen. The first abdominal ganglion is in close connection
                    with the large thoracic one, and is in some instances so little developed that
                    Newport and others, overlooking it, derived the nerves running to the first pair
                    of pulmo-branchiae from the thoracic ganglion itself, and thence allowed but
                    three to the abdomen.</p>
                <p>The caudal ganglia, four in number, do not correspond to the number of segments,
                    which are five, or counting the terminal bulb, six. From each caudal ganglion
                    two lateral nerves only issue, except from the last, whence there issue three
                    pairs; the extra ones, running back, and branching out into the muscles of the
                    poison bulb, doubtless add greatly to its sensibility and irritability.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Reproduction</hi> occupy, both externally and
                    internally, a similar position in both sexes. The external aperture is duplex,
                    situated between the first and second segments of the abdomen, in front of and,
                    in a manner, between the comb-like appendages, and covered by an operculum.
                    Internally those of the male consist of a duplex set of vessels for the
                    elaboration, collection, and conveyance of the seminal fluid to the external
                    orifices, each orifice having its own set. The vessels, answering to testes, in
                    which the seminal fluid is secreted, consist each of a tube forming three large
                    quadrilateral, flexuose, and free, anastomosing meshes placed longitudinally;
                    those of one set sometimes communicating with the other at the lower mesh by a
                    short, strong connecting tube. According to Treviranus the three meshes on
                    either side anastomose with each other, having, in fact, a common connection
                    throughout, but this L. Dufour considers to be an abnormal case; the vessels for
                    the collection of the seminal fluid, <hi rend="italic">vesiculoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seminales,</hi> are three for each set, and all open into the
                    channel of emission; this is produced backwards in the form of a long, fusiform,
                    sheath-like channel, lying along the flanks of the abdominal cavity, and
                    attenuated at both extremities; within this channel is another slender, corneous
                    sheath-like organ, prolonged to the genital aperture, where it is exceedingly
                    fine. This is “le fourreau et l’armure de la verge” (Dufour), and within it is
                    the intromittent organ itself, having a whitish cartilaginous, thread-like
                    appearance. No recorded observations have yet decided the mode in which these
                    parts of generation are used: the Scorpionides being nocturnal in their habits
                    makes such observations very difficult, but all analogy is in favour of
                    copulation by the exsertion and introduction of the thread-like organs above
                    described into the female parts of generation. These consist of two ovaria, each
                    composed of a membranous tube, forming four large quadrilateral meshes in a
                    longitudinal line on each side, anastomosing with each other and with those of
                    the other side; each of these ovaria ends in a simple oviduct (sometimes with,
                    sometimes without ovisacs) leading to the vulva or external orifice. The general
                    similarity of these female organs with those of the male is at once apparent. A
                    curious point noticeable in these parts in the Scorpionides is their <hi
                    rend="italic">duplex</hi> character, and hence the question as to their mode of
                    operation becomes of greater interest. It is remarkable that the only other
                    Arachnids in which an intromittent organ is as yet known are among the
                    Phalangides, a group widely separated from the Scorpionides in other
                    characteristic details, though approaching much nearer to the pseudoscorpions.
                    Scorpions are ovo-viviparous, and, according to Dufour (Z.c.), their period of
                    gestation is of great length, extending even to fifteen or sixteen months; but
                    for five of these months, which occur in the winter season, Dufour concludes,
                    from frequent observations, that the whole genital apparatus is, like the animal
                    itself, in a dormant state, and that therefore no progress in the development of
                    the ova takes place during this period. On the very important branch of this
                    subject—the <hi rend="italic">embryology of the scorpion—</hi> reference only

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Observations.</hi> —The sub-order Scorpiones forms a
                    remarkably homogeneous group. It has been divided, however, into several
                    families by Koch <hi rend="italic">{Lie Arachn.);</hi> and various genera, based
                    principally on the number and distribution of the eyes, the form of the fore
                    margin of the cephalo-thorax, and the structure of the comb-like appendages
                    attached to the under side of the abdomen, have been characterised. The species
                    are tolerably numerous, but the whole group greatly needs revision, both in
                    respect to its family and generic divisions, as well as in regard to the
                    identification and determination of the species. Those found in Europe are of
                    comparatively small dimensions, and are confined to the southern parts of the
                    Continent; the majority are tropical, attaining their greatest size— nine or ten
                    inches in length—in Central Africa and South America. They are nocturnal in
                    their habits, living by day underneath stones, behind the loose bark of trees,
                    among the ruins and debris of old walls and buildings, and preying upon insects
                    and other Arachnida; they are said to be very partial to the eggs of spiders and
                    insects. It <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0305-0286"/> does not appear that they are able to inflict any
                    great injury with the, often formidable looking, crab-like claw with which their
                    palpi terminate, though they can gripe and hold on firmly with them. The wound
                    inflicted by the sting at the end of the tail is certainly more or less
                    venomous; the amount of venom is probably dependent on the age of the scorpion,
                    and the season of the year; and the effect of the sting is no doubt dependent
                    upon the state of health, constitution, or predisposition of the person injured.
                    Experiments, tried by Maupertuis, upon poultry and dogs stung by exasperated
                    scorpions, resulted in their almost entire immunity from bad effects, while in
                    Redi’s experiments, the sting proved fatal in some instances to pigeons. These
                    experiments were tried with European species of scorpion, which would probably
                    be less venomous than those living in tropical countries. For a recent memoir on
                    the poison of the scorpion, and the mode in which it acts, see Dr Jousset, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann. Ent. Soc. France,</hi> 1872, p. 151; also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1870, pp. 407-411. According to Jousset, the venom acts
                    directly upon the red globules of blood, paralysing them, so that becoming
                    agglutinated together, they obstruct the entrance to the capillaries and stop
                    circulation. The peasant inhabitants of Tuscany are said to handle scorpions
                    without fear; but this may be chiefly from a skilful mode of handling them. A
                    scorpion does not appear to be able to move its tail or its sting in a lateral
                    direction, nor does it strike downwards. The present writer has seen natives of
                    Egypt handling large, and it is believed very deadly ones with impunity, but
                    then they always held them tightly by the last joint of the tail. It was a
                    common practice so to catch these creatures, and after breaking off the tip of
                    the sting, to let them loose again; but this infliction generally appeared to
                    produce a kind of paralysis of the whole tail, and probably the poor animal
                    would soon die.</p>
                <p>Though the well-known tale of the scorpion, when surrounded by fire, stinging
                    itself to death, has been perpetually repeated, and has even been related to the
                    present writer with some very minute and extraordinary details, it must be held
                    to be merely a “traveller’s story.” Cross-examination, in the special instance
                    noted, very much nettled the narrator at the incredulity which led to it, but it
                    threw more than a doubt over the conclusiveness of the experiment narrated.
                    Probably in some instances the poor scorpion has been burnt to death; and the
                    well-known habit of these creatures, to raise the tail over the back and recurve
                    it so that the extremity touches the fore part of the cephalo-thorax, has led to
                    the idea that it was stinging itself. Perhaps, under the pain of scorching,
                    there may have been convulsive efforts and movements of the highly nervous and
                    sensitive tail in this position, and the point of the sting may even have been
                    inserted between the articulation of the cephalo-thorax and abdomen; and what
                    more would be wanting to make a wonder-loving traveller believe that it had
                    really committed suicide Î The progress of scorpions is neither rapid nor
                    graceful; they are unable to run without elevating the tail to an erect
                    position, which seems to be necessary to enable them to preserve their
                    balance.</p>

                <p>One hundred and twenty-two species, distributed variously among the above eleven
                    genera, have been described by Koch <hi rend="italic">(DieArachn.);</hi> but
                    many others also have since been added to these, in isolated papers by other
                    authors. For another systematic arrangement, as well as on the group generally,

                    Scorpions have been found in a fossil state, as well as in amber, in which
                    substance a species of Tithyus <hi rend="italic">(T. eogenus)</hi> has been
                    described by Menge.</p>

                <p>The last group, Scorpiones, seems to be the culminating point of the Arachnids in
                    a certain plane, and it presents the arachnidous type in its highest and most
                    complex state of development. The group now to be considered gradually lowers,
                    so to speak, this type again through its three well-marked families, to the last
                    order Araneidea.</p>
                <p>As has been before observed, there is seldom or never in nature exactly the same
                    hiatus between one group and another, as there may be between either of them and
                    others; or, in other words, some groups are far more nearly allied to the one
                    next to it than others are to that next to them, although, perhaps, all of those
                    groups bear the same apparent value in a systematic arrangement. Thus, for
                    instance, the groups A, B, C, D may all be equal in a systematic arrangement,
                    and yet A and B may be far more nearly allied than B and C; or again, C and D
                    may be more closely united than either B and C or A and B. So the two orders of
                    Arachnids—Scorpionidea and Thelyphonidea —are certainly far more nearly allied
                    to each other than, for instance, the Solpugidea and Scorpionidea, or the
                    Thelyphonidea and Araneidea are to each other respectively. So obvious is the
                    affinity of the family Thelyphonidea of the present order to the Scorpiones,
                    that Walckenaer and others have included them in the same order, making a
                    separate order of its other family, Phrynides; but the latter family certainly
                    seems nearer to Thelyphonides than even the Thelyphonides to the Scorpiones; and
                    so, while the Thelyphonides and the Phrynides must go together, these last could
                    scarcely with any propriety be included in the same order as the scorpions. This
                    will, we think, be evident when we consider presently their structural
                    characters. From these and other considerations, it has therefore been thought
                    best to separate the Thelyphonides from the Scorpionides, and include them in
                    another order with Phrynides.</p>
                <p>In the order Thelyphonidea, the <hi rend="italic">céphalo-thorax</hi> is similar
                    in the general nature and condition of its integument to that of the scorpions,
                    being hard, granulose, and sometimes tubercular, bearing also visible traces of
                    its soldered segments.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> is segmented, and united to the cephalothorax
                    by a pedicle of greater or less strength, but never, as in the Scorpiones,
                    throughout its entire breadth; it terminates in one family (Thelyphonides) with
                    three postabdominal segments, to which is attached a long multiarticulate
                    setiform tail; in another (Tartarides) with a short tail of different form
                    according to the species; and in the third family (Phrynides) the abdomen
                    terminates with a simple button-Hke segment.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> of the first pair are much longer than the rest
                    (in the Phrynides of most inordinate length) and antenniform; the tarsi, and
                    generally the metatarsi, multi-articulate, ending without any terminal claw; the
                    legs of the other three pairs are seven-jointed, with the last, or tarsal joint,
                    subdivided.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> when present (as in two families), are eight in
                    number, placed on the fore part of the cephalo-thorax <pb break="no"

                    apex (more or less acute) directed forwards; the base of the triangle is formed
                    by two lateral groups, each of three contiguous eyes; the apex by the third
                    group of two eyes near together, but not generally contiguous to each other.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">falces</hi> are monodactylous, or terminating with a simple
                    movable fang. The <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> are four-jointed, monodactylous,
                    or rather didactyle in a modified form. The <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> is
                    more developed than in the scorpions, but not so fully as in the next order,
                    Araneidea. The <hi rend="italic">labium</hi> is either entirely wanting or very
                    rudimentary in one family, in another fairly developed, and in another
                    altogether absent. In any case, it is probably of small economic importance
                    compared to the labium in the Araneidea.</p>
                <p>Such knowledge as is at present attainable in regard to the internal anatomy of
                    this order will be noted in the separate descriptions of each family. These
                    families are three in number,— <hi rend="italic">Thelyphonides, Tartarides,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Phrynides,—</hi> and being very distinct, it will be well
                    to give a short diagnosis of each.</p>
                <p>Family I.— <hi rend="italic">Thelyphonides.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">External
                    Structure</hi> (figs. 21,22).—The <hi rend="italic">cephalo-thorax</hi> is
                    sometimes of a tolerably regular oval form, more or less blunt-pointed before,
                    but often it is of an oblong quadrate shape, also pointed in front, and making
                    not only the hinder part but also the fore part somewhat angular,—the latter
                    having two obtuse lateral angles, and one acute and apical; it is of a flattened
                    form, and destitute of hairs and spines, but is generally granulose, and
                    sometimes covered with more marked, but still minute, tubercles. Marks of
                    segmental soldering are visible, as also a longitudinal groove in the medial
                    line of the caput, similar to, but less marked than, that noted in regard to the
                    scorpions. Beneath the cephalo-thorax are two pieces, which may be regarded as
                    small sternal plates, perhaps the terminal remains representing the complete
                    sternum of the Araneidea. or anticipating its complete form in that order. One
                    of these sternal plates is of a somewhat triangular form, and has its longest or
                    apical angle directed backwards between the basal joints of the first two pairs
                    of legs; the other, more heart-shaped, and with the apical angle reversed, is
                    situated between the basal joints of the legs of the fourth pair. In some
                    species a minute corneous patch may be seen between the coxae, or basal joints,
                    of the third pair of legs, affording still further evidence of the remains of a
                    sternal plate. At the centre of the fore margin of the foremost of these sternal
                    plates is a small point which seems to represent the labium. Beneath the fore
                    part of the cephalo-thorax are two not very powerful <hi rend="italic"
                    >falces,</hi> terminating with a long, powerful, movable, curved fang, somewhat
                    resembling what we find in the Araneidea, and hinting at a transition to that
                    order from the didactyle falces of the Scorpiones. Beneath, and opposed to, this
                    fang is a fixed tooth-like claw; these parts of the mouth are thickly clothed
                    and fringed with hairs. Immediately in front of the fore sternal plate, beneath
                    the anterior part of the cephalo-thorax, are articulated two enormous <hi
                    rend="italic">maxillae</hi> of a subtriangular form, the apex being at the
                    articulated part, and the inner basal angle prolonged into a larger or smaller
                    tapering, pointed apophysis, which is now and then denticulate. From the
                    extremity of each of the maxillae springs a proportionately strong and massive
                    four-jointed <hi rend="italic">palpus,</hi> powerfully armed with spines,
                    denticulations, and claw-like projections; the inner extremity of the last, or
                    digital, joint terminates like the radial (or the joint next before it), with
                    astrong, claw-like, sharp-pointed projection, in imperfect opposition to which
                    there is a stronger movable claw, of the same nature, articulated to the outer
                    extremity; the fixed claw of the digital joint, with the joint itself, appears
                    capable of being opposed at will to the fixed claw of the radial joint, thus
                    giving the palpi a duplex kind of didactyle claw,—didactyle, that is, in a
                    modified sense, differing as it does considerably from the terminal claw of the
                    scorpion’s palpus, which is more properly spoken of as didactyle. The movable
                    finger of this claw would, perhaps, be more correctly reckoned as a <hi
                    rend="italic">substantive joint,</hi> terminating with a more or less sharp
                    corneous nail; and this joint, opposed to a pointed apophysis of the one to
                    which it is articulated, forms the so-called <hi rend="italic">didactyle</hi>
                    claw; in fact, the terminal palpal claw of the Scorpiones (including the
                    Pseudo-Scorpiones) as well as that of the Phalangidea, appears to be similarly
                    constructed. In the present family, however, the basal portion of the joint,
                    bearing the fixed claw, being far less developed (seldom stronger or more
                    bulbous than the other joints), and the two fingers being always of unequal
                    length, the didactyle nature of the whole is less real, and less apparent; while
                    in the scorpions its bulbous form is generally apparent, and often inordinate,
                    the equal length of the two fingers and their evidently purposed opposition to
                    each other making the claw, in the fullest sense, didactyle.</p>
                <p>If this view (that the movable finger of this claw is a substantive joint) be
                    correct, the palpi in the present order, as well as in the orders Phalangidea
                    and Scorpionidea, must be considered to have five instead of four joints, thus
                    bringing them to an equality in this respect with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0307-0288"/> Araneidea. The palpi in the third family of this
                    order— Phrynides—bear out this idea strongly.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> are long, slender, and seven-jointed, except
                    those of the first pair, which have but six, the genual, or fourth, joint being
                    absent. The tarsi of the first pair are divided into eight short articulations,
                    while those of the rest have but three. There is probably some variation in the
                    number of these articulations in different species, since Walckenaer describes
                    the tarsi of the three hinder pairs as 7⅛ojointed; the first pair are far more
                    slender than the rest, palpiform, and without any terminal claw; they appear, as
                    it were, to be thrust out of their position by the great size of the maxillae,
                    and their basal joints seem to be jammed in over those of the second pair. The
                    tarsi of the three hinder pairs terminate with three claws, of which those of
                    the superior pair are the strongest and curved.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> is of a long-oval form, composed of nine quasi
                    segments, formed by a covering, both above and below, of so many transverse
                    articulated corneous plates; while the cartilaginous membrane on each side,
                    between the lateral margins of the upper and lower plates, is continuous, not
                    folded or articulate as in the Scorpionidea. This is a point to be noted, as it
                    marks a transition to the abdominal type of the Araneidea. The first plate on
                    the upper side forms a protective covering to the pedicle by which the abdomen
                    is united to the cephalo-thorax, and makes the pedicle look broader than it
                    really is. There is a double longitudinal row of impressed circular spots on the
                    upper side, two (in a transverse line) on each corneous plate, except the first
                    and last; these impressed spots are perhaps points of attachment for muscular
                    fibres.</p>
                <p>Beneath the abdomen, on the fourth and three following segmental plates, are
                    eight stigmata in as many largish, shallow, circular impressions; they are,
                    however, imperforate, and are probably, like those mentioned above, points for
                    the attachment of muscles. The spiracular stigmata are four in number, two being
                    placed beneath the hinder margin of each of the first and second sub-abdominal
                    plates, one on each side of the median line; the genital aperture is under the
                    hinder margin of the first plate, between the first two spiracular openings.
                    Joined to the posterior extremity of the abdomen are three small cylindrical,
                    postabdominal segments, to which is attached a long setiform tail, variable in
                    length, composed of a number of small articulations, and, like the legs and
                    palpi, sparingly furnished with hairs; at the extremity of the third
                    post-abdominal segment, beneath the tail, is the anal opening.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> are eight in number: two placed transversely,
                    near to each other, on the fore margin of the caput in the medial line, and
                    three others in a triangular group on each side at its lateral angles, just
                    above the insertion of the legs of the first pair.</p>

                    number, and situated in the position already mentioned. Their mode of
                    reproduction is probably like that of the scorpions, ovo-viviparous, but this is

                <p>All the species of this small but remarkable group are confined to the tropical
                    regions of Asia, America, and Australasia, no species having yet been recorded
                    from Africa. In size they vary from rather more than half an inch to 2 or 3
                    inches in length. Among other characters useful in the identification of the
                    species, are the number and differential development of the various processes
                    and denticu-lations of the palpal joints. Of their habits little io known, and
                    much of that little is of a very recent date. Dr Stoliczka <hi rend="italic"
                    >(l.c.')</hi> gives a short account of them, from which it appears that they are
                    nocturnal or crepuscular, living by day in damp places under the bark of old
                    trees; when disturbed they hold up the palpi, as if for defence, and beat a
                    rapid retreat, with the tail in an erect position. In this position of the tail
                    we see a curious relationship to the scorpions, but apparently without the same
                    necessity, in the present instance, for such a position. They lie still when
                    uncovered, evidently simulating (though of course unconsciously) a fragment of
                    old bark or fungus. The first pair of legs act more as feelers than as organs of
                    locomotion. In the presence of a sternal plate, the mode in which the abdomen is
                    united to the cephalo-thorax, and the structure of the falces, Thelyphonids
                    approach nearer than the scorpions to the structure of the true spiders, and, as
                    we shall see, the family Phrynides is a transitional group bridging over some
                    part of the gap between the two, while in the massive palpi (though imperfectly
                    didactyle), and in some other respects, they show an unmistakable alliance to
                    the scorpions.</p>
                <p>Family II.— <hi rend="italic">Tartarides.</hi></p>
                <p>This family is nearly allied to the former—Thelyphonides—but has a more elongated
                    form. The <hi rend="italic">cephalothorax</hi> is beak-like in front, and is
                    also divided into two parts or segments; the first comprises the caput, and ths
                    coalesced thoracic segments belonging to the first two pairs of legs; the hinder
                    part is the smallest, and comprises the second thoracic segments belonging to
                    the third and fourth pairs, but no grooves or indentations mark the union of the
                    segments, its surface being smooth and glossy. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >abdomen</hi> is united to the cephalo-thorax by a stout pedicle, and is covered
                    above and below, as in Thelyphonides, with eight or nine transverse, corneous,
                    articulated plates, the upper series separated from the lower by a narrow
                    divisional space, covered with a continuous cartilaginous integument. Beneath
                    the fore part, at the hinder margin of the first sub-abdominal segment, a
                    line-like fissure in the median line probably represents the opening to the
                    reproductive organs; near the fore margin of each of the fourth, fifth, and
                    sixth plates, in a transverse line, are two small elongated stigmata, thought at
                    first to belong to the respiratory apparatus, but further examination seems to
                    prove them to be, like the eight analogous stigmata in Thelyphonides,
                    imperforate, and probably due to the same cause conjectured in regard to them.
                    Two (or four) narrow slits, placed two and two symmetrically on each side of the
                    genital aperture at the fore margin of the first and second segments, but very
                    difficult to be correctly ascertained, are probably the external openings to the
                    respiratory organs; these points, however, can hardly yet be said to be
                    satisfactorily determined. Two or three very narrow corneous rings, or
                    post-abdominal articulations, support a caudal appendage, either slender,
                    cylindrical, and bi-arti-culate, or of a largish, peculiar, sub-triangular form,
                    articulated to a small foot-stalk. <hi rend="italic">Eyes</hi> none, no traces
                    even of eyes being visible. The <hi rend="italic">falces</hi> are strong, of a
                    flattened cylindrical form, deeper than broad, projecting in the plane of the
                    cephalo-thorax, and terminating with a sharp, curved, movable fang at their
                    upper extremity, the lower extremity being rather pointedly prominent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">palpi</hi> are very strong, five-jointed, and each issues
                    from a long, strong, nearly cylindrical basal joint or <pb break="no"

                    corner of which is prolonged into a sharp, strong point; the other joints are
                    armed variously with teeth, and the final, or digital, joint in one species has
                    a longish, but not very strong, spine beneath it, terminating with a small,
                    apparently movable, curved claw. In these palpi we see a marked transition from
                    the more apparent didactyle nature of those of Thelyphonides to those of the
                    Phrynides, removing them further than the former, in this respect, from the
                    Scorpiones.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> appear very similar to those of Thelyphonus; they
                    are seven-jointed; those of the first pair are slender and evidently palpiform;
                    their tarsi are composed each of several (apparently ten) minute articulations,
                    and devoid of terminal claws. Those of the other three pairs are apparently
                    inarticulate, and each ends with three simple curved claws, of which the
                    inferior one is the smallest and most sharply bent; the femora of these three
                    pairs are all strong, those of the fourth pair inordinately so. The <hi
                    rend="italic">sternal plates</hi> are very similar to those of Thelyphonus, but
                    the hinder one is not so much developed, and the central corneous spot is not
                    visible.</p>
                <p>This family, of small but exceedingly interesting blind Arachnids, contains but
                    one at present known genus— <hi rend="italic">Nyctalops</hi> (Cambridge), and
                    two species— <hi rend="italic">N. crassicaudata</hi> (Id.) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >N. tenuicaudata</hi> (Id.); both are of a uniform pale yellow-brown colour,
                    differing from each other, among other characters, in the markedly different
                    form of the tail; the length of the largest (probably, but not certainly
                    ascertained to be, in the adult state) is but 2 J lines. They are found under
                    decayed leaves in Ceylon; but nothing is yet known of their habits, nor of their
                    internal structure and anatomy; analogy, however, points to a similarity in this
                    latter respect to Thelyphonus.</p>
                <p>Family III.— <hi rend="italic">Phrynides.</hi></p>
                <p>This is also a remarkably homogeneous family, and although, undoubtedly, a near
                    ally of the Thelyphonides, yet in its form it presents many typical characters
                    of the Araneidea (figs. 23, 24, 25).</p>
                <p>With respect to <hi rend="smallcaps">External Structure,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">body</hi> is short and broad instead of elongated, as in
                    Thelyphonus and Nyctalops. The <hi rend="italic">céphalo-thorax</hi> is
                    flattened, of a round oval form, hollowed on the hinder margin, and often of a
                    short heart or kidney shape; its integument is hard, horny, granulose, and often
                    tuberculose; near the centre is a deep fovea, or pitlike indentation, from which
                    other grooves and indentations radiate, showing the, now soldered up, junctional
                    lines of the caput and thorax, and thoracic segments. In these characters of the
                    cephalo-thorax the affinity of Phrynides to the Araneidea is very plainly
                    indicated, as it is also in the sternal plate, around which the legs are
                    articulated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">falces</hi> are strong and somewhat cylindrical in form.
                    They project in a line parallel to that of the cephalo-thorax, and each
                    terminates with a strong curved denticulated fang, which is articulated to its
                    upper extremity. The falces are toothed also on their under sides; the
                    denticulations of the falces and their fangs differ a good deal in different
                    species, and form one of the best and most tangible characters for the
                    determination of the species (see a paper on “Phrynus,” by A. G. Butler, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann. and A fag. N. H.,</hi> Aug. 1873, pp. 117-125, pls. 6, 7). In
                    the usual position are two strong divergent <hi rend="italic">maxillae,</hi>
                    each with a broad obtusely rounded apophysis at the fore extremity on the inner
                    side; from the extremity of each maxilla springs a long, strong <hi
                    rend="italic">palpus,</hi> in some species of great length, consisting of four
                    or (reckoning the large terminal movable claw as a substantive joint) five
                    joints. This palpus is armed variously with tubercles, spines, and
                    denticulations, especially on the cubital and radial joints, where several long,
                    strong spines, opposed by the terminal claw (or digital joint), form a powerful
                    grasping or raptorial organ, but one considerably further removed than the
                    analogous portion of structure in</p>
                <p>Thelyphonus from the didactyle claw of the Scorpionidea. Between the maxillae,
                    and issuing from the fore margin of the sternum, is a narrow, elongated tapering
                    <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">id</hi> some species bifid at
                    its extremity; the presence of a distinct sternal lip, or labium, is another
                    mark of affinity to the Araneidea.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">legs</hi> (seven-jointed) are long and generally slender,
                    though the coxal joints of the three hinder pairs are long and strong, and
                    articulated laterally to the sternum. The legs of the first pair are palpiform,
                    and of great length <pb break="no"

                    one long slender tapering portion, which is however subdivided into a great
                    number of minute homogeneous articulations without any terminal claw; each
                    tarsus of the remaining three pairs is divided into three articulations, ending
                    with two curved claws; and in some species the tibial joint of the fourth pair
                    is also tri-articulate. Probably the subdivision of the fourth pair of legs
                    varies in other species also. The coxal joints of the first pair are, as it
                    were, crushed in behind the maxillae and above the coxae of the second pair, as
                    in Thelyphonus. The extreme articulation of each tarsus has a peculiarity never
                    (it is believed) noticed before; its upper side being covered, throughout its
                    length, with a separate integumental plate, prolonged at its fore extremity into
                    a corneous, slightly bent, claw-like apophysis, forming a kind of third claw
                    above and between the two ordinary ones. These latter spring from a
                    supernumerary or heel joint, which has a short, conical, tooth-like spur beneath
                    it, representing the usual third claw in other groups.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">eyes,</hi> eight in number, are placed in three groups,
                    forming a very obtuse angled triangle on the fore margin of the caput. Two eyes,
                    seated transversely, and near together in the medial line, constitute the apex
                    of the triangle, which is directed forwards; the other two groups are of three
                    eyes each, closely grouped in a triangular form, one on each side, about
                    parallel with the second pair of legs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen,</hi> is oval, of a somewhat flattened form, and
                    joined to the cephalo-thorax by a narrow pedicle, showing, in this also, a near
                    approach to the Araneidea; it consists of ten quasi-segments, or articulations,
                    formed, as in the other families of the order, by a series of upper and lower
                    transverse corneous plates, having an, apparently continuous, cartilaginous
                    integument between the two series of plates, and terminating with a button-like
                    joint, or process, at its extremity. On the under side are two parallel rows of
                    impressed spots, two, in a transverse line, in each of the fourth and three
                    following sub-abdominal plates; but, apparently, like the corresponding marks in
                    Thelyphonus, imperforate. The <hi rend="italic">organs of generation</hi> have
                    their external orifice beneath the posterior margin of the first subabdominal
                    plate; and the external openings to the <hi rend="italic">respiratory
                    organs,</hi> four in number, are situated, two beneath the posterior margin of
                    the first, and two others beneath that of the second of these plates. The <hi
                    rend="italic">sternum,</hi> is oval, and often superficially divided into
                    several portions by various ridges and indentations.</p>
                <p>With regard to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Internal Structure</hi> of the
                    Phry-nides, the <hi rend="italic">respiratory system</hi> is pulmo-branchial,
                    the orifices to these organs being four in number, and placed as above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">nervous system,</hi> according to Van der Hoeven, appears
                    to be very simple, consisting of a large thoracic bi-lobed ganglion, from which
                    four pairs of lateral nerves issue, while a double nervous chord runs back
                    through the connecting pedicle into the abdomen, where it divides into two
                    divergent branches, from which the various nerves are distributed to the
                    different parts of the abdomen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Remarks.</hi> —The family Phrynides comprises but
                    one genus, <hi rend="italic">Phrynus</hi> (Olivier), which, according to the
                    most recent publication upon it (A. G. Butler, <hi rend="italic">l.c.
                    supra),</hi> includes twenty species only, all confined to the tropical regions
                    of the world. The individuals of most of these species appear to be of rare
                    occurrence, or; at least, but rarely observed, and the family has, comparatively
                    speaking, received but little attention. It is, however, one of great interest
                    and importance, and deserves more elaborate and careful treatment, especially in
                    regard to its habits and internal anatomy, for it undoubtedly forms a plain
                    passage from the Scorpionidea (through Thelyphonus and Nyctalops) to the true
                    spiders (Araneidea). The main external marks of affinity with this order have

                    of the ordinary cephalic and thoracic segments soldered together; and although
                    these segments form but one undivided portion of structure, it is necessary to
                    speak of it frequently by the names of its two portions—caput and thorax. The
                    caput is almost always easily traced, forming a kind of wedge-shaped portion,
                    jammed (as it were) into the first of the thoracic segments, and giving one the
                    idea, in most cases, of its fore part having been to a greater or less extent
                    truncated or lopped off (fig. 28, δ). Similarly the last of the four thoracic
                    segments has the appearance of having been driven in to meet the caput, all the
                    segments thus converging, on the upper side, towards a common fovea, or more or
                    less deep central indentation (fig. 28, e), and on the under side forming a
                    sternum (or sternal plate), in which, however, no appearance of segmentation is
                    generally visible beyond small eminences opposite to the articulation of the
                    legs, with which the number of the thoracic segments, as seen above, agrees. The
                    integument of the cephalo-thorax is either hard, horny, or coriaceous, generally
                    more or less clothed with hairs and bristles, and sometimes, though more rarely,
                    with tubercles and spines; occasionally it is perfectly smooth and glabrous. The
                    <hi rend="italic">eyes,</hi> when present, are two, four, six, or eight, and are
                    very variously, but always symmetrically, disposed on the fore part of the caput
                    (figs. 28, 29, 30). The number and general position of the eyes form valuable
                    characters for the formation of genera; while their relative size is strongly
                    characteristic of species. The eyes of spiders, like those of other Arachnids,
                    are always simple.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">leys,</hi> eight in number, are articulated to the sternal
                    plate (mentioned above) which forms the under side of the cephalo-thorax; in one
                    genus, however <hi rend="italic">(Miagrammopes,</hi> Cambr.), found in Ceylon
                    and Australia, no sternum properly so called exists, the legs being articulated
                    to the continuous under side of the cephalothorax. Except in one or two species
                    the legs are seven-j ointed, and variously furnished with hairs, bristles, and
                    spines. Many spiders have a kind of pad of closely set papillae-form hairs
                    beneath the extremity of the tarsi of some or all the legs, and often extending
                    along the whole of the under side of the joint. This pad enables the spider to
                    run over smooth vertical surfaces, acting as a kind of sucker, partly by
                    atmospheric pressure, and partly (Mr Blackwall thinks wholly) by means of a
                    viscid secretion from the papillae-form hairs. Each tarsus ends with either two
                    or three more or less curved or bent claws, commonly (but not always) pectinate
                    or finely denticulated; these (with other opposed serrated claws, in some
                    groups) are used in traversing their webs, and as hooks to give a tension to the
                    line of their snares by alternately pressing and straining upon them; the spines
                    and bristles are used also in many cases in the actual construction of the
                    silken snares in which spiders entrap their prey. The spines on the legs of some
                    spiders which excavate cylindrical holes in the earth (lined with silk and
                    closed with a hinged lid) are very strong, and well suited for digging out the
                    soil. The males of some species, again, have a curious row of short, closely
                    set, curved, spiny bristles along a portion of the upper side of the metatarsi
                    of the fourth pair of legs; the use of this row of bristles (called the <hi
                    rend="italic">calamistrum)</hi> is alluded to further on. The length of the legs
                    in spiders (both actual and relative) is very various; and the differences
                    between them, as well as their armature and terminal claws, furnish valuable
                    characters, often generic, and always important in the determination of
                    species.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">falces,</hi> two in number, are articulated immediately
                    below the fore margin of the caput; their direction is various, ranging from a
                    line parallel to the plane of the cephalo-thorax to one perpendicular to it;
                    they are in general opposed to each other, and in most cases are armed with
                    teeth on their inner surface, especially towards the extremities; each also
                    terminates with a movable curved fang, which, when not in use, is (according to
                    its mode of articulation) folded down either across the inner side of the
                    extremity of the falx, or (as in one extensive family, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theraphosides)</hi> backwards along its length; by means of these fangs, which
                    are internally channelled and perforated at their extremities, a poison secreted
                    within the caput is instilled into the wound made by them, proving, no doubt,
                    fatal to the spider’s prey, and often nearly so to human beings. Not to dwell
                    upon the, probably exaggerated, accounts of the Tarantula, there are
                    well-authenticated instances of recent date in regard to the very deadly nature
                    of the poison of quite a small spider, <hi rend="italic">Lathrodectus
                    Katipo</hi> (LL Powell), found in New Zealand <hi rend="italic">(Trans.</hi> 2V

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">maxillae</hi> are a conspicuous, as well as an important,
                    portion of structure in the Araneidea; they are two strong pieces situated
                    immediately behind the falces, exceedingly varied in form and strength, and
                    articulated to the fore side of the sternum between the basal joints of the
                    first pair of legs. Their real direction is always divergent, t.e., outwards
                    from each other, but as in most cases the inner extremity is produced into an
                    apophysis of greater or less size (sometimes following the direction of the
                    maxilla, sometimes curved so that its extremity almost touches that of the
                    opposite maxilla), the maxilla itself often seems lost in the part which
                    projects from it. Owing to this, the palpus which springs from each maxilla,
                    although really always springing <hi rend="italic">from its extremity,</hi>
                    appears more frequently to issue from <hi rend="italic">its outer side;</hi>
                    and, in fact, it can hardly in those cases be described (without leading to some
                    confusion) as issuing in any other way. The form of the maxillae, together with
                    the apparent point of palpal issue, constitutes one of the most valuable
                    characters for the establishment of genera.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">palpi,</hi> issuing from the maxillae as just described,
                    are two (in both sexes of <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> and in the female sex of
                    <hi rend="italic">most</hi> species, leg-like) limbs, of five or (counting the
                    basal joint—maxilla—to which each is articulated) six joints; in the female
                    spider the palpi generally end with a single, and sometimes denticulate, curved
                    claw; in some instances, however, there is no terminal palpal claw; but in the
                    male, the third <hi rend="italic">(cubital)</hi> and fourth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(radial)</hi> joints of the palpi are (the former often, the latter always)
                    characterised by prominences, spiny apophyses, or protuberances, which furnish
                    some of the strongest, as well as most tangible, specific characters of that
                    sex; the last (or <hi rend="italic">digital)</hi> joint of each palpus (in the
                    male spider) is generally more or less <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n311/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0311-0292"/> concave, and always includes, either within its
                    concavity or articulated to its under side, a (frequently complex) congeries of
                    corneous lobes, spines, and spiny processes, in some instances articulated to
                    each other so as to be capable of being opened out as by hinges. These are not
                    developed until the spider arrives at maturity. Up to that period the digital
                    joint has a tumid and somewhat semi-diaphanous appearance, and, although
                    commonly smaller, bears the same general form that it has after maturity. These
                    processes, or, as they are called, <hi rend="italic">palpal organs,</hi> are
                    connected with the process of reproduction—the fecundation of the female. This
                    subject, however, we shall have occasion to refer to again. The palpi are
                    generally furnished more or less with hairs, bristles, and spines, like the
                    legs; and like them, also, are reproduced after accidental loss.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">labium</hi> is also another important portion of structure;
                    it is situated at the fore extremity of the sternum, between and in front of (or
                    rather beneath) the maxillae; it is of varied form and size, and stopping the
                    gap between the maxillae, it completes with them the inferior and lateral
                    boundaries of the mouth, the falces forming its upper limits. The labium is
                    always present, except in a new and very remarkable Brazilian spider, <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphantochilus Rogers™</hi> (Cambr.), in which the labium is
                    wanting, and yet not wanted, because the maxillae, in this instance, close up to
                    each other, leaving no gap between them.</p>
                <p>Between the labium and falces is another portion of structure, the <hi
                    rend="italic">tongue;</hi> it is, no doubt, by the aid. of this that the act of
                    swallowing the juices of insects, when expressed by the falces and maxillae, is
                    effected; that, in fact, the spider eats without being choked. No use hitherto
                    has been made of the tongue in spiders for purposes of classification, but the
                    form of the <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi> is very useful for the
                    characterisation of genera. These parts —falces, maxillae, labium, and
                    tongue—thus complete the mouth-parts of a spider.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi> has already been mentioned; its form varies
                    from oval to heart-shaped, and sometimes somewhat pentagonal; its convexity also
                    varies considerably; its use in classification is rather limited, but with its
                    clothing of hairs, bristles, or pubescence, or its sometimes glabrous nature, it
                    generally has some specific importance. In one known genus only, as mentioned
                    above, is the sternum wanting.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> is exceedingly varied in form in different
                    families; it is united to the cephalo-thorax by a short narrow pedicle, and
                    generally terminates writh organs for spinning; in one species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Liphistius</hi><hi rend="italic">desultor</hi> (?) (Schiödte), the
                    spinners are placed near the anterior part of the under side of the abdomen; and
                    in another, <hi rend="italic">Mutusca mammosa</hi> (Cambr.), one pair only are
                    so placed, the rest occupying the ordinary position. The number of spinners
                    varies— two, four, six, or eight; they are placed in pairs, and when a fourth
                    pair is present it is, usually as a single one, united throughout its length
                    (but with often a line of division visible), and occupying a transverse position
                    in front of the rest. It is but very lately that spiders have been observed with
                    two spinners only; see “Spiders of Palestine and Syria,” O. P. Cambridge, <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Zool. Soc.</hi> 1872, p. 260; <hi rend="italic">Ann. and.
                    Mag. N. H.</hi> 1870, pp., 414-417, <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">spinners</hi> consist of from one to three joints, and vary
                    greatly in size and structure, as well as in number, but their use in
                    classification has not hitherto been as great as might have been expected;
                    generally they are separate, but in <hi rend="italic">Tetrablemma</hi> (Cambr.)
                    they are enclosed in a kind of corneous sheath. Those of the fourth pair when
                    present (which they are in both sexes) are correlated, but in general only in
                    the female sex, with the calamistrum, or double series of curved bristles before
                    mentioned, on the metatarsi of the fourth pair of legs. The function of the
                    calamistrum has been proved by Mr Black wall to be the carding, or teasing and
                    curling, of a peculiar kind of silk, secreted and emitted from the fourth pair
                    of spinners; when thus prepared this silk becomes adhesive, from its minutely
                    divided and elastic fibres; and, disposed about the lines of the spiders’
                    snares, it renders more easy the entanglement and capture of their prey.
                    Immediately above the spinners is a small nipple-like prominence which indicates
                    the anal orifice.</p>
                <p>The abdomen is covered with a continuous integument neither annulate nor
                    segmentate; in one species, however (before mentioned), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liphistius</hi><hi rend="italic">desultor</hi> (Schiödte), the upper side has a
                    longitudinal series of transverse corneous plates, like those of the Phrynides;
                    and something of a similar kind, but less marked, is observable in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetrablemma medioculatum</hi> (Cambr.), a very rare and remarkable
                    little spider found in Ceylon. The epidermis of the abdomen is of various kinds
                    and consistency in different groups, sometimes excessively thin and tender, at
                    other times tough and coriaceous, and sometimes hard and horny, with a varied
                    armature and clothing of hairs, bristles, pubescence, tubercles, and spines,
                    sometimes being, however, perfectly bare and glabrous; its colours, also, and
                    the patterns produced by their distribution, vary exceedingly. Underneath the
                    fore extremity of the abdomen are placed tho external openings to the
                    respiratory organs; these apertures consist of a narrow slit or orifice under
                    the fore edge of round or oval scale-like plates, placed on each side of thα
                    median line; such plates are in some spiders four in number, but for the most
                    part only two. Other spiracular openings also exist in many spiders, both at the
                    anterior part of the under side (fig. 28, <hi rend="italic">t, t)</hi> and near
                    the spinners (Siebold), but these are usually far less perceptible than the
                    others before mentioned, and often discoverable with great difficulty. The
                    ordinary pair of spiracular plates are in general very conspicuous, commonly
                    differing in colour from the surrounding surface, and sometimes slightly
                    pubescent. They occupy each side of the median line at the extreme fore part of
                    the under side of the abdomen; and between them is, in the male spider, a very
                    minute orifice which leads to the seminal organs; while in the same situation in
                    the female is an aperture usually rather conspicuous, always of characteristic
                    form, and often furnished with a corneous process of greater or less
                    development. This aperture is the vulva, and the process (when present) probably
                    has the function of an ovipositor. The form and structure of this aperture is of
                    great use in the determination of species, but until the female spider attains
                    maturity no aperture at all is visible. The orifices to the breathing organs are
                    fringed with hairs or lashes, and open and close by an internal muscular
                    arrangement. The other pair of spiracular plates, when present, are in some
                    cases close behind those just above mentioned, but more commonly at some
                    distance further towards the hinder extremity of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>On the upper side of the abdomen may be seen in many spiders several impressed
                    spots or dots, differing in number and position in different genera and species,
                    but always placed symmetrically. These, considered by Treviranus as stigmatic
                    openings, are probably indicated points of fixture for muscles beneath the
                    integument, being apparently imperforate. Smaller puncture-like marks are also
                    often visible on the under side, and are perhaps similarly caused. The hairy
                    clothing of the abdomen (as well as of the cephalothorax and other parts),
                    variously tinted and coloured, gives the specific pattern to the spider from its
                    diversified distribution; and when such clothing is absent, the pattern is often
                    equally distinct and varied, arising in such cases from a pigment in the coats
                    of the integument itself.</p>

                    the Articulata. The muscles are formed of numerous parallel fibres traversed by
                    very marked striae; these muscles are attached to the different portions of the
                    tegumentary system, and move the various parts of the body by the contraction of
                    their fibres. Those which set in motion the falces, the maxillae, and the coxae
                    of the legs, are attached to the thorax, and radiate to all these parts from a
                    centre, marked externally by what has been before spoken of as the <hi
                    rend="italic">thoracic indentation,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fovea.</hi> The
                    other joints of the legs move, one after the other, by means of small and
                    exceedingly fine muscles, of the two kinds ordinarily known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >extensors,</hi> to raise the joint, and <hi rend="italic">flexors,</hi> to
                    lower it. All these muscles act with great rapidity, and enable the legs to move
                    in every direction according to the mode in which the various joints are
                    articulated. The differences in the relative strength and volume of the muscles
                    are very great; those, for instance, by which the fangs of the falces are moved
                    are exceedingly powerful; the abdomen being generally soft, its integument does
                    not furnish such firm points of attachment as that of the thoracic region, and
                    yet the spider can move its abdomen with the greatest ease in every direction.
                    Beneath the integument, at the fore part of the under side, two ligaments are
                    attached to a membranous plate, situated under the branchial operculum, and at
                    the hinder part, round the ring which encircles the spinneΛ and the anus. The
                    fore half of these ligaments is cartilaginous, while the hinder half is composed
                    of contractile muscular fibres, and by means of those muscles the spider moves
                    its abdomen. Two other pairs of muscles may also be particularly mentioned,—one
                    pair inserted under the membrane in the junctional pedicle, the other leading
                    round the respiratory organs: the office of these is to open or close the
                    branchial opercula, and to draw the sexual organs backwards or forwards. The
                    spinners are moved by special muscles similar to those of the legs. (Simon, <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Digestion</hi> consist of a large sac, or stomach
                    placed in the cavity of the cephalo-thorax, and fastened to its arch by a strong
                    muscle; this muscle passes round and through the stomachal sac; <hi
                    rend="italic">into</hi> the stomach a tube (oesophagus) leads from the mouth,
                    and <hi rend="italic">from</hi> it ten lateral branches or caeca (five on either
                    side) issue, passing down the sides to the origin of the legs, and, curving
                    round, end in a reservoir placed below the stomach. This reservoir is connected
                    with the stomach by the muscle mentioned above, and divided from it by a solid
                    plate into which this muscle is inserted; it, in fact, forms a kind of second or
                    lower stomach into which the juices forming the spider’s food are forced from
                    the upper one by muscular action.</p>
                <p>Out of the stomach the alimentary juices go into a tube or intestine, which is
                    much contracted in size in passing through the junctional pedicle into the
                    abdomen, but enlarges a little within the latter; this tube curves over for some
                    distance in a line parallel with the dorsal integument; it then drops down
                    suddenly, forming a large loop, and so passes into a large rounded pouch
                    (rectum), in which the undigested portions of food collect, and thence pass out
                    through the anus, situated, as before observed, at the extremity of the abdomen
                    just above the spinners. The abdominal intestine is imbedded in a mass of fatty
                    globules, from which bile is secreted; the bile passing by means of biliary
                    ducts (into which urinary organs also pour their contents) into the rectum.
                    Digestion is effected by means of a gastric juice secreted by appropriate glands
                    between the lateral caeca, and thence poured into the stomach (Simon, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> after Dugès).</p>
                <p>Walckenaer, <hi rend="italic">Ins. Apt.,</hi> following Treviranus, gives a
                    slightly different account of the digestive apparatus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tegenaria</hi><hi rend="italic">domestica</hi> ( ∖Valck. ) Probably a certain
                    amount of variation would be found in the details of form and structure of the
                    stomach and intestinal canal, and other organs of digestion, in different
                    species; but the general plan of the digestive arrangement is the same. It is an
                    undecided question whether the oesophagus of spiders can pass any substance
                    except the juices of their prey. See O. P. Cambridge in <hi rend="italic"

                    communicate with the pericardium by means of small elongated orifices
                    (auriculo-ventricles) placed at the constrictions where the chambers are
                    separated from each other; through these orifices the vital fluid passes <hi

                    heart. This latter operation is effected by the contraction of the heart, which
                    forces the fluid forwards into a tube or artery issuing from the first chamber;
                    this tube—aorta—passes through the junctional pedicle, and entering the thorax,
                    divides into three paire of arteries. The upper pair follow the dorsal line and
                    give off blood-vessels to the eyes, the falces, and other parts of the mouth;
                    the second pair, intended to give nourishment to those parts, pass over the
                    stomach; and the third are imbedded beneath that organ, and emit arteries to the
                    legs, extending to the very extremity of each. These three pairs of arteries
                    reunite forwards and form a collar round the cerebral ganglion; and from thence
                    a tube<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Claparède could

                    continuing quite to the spinners; this tube furnishes numerous branches to the
                    organs which it passes in its course. From the general circulation the vital
                    fluid is brought into two large longitudinal reservoirs within the lower face of
                    the abdomen, by means of sinuses or canals formed by the interstices of the
                    muscles; these anastomose and pour their contents into the reservoirs just above

                    contractions and dilatations appear to be the means by which the fluid is
                    propelled through the sinuses that bring it to the branchial organs for
                    oxygenation (Simon, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> after Emile Blanchard, and
                    Dugès).</p>
                <p>As has been already observed in several notes, there is some difference between
                    the above account of the circulatory system and that given by Claparède;
                    probably the organs of circulation vary somewhat in different species. One point
                    of difference, however, between the above and Claparède’s description is of
                    importance, that is, the difference which is mentioned in note (4) below. The
                    idea that the blood “penetrates” the branchial organs may have been led up to by
                    the apparently unfounded, but confidently pronounced opinion that these organs
                    were true analogues of the lungs of the Vertebrata; whereas, if the blood does
                    not penetrate them, but is merely oxygenated in its general passage by and round
                    them, their real tracheary nature (as seems to be the better opinion now) is
                    strongly confirmed; and hence the hitherto widely-received division of Arachnids
                    into <hi rend="italic">pulmonary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tracheary,</hi>
                    based upon the idea of the distinct nature of the pulmo-branchiae from the
                    tracheae, falls to the ground; the more especially since, whatever the
                    difference may be between the ordinary tracheae and the pulmo-branchiae, both
                    are found in the same individual, in the order we are now considering
                    —Araneidea.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organs of Respiration.—</hi> From what has just been said, it
                    seems hardly proper to base any definition of the respiratory organs of spiders
                    on the supposed essential distinction between the pulmo-branchiae and tracheae.
                    Such difference as there is, and it is indeed an important one, seems to be
                    this, that whereas the tracheae are lengthened tubes, which convey the air in
                    very small volumes to different parts of the body, and so oxygenate the vital
                    fluid in its passage, the pulmo-branchiae are modified tracheae, localising, so
                    to speak, within a peculiarly furnished sac, a considerable volume of air in the
                    immediate course of the large sinuses, in which the used-up vital fluid is
                    re-collected previous to its return to the dorsal vessel. This arrangement, no
                    doubt, marks a higher state of organisation than is possessed by those
                    Articulata furnished with merely simple tracheae; it is a progress from a
                    diffused to a localised system, but still it seems essentially distinct from the
                    lungs of vertebrates, in which the <hi rend="italic">blood is carried to the air
                    and permeates every portion of the air-vessels,</hi> and not the air to the
                    blood, as is really the case in regard to both the pulmo-branchiae and tracheae
                    of spiders. It is not a matter, perhaps, of prime importance, but if the above
                    views be correct, it would seem better to relinquish the name of
                    pulmo-branchiae, since there is not only no real analogy to the lungs of a <pb

                    fish. We would propose, therefore, to distinguish these modified and localised
                    tracheal sacs by the name of <hi rend="italic">sac-tracheae,</hi> the ordinary
                    ones being designated <hi rend="italic">tube-tracheae.</hi></p>
                <p>In some spiders, Theraphosides (including the giant spiders of the family better
                    known as Mygalides), the respiratory organs are solely sac-tracheae; these are
                    in this case four in number, and placed in two pairs on the lower side of the
                    abdomen. Their external orifices are protected by spiracular plates (as before
                    noticed); in other spiders there is, close in front of each of the fore-pair of
                    sac-tracheae, an orifice leading to tube-tracheae. In some few spiders a kind of
                    supernumerary spiracular slit or opening is visible near to the ordinary one,
                    but not always similarly placed. A pair of others are also visible close behind
                    the sexual aperture in <hi rend="italic">Cambridgea fasdata</hi> (L. Koch) (fig.
                    27, <hi rend="italic">t, t).</hi> These openings probably lead to other tube
                    tracheae. We have also noticed slit-like openings similar to those above

                    exist, according to Siebold, near the spinners. The sac-tracheae of spiders are
                    of the same construction as the organs described as pulmo-branchiae in the
                    family Scorpionides. The following short description is abstracted from E.
                    Simon, <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> following
                    Emile Blanchard:—“The respiratory apparatus is contained in sacs beneath the
                    stigmata; these sacs are globular and flattened, formed by a silvery white
                    membrane. Each of them contains a body not fastened to the walls of the sac, but
                    lodged as in a chamber; this body is composed of sixty or seventy plates
                    (lamellae) lying one upon another like the leaves of a book. Each one of these
                    apparent <hi rend="italic">plates</hi> is in fact itself a flattened sac, with
                    an opening on its lower side communicating with the outer air admitted through
                    the spiracular orifices. The walls of these numerous sacciform lamellae consist
                    of two membranes of different composition, the inner one hard, the other soft,
                    and between them is a very fine strong network analogous to the spiral thread of
                    the tracheae of insects.”</p>
                <p>The inspiration and expiration of air in these sac-tracheae are effected in a
                    very simple manner. To the outer wall of the sac a broad, and strong ligament is
                    attached; this ligament ascends across the abdomen, and is fixed to the walls of
                    the heart. Each movement of this organ, diastole or systole, strains or slackens
                    the ligament, which in its turn raises or lowers the tracheal sac, and by these
                    means the air is either drawn into or expressed from it (E. Simon, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> after E. Blanchard). t. ^ '.</p>

                    on each side, there are, in the Araneidea, four pairs of spiracles (four on each
                    side of the cephalo-thorax) situated immediately above the insertions of the
                    legs. He also notes four stigmata (in two pairs) on the upper Bide of the
                    abdomen, and a pair on the under side; the former undoubtedly exist, in some
                    species at least, but the latter appear to be imperforate, and are probably only
                    points of muscular attachment. It does not appear that the tracheae leading from
                    the thoracic spiracles have ever been traced; they are, perhaps, exceedingly
                    delicate in their walls, and probably of no great length, and hence after death,
                    when the air has left them, they would be exceedingly difficult to detect. There
                    remains much, doubtless, to be yet discovered in regard to these and other
                    minute details of the internal organisation of spiders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Nervous System.—</hi> In the order <hi rend="italic">A
                    caridea,</hi> as it has been above observed, the nervous matter is concentrated
                    into one large mass or ganglion, whence it branches out to the rest of the body.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Pycnogonidca</hi> the nervous system consists of a
                    longitudinal series of large ganglia, of which the four abdominal ones are
                    sessile. In the <hi rend="italic">Scorpionides,</hi> also, it consists of a
                    longitudinal series of eight ganglia distributed throughout the whole body, and
                    united by a triple nervous chord; and now in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Araneidea</hi> (as in the <hi rend="italic">Solpugidea, Thelyphonidea
                    (Phrynides),</hi> and indeed in the <hi rend="italic">Phalangidea</hi> also), we
                    seem to have a compound of these two modifications. Thus, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Araneidea</hi> the nervous matter is, in general, concentrated
                    into two masses, one placed within the fore part of the cephalo-thorax, just
                    above the oesophagus; this (the cephalic or so-called cerebral) ganglion sends
                    out fine nervous threads to the eyes, falces, and labium; the other mass
                    (thoracic ganglion) is situated just behind the former, and occupies a large
                    portion of the thoracic cavity; it is of a flattened disc shape, and is united
                    to the cephalic ganglion by short but broad connectors, forming a narrow collar
                    round the oesophagus. This thoracic ganglion is formed by an approximation and
                    soldering together of the different ganglia which exist separately in the
                    scorpions. A proof of this is furnished by the fact, that in the young of some
                    of the Araneidea, furrows of greater or less depth show the junctional points of
                    the different ganglia.</p>
                <p>From the thoracic ganglion lateral nerves issue to the legs and palpi; besides
                    which a fascia of nerves runs backwards through the pedicle into the abdomen,
                    and these subdividing, branch out to all its different organs (Simon, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.)</hi> A modification of the above exists in the
                    Theraphosides, where there is a special enlargement, or ganglion, just within
                    the fore part of the abdomen, before the nervous fascia subdivides and branches
                    oiιt into that part of the body; probably this modification would be met with
                    also in many other spiders (Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic">An. Kingdom,</hi> pl. 2,
                    Arachnides; and Treviranus, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> pl. 5, fig. 45).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Organs of Reproduction</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >female</hi> consist of two long ovaria placed longitudinally within the ventral
                    surface of the abdomen; these unite and form a short broad oviduct, having aD
                    external opening of various form beneath the upper end of the abdomen between
                    the spiracular orifices, as before noted under the head of external
                    structure.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">male</hi> the organs for the secretion of the seminal
                    fluid consist of two long narrow convoluted tubes, occupying the same relative
                    situation as the ovaria in the female, and also opening outwardly through a
                    common but exceedingly minute orifice in a similar position. No intromittent
                    organ has been discovered in any instance; and it is not long since that the
                    probable way in which the impregnation of the female takes place (at least in
                    some cases) has been at all certainly noted. It has been before remarked that
                    the peculiar corneous lobes and spiny processes connected with the digital joint
                    of the palpi—palpal organs<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and their development (unmistakable when complete), is an unerring sign of the

                    rounded and tumid, but it can even then seldom be mistaken for that of a female

                    araneologists were not (and probably are not now) agreed as to their real office
                    in generation. A distinguished author, Mr John Blackwall, went so far as to
                    prove, as he believed, by a series of carefully conducted experiments, that the
                    seminal organs of the male spider, above described, are in some cases wholly
                    unnecessary for the impregnation of the female—at least so far as any external
                    use or application is concerned—and that the palpal organs are the efficient
                    agents in the impregnation of the female spider <hi rend="italic">(Report of
                    Brit. Assoc.</hi> 1844, pp. 68, 69). This, however, seemed to be contrary to all
                    reason and analogy, and led to the hypothesis that there was some communication
                    by a duct or ducts between the spermatic vessels in the abdomen and the palpal
                    organs (Hermann, 1868; <hi rend="italic">Verhandlung</hi><hi rend="italic">d.
                    Zool. Bot. Gesellsch. in JVicn,</hi> xviii. pp. 923, <hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">seq.)</hi> This idea, however, appeared to be
                    negatived by the failure of Dugès and other eminent anatomists to discover any
                    duct in the palpus, where, if present, it would be comparatively easy to find.
                    Another hypothesis— grounded on the fact that the palpal organs have in some
                    cases been observed to be applied repeatedly to the mouth between their numerous
                    applications to the vulva—was, that there might be some duct through which the
                    spermatic fluid could pass into the alimentary canal, and so be conveyed to the
                    oesophagus, and thus be taken from the mouth by means of the above-mentioned
                    application to it of the palpi. The discharge of the spermatic fluid in birds
                    into the lower intestine appeared to support the possibility of this hypothesis
                    being true (O. P. Cambridge, <hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >N.</hi><hi rend="italic">Z. Instit.,</hi> vol. vi. 1873, p. 190). Another
                    opinion, long since, and even now, held by some arachnologists, is that the male
                    spider collects the seminal fluid with its palpal organs into the concavity of
                    the digital joint from the minute orifice above noted; but no instance has ever
                    been noticed in which a spider has been detected in such an employment of its
                    palpi. An instance has been recorded in which there were <hi rend="italic"
                    >during copulation</hi> (?) repeated embraces, and at each embrace a perfect
                    apparent coition was effected between the sexual apertures of the male and
                    female spider, the palpi not being used at all (0. P. Cambridge, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> p. 191). Other arachnologists, again, have recently
                    observed that the male spider before the act of copulation “emits from the
                    sexual aperture a drop of sperma on a kind of small web made for the puιpose,
                    which drop he then takes up in the genital bulb of the palpi” (A. Menge, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ueber die Lebensw. d. Arachn.</hi> p. 36; and A. Äusserer, <hi
                    rend="italic">Beob. ueber die Lebensw.</hi><hi rend="italic">der Spinnen,</hi>
                    p. 194). This would appear to settle the question; but while, at the same time,
                    it is remarkable that an observer so accurate in observation and so painstaking
                    as Mr Blackwall should never have observed male spiders taking the spermatic
                    fluid from the abdominal aperture, as stated by Menge some thirty years ago, it
                    is also remarkable that Mr Blackwall should unconsciously afford the strongest
                    evidence in favour of the facts mentioned by Menge and Äusserer.</p>
                <p>Dugès, in suggesting, long since, that the male spider took the seminal fluid
                    from the aperture in the abdomen with its palpi, asked whether the palpal organs
                    may not alternately act as an absorbing siphon and an ejaculatory organ. Mr
                    Blackwall <hi rend="italic">(Jour. Linn. Soc.</hi>, vii.) mentions this question
                    of Dugès, and then states a fact which at once answers the first part of it in
                    the affirmative, and tends to confirm <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0314-0295"/> Menge’s and Ausserer’s statement: “A male <hi
                    rend="italic">Agelena</hi><hi rend="italic">labyrinthica</hi> confined in a
                    phial, spun a small web, and among the lines of which it was composed I
                    perceived that a drop of white milk-like fluid was suspended; how it had been
                    deposited there I cannot explain, but I observed that the spider, by the
                    alternate application of its palpal organs, speedily imbibed the whole of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>That the spermatic fluid is conveyed to the female parts of generation by the
                    male palpi is thus pretty certain; and it seems not improbable that there are
                    more modes than one by which the palpi are supplied with the fluid. See also
                    critical observations on this subject by Dr. T. Thorell, 1873, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Before concluding our remarks on the internal structure of the Araneidea, two of
                    their special properties must be shortly noticed—the secretion of the poison
                    injected into the wounds made by the fangs of the falces, and the secretion of
                    the matter emitted as silken threads through the spinning organs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">poison</hi> is secreted in two small elongated sacs (one
                    for each of the falces), situated within the cephalothorax on either side of the
                    alimentary canal; the sacs are connected with a membranous channel in each of
                    the falces, the channel running completely through the fang, from an orifice
                    near the end of which the poison is pressed out by the spider in the act of
                    wounding its prey. On the venomous nature of the poison some remarks have
                    already been made. As to its venom in British spiders, see “Blackwall’s
                    Experiments,” <hi rend="italic">Trans. Linn. Soc.,</hi> xxi. pp. 31-37. The
                    result of these interesting experiments is contrary to the generally received
                    idea as to the great virulence of spider poison.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">external spinning organs</hi> have been mentioned above;
                    they are usually called <hi rend="italic">spinners,</hi> and are various in
                    size, both actual and relative, in form and in structure, as well as in number.
                    From the extremity of each of these organs the silk matter issues through
                    numerous movable papilla, or <hi rend="italic">spinnerets,</hi> which are
                    similar to hollow bristles with enlarged bases; the papillae vary both in form
                    and number in different species, and from each spinneret or papilla issues an
                    exceedingly fine thread; this, uniting with threads from all the other papillae,
                    forms the ordinary silk line, which though to ordinary observation simple, is
                    composed of numberless threads from some one, or all, of the spinners. The
                    matter from which the silk is formed is secreted in organs (silk-glands)
                    situated within the ventral surface of the hinder part of the abdomen. These
                    glands vary in number, size, and form in different species; they differ also in
                    size and shape in the same species, for the secretion of different qualities of
                    silk-matter; and each gland has a distinct duct terminating at the extremity of
                    the spinners. The emission of silk matter appears certainly to be a voluntary
                    act on the part of the spider; but it is a disputed question among
                    arachnologists, whether spiders have the power forcibly to expel it, or whether
                    it is merely drawn from the spinnerets by some external force or other. Mr
                    Blackwall <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Linn. Soc.,</hi> xv. p. 455; <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches in Zoology,</hi> pp. 242-248, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland,</hi> p. 12) is of the latter
                    opinion; while Mr R. H. Meade (of Bradford, Yorkshire), in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Report of British Assoc.,</hi> 1858, pp. 157-164, pl. 16, thinks that (from
                    microscopic anatomical investigations which he has himself made) there is good
                    evidence of spiders having the power to expel it, for he finds a certain
                    muscular arrangement which would apparently suffice to give this power, and
                    observers have actually seen the lines propelled. Mr Meade, however, need not be
                    assumed to assert an indefinite power to expel threads of silk to any indefinite
                    distance. The truth probably is, that spiders have, and do exercise, a general
                    power not only of <hi rend="italic">emitting</hi> silk matter from the secreting
                    glands merely to and from the external orifices of the silktubes, but also of
                    <hi rend="italic">propelling</hi> it when necessary to some short distances; and
                    that external causes (such as the movement of the spider while the end of its
                    line is fixed, or when a current of air takes an emitted line and carries it in
                    a direction contrary to that of the spider) also serve to draw the threads out.
                    In all these ways, no doubt, are produced the gossamer lines which often cover
                    the surface of the ground and herbage in autumn. In the formation of their
                    snares spiders use the hinder or fourth pair of legs for drawing the threads
                    tight, and apparently for ascertaining their power of tension. The third, or
                    inferior tarsal claw, being usually strongly bent, no doubt enables spiders to
                    perform these operations very readily. Some large groups of spiders do not spin
                    any snares, and in them we usually find this third claw absent; while in one
                    group, Epeïrides, whose snares are marvels of beauty and ingenuity, the third
                    claw is very highly developed.</p>
                <p>The snares of spiders have been made the basis of some of the primary divisions
                    of the order. Characters, however, taken merely from habits and modes of life,
                    can hardly be considered those on which systematic classification should be
                    based, not to mention that those characters fail when we come to extensive
                    groups spinning no snares at all. Short of such a use of the snares of spiders,
                    this part of the subject is of extreme interest and importance. The Latreillian
                    divisions of snares is fairly and generally accurate; by this method they are
                    divided into— <hi rend="italic">Orbitelarioe,</hi> where the plan is that of a
                    circle or a portion of one, with lines radiating from a centre; <hi
                    rend="italic">Retitelarioe,</hi> where a thin sheet of web is suspended among
                    the branches of shrubs or in angles of buildings, and held up and down by lines
                    in all directions above and below; <hi rend="italic">Tubitelarioe,</hi> where
                    the snare is a silken tube, inserted in crevices, and fissures, and casual
                    holes, and with an open mouth more or less guarded or armed with insidious
                    lines; and <hi rend="italic">Territelariae,</hi> in which a tube is spun in a
                    hole formed by the spider itself, and closed sometimes by a close fitting
                    cork-like, or sometimes by a scale-like or wafer lid, sometimes left open, and
                    at other times closed by the falling over of a portion of the tube which
                    protrudes from the surface of the ground (see <hi rend="italic">Trapdoor
                    Spiders,</hi> by J. T. Moggridge, Lovell Reeve, London, 1873-4). With respect to
                    the economic or mercantile value of spider silk, the idea seems to have been
                    entertained, from a remote period, that it might not only be turned to practical
                    use in the manufacture of silk fabrics, but also be made to pay as a mercantile
                    speculation. The possibility of making it into articles of wear is undoubted, as
                    instances of it are on record. Upwards of 150 years ago Le Bon of France
                    (Languedoc) obtained, from spiders, silk which was afterwards woven into gloves
                    and stockings; but Réaumur, appointed by the French Academy to investigate the
                    matter, reported unfavourably, doubting the possibility of rearing the spiders
                    together owing to their voracious and cannibal propensities. In 1777 and 1778 a
                    Spaniard, Raimondo Maria de Termeyer, published, in Italian periodicals, two
                    memoirs on the subject; and afterwards, 1810, at Milan, another called <hi
                    rend="italic">Ricerche e Sperimenti sulla Seta de Ragne,</hi> in which he takes
                    an opposite view to that of Réaumur. The latter work is of great rarity <hi

                    Mag.,</hi> xxxiv. p. 455). Termeyer constructed a small kind of stocks, in which
                    the spider was fixed by the body, while with a little winding-machine he drew
                    out and wound up the silk threads from the spider’s spinnerets; but evidently
                    nothing came of this further than an additional proof of the possibility of
                    procuring and making use of spider silk, as well as of its strength and lustre;
                    this last, however, as well as other qualities of the silk, would probably be
                    found, as with that of various silk worms, to vary according to the species.
                    Other experiments, with a similar general result, have been made since <hi

                    mercantile importance of spiders’ silk appears to have hitherto elicited only an
                    unfavourable answer. Dr Wilder, however, is still sanguine upon the point <hi

                    that small birds are sometimes entangled in its webs, and that the ladies of

                <p>Before leaving this part of the subject, we must notice the office of the <hi
                    rend="italic">calamistrum,</hi> mentioned before in speaking of the armature of
                    the legs of spiders. This instrument is found in the females of various genera
                    and families; it consists usually of a closely set double row of curved
                    spine-like bristles on the upper sides of the metatarsi of the fourth pair of
                    legs, forming a kind of comb, whence Mr Blackwall, by whom it was first
                    discovered and its use perceived, gave it the name it bears. Its office is to
                    card, or curl, or tease a particular kind of silk emitted from the supernumerary
                    spinners, mentioned above as always, in the female, correlated with this
                    instrument; the silk so curled and carded is, owing to the fineness of its
                    fibres, exceedingly prehensile, and being disposed about the lines of the
                    spider’s snare, serves to entangle the insects which come in contact with it <hi

                    (Koch) are common house spiders whose webs are thus furnished with carded silk
                    from the supernumerary spinners. Doubts have been entertained quite lately by an
                    eminent araneologist as to whether the supernumerary spinners are indeed true
                    spinning organs (T. Thorell, <hi rend="italic">Synonyms of European
                    Spiders,</hi> p. 595, 1873). It is therefore interesting to find in <hi
                    rend="italic">Science Gossip</hi> (Hard-wicke, London, Sept. 1874), a short
                    article by H. J. Underhill, in which the anatomy of these spinners is described
                    and figured from original microscopic investigations, proving the recorded
                    observations of Mr Blackwall, and others also, as to their being true spinners,
                    to be correct.</p>
                <p>The white flake-like flocculi often seen floating in the air on a calm autumnal
                    afternoon are composed of spider silk emitted by numerous immature spiders, of
                    many species and genera, passing through the air on their lines, which being so
                    much lighter than the atmosphere, serve to bear them away with every breath of
                    wind. The flocculi appear to be agglomérations of fine lines, adhesive from
                    their fineness and fibrous nature. In this respect they differ from the ordinary
                    gossamer lines, which are merely the threads left by small and immature spiders
                    (chiefly of one or two families,) as they pass from blade to blade and plant to
                    plant. It seems probable that nearly all spiders leave a line or lines, which
                    proceed from one or more of their spinners, whenever and wherever they move
                    about; and the setting in of fine weather being the signal for a spontaneous
                    restlessness, we can hence better understand the almost sudden appearance of
                    myriads of lines stretching over the surface of the earth, and often extending
                    high up into the air. Numerous papers have been written on gossamer, chiefly by
                    German and French writers, with the latter of whom the subject has been
                    sometimes treated on the basis of the marvellous and superstitious. These lines
                    are called by them <hi rend="italic">fils de la Vierge.</hi></p>

                    within every one’s reach. The following notes, however, gathered from the works
                    of Mr Blackwall and others, as well as from the writer’s own observations, may
                    be of interest :—</p>
                <p>The geometric spiders <hi rend="italic">(Orbitélarioe)</hi> are almost the only
                    ones whose method of forming a snare have been at all minutely recorded. When
                    the situation for the snare has been chosen, the area intended to be filled up
                    by it is enclosed by various circumferential boundary lines, fixed to adjacent
                    objects, the exact shape of the area being influenced by the situation and
                    surrounding circumstances. A diagonal thread is then spun across it, and from
                    about the central point of this thread another is carried to the marginal line;
                    returning to the central point along the line just spun from it, the spider
                    carries another line to the margin, and fixes it at a short distance from the
                    first. In this way the whole area is gradually filled up, the spider always
                    returning to the centre along the last line spun, and starting again thence
                    fixes a fresh one to the boundary line of the snare. The form of the snare is
                    now that of a wheel; the next operation is to cross the radii of the wheel with
                    ladder-like lines; this the spider does, beginning from the centre and working
                    towards the circumference, with a single spiral line, which is fixed, or glued,
                    with a minute portion of viscid matter, to each of the radii as it crosses by an
                    application of the spinners; at some distance from the centre this spiral line
                    is discontinued and another is begun; this is formed of quite a different kind
                    of silk matter, being viscid, and retaining its viscidity in the form of “minute
                    dew-like globules closely studding the line.” It appears that when the viscid
                    lines, intended for the capture of its prey, are completed, the spider cuts away
                    the first, or unadhesive line, which is of no service in the entanglement of
                    insects, its office appearing to be chiefly to strengthen the snare while the
                    viscid line is being spun, and to enable the spider to traverse the parts with
                    greater ease. Modifications of the above method are, no doubt, adopted by some
                    species, but, substantially, it is believed that most orbicular snares are thus
                    constructed.</p>
                <p>The mode of formation of the snares of the <hi rend="italic">Retitelariae</hi>
                    does not appear to have been observed, probably owing to their being made almost
                    wholly during the night. The snare of one of these spiders, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Linyphia</hi><hi rend="italic">marginata</hi> (BL), is an exceedingly perfect
                    one of its kind, and abundant in most localities; it consists of a thin
                    horizontal sheet of web, suspended among the branches of low evergreen trees and
                    shrubs, by a maze of intersecting lines above, and held down firmly, on the
                    under side, by some short, tightly-strained perpendicular lines, fixed below to
                    others, which traverse each other in all directions; beneath the horizontal
                    sheet of web, head downwards, the spider remains patiently watching for such
                    insects as may become entangled in the upper maze of lines. The mode in which
                    the horizontal web is suspended and braced down, would, without doubt, if it
                    could be observed, prove to be a point of great interest.</p>

                    adhesive flocculus, drawn from the fourth pair of spinners by the “calamistrum,”
                    and disposed about the irregularly intersecting lines <pb break="no"

                    walls, in crevices, between portions of detached rock, and other similar
                    situations. The adhesive flocculus serves to entangle insects, and makes them an
                    easy prey to the spider who lies in wait not far off, having formed a
                    funnel-shaped tube of slight texture from its place of concealment to its
                    snare.</p>
                <p>With regard to the formation of the snares of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Territelarioe,</hi> Mr Gosse has an interesting passage in <hi rend="italic">A
                    Naturalist’s Sojourn in Jamaica;</hi> it is, however, too long for quotation
                    here. Mr Moggridge also <hi rend="italic">(l.c. infra}</hi> has some details
                    respecting the formation and repair of their neste by trapdoor spiders in
                    confinement. The chief point of interest, however, in regard to trapdoor snares,
                    is whether the hinged lid is formed in one continuous piece with the tube, and
                    then cut out, leaving a portion unsevered to form the hinge, or whether the lid
                    is made separately, except in that part intended for the hinge. Neither Mr Gosse
                    nor Mr Moggridge enter into this question, though Mr Moggridge indeed speaks
                    (Z.c, p. 118) of his belief that, when all is completed, the spider cuts away
                    certain threads by which the door is supported on either side of the hinge. The
                    present writer was once told by a gentleman who had formerly resided in the West
                    Indies, that trapdoor spiders there invariably make the tube and lid of one
                    continuous, solid, homogeneous piece, and then cut out the lid with the falces.
                    This account, especially as coming from a non-naturalist, seemed improbable—a
                    spider’s falces being in no way, apparently, fitted for such an operation; if,
                    however, the fact be that the lid, instead of being of one solid piece with the
                    tube, is merely connected with it by a few supporting threads (in accordance
                    with Mr Moggridge’s belief), these could easily be torn away by the spider’s
                    falces, and the lid would be left free, except at the point where the hinge is
                    formed.</p>

                    space to go into detail upon this wide portion of the subject; it must suffice
                    to say that the order Araneidea may at present be divided into about thirty -

                    the position of the eyes, the form of the maxillae and labium, the number and
                    structure of the spinners, and some other details. The species are very
                    numerous; probably not a tithe of the existing ones are yet described. In one
                    family alone, <hi rend="italic">Salticides,</hi> nearly a thousand are

                <p>As in all other creatures, differences of colour and markings, as well as
                    integumental clothing and armature, serve to distinguish the species—the latter,
                    too, are at times of generic value; but with regard to spiders particularly, in
                    order to determine their species, it is very essential to obtain comparative
                    dimensions from different portions of structure; thus the position of the eyes
                    on the fore part of the caput furnishes us with the <hi rend="italic"

                    margin of the caput and the anterior eyes nearest to the medial line. The
                    comparative extent of these parts is of great importance as specific characters,
                    and they are easily observed; that part of the facial space occupied by the eyes

                    spiders when adult may, with few exceptions, be certainly distinguished in

                    organs, the development of the latter being an infallible criterion of maturity.
                    <hi rend="italic">Female</hi> spiders, again, may, in numerous cases, be as
                    certainly distinguished by the form and structure of the genital aperture,

                    aperture is never externally “perforate” until the last moult of the spider, and
                    its full development is therefore an unerring criterion of the maturity of the

                    appears to have been certainly ascertained; but the late Mr Richard Beck has an
                    interesting paper upon the subject in <hi rend="italic">Entomologist,</hi> Lond.
                    1866, vol. iii. p. 246. He suggests that the fine and delicate hairs of some
                    spiders’ legs may convey sounds to them. With regard to the sense of <hi
                    rend="italic">taste</hi> we may well conclude that spiders have this sense in
                    considerable perfection, in the possession of a well-developed membranous
                    tongue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">General Remarks.</hi> —Spiders are to be found more or less
                    abundantly in every part of the world and in almost every conceivable position;
                    even subterranean caves, such as those of Adelsberg and the Island of Lesina,
                    are tenanted by species peculiarly adapted by the absence of eyes to their dark
                    and gloomy abodes. Less repulsive and forbidding in appearance than most others
                    of the Arachnida, the Araneidea are often extremely interesting in their habits.
                    Being almost exclusively feeders on the insect tribes, they are consequently
                    endowed with proportionate craftiness and skill; this is shown remarkably in the
                    construction of their snares and dwellings. The “trapdoor spider” has always
                    been one of note in popular works on spiders’ habits, and certainly the details
                    of several different types of the trapdoor tubular nest, with the habits of the
                    several species to which they belong, lately published by Mr Traherne
                    Moggridge,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Harvesting Ants and Trapdoor Spiders,</hi> Lovell Reeve, 1872,
                    with supplementary vol. 1874, illustrated with numerous plates.</p></note> are
                    of the greatest interest and importance. The typical trapdoor nest is a
                    cylindrical hole in the earth excavated by the spider itself, lined with silk
                    and closed by a lid, which fits like a valve or cork into the opening at the
                    surface and opening by a strong elastic silken hinge, the spring of which closes
                    it again with some slight force. Many spiders, however, live a vagabond life,
                    and capture their prey without the aid of a snare, by springing on it unaw ares,
                    or, in some cases, running it fairly down in open view; yet craft and skill are
                    equally apparent, whatever be their mode of life and subsistence.</p>
                <p>To say that spiders are less repulsive and forbidding in appearance than other
                    Arachnids, is to do them but scanty justice, for numbers of species of various
                    genera—notably among the Salticides, or jumping spiders—are unsurpassed by
                    insects of any order, in respect both to brilliancy of colouring and the designs
                    formed by its distribution. Some of the curious and delicate little species of
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Argyrodes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ariamnes</hi>
                    are perfect marvels of metallic brilliancy and beauty. These little spiders are
                    found living as quasi parasites, in the outskirts of the webs of the larger
                    exotic epeïrids, and appear to live on the smaller insects caught in them;
                    probably also spinning irregular snares of their own among the lines of the
                    larger snare. In external appearance the young of spiders do not differ greatly
                    from the adults, except in being generally more distinct in colour and markings;
                    in some species the characteristic markings can seldom be w ell traced except in
                    immature examples. The cocoons or nests in which some spiders deposit their eggs
                    are very beautiful, as w ell as varied and characteristic in form; that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ero variegata</hi> (Bl.), a little spider not uncommon in England,
                    w ould arrest the attention of even an indifferent person; it is of an elegant
                    pear shape, formed of a strong yellow-brown silk network, and attached by a long
                    elastic stem, of the same material, to stalks of dead grass, sticks, or other
                    substances, in shady places. Another, made by a larger spider, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agro'éca</hi><hi rend="italic">brunnea</hi> (Bl.), is of a truncated pear
                    shape, formed of a continuous white silk fabric, and attached to blades and
                    stalks of living grass and rushes, by a short pedicle; it must, however, be seen
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0317-0298"/> soon after it is made, for the maker, as if
                    prescient of the attraction of such a beautiful little object, hastens to daub
                    it over thickly with a coat of mud or clay, which completely conceals its
                    structure and beauty.</p>
                <p>Spiders vary greatly in their relative fertility; probably many species are rare
                    owing to a limited fecundity. The egg sac of <hi rend="italic">Agroëca</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">brunnea</hi> (Bl.) contains about forty or fifty eggs, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Xysticus</hi><hi rend="italic">claveatus</hi> (Walck.) about
                    twenty, that of <hi rend="italic">Ero variegata</hi> (Bl.) not so many, while
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Oonops</hi><hi rend="italic">pulcher</hi> (Tempi.)
                    contains usually no more than two. Some spiders, however, perhaps most,
                    construct more than one cocoon.</p>
                <p>From their mode of life spiders attain (as we should naturally suppose) their
                    largest size, and are found in their greatest profusion, in the tropical
                    regions; while in more temperate climates, where the members of the insect
                    tribes are smaller and their species fewer, we find spiders in general of
                    comparatively smaller dimensions and less numerous in species. One of the
                    largest known spiders, <hi rend="italic">Eurypelma Klugii</hi> (Koch),—Fam.
                    Theraphosides—found in Brazil, measures upwards of two and a half inches in
                    length, with legs nine inches and upwards in span; while the smallest known
                    spider, <hi rend="italic">Walckenaëra</hi><hi rend="italic">diceros</hi>
                    (Cambr.), found in England, is but -⅛th of an inch in length. Tropical
                    countries, however, although some of their spiders are giants, have numbers of
                    small size. Numerous species have been procured from Ceylon measuring no more
                    than from ∙⅛th to - <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi>-θth of an inch in length.</p>
                <p>Spiders, besides being skilful and crafty, are very cleanly; one of our common
                    Saltici, <hi rend="italic">Epiblema</hi><hi rend="italic">histrionica</hi>
                    (Koch), may often be seen brushing and cleaning its forehead and eyes with its
                    hairy palpi, as a cat uses its paws for a similar purpose. Probably most
                    spiders, like the Crustacea, have the faculty of reproducing a lost limb.
                    Instances of this are numerous (see Mr Blackwall’s experiments, <hi
                    rend="italic">Report of British Association</hi> before cited), but a reproduced
                    limb is seldom or never equal to the original one in size; this accounts for the
                    frequency of examples captured with one or more legs, or a palpus, of dwarfed
                    and stunted dimensions. Many spiders show great attachment to their eggs and
                    young. The female Lycosa will seize her egg sac again and again if it be taken
                    from her, only relinquishing it at last when apparently convinced of the
                    hopelessness of retaining it. A pretty little spider, not rare among weeds and
                    garden plants, <hi rend="italic">Theridion carolinum</hi> (Walck.), carries its
                    egg cocoon within its legs, and searches for it anxiously if compelled to drop
                    it. Many also of the genus <hi rend="italic">Clubiona,</hi> as well as others,
                    brood over their eggs and tend upon their young until they disperse to find
                    their own means of subsistence. The food of very young spiders is probably
                    wholly derived from the moisture of the atmosphere. Spiders are great drinkers,
                    and suffer severely from drought. Mr Blackwall relates that an emaciated,
                    half-dead example of <hi rend="italic">Micaria nitens</hi> (BL) grew immediately
                    plump and strong after a draught of water.</p>
                <p>In speaking of the better qualities of spiders, their attachment to their young,
                    and the frequent fondness for each other evidenced by the apparently happy life
                    of the male and female of some species in the same web, we must not overlook the
                    other side of the picture. It has been well authenticated that in some species
                    of Epeïrides the female will seize and devour the male even immediately after
                    the exercise of his natural office, which indeed he has to undertake with great
                    circumspection and care to be able to accomplish at all. From this propensity of
                    the female, we may account for the gradual lessening in size of some male
                    spiders in comparison with that of the females, by a kind of sexual selection,
                    since it is obvious that the smaller the male the better his chance of escape
                    (see O. P. Cambridge in <hi rend="italic">Zoologist,</hi> 1868, p. 216, and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Pro</hi><hi rend="italic">ceedings Zool. Soc. Bond.,</hi>
                    1871, p. 621, and also Vinson’s <hi rend="italic">Spiders of Bourbon and
                    Mauritius'),</hi> and thus selection would operate until the males became so
                    small as only just to be able to fulfil the office of impregnating the female.
                    The male, nearly always the smallest, is in the case of some epeïrids and
                    Thomisids not <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th or even <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛th of the length of the female, and sometimes not more than <hi

                    (A. W. Μ. Van Ξasselt, <hi rend="italic">Arch. Neerland,</hi> tom. viii.) As a
                    rule, however, the difference in size between the male and female spider is not
                    nearly so great. Spiders are unable to fly, and the mode adopted by many
                    species, and myriads of individuals, to make up for this by sailing away on
                    their silken lines, has been mentioned; but lately a beautiful species of
                    Salticides, <hi rend="italic">Attus</hi><hi rend="italic">volans</hi> (Cambr.),
                    <hi rend="italic">Ann. and Mag. N. H.,</hi> September 1874, found at Sydney,
                    N.S.W., has been described and figured, with large flaps or lateral extensions
                    of the abdominal integument, by means of which the spider can sustain itself in
                    leaping from plant to plant; it has power to elevate and depress these flaps at
                    will.</p>
                <p>The voracity of spiders is well known, and the propensity above noticed of the
                    female to devour the male is but one instance of general voracity; but though
                    thus voracious, spiders can endure extreme fasting with impunity. A small spider
                    enclosed in a glazed case, lived and appeared healthy for eighteen months
                    without food; if it had any nourishment at all during this time, it could only
                    have been the very slight moisture that might exude from the skin of a lately
                    stuffed bird in the case, <hi rend="italic">Zoologist,</hi> 1853, p. 3766. Other
                    instances are also on record of fasts, almost or quite as long, and borne
                    equally well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Enemies of Spiders.</hi> —Preying upon all the insect
                    tribes, and occasionally upon lizards (F. Pollock, <hi rend="italic">Ann. N.
                    H.,</hi> October 1872) and earth-worms (E. Simon in <hi rend="italic">Ann. Soc.

                    >Zoologist,</hi> 1856, p. 5021), spiders are also themselves preyed upon by both
                    lizards and insects. More than one species of parasitic hymenoptera tend to keep
                    spiders within due bounds; but little has yet been done towards working out
                    these parasites. Three species are figured in Blackwall’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spid. Great Britain and Ireland,</hi> pl. xii.; two of them prey upon <hi
                    rend="italic">Agroëca</hi><hi rend="italic">brunnea</hi> (Bl.); while the third,
                    <hi rend="italic">Pompilus</hi><hi rend="italic">sepicola</hi> (F. Smith),
                    pierces large spiders, paralysing, but not killing them; they are then dragged
                    to its nest, in a hole in the earth; eggs are laid in the spider, which retains
                    sufficient vitality to furnish fresh food to the parasitic larvae until the time
                    for their change to the pupa state arrives. Full grown females of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lycosa</hi><hi rend="italic">campestris</hi> (Bl.) have been found
                    by the writer in the grasp of this powerful ichneumon. From the outskirts of a
                    single web of <hi rend="italic">Epèira opuntioe</hi> (Buf.), on the shores of
                    the Sea of Galilee, the writer collected, in April 1865, many truncated
                    pear-shaped egg cocoons belonging to the beautiful little <hi rend="italic"
                    >Argyrodes</hi><hi rend="italic">epéirae</hi> (Sim.); and from each of these
                    cocoons a single hymenopterous parasite shortly issued. The egg cocoons of
                    various epeïrids in England are likewise often preyed upon by numerous minute
                    parasites of the same order. Several species of <hi rend="italic">Theridion—T.
                    simile</hi> (Koch) especially —are subject to a larval parasite, often as large
                    as the spider itself, adhering to the outside of the abdomen. Various attempts
                    to rear the perfect insect from this para-· site have hitherto failed. A wide
                    field of great interest is open to any one who should take up the investigation
                    of the various insect parasites of spiders, with their mode of attack and
                    subsequent victory.</p>
                <p>Other foes, common to all the Articulata, spiders also have in abundance—birds,
                    small mammals, and reptiles. Doubtless we are indebted to such enemies for the

                    with spines to an extent that would make them a painful meal to any bird or

                    >Aphantochilus</hi><hi rend="italic">Pogersii</hi> (Cambr.), found in Brazil.
                    Other spiders, again (Genus <hi rend="italic">Eurysoma,</hi> Koch, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyrtarachne</hi> Thor.), closely resemble some species of
                    phytophagous coleoptera; one of the latter genus found in Ceylon, but yet
                    undescribed, resembles a small mollusc. Of the former some are very like a
                    minute crab (fig. 32). And lastly, to sum up the enemies of spiders, they prey
                    on each other, and are preyed upon also by other Arachnids; but on the whole
                    they have, as by their office they should have, the best of it, for they are
                    against <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Articulata, but only comparatively a <hi
                    rend="italic">few</hi> of the Articulata are against them.</p>
                <p>Spiders are not creatures which belong solely to the present geologic era of the
                    earth, for fossil spiders, with other Arachnids, as well as spiders in amber,
                    have been found; the oldest in the coal formation. See on this subject a late

                    been found a matter of difficulty to make them good-looking, sightly, cabinet
                    objects. By ordinary care and skilful manipulation, however, most of them can be
                    preserved and displayed very satisfactorily. So much of the comparative neglect
                    of Arachnids in general is owing to this difficulty, that it may perhaps be
                    worth the space of a few lines to remark, that many whose abdominal integument
                    is strong, or pretty thickly clothed with hairs and pubescence, may be pinned,
                    set out, and dried like insects. · Others may have the abdomen opened from
                    below, and after the contents are carefully extracted, be stuffed with fine
                    cotton wool. Others again have been most successfully treated by inflating the
                    abdomen (after the contents have been pressed out) with a blow-pipe, and then
                    subjecting them to a process of rapid desiccation, which in general preserves
                    the colours and markings very well indeed. But the best and most useful way for
                    <hi rend="italic">all</hi> purposes is to immerse and keep them in tubes filled
                    with spirit of wine. To make spiders in spirit sightly objects, they should,
                    when drugged with chloroform, or some other stupifying agent, be secured, but
                    not transfixed, by pins to a piece of cork, sunk in a vessel of spirit, in a
                    natural position, until rendered rigid by the action of the spirit, which will
                    be in a fortnight or so; the pins are then removed, and the spiders are placed
                    in glass test tubes, large enough to receive them without too much compression
                    of the legs. A bit of white card is slipped in under the specimen to keep it in
                    position, the tubes are filled with spirit, stopped firmly with a pledget of
                    cotton wool, and inverted round the inner side of a wide mouthed glass-stoppered
                    bottle; this bottle is filled also with spirit, and the spider is then seen in
                    its natural position, and with all its colours and markings perfectly visible.
                    It is also capable of examination with an ordinary pocket lens, even without
                    removal of the tube from the large bottle. Large spiders with a largely
                    developed abdomen should be kept in pill-boxes for a fortnight or so before
                    being placed in spirit; during this time the crudities of their food contents
                    are discharged, and preservation without injury or obliteration of colours and
                    markings is thus rendered far more certain; the beauty of many of our large and
                    handsome epeïrids can only be certainly retained, even in spirit, when treated
                    after the above method. See further on this subject, as well as on the mode of
                    search and capture of spiders (O. P. Cambridge, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Neu

                <p>It is not necessary to give here a list of works on Arachnids, many having been
                    already quoted in speaking of the different orders. The following, however, on

                    Nothing has been said in the foregoing pages respecting the “Embryology” of
                    spiders; for information in regard to this important and interesting but
                    recondite part of Araneology, it must suffice to refer the reader to Herold, <hi

                <p>These, with other works quoted on the different points that have arisen in the
                    course of the foregoing article, will be found sufficient to guide the student
                    and collector. The general works on Arachnida, or on any of its separate orders,
                    are exceedingly few, and none, except that of Μ. Simon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hist,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Araignées,</hi> Paris, 1864, are of recent
                    date, beyond the merest abstracts. The literature on the subject is scattered up
                    and down, in isolated papers, in numberless Transactions and Proceedings of
                    various societies, and in scores of periodical volumes and journals for the
                    record of natural and scientific investigation. It has been attempted to give in
                    the foregoing pages as fair a general view of the whole subject as the limited
                    space, and great difficulty of getting access to important papers treating upon
                    it, would permit. The object of such articles as the present is rather to <hi
                    rend="italic">excite</hi> an appetite for the obtaining more detailed
                    information, than to satisfy fully the appetite already excited. (o. P. c.) <pb
