                    fifteen other Greek towns which, like itself, owed their foundation to Seleucus
                    Nicator, and their names to his father Antiochus. While the wide-spread
                    notoriety of Daphne, with its beautiful grove, compared to the vale of Tempe,
                    and with its extraordinary excesses of pleasure, rendered it available as a
                    local designation for Antioch, the river Orontes also seems to have served the
                    same purpose with more than usual interest, owing, perhaps<pb break="no"

                    called Typhon, from the snake-legged giant of that name (Strabo, p. 750), who
                    here struck by the thunderbolt of Jupiter, and seeking escape under the earth,
                    formed the bed of the river by his trail, and its source by his descent.
                    Orontes, it was said, was the name of a man who had built, a bridge over the
                    river, and when iu Roman times the course of the stream was partly changed, a
                    tomb <hi rend="italic">(soros)</hi> was found in the old bed containing the
                    bones of a man of colossal size, which the oracle declared to be those of
                    Orontes (Pausanias, viii. 29, 3). On the coins of Antioch struck by Tigranes,
                    and frequently on those of later times, the city is personified as a female
                    figure seated on a high rock or hill, from undeι which issues the Orontes in the
                    form of a youth in the attitude of swimming. The same representation occurs in a
                    marble statue in the Vatican, and in a silver statuette in the British Museum;
                    and iu each case there can be little doubt that the original model was the
                    celebrated statue of Antioch by Eutychides, a people of Lysippus.</p>
                <p>On the dismemberment of the Eastern empire founded by Alexander the Great, it
                    fell to Seleucus to make himself master of that portion of it included in Syria.
                    It was an age remarkable for the building of new towns more or less on the plan
                    of Alexandria, and accordingly Seleucus, instead of establishing himself at
                    Antigonia, the newly-built capital of his defeated rival, chose a site a little
                    further down the Orontes, about 20 miles from its mouth, for the capital of his
                    new kingdom, the task of laying out and building it being entrusted to the
                    architect Xenaeus. On Mount Silpius was placed the citadel, and on the slope
                    towards the river the town. Seleucus destroyed Antigonia, transferred its
                    inhabitants to Antioch, and perhaps, as has been said, utilized its building
                    material In addition to this new population there were the old inhabitants of
                    the village of Iopolis or Ione, which had before occupied the citadel, and which
                    traced its origin to Ione, an Argive fugitive from Egypt, in search of whom
                    Triptolemus had been sent from Eleusis. Though this legend appears to have
                    originated simply from the name Ione, the people of Antioch yet boaβted of a
                    common descent with the inhabitants of Attica, struck coins with the head of
                    Pallas and an owl, precisely like coins of Athens, and maintained the traditions
                    of Triptolemus as of a sort of ancestral hero. Besides Iopolis, the villages of
                    Meroe, afterwards a suburb, and Bottia, on the banks of the Orontes, where
                    Alexander dedicated a temple to Jupiter Bottiaeus, claimed to have furnished the
                    original inhabitants of Antioch. But the town founded by Seleucus, 300 B.c.,
                    soon became insufficient for the influx of population, and a new district had to
                    be enclosed, the original walls being allowed to remain. For the same purpose a
                    third addition was made in the time of Seleucus Callinicus (246-226 B.C.), and a
                    fourth under Antiochus Epiphanes (175-164 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), to
                    whom the city owed also many new buildings of great splendour. From its four
                    parts, each separately walled, Antioch was now called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >tetrapolis,</hi> and in point of situation,^architectural magnificence, and
                    resources of enjoyment, ranked after Rome and Alexandria as the next city of its
                    time. The chief retreat of pleasure was the cypress grove of Daphne, at a
                    distance of between 4 and 5 miles, but connected with the city by a suburb
                    called Heraclea, the road passing among beautiful villas; gardens with
                    fountains, hot springs, medicinal wells, brooks, and, in short, if we may trust
                    the ancient writers who speak from personal observation, every combination of
                    salubrity and beauty. Seleucus Nicator had laid out the grove of Daphne, and
                    erected in it a temple of Apollo and Diana, to which deities an annual festival
                    was held in August, attended by all the people of the neighbourhood. Round the
                    temple was an enclosure or asylum within which refugees were safe. In the temple
                    of Apollo was a colossal statue of that god, the work, it was said, of the
                    sculptor Bryaxis, of which, apparently, there is a copy on the coins of
                    Antiochus Epiphanes. While the emperor Julian was at Antioch preparing for the
                    Parthian war, this temple was burned, but whether the fire was due to the
                    antipathy of the Christians, or to accident, was never ascertained. The city
                    itself, abounding in fine buildings, seems to have been for nothing so
                    remarkable in this direction as for its streets and porticoes, which were styled
                    “golden,” with reference to the splendour of the columns, and perhaps, more
                    literally, to the application of gold as a means of ornamentation. The principal
                    street traversed the entire length of the city from east to west, a distance of
                    about 4 miles, having four parallel rows of columns, forming a broad road in the
                    middle open to the sky, and at each side a narrower covered way or portico. The
                    road in the middle was laid with granite in the time of Antoninus Pius. From
                    this main street others branched off at intervals up to the higher part of the
                    town on the one hand, and down towards the river on the other. Where such
                    junctures occurred, the porticoes of the main street were carried over in the
                    form of arches. Among the buildings of which particular mention is made,
                    are—(1), a temple to Jupiter Capitolinus, in imitation of the temple to the same
                    deity in Rome, situated probably on Mount Silpius; (2), the theatre, begun by
                    the Seleucidae kings, enlarged by Agrippa and Tiberius, and finished by Trajan;
                    and.(3), the'great Christian church begun by Constantine and completed by
                    Constantius, which stood until 526 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it was
                    destroyed by an earthquake and fire. Its dome-shaped roof is said to have been
                    of immense height, while many parts of the building glistened with precious
                    stones and ornaments of gold. The altar within it faced the west. From the
                    description it is thought to have resembled St Vitalis at Ravenna. The
                    necropolis appears to have been situated on Mount Casius, above Antioch, where
                    are still sepulchres cut in the rock, afterwards used as cells by anchorites,
                    among them Zeno, who died about 420 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> With a
                    plentiful supply of water for private purposes from the wells and fountains in
                    the city, it was yet necessary to maintain the public baths, which in Roman
                    times became numerous, by aqueducts conveying water for some distance. The ruins
                    of one of these aqueducts still remain, admired for the solidity of the masonry
                    and the colossal scale of the structure (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Aqueduct).</hi> But with all its charms Antioch was beset by a danger which,
                    often threatening, several times succeeded in laying its fairest aspect waste.
                    The first recorded earthquake occurred 148 B.C., but the myths of the giants
                    Pagres and Typhon there struck by the thunderbolts of Jupiter seem to refer to
                    similar commotions at a remoter period. A second earthquake, 37 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in the reign of Caius Caesar, caused so much damage
                    that the emperor sent two senators to look to the affairs of the city. A third
                    followed in the time of Claudius. One effect of these disturbances was to <pb

                    there was an instance in the magician Dabbonius, who placed a bust on a purple
                    column in the centre of the city, and inscribed it dσeιστα <hi rend="italic"
                    >aτrτωτa,</hi> but in vain, for the next earthquake cast it down. Much more
                    severe was the earthquake 115 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> while the city was
                    full of the Roman army which Trajan was to lead against the Parthians. The
                    rivers changed their courses, Mount C ’ asius shook, and it was only by taking
                    shelter for several days in the circus that Trajan himself escaped danger from
                    the falling buildings. The city being restored partly by the aid of Trajan and
                    Hadrian, was spared any serious calamity of this kind till 526 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it was entirely destroyed, the loss of life,
                    all the greater because of an assembly of Christians then met, being reckoned at
                    250,000 persons. There had before been two shocks, 341 and 457-8 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the latter attended with considerable loss. Again,
                    on Nov. 29, 528 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> occurred another earthquake,
                    through which 5000 lives were lost. There appears to have been a violent shock,
                    587 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> followed on the last day of October 588 by
                    another, attended with a terrible destruction of life. But the people of Antioch
                    were not without troubles of their own making, as when, by their disaffection
                    towards the king Demetrius, they caused him to seek the aid of a body of Jews,
                    with whom he fell upon his subjects, slaying a vast number, and setting fire to
                    the city. In 83 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Tigranes, either by invitation or
                    by force, took Antioch, but was compelled to leave it by Lucullus, who placed on
                    the throne Antiochus Philopator. Syria became a Roman province in the time of
                    Pompey, who (64 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> enlarged the temple at Daphne,
                    and conceded to Antioch autonomy. In 47 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Caesar
                    visited Antioch on his expedition from Alexandria against Pharnaces, and was
                    regarded as a benefactor, and styled dictator, because he allowed the town to
                    retain its freedom, and added several public works of importance. Augustus w as
                    no less favourably inclined to the famous Eastern city, which on the news of the
                    defeat of Antony at Actium, hastened to espouse the cause of the emperor, and
                    even instituted an era from the day of that battle, which, however, was not long
                    retained. The usual era from which reckonings were made in Antioch, and over a
                    great part of the East, down to the 10th century, was 312 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> in which year Seleucus took Babylon. It was known as the era of the
                    Seleucidae. Successive emperors showed their favour for the city by visits or
                    the erection of public works. Germanicus died at Antioch 19 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.;</hi> his body was burned in the forum, and a monument erected over his
                    ashes. Titus, it is said by Malala, placed the cherubim which he removed from
                    Jerusalem on one of the gates of Antioch, and there seems to be confirmation of
                    this statement in the fact, that one of the gates continued long to be named
                    after these figures. Hadrian built an aqueduct for the town with a reservoir <hi
                    rend="italic">(castellum)</hi> at Daphne, in the form of a temple to the nymphs
                    aħd naiads. Under Commodus a neλv splendour was given to Antioch by the
                    celebration of the Olympic games at Daphne. Buildings were erected for the
                    practice of athletic feats generally, and in particular for the use of those who
                    competed in the games. In 266 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the Persians
                    invaded Antioch, appearing suddenly on the hills while the people were assembled
                    in the theatre, where many were slain by the enemy’s arrows before escape was
                    possible. The Christian church, partly built by Constantine, and finished by his
                    son, has already been mentioned, and from its great size it may be assumed that
                    the Christian population of Antioch was already considerable. In the time of
                    Theodosius the entire population is given by Chrysostom at 200,000, of which
                    number about the half were orthodox Christians,—a name which was here first
                    applied to the disciples of Christ ( Acts xi. 26). From 252 to 380 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> ten assemblies of therhurch were held at Antioch. It
                    had been the residence of the apostle Peter, as it was afterwards that of the
                    Patriarch of Asia. But in the history of Christianity at Antioch no period is so
                    memorable as the reign of the emperor Julian, whose measures directed against
                    the new religion—such as closing the church and allowing the temple of the Jews
                    to be restored— brought upon himself an amount of odium which was far from being
                    counterbalanced by success in his efforts, to revive the old rites of Apollo and
                    Jupiter. Valens, though not orthodox, was yet liberal in the erection of new
                    buildings in Antioch,— among them a forum surrounded by four basilicas, and with
                    a high column in the centre surmounted by a statue of Valentinianus. This he did
                    after having made peace with the Persians, Nov. 10, 371 A.D. The reign of
                    Theodosius the Great was signalised by a fierce sedition in Antioch, caused by a
                    tax which he had imposed in 387 or 388 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> a year of
                    famine. The statues of the emperor and the imperial family were thrown down, and
                    a tumult raised which was suppressed with difficulty. Many of the offenders were
                    punished with great severity, while the town itself was deprived of its
                    privileges as a metropolis. In the time of Leon a temple was erected in Antioch
                    to Simeon Stylites, whose body was conveyed to the city from the hill, between
                    30 and 40 miles to the east, where, on the top of a column 40 or 60 feet high,
                    he had lived in self-imposed martyrdom for thirty years. Under Zeno great
                    efforts were made to restore the city to its. original splendour before the
                    earthquakes of 526 and 528 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Its name was now
                    changed to Theopolis, but the change was of short duration, as were also the new
                    buildings; for in 538 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Chosroes, the king of
                    Persia, took the town, and, after removing all the plunder, even that of the
                    church, gave it over to his soldiers, by whom the greater part of it was set on
                    fire. It was again partly revived by Justinian, but from this time gradually
                    sank from its high position of queen of the East. Under Heraclius (635 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> it fell into the hands of the Saracens, who held it
                    till 969 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it was restored to the Roman
                    dominion by Michael Burza and Peter the Eunuch, and so retained till 1084 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when it fell into the power of the Turks, from whom
                    again it was captured by the Crusaders, 1098 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In
                    1268 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it was taken by the sultan of Egypt, and
                    never revived from the destruction which it then suffered. Of the ancient city
                    little now remains except a great aqueduct bridge and part of the massive walls,
                    which are still to be seen scaling step by step the precipitous hills. At one
                    place the wall is carried over a deep ravine with an "arch about 60 feet high.
                    Across the Orontes is a bridge of nine arches, with two towers having gates
                    plated with iron, whence the bridge is known as the iron bridge. Neither the
                    harbour nor the ancient walls which divided the four parts of the city can now
                    be traced. As in the case of many other Greek cities in Asia, once famous for
                    their beauty, the site of Antioch is now studded with squalid hovels of mud and
                    straw. The people live by the produce of the mulberry trees and by growing
                    tobacco, which is of a fine quality. It is still called (Antioch) Antakie, and
                    is sometimes, as in 1822, reminded of its ancient calamities arising from
                    earthquakes. In 1835 it contained 5600 inhabitants, with 6000 Egyptian soldiers
                    under Ibrahim Pasha, who had then his headquarters there. (C. O. Müller, <hi
