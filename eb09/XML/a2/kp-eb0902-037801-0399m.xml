                    court derives its name from its ancient place of judicature, which was in the
                    church of St Mary of the Arches <hi rend="italic">(de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arcubus),</hi> the modern representative of which is now called ordinarily Bow
                    Church. The modern church is on the south side of Cheapside, in the city of
                    London, and stands on the site of a very ancient church, which was burnt down in
                    the great fire of London in 1666, and which had a very fine arched crypt, whence
                    it derived its name. The ecclesiastical tribunal, which has passed for a long
                    time by the name of the Arches Court, is the court of appeal of the archbishop
                    of Canterbury, as metropolitan of the province of Canterbury, and the proper
                    designation of the judge is the Official Principal of the Arches Courts, but by
                    custom he has come to be styled tho Dean of the Arches, from the circumstance
                    that the office of dean has been in modem times usually united in the same
                    person with that of the official principal of the court of appeal. The office of
                    the dean of the Arches may now be regarded as extinct, or at least as purely
                    titular, like that of the dean of Booking in Essex, inasmuch as the peculiar
                    jurisdiction which he exercised as dean <hi rend="italic">(decanus)</hi> over
                    thirteen churches, locally situated within the diocese of London, but exempt
                    from the bishop’s jurisdiction, has been abolished, and the churches have been
                    placed by statute under the ordinary jurisdiction of the bishop of London. It
                    was, no doubt, owing to the circumstance that the Arches church was exempt from
                    the bishop of London’s jurisdiction that it was selected originally as the place
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n400/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0400-0379"/> judicature for the archbishop’s court. After the
                    College of Advocates was incorporated and had established itself in Doctors’
                    Commons, the archbishop’s court of appeal, as well as his prerogative court,
                    were usually held in the hall of the College of Advocates, but since the
                    destruction of the buildings of the college, the court of appeal has had no
                    settled place of judicature, and the official principal appoints from time to
                    time its sittings, which have been held for the most part in Westminster Hall.
                    The appeals from the decisions of the Court of Arches were formerly made to the
                    king in Chancery, but they are now by statute addressed to the king in Council,
                    and they are heard before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. By 23
                    Henry VIII. c. 9, the Arches Court is empowered to hear, in the first instance,
                    such suits as are sent up to it by letters of request from the consistorial
                    courts of the bishops of the province of Canterbury; and by the statute 3 and 4
                    Vict. c. 86 (the Church Discipline Act) this jurisdiction is continued to it,
                    and it is further empowered to accept letters of request from the bishops of the
                    province of Canterbury after they have issued commissions of inquiry under that
                    statute, and the commissioners have made their report. The official principal of
                    the Arches Court is the only ecclesiastical judge who is empowered to pass a
                    sentence of deprivation against a clerk in holy orders. (τ. τ.)</p>
