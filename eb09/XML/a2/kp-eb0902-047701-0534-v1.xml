                <p><label type="entry">ARCHYTAS</label>, of Tarentum, son of Mnesagoras or
                    Histi-aeus, was one of the most celebrated men of antiquity. He was.
                    distinguished as a mathematician, a philosopher, a statesman, and a general; nor
                    was he less remarkable for the purity and integrity of his life and the mildness
                    and benevolence of his disposition. The time at which he flourished can be
                    settled approximately from the fact that he was contemporary with Plato, whom he
                    knew personally, and whose life he saved by interceding with the tyrant
                    Dionysius. He took a prominent part in the administration of the state, and was
                    seven times made general of the army, although by a law it was forbidden that
                    any citizen should hold the command more than once. It is said that he was never
                    defeated in battle. He was also intrusted with the charge of many important
                    civil affairs. There seems to have been a tradition (see Horace, <hi
                        rend="italic">Odes,</hi> i. 28) that Archytas was drowned while crossing the
                    Adriatic, but of this there is no certain information. Archytas belonged to the
                    Pythagorean school of philosophy, and is said by some to have been the teacher
                    of Philolaos. This, however, must certainly be an error. According to others, he
                    was the eighth leader of the Pythagorean school. Fragments of writings, said to
                    be his, on various points of ethical and metaphysical philosophy, are given by
                    Stobaeus, Simplicius, and others. To portions of these Aristotle has been
                    supposed to owe his doctrine of the Categories and s√me of his principal ethical
                    theories. But it seems quite clear that scarcely any of these fragments are
                    genuine, and that they belong to the 1st or 2d century A.D., a period during
                    which Eclecticism, and a consequent desire to find traces of later doctrines in
                    old writers, were the prevailing influences. Such fragments as do appear genuine
                    are of no philosophical value, and are generally on special subjects. Archytas
                    is particularly celebrated as a mathematician. To him are ascribed a solution of
                    the problem of the duplication of the cube, and the application of analysis to
                    the resolution of geometrical problems. He was also a skilled mechanician, and
                    was one of the first to apply mathematics to mechanics and music. On the
