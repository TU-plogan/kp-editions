                    the name Cynic; but the popular derivation of the word connected it with the
                    dog, whose shamelessness and importunity many of their actions seemed to
                    imitate. In the time of Diogenes the name was firmly fixed as a nickname, and
                    even adopted by the Cynics themselves.</p>
                <p>Antisthenes was apparently born some years before the Peloponnesian war began,
                    and from his remark on the rejoicings after the battle of Leuctra (371 <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">b.c. Ho</hi> may be regarded as an elder contemporary of Plato.
                    In youth he studied rhetoric under Gorgias, perhaps also under Prodicus and
                    Hippias. These studies bore fruit, not merely in the stylistic ability which
                    made his writings eulogised by later critics, but more especially in the
                    doctrine he afterward held, that the study of names was the first step in
                    education. He opened a school of his own, and was on the way to distinguish
                    himself in the usual course of oratory, when he met with Socrates, and his views
                    of life underwent a change. From that time he became the inseparable admirer of
                    Socrates, to hear whom he walked every morning from Piraeus to Athens, a
                    distance of about 5 miles.</p>
                <p>Antisthenes was poor, and lived in the midst of a commercial population which had
                    suffered severely from the disasters attending the downfall of the Athenian
                    empire. He became the philosopher of the proletariate, carrying into the haunts
                    of the indigent and the vicious those principles which had been spreading in
                    wealthier circles, and modifying them to suit altered circumstances. His earlier
                    culture had always been more literary and rhetorical than strictly
                    philosophical, and he never attained a mastery over metaphysical problems.
                    Aristotle speaks of him as uneducated and simple-minded; and Plato has been
                    understood, in more places than one, to refer to the zeal without knowledge with
                    which he dwelt upon the difficulties of dialectic. Words and names were to him
                    more important than thoughts The puzzle of the one and the many, which then was
                    so prominent, led him to the strange conclusion that we can never say that one
                    thing (or name) is another, as that a tree is green, but only that a tree is a
                    tree. Such an adhesion to identical propositions as the sole form of judgment
                    led him to deny the possibility of contradiction altogether. He objected to the
                    Platonic theory of the substantive existence of relative and qualitative terms,
                    such as good or beauty. The dramatising legend shows him putting out his
                    criticism thus: “Plato,’' he said, “I can see a horse, and I can see a man; but
                    humanity and horsehood I cannot see.” “True,” replied Plato, “you have the eye
                    which sees a horse and a man; but the eye which can see horsehood and manhood
                    you have not.” The idea expressed by the so-called abstract term was to
                    Antisthenes merely subjective—a bare conception <hi rend="italic">(ψtλη
                    εwoLa)</hi> in the mind. Antisthenes, in short, opposes a crude Realism to the
                    Idealism of Plato The attitude of Antisthenes towards intellectual philosophy is
                    in the main negative, and the general result he comes to is that logical or
                    metaphysical investigations which go beyond name are unfruitful and
                    frivolous.</p>
                <p>A certain training is, however, necessary before a man can become what
                    Antisthenes wishes him to be—his own master, independent of all external goods
                    and social ties. This preparation consists in the laborious endeavour (πόνος) to
                    raise himself above those external circumstances of human life which reflection
                    shows to be useless and vain show (τύφος). We must separate what we really are
                    by nature from our artificial surroundings, so as to discover the minimum of
                    real wants in life; and then fixing our mind on that standard, we must discard
                    whatever is desirable only because popular opinion calls for it. Seeing that
                    nature needs but little, and that this little is easily attained, if we do not
                    insist on the delusions which attend it, the wise man will, it is true, gratify
                    the natural cravings, but will not do more. These inevitable appetites of sex
                    and food being satisfied, without the additions and refinements which art and
                    fashion require, he will renounce pleasure as such. In the paradoxical language
                    of Antisthenes, he would rather plunge into insanity than into pleasure. His aim
                    must be to become, as much as may be, independent of everything outside, using
                    it as needful, but not desiring it as a gratification. Such a mastery of self is
                    what is called virtue, and is enough for happmess. It is hard to win, but once
                    attained it can never be lost. The Cynic is one who surrenders the city of human
                    life, with its varied scenes, on account of the difficulty of keeping his
                    ground, and who is content if he can hold out the barren rock of the citadel as
                    a soldier, constantly on the watch and <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">procinctu.</hi> Unfortunately this conception of a minimum of
                    needs is somewhat vague, and allows many degrees. Diogenes could criticise and
                    improve upon Antisthenes, and the Indian gymnosophists pointed out that Diogenes
                    himself exceeded the strict demands of nature.</p>
                <p>Antisthenes, though he did not encourage the formality of a school, and drove
                    away the curious or enthusiastic with his staff, taught others by his example
                    and by his caustic words. The Cynic was something of a missionary. He adopted a
                    peculiar garb, at first perhaps for reasons of economy, but subsequently as a
                    symbol of his profession. A rough cloak, which could be doubled to counterfeit
                    an inner garment, and served the purposes of a night covering; a wallet, in
                    which provisions could be carried; a staff to support his steps, and perhaps
                    something from which to drink, constituted the property of the bare-footed
                    Cynic; and to these was afterwards added a long beard. The successors of
                    Antisthenes lived, like mendicant friars, on the alms of the public, and
                    wandered from place to place, sleeping by night on the steps of public
                    buildings, or occupying any vessel or tub which might suit their purpose.
                    Antisthenes himself seems not to have been specially extravagant in conduct; but
                    the later Cynics, who were without his early culture, made it a point to
                    disregard all decency and social conventions. Whatever they had to do they
                    deemed it their duty to do in public—at least such is the tenor of many tales.
                    The wise man, they held, would follow another law than that of his city; he was
                    a citizen of the world. Sexual desires he would unquestionably have to satisfy,
                    but in the most convenient way, without regard to sentimental objections or to
                    beauty —the uglier the better. Some, at least, of the Cynics maintained the
                    advisability of a community of wives. They allowed to no ceremonies more than a
                    relative force. According to Diogenes, the practice of cannibalism among certain
                    tribes shows that the prohibition against eating human flesh is no part of the
                    code of nature.</p>
                <p>So far the Cynics taught practically. But they were also great in repartee and
                    sarcasm. The fine touch of Socratic irony, which had given offence by talking
                    occasionally about pots and pans, was succeeded by a rough and sometimes gross
                    satire, which scrupled not to deal with matters viler still. Antisthenes, it is
                    said, had some powers of social attraction; but if it were so, his successors
                    were more marked by the severity of their rebukes. From the Homeric poems, the
                    Bible of the Greeks, they drew many of the weapons of their warfare, parodying
                    its language, and applying it to suit their own circumstances. Public manners,
                    men, and measures were assailed in no merciful spirit. Antisthenes compared the
                    cry of democratic politicians to the speech in w hich the hares demanded
                    equality of rights from the lion. He was equally at odds with the aesthetic and
                    literary tendencies of his time. Aristippus, Plato, and Isocrates were among his
                    literary enmities. Nor was he less trenchant in his criticisms of popular
                    superstitions, of soothsayers, and mystery-mongers. When the priest dilated in
                    his sermon on the blessedness of the other world for the initiated, Antisthenes
                    interrupted him with the words: “Why don’t you die, then ?”</p>
                <p>Antisthenes was a voluminous writer; his works, according to Diogenes Laertius,
                    filled ten volumes. Of these scarcely anything is left. They seem to have been
                    on <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0151-0138"/> various subjects, many of them being apparently a
                    moralising interpretation of the poems of Homer. We can base our estimate of
                    Antisthenes only on the sayings attributed to him, and, above all, to his
                    follower Diogenes.</p>
                <p>The great age of Cynicism in Greece is the century from 400 to 300 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Diogenes, who succeeded Antisthenes, carried the
                    exaggeration still further; and yet, in the story of the education of the
                    children of Xeniades -by him, there are traits which anticipate the educational
                    theory of Rabelais and Rousseau. Crates, who succeeded Diogenes, voluntarily
                    abandoned his possessions; and Hipparchia was so enamoured of Cynical life, that
                    she refused her wealthy suitors, and married the landless and ill-favoured
                    Crates. They were both notable features in the school, which includes the names
                    of Monimus (a slave who was attracted by the fame of Diogenes), Onesicritus,
                    Metrocles, and Menippus. In Menedemus the Cynical succession disappears, perhaps
                    combining with the Megaric. For more than three centuries the name continued a
                    tradition, when in the 1st and 2d centuries of the Christian era it was revived.
                    The majority of the Cynics of that date were a worthless set of vagabonds, who
                    used the garb and the name as a cover for all iniquities. They may be compared
                    to the mendicant orders in the worst days of their corruption. But amongst them
                    two or three names have a brighter light thrown upon them. Demetrius is lauded
                    by his contemporary Seneca, and about a hundred years later Demonax is
                    enthusiastically presented to the world by Lucian. There is much of the old
                    Cynic in these descriptions; but the men were more eclectic, and had in some
                    respects followed the advance of the general culture. Cynicism lasted for a few
                    centuries longer, but never contributed anything to philosophy properly so
                    called. It was a mode of life rather than a theory; and it sank before the
                    monasticism and asceticism which marked certain directions in the history of the
                    Christian church. (w. w.)</p>
