                    which traces may be found in any state of society; but it is to the Justinian
                    jurisprudence that we owe it as a system which has found its way into the
                    practice of European nations in general, and has even evaded the dislike of the
                    English common lawyers to the civil law. The eighth section of the fourth book
                    of the Pandects is devoted to this subject. Almost all the advantages, as well
                    as the defects of the system in modern practice, seem to have been anticipated
                    by the Roman jurists. Some of the civilians make a distinction between the <hi
                    rend="italic">arbitrator,</hi> the name applicable to a person voluntarily
                    chosen by parties to decide disputes, and the <hi rend="italic">arbiter,</hi> an
                    officer to whom the praetor is supposed to have remitted questions of fact as to
                    a jury. In this sense arbiters appear to have been employed as a substitute for
                    jury trial in some of the old provincial laws of France; and hence, perhaps, it
                    comes that, by a very remarkable provision in the French code of commerce, all
                    questions between partners touching the partnership must be referred to
                    arbitration. In the code of civil procedure the title <hi rend="italic">des
                    arbitrages</hi> is treated so fully and minutely, as very forcibly to convey the
                    impression of a separate system of voluntary jurisdiction, being created for
                    performing what ought to be accomplished by the ordinary tribunals in a
                    well-regulated judicial system. In Scotland the practice of arbitration has been
                    imported from the Roman law without requiring, as in England, statutory
                    intervention. It is one of the advantages of the Scottish System of registration
                    that the decree-arbitral, or decision of the arbiter, when recorded in pursuance
                    of the consent of the parties in their contract of arbitration or submission,
                    can be enforced as the decree of a court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitration in Scotch Law.</hi> —This term is applied to the
                    contract whereby a dispute is referred to one or more persons by the parties
                    interested, and so withdrawn from the cognisance of the ordinary tribunals. When
                    one person only is chosen he is called sole arbiter or arbitrator; when more
                    than one, an umpire or oversman is appointed either in the contract or by the
                    arbiters themselves, and his award is final if the arbiters differ in opinion.
                    The contract is properly entered into by deed, duly attested and stamped, and is
                    termed a <hi rend="italic">submission.</hi> Submissions are either general or
                    special; the former including all disputes subsisting at the time, the latter
                    restricted to certain specified matters. The judgment when promulgated is termed
                    the award or decree?arbitral. The deed of submission contains a clause
                    authorising registration for execution, under which, on registration in the
                    books of a competent court, witnesses may be cited and the decree-arbitral put
                    to execution. The procedure may be by written pleadings, and a formal record may
                    be made up if the arbiters deem that desirable. If the determination of the
                    matter falls on the oversman, he may order further debate before deciding.
                    Unless the submission provides otherwise, the powers of the arbiters fall on the
                    expiry of one year; but if it contain a power of prorogation, the arbiters may
                    prorogate from year to year; and in all cases the parties themselves may renew
                    the reference after it has fallen. By Act of Regulations, 1695, c. 25,
                    decrees-arbitral are declared not to be reducible except on the grounds of
                    bribery, corruption, or falsehood; this has, moreover, been so interpreted as
                    not to exclude reduction when the arbiters have plainly travelled out of the
                    powers conferred on them by the submission, or where their procedure has been
                    grossly irregular, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> taking evidence in absence of
                    one of the parties. An arbiter has the power of awarding costs, even though the
                    deed contain no such provision. It is the general rule that a reference is
                    ineffectual where the arbiters are not named, or where an arbiter is merely
                    designated as the holder of an office, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Lord
                    Advocate. To this there is, however, an exception, where in a contract the
                    parties bind themselves to refer, and where a reference is necessary to work out
                    the contract. A rule in friendly societies to refer disputes is binding.
                    Arbiters having once accepted, cannot renounce their office at pleasure; and if
                    they do so, become liable in damages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Judicial References</hi> have been long known to the law of
                    Scotland. When an action is in court the parties may at any stage withdraw it
                    from judicial determination, and refer it to arbitration. This is done by minute
                    of reference to which the court interpones its authority. When the award is
                    issued it becomes the judgment of the court. The court has no power to compel
                    parties to enter into a reference of this kind, and it is doubtful whether
                    counsel can bind their clients in such a matter. A judicial reference falls like
                    the other by the elapse of a year; and the court cannot review the award on the
                    ground of miscarriage. By 13 and 14 Vict. c. 36, § 50, a provision is introduced
                    whereby parties to an action in the Supreme Court may refer judicially any issue
                    for trial to one, three, five, or seven persons, who shall sit as a jury, and
                    decide by a majority. The Consolidation Acts in reference to the acquisition of
                    lands, &lt;fcc,, for public undertakings, such as railways, also&gt; contain
                    provisions for settlement of disputes by arbitration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitration,</hi> in the Law of England, is described by
                    Blackstone as an arrangement by which “the parties injuring and injured submit
                    all matters in dispute concerning any personal chattels or personal wrong to the
                    judgment of two or more <hi rend="italic">arbitrators,</hi> who are to decide
                    the controversy; and if they do not agree, it is usual to add that another
                    person be called in as <hi rend="italic">umpire,</hi> to whose sole judgment it
                    is then referred; or frequently there is only one arbitrator originally
                    appointed.” Proceedings in arbitration were regulated by the Act 9 and 10 WilL
                    III. c. 15, which allowed the submission to be made a rule of any of the courts
                    of record and subsequent statutes. It may be said in general that all questions
                    relating to civil rights may be referred to arbitration, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> personal damages, disputes about real property, and pure questions
                    of law. How far questions involving matters of criminal law may be made the
                    subject of arbitration is not quite clear. In many cases the aggrieved person,
                    having a remedy by indictment as well as by action, may compromise the criminal
                    process by referring his civil rights to an arbitrator; but the more serious
                    criminal offences of course could not be dealt with in this way. An arbitrator
                    ought to have no personal interest in the subject of dispute, but this is almost
                    the only restriction recognised by the law. Idiots, lunatics, infants, and
                    married women, who are under a general rule of disqualification in law, may all
                    be arbitrators, for it is said, the parties have selected their own judges and
                    must abide by their choice. In certain cases of arbitration under a statute, the
                    arbitrator must be taken from some special class, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in settling disputes about the proportional expense of county prisoners in a
                    borough gaol, the arbitrator must be a barrister. Under the Common Law Procedure
                    Act of 1854, the reference is to the master of the court The submission to
                    arbitration may be by agreement between the parties, by order of a court or
                    judge, or by compulsion under the Common Law Act, 1854, or under special
                    statutes. A verbal submission, besides other obvious disadvantages, cannot be
                    made a rule of court. The statute 9 and 10 Will. III. provided that persons·
                    might agree that their submission should be made a rule of court, but the
                    insertion of the consent clause in the submission was necessary. The Common Law
                    Procedure Act, 1854, § 17, provides that every agreement or submission to
                    arbitration by consent, whether by deed or instrument in writing, not under
                    seal, may be made a rule of any one of the superior courts of equity or law at
                    Westminster, on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0332-0313"/> application of any party thereto, unless such
                    agreement or submission contain words purporting that the parties intend that it
                    should not be made a rule of court; or if any particular court is specified, the
                    submission shall be made a rule of that court only. The court has no
                    jurisdiction until the submission has been actually made a rule of court, and
                    that is seldom done until it is necessary to enforce or set aside the award. The
                    courts are very jealous of any attempt to “oust their jurisdiction,” by
                    agreements to refer differences not yet risen, or covenants not to 8uein respect
                    of such differences. The 11th section of the Common Law Procedure Act, however,
                    enables a defendant to take advantage of an agreement to refer by applying to
                    the court to stay proceedings in the actions, and compel the plaintiff to resort
                    to arbitration. In a pending action the matters in dispute may by consent of the
                    parties be referred to arbitration, before or after the action is called on
                    trial, by a rule of court, or by order of a judge at the trial. If it should be
                    made to appear, at any time after the issuing of the writ, to the satisfaction
                    of a court or the judge that the “matter in dispute consists wholly or in part
                    of matters of mere account,” the court or judge may order such matter to be
                    referred to an arbitrator or an officer of the court (Common Law Procedure Act,
                    § 3). At the trial of any issue of fact, matter of account therein arising may
                    by order of the judge be similarly referred (section 6). In the latter case the
                    power cannot be exercised after the jury is sworn. Among the statutes
                    authorising reference to arbitration in cases of dispute the most important are
                    the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, the Railway Clauses Act, 1845, and the
                    Companies’ Clauses Act, 1845—statutes which consolidate the “common clauses”
                    usually inserted in Acts relating to the subjects named in their respective
                    titles.</p>
                <p>The powere of the arbitrator are very various. He may have the power of a jury or
                    a judge at Nisi Prius, of a court in banco, of the Lord Chancellor, or of a
                    master. The time for making the award is usually fixed by the submission; in
                    other cases the legal period is three months. The time, however, may be enlarged
                    by a rule of court, or by order of the arbitrators themselves. The award or
                    decision of the arbitrators ought to decide finally all the questions in
                    dispute, and ought to be certain and definite; it ought to be “mutual,” z.e., it
                    should ascertain the rights and duties of both parties, and it must be possible
                    and consistent with itself. It is a general rule that an award cannot be
                    impeached for a mistake in law or in fact, although it is to be regretted that
                    the practice of the courts on this point is by no means uniform. Where a
                    demurrer, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> an issue in point of law, was referred to
                    arbitration, it was held that a mistake in law was no ground for setting aside
                    the award. On the other hand, it has been held that a clear gross mistake
                    affecting the whole award may be a good ground for having it set aside.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arbitration,</hi> in International Law, is one of the
                    recognised modes of terminating disputes between independent nations. Vattel
                    calls it “a reasonable and natural mode of deciding such disputes as do not
                    directly interest the safety of a nation.” Heffter mentions six cases in which
                    the judgment of the arbitrators would not be binding on the contending parties,
                    viz., when the agreement has been insufficient, when the arbitrators have been
                    incapable, when they have acted on bad faith, when the parties have not been
                    understood, when the award is in excess of the reference, and when it is
                    contrary to natural justice. Arbitration is sometimes spoken of as a universal
                    substitute for war, but hitherto there has been no inclination, on the part of
                    independent states, to submit any but secondary questions to the decision of
                    neutral parties. The king of Prussia acted as arbitrator between England and
                    France in 1843, in what were known as the Portendic claims. In the c⅞se cf the
                    “General Armstrong” privateer, between the United States and Portugal, the
                    president of the French Republic (afterwards the Emperor Napoleon) acted as
                    arbitrator. The most formal experiment in arbitration, however, was the Geneva
                    Convention in 1872. The United States having for many years urged upon England
                    the settlement of what were called the “Alabama” claims, a treaty was concluded
                    by which the case was referred to five arbitrators named by England, the States,
                    the Swiss Republic, the king of Italy, and the emperor of Brazil, respectively.
                    Three new rules were at the same time drawn up for the arbitrators to follow in
                    deciding on the liability of England. The award was in favour of America, and
                    the English representative (Lord Chief-Justice Cockburn) was the only
                    dissentient.</p>
                <p>Arbitration is frequently employed to settle differences not of a legal
                    character, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> disputes between masters and workmen as
