                    recent Acts of Parliament as pharmaceutical chemists, and chemists and
                    druggists, both in England and Scotland. In England the name indicates a general
                    practitioner in medicine who supplies drugs to his patients. The Apothecaries’
                    Society of London is one of the corporations of that city, and both by Royal
                    Charters and Acts of Parliament exercises the power of granting licences to
                    practise medicine. The members of this society do not possess and never have
                    possessed any exclusive power to deal in or sell drugs; and until very lately
                    (1868) any person whatever might open what is called a chemist’s shop, and deal
                    in drugs and poisons. In that year, however, the Pharmacy Act was passed, which
                    prohibits any person from engaging in this business without being
                    registered.</p>

                    distinguished till the reign of Henry VIII., when separate duties were assigned
                    to them, and peculiar privileges were granted to each. In 1518 the physicians of
                    London were incorporated, and the barber-surgeons in 1540. But, independently of
                    the physicians and the surgeons, there were a great number of irregular
                    practitioners, who were more or less molested by their legitimate rivals, and it
                    became necessary to pass an Act in 1543 for their protection and toleration. As
                    many of these practitioners kept shops for the sale of medicines, the term
                    “apothecary” was used to designate their calling.</p>
                <p>In April 1606 James I. incorporated the apothecaries as one of the city
                    companies, uniting them with the grocers. On their charter being renewed in 1617
                    they were formed into a separate corporation, under the title of the
                    “Apothecaries of the City of London.” These apothecaries appear to have
                    prescribed medicines in addition to dispensing them, and to have claimed an
                    ancient right of acting in this double capacity; and it may be mentioned that
                    Henry VIII., after the grant of the charter to the College of Physicians,
                    appointed an apothecary to the Princess Mary, who was delicate and unhealthy, at
                    a salary of 40 marks a year, <hi rend="italic">“pro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >meliore</hi><hi rend="italic">cura</hi><hi rend="italic">et consideratione
                    sanitatis</hi><hi rend="italic">suoe”</hi> During the 17th century, however,
                    there arose a warm contest between the physicians and the apothecaries,—the
                    former accusing the latter of usurping their province, and the latter continuing
                    and justifying the usurpation until the dispute was finally set at rest by a
                    judgment of the House of Lords in 1703, when it was decided that the duty of the
                    apothecary consisted not' oηly in compounding and dispensing, but also in
                    directing and ordering the remedies employed in the treatment of disease. In
                    1722 an Act was obtained empowering the Apothecaries’ Company to visit the shops
                    of all apothecaries practising in London, and to destroy such drugs' as they
                    found unfit for use. In 1748 great additional powerà were given to the company
                    by an Act authorising them <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> to appoint a board of
                    ten examiners, without whose license no persons should be allowed to dispense
                    medicines in London, or within a circuit of 7 miles round it. In 1815, however,
                    an Act of Parliament was passed which gave the Apothecaries’ Society a new
                    position, empowering a board, consisting of twelve of their members, to examine
                    and license all apothecaries throughout England and Wales. It also enacted that,
                    from the 1st of August of that year,-no persons except those who were so
                    licensed should have the right to act as apothecaries, and it gave the Society
                    the power of prosecuting those who practised without such license. But the Act
                    expressly exempted from prosecution all persons who were then in actual
                    practice, and it distinctly excluded from its operation all persons pursuing the
                    calling of chemists and druggists. It was also provided that the Act should in
                    no way interfere with the rights or privileges of the English Universities, or
                    of the English College of Surgeons or the College of Physicians; and indeed a
                    clause imposed severe penalties on any apothecaries who should refuse to
                    compound and dispense medicines on the order of a physician, legally qualified
                    to act as such. It is therefore clear'that the Act contemplated the creation of
                    a class of practitioners who, while having the right to practise medicine,
                    should assist and co-operate with the physicians and surgeons.</p>
                <p>Before this Act came into operation the education of the medical practitioners of
                    England and Wales was entirely optional on their own part, and although many of
                    them possessed degrees or licences from the universities or colleges, the
                    greater number possessed no such qualification, and many of them were wholly
                    illiterate and uneducated. The Court of Examiners of the Apothecaries’ Society
                    being empowered to enforce the acquisition of a sufficient medical education
                    upon its future licentiates, specified from time to time the courses of lectures
                    or terms of hospital practice to be attended by medical students before their
                    examination, and, in the progress of years, regular schools of medicine were
                    organised throughout England.</p>
                <p>As it was found that, notwithstanding the stringent regulations as to medical
                    acquirements, the candidates were in many instances deficient in preliminary
                    education, the Court of Examiners instituted, about the year 1850, a preliminary
                    examination in Arts as a necessary and indispensable prerequisite to the medical
                    curriculum, and this provision has been so expanded that, at the present day,
                    all medical students in the United Kingdom are compelled to pass a preliminary
                    examination in Arts, unless they hold a university degree. An Act of Parliament,
                    passed in 1858, and known as the Medical Act, made very little alteration in the
                    powers exercised by the Apothecaries’ Society, and indeed it confirmed and in
                    some degree amplified them, for whereas by the Act of 1815, the licentiates of
                    the Society were authorised to practise as such only in England and Wales, the
                    new measure gave them the same right in Scotland and Ireland.</p>
                <p>A still more recent Act, passed in 1874, relates exclusively to the Apothecaries’
                    Society, and is termed the Apothecaries’ Act Amendment Act. By this measure some
                    provisions of the Act of 1815, which had become obsolete or unsuited to the
                    present times, were repealed, and powers were given to the Society to unite or
                    co-operate with other medical licensing bodies in granting licences to practise.
                    The Act of 1815 had made it compulsory on all candidates for a licence to have
                    served an apprenticeship of five years to an apothecary, and although by the
                    interpretation of the Court of Examiners of the Society this term really
                    included the whole period of medical study, yet the regulation was felt as a
                    grievance by many members of the medical profession. It is accordingly repealed,
                    and no apprenticeship is now necessary. The restriction of the choice of
                    examiners to the members of the Society is also repealed, and the Society has
                    moreover the power (which it did not before possess) to strike off from the list
                    of its licentiates the names of disreputable persons. As a question was raised,
                    under the Act of 1815, whether women were admissible as candidates for the
                    medical licence (owing to the ambiguous wording of the measure), and as the
                    society, acting under legal advice, had admitted a woman to the licence, the Act
                    of 1874 refers to the point, but leaves it still undecided, merely specifying
                    that the new Act does not deprive the Society of any right or obligation they
                    may have to adffiit women to examination, and to enter their names on the list
                    of licentiates if they acquit themselves satisfactorily.</p>
