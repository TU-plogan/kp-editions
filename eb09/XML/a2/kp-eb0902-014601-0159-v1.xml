                <p><label type="entry">ANUBIS</label>, an Egyptian deity, called in hieroglyphs <hi
                        rend="italic">Anepu</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Anup,</hi> and in Coptic, <hi
                        rend="italic">Anob</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Anoub.</hi> It appears from the
                    hieroglyphic legends that he was the son of Osiris and Isis, not Nephthys, as
                    stated by Plutarch. His name has no particular meaning in hieroglyphs, although
                    it resembles the Coptic <hi rend="italic">anebe,</hi> the appellation of a
                    particular kind of dog. His worship was of the oldest period, and is found in
                    tombs at Memphis, of the age of the 4th dynasty, at which period all dedications
                    run in his name instead of that of Osiris, which did not appear till the 6th. At
                    this time he is always styled resident in the sacred abode, and attached to the
                    land of Ut, and lord of the Taser or Hades. At the earliest period he presided
                    over the funeral rites and embalming of the dead, on account of having rendered
                    these offices to his father Osiris. In this character he is seen raising the
                    mummy on its feet to receive the sepulchral sacrifices and libations, or else
                    laying it out on the bier, to which the soul flies down to visit or be reunited
                    to the body. In the great judgment Anubis, with Thoth, attends to the balance
                    placed in the Hall of the Two Truths, where the soul is tried by Osiris as judge
                    of Hades, and the heart of the dead is weighed against the feather of Truth.
                    Besides his sepulchral character, Anubis was also called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ap-heru,</hi> “opener of the roads” or “paths,” which were supposed to lead
                    to heaven. Of these there were two, the “northern and the southern.” As lord of
                    the northern road he was lord of Sais, while as ruling the southern, he was lord
                    of Taser or Hades. In this character he was often represented as a jackal seated
                    on a pylon or gateway, the jackal being his sacred animal or living emblem. This
                    may be considered the type of the celestial Anubis, and as such he was styled
                    lord of the heaven, and opener of the solar disk. Anubis is represented with the
                    head of a jackal, seldom with that of a man, and rarely with any head attire,
                    although at the Roman period his head is surmounted by the pschent, or crown of
                    Upper and Lower Egypt. In other respects his type is that of other Egyptian
                    deities. In the tablets and other monuments of the 18th and later dynasties,
                    Anubis is introduced as following, or as part of,, the cortege of Osiris;
                    sometimes he is worshipped alone; but he was a subordinate god of the third
                    order, supposed to have reigned over Egypt as one of the kings of the 2d dynasty
                    of gods. The principal site of his local worship was Lyco-polis, or El Siut, the
                    capital of the 13th and 14th(orLyco-polite) nomes, and at the 17th or Cynopolite
                    nome; but he appears also as one of the gods of the 18th or Oxyrhynchite nome,
                    and as such is styled lord of <hi rend="italic">Sep.</hi> In this character he
                    is said to have defeated the opposers of his father Osiris, which accords with
                    the story of Diodorus, that Anubis was the general of Osiris in his Eastern
                    expedition. The introduction of Anubis into the Isiac worship about the 1st
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> gave rise to various esoterical
                    explanations not found in the hieroglyphs. He is stated to have been the son of
                    Nephthys and Osiris, and discovered by dogs, and hence had a dog’s or jackal’s
                    head; also that he represented the horizontal circle which divides the invisible
                    world, called by the Egyptians Nephthys, in contradistinction to Isis, or the
                    visible, or to have been like Hecate. He was also supposed to mean time and
                    universal reason. But these explanations are not found in the hieroglyphs, and
                    the change of his head to that of a dog instead of a jackal, was not Egyptian.
                    On Roman monuments of the 1st and 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> his
                    form is combined with that of Hermes, and passed by the name of Hermanubis, in
                    his character of the infernal Mercury. In the days of Tiberius, the seduction of
                    a noble Roman lady in his temple at Rome, with the connivance of the priests,
                    led to the suppression of his worship, but at a later period the Emperor
                    Commodus, infatuated with the Isiac worship, shaved his head like an Egyptian
                    priest, and carried in procession the figure of the god. The idea that his name
                    meant gold, as suggested by the learned, is confuted by the hieroglyphs; nor are
                    the statues found of him either gold or gilded, while in the Egyptian paintings
                    he is always coloured <hi rend="italic">black,</hi> and never yellow or golden,
                    as the goddesses often are. The jackal was his sacred living animal, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n160/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0160-0147"/> and was embalmed after death, and this animal
                    represented, according to Clement of Alexandria, either the two hemispheres
                    which environed the terrestrial globe, or the tropics. Figures of Anubis in
                    porcelain are not uncommon in Egyptian collections, having been attached to the
                    outer network of bugles which covered the mummies, but in other materials they
                    are much rarer. The jackal, his animal and emblem, is, however, often placed on
                    chests, or other sepulchral monuments. His worship commenced at the earliest
                    period of Egyptian history, and continued, in one form or another, till Egyptian
                    paganism was superseded by Christianity. He was, in fact, one of the oldest, if
                    not the oldest deity of the paganism of the world. (Wilkinson, JΓαnn. <hi
