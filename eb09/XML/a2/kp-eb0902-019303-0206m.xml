                    >πλησσω,</hi> to strike down, to stun), a term in medicine which, though now
                    also employed with other significations, is commonly understood to apply to a
                    fit of sudden insensibility occurring in connection with some diseased condition
                    of the brain.</p>
                <p>Apoplectic attacks vary both as regards their intensity and their attendant
                    phenomena, but well-marked cases present the following symptoms: The person
                    attacked becomes, more or less suddenly, deprived of consciousness and all power
                    of voluntary motion. He lies as if in a deep sleep, with a flushed face, a slow
                    pulse, stertorous breathing, accompanied with puffing of the cheeks during
                    expiration, and with the pupils of the eyes insensible to light, and contracted
                    or unequal. This state in many respects resembles the coma of narcotic
                    poisoning, and is unfortunately too often mistaken by unskilled persons for
                    alcoholic intoxication. The symptoms and history of the case, however, are
                    usually sufficient to enable a medical man to form a correct diagnosis. In this
                    condition of insensibility death may occur within a few hours, or there may be a
                    gradual return to consciousness, in which case it is frequently observed that
                    some trace of the attack remains in the form of paralysis of one side of the
                    body, while occasionally there may also be noticed some impairment of the mental
                    powers, pointing to damage done to the brain. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paralysis.)</hi></p>
                <p>Although thus generally sudden in its onset, it is seldom that an attack of
                    apoplexy occurs without some previous warning. Persistent headache of a dull
                    throbbing character, a sense of fulness in the head, vomiting, giddiness, noises
                    in the ears, slight confusion of mind, and numbness of a limb or of one side of
                    the body, are among the more important premonitory symptoms; and these may exist
                    for a variable length of time) before the fit comes on. Such symptoms, more
                    particularly the association of them, when occurring in a person at or beyond
                    middle life are to be regarded with anxiety, as indicating danger of an
                    apoplectic seizure. Various morbid conditions of the brain are capable of giving
                    rise to fits of apoplexy. Hence different forms of apoplexy have been described
                    by medical writers, such as the <hi rend="italic">congestive,</hi> where the
                    cause appeared to lie in an engorgement of the blood-vessels of the brain and
                    its membranes; and the <hi rend="italic">serous,</hi> where sudden effusion of
                    fluid into the ventricles or substance of the brain seemed to have brought on a
                    fit. But by far the most frequent and important occasion of apoplexy is
                    haemorrhage into the brain by the rupture of blood-vessels. Indeed, by many
                    modern writers the term apoplexy is applied only to cases of cerebral
                    haemorrhage. The blood-vessels of the brain, like those in other parts of the
                    body, are liable to undergo degenerative changes after middle life. These
                    changes affect the minute capillaries, as well as the larger vessels, rendering
                    their texture fragile, and at the same time impairing their function in carrying
                    on the healthy nutrition of the brain. Hence, in the immediate vicinity of the
                    diseased blood-vessels, the substance of the brain itself undergoes
                    degeneration, and becomes softened. The capillary vessels having thus lost the
                    natural support of the surrounding tissues, and being themselves weakened by
                    disease affecting their walls, are liable to give way, and blood escapes into
                    the brain. The haemorrhage may be slight in amount and in parts of the brain
                    where its presence gives rise to little disturbance; but where a large
                    blood-vessel has ruptured, and more especially where the blood has been
                    extravasated in or around the important structures at the base of the brain, the
                    result is a fit of apoplexy as above described, and death not unfrequently
                    follows within a short period. In favourable cases where a certain measure of
                    recovery takes place, the effused blood undergoes gradual absorption, or becomes
                    enveloped in a sort of capsule formed by the surrounding brain substance, and
                    ceases to cause further disturbance. But even in such cases some degree of
                    paralysis remains at least for a time. Moreover, the nutrition of the'brain is
                    so impaired as to render probable a recurrence of the haemorrhage, and thus the
                    danger to life, as is well known, increases with each successive attack.</p>
                <p>From whatj has been above stated, it will be observed that apoplexy is to be
                    regarded as a disease of advanced life. Hippocrates states that it is of most
                    frequent occurrence between the ages of forty and sixty, and all medical
                    experience confirms the truth of this observation. Nevertheless it may occur at
                    any period of life, and cases are not wanting of true apoplexy in very young
                    children. It is said to be more common in men than in women, but this is denied
                    by many observers, and appears at least doubtful. What has from early times been
                    described as the apoplectic habit of body, consisting in a stout build, a short
                    neck, and florid complexion, is now generally discredited, it being admitted
                    that apoplexy occurs about as frequently in thin and spare persons who present
                    no such peculiarity of conformation. A hereditary tendency is acknowledged as
                    one of the predisposing causes of apoplexy, as are also diseases of the heart
                    and kidneys. With respect to th« exciting causes of a fit of apoplexy, it may be
                    stated generally, that whatever tends directly or indirectly to increase the
                    tension within the cerebral blood-vessels may bring on an attack. Hence, such
                    causes as immoderate eating or drinking, severe exertion of body or mind,
                    violent emotions, much stooping, overheated rooms, exposure of the head to the
                    sun, sudden shocks to the body, and the sudden suppression of evacuations, such
                    as the menstrual discharge, may precipitate the fit.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of these facts is of the utmost importance in the treatment of
                    apoplexy, as obviously much can be done in the way of warding off fits where
                    they appear to threaten, and of preventing a recurrence in cases where there
                    have been previous attacks. With respect, further, to the treatment of apoplexy,
                    it must be admitted that^little can be done during the state of unconsciousness.
                    The practice of blood-letting, once so common in this disease, is now almost
                    entirely abandoned, although there are physicians who still recommend its
                    employment, especially where the attack occurs in stout, plethoric persons.
                    Where death appears to threaten from failure of the heart’s action, warm
                    applications to the surface of the body, and, should there exist any power of
                    swallowing, the cautious administration of stimulants, are to be recommended.
                    The case must be anxiously watched, and symptoms treated as they arise. When
                    consciousness returns, the utmost care and quietness are to be observed to
                    prevent the occurrence of <pb break="no"

                    result of haemorrhage into the brain.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Apoplexy</hi> is also applied in modern medical
                    nomenclature to an extravasation of blood within the substance of any organ in
                    the body, as for instance, <hi rend="italic">pulmonary apoplexy,</hi> where
                    blood has been effused into the tissues of the lung. This use of the word,
                    however, is altogether objectionable. (J. o. A.)</p>
