                    lower forms of animal and vegetable life are observed to grow and multiply in
                    the putrefying substance. The exciting causes of putrefaction have long formed a
                    subject of scientific discussion, two widely-different theories being maintained
                    respecting them. By the one, the changes which occur during the process are held
                    to be from the first the result of chemical decomposition in the organic
                    substance, whose atoms are in a state of motion or activity, which is capable of
                    being communicated by catalytic action to other organic material in contact with
                    it (Liebig); while, further, it is asserted that minute living organisms may be
                    evolved from the dead material as the result of these chemical transformations.
                    By the other theory, which is founded mainly upon the researches of Pasteur, the
                    putrefactive changes are ascribed to the agency of organised germs ever present
                    in the atmosphere, which, finding a suitable nidus in the putrescible material,
                    grow and multiply, producing the chemical decompositions as the result of their
                    action. Putrefaction, it is further maintained, may be entirely prevented by
                    means which exclude the access of germs. The subject derives much interest and
                    importance from its relation to the doctrines of the origin of life, as well as
                    to questions concerning the sources of contagion and epidemic disease, and
                    continues to the present time a matter of keen inquiry and experiment among
                    physiologists. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Biology.)</hi></p>
                <p>Putrefaction may be prevented by removing one or more of the conditions essential
                    to its occurrence. Thus, by exclusion of the atmosphere, dead matter, which
                    would speedily undergo decomposition, may be kept intact for an indefinite
                    length of time, as shown in the method of preserving meat by hermetically
                    sealing the jars after the expulsion of the air by heat. Again, the preservative
                    influence of a low temperature is well known; and extreme cold is a powerful
                    antiseptic, as proved in the case of the frozen mammoths of northern Asia.
                    Furthermore, the abstraction of moisture will prevent corruption in dead matter.
                    In warm and dry climates animal food may be preserved by exposure to the sun. In
                    the .ancient practice of embalming the dead, which is the earliest illustration
                    of the systematic use of antiseptics, the moister portions of the body were
                    removed before the preservative agents were added. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Embalming.)</hi> Numerous chemical substances have the power of counteracting
                    the putrefactive process. Many of these have been long known and used for this
                    purpose. In embalming, besides the application of various aromatics and resins,
                    the body was washed with cedar oil and natron (soda), and pitch or tar were used
                    as anti septies. Pitch was used by the Romans in wine-making to control the
                    fermentive process. The fumes of sulphur were largely employed by the ancients
                    for purposes of purification, while common salt has been known and used for ages
                    as one of the best preservatives from decay. The mineral acids possess
                    antiseptic properties, as do also many of the metallic salts—the chloride of
                    zinc, in the form of Sir W. Burnet’s disinfecting fluid, being one of the most
                    potent of them. Alcohol is well known for its power of preserving animal
                    substances from decay. Quinine has been found to possess strong antiseptic
                    properties. The tar products, notably carbolic acid, are among the most approved
                    and extensively used of all antiseptic agents. The various substances named
                    possess the power of preventing putrefaction in dead’animal or vegetable matter,
                    and to a greater or less degree of arresting it where already begun. They
                    likewise exert a similar action on the analogous process of fermentation. They
                    differ from mere disinfectants, which destroy the emanations from putrescent
                    material, but do not necessarily arrest the progress of decay. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Disinfectants.)</hi> Some antiseptics, however, such as
                    sulphurous acid, are powerful disinfectants also, while others, such as quinine,
                    have no disinfectant properties at all. · Various opinions are entertained
                    regarding the <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi> of
                    antiseptics. By those who hold the purely chemical theory of putrefaction they
                    are believed to operate in different ways according to their chemical
                    properties; thus, sulphurous acid is said to act by deoxidising the putrescible
                    matter; the mineral acids and metallic salts by combining with the substance,
                    and forming a permanent compound; and the tar acids in a similar manner. On the
                    other hand, the supporters of the germ theory maintain that carbolic acid, and
                    indeed all true antiseptics, produce their effect by acting as poisons to the
                    infusorial organisms which are held to be essential to the occurrence of the
                    putrefactive process.</p>
                <p>One of the most important applications of antiseptics has been their introduction
                    into medical and surgical practice. Although their internal administration, with
                    the view of counteracting diseases believed to be due to morbid poisons, has not
                    hitherto yielded any marked practical result, their employment in the treatment
                    of wounds has, in the hands of Professor Lister of Edinburgh, attracted much
                    interest, and has exercised an important influence on surgical practice during
                    the past ten years. Professor Lister, adopting the germ theory of putrefaction,
                    and regarding many of the evils arising in connection with open wounds as the
                    result of putrid discharges, produced by the agency of atmospheric germs, seeks
                    to exclude the access of these to wounded surfaces by the employment of
                    antiseptics, particularly carbolic acid, the power of which in destroying living
                    organisms is undoubted. Dressings of gauze, made antiseptic by previous
                    treatment with strong carbolic acid, are applied to wounds. The acid well
                    diluted with water is likewise employed as a lotion, and, during the dressing of
                    wounds and the performance of operations, is also applied in the form of spray
                    to the surrounding atmosphere, with the object of preventing all access of
                    germs. Boracic acid is also employed by Mr Lister as an antiseptic. The chief
                    benefits claimed for this method of treatment are, that wounds, however
                    extensive, may heal without the occurrence of putrefaction in the discharges,
                    and that thereby the risks of blood poisoning (pyaemia, *fcc.) are reduced to a
                    minimum. Although the antiseptic system in surgery is but on its trial, and its
                    practical advantages over the methods of treatment in general use are still
                    questioned by many high authorities, it has already obtained wide repute, and is
                    extensively employed by surgeons both in this and other countries. (j. o. <hi
