                <p><label type="entry">ASCETICISM</label>, from Greek dσ∕ojσιs, meaning the exercise
                    or training to which the athletes subjected themselves when preparing for the
                    games or contests, is used metaphorically to denote the habitual practice of
                    exercising restraint over, or subduing, the bodily desires and affections which
                    tend to lower objects, in order thereby to advance in the higher life of purity
                    and virtue. It is the means by which the mind withdraws itself from the
                    hindrances and temptations of the world, and clears its vision for what is
                    spiritual and true. In its lowest stage it consists in the mortification of the
                    flesh by fasting, penance, and the like; but in a higher sense it involves the
                    uprooting of all worldly or temporal desires, and withdrawal from the natural
                    relations of life. The origin of such a peculiar aspect of thought or mode of
                    action is to be found in the wide-spread idea, not wholly Oriental, that in
                    Unity or Identity alone is true goodness and happiness, while in Multiplicity or
                    Difference is evil and misery. Unity is but the abstract expression for God, the
                    Absolute, or Spirit, and Multiplicity for Matter, in which both Orientals and
                    Greeks thought to find the origin of evil. Now, in man exist both spirit, which
                    is the shadow of or emanation from the divine, and the body, with its various
                    desires <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0738-0677"/> and passions, which is of the nature of matter,
                    and therefore in itself evil. True happiness—nay, true life for man —consists in
                    contemplation of God, absorption into the divine unity and essence; and this
                    ecstatic vision can only be attained by the cultivation of the spirit, and the
                    mortification of the body. The desires and passions must be subdued, rooted up,
                    and the means recommended are solitude, poverty, celibacy, fasting, and penance.
                    We find, accordingly, that in all nations, those who seek divine illumination
                    prepare themselves by these means. In this respect the Hindoo fakirs, jogis,
                    dervishes, and gymnoso-phists, and the numerous sect of the Buddhists, are at
                    one with the Hebrew prophets, Nazari tes, and Chasidim, and with the priests of
                    the Grecian mysteries. In most of the Greek schools of thought, however,
                    asceticism had less a mystical and religious than a moral and practical bearing.
                    Even the solitude and abstinence practised by the Pythagoreans were connected
                    partly with their theory of metempsychosis, but mainly with their ethical
                    training. Socrates, who called temperance, or self-restraint, the chief of
                    virtues, had in view only the higher ethical life of the human spirit; and the
                    Cynics and Stoics, who carried out his doctrine to an extreme, endeavoured to
                    stifle the natural desires, and violate the natural relations of life, in order
                    to realise their ideal of a wise and self-sufficing man of virtue. In Plato,
                    however, appears very prominently the idea of matter as in itself evil and
                    hostile to the divine; and among the neo-Platonic and neo-Pythagorean schools of
                    Alexandria, who draw mainly from him, the doctrine and practice of a mystical
                    and religious asceticism were essentially involved in their philosophical
                    systems. About the same time similar principles had taken root among the Jews,
                    and appeared in Palestine among the Essenes (by some supposed to be an offshoot
                    from the Chasidim), in Egypt among the Therapeut», Into the heart of this circle
                    of ideas Christianity entered; it incorporated many of them, and lent additional
                    strength to the principle of asceticism in its higher signification. The deep
                    sense of the nothingness of temporal phenomena when compared with spiritual
                    realities, the conviction that in this world believers are but pilgrims, exposed
                    to many temptations through the weakness of the flesh, in which is the origin of
                    sin, and the many expressions which seemed to imply that riches and the ties of
                    marriage were real hindrances in the Christian life, contributed to strengthen
                    the already powerful tendency towards ascetic practices. Accordingly, in the
                    early church celibacy and poverty, with occasional fasting and penance, were
                    commonly recommended as means for the attainment of true virtue and communion
                    with God, and such practices soon began to be looked upon as having a special
                    merit in themselves. The natural consequence was that certain enthusiasts—such
                    as Paul of Thebes, Anthony, and Simeon Stylite⅛—vied with each other in their
                    fanatical asceticism, withdrawing to the desert, and spending their lives in
                    self-mortification. The persecutions of the church, which drove the Christians
                    together, and the introduction of cenobitisιn by Pachomius in the 4th century,
                    gave rise to monasticism, in which, for the first time, asceticism was reduced
                    to an organised system. But the constant reforms required to preserve the purity
                    of the monastic life, and the continuous protests against the whole practice,
                    which began in the 11th century with such men as Peter of Bruis and Henry of
                    Lausanne, and culminated in the Reformation, demonstrated the weakness of the
                    foundation on which the system had been built. Asceticism, meanwhile, was not
                    confined to the church, but had spread through the heretical and religious sects
                    which sprang up alongside of it. The Ebionites and Gnostics inculcated the
                    subjection of the body to the spirit; the new religion of Mani advocated the
                    absolute withdrawal of all desires from the world; and among the followers of
                    Mahomet, one sect, the Persian Sufis, specially distinguished themselves by
                    their practice of abstinence and solitary meditation. Even in modern times,
                    although ascetic practices have been modified, traces of the idea on which they
                    rest are not wanting. The principles of the Quaker Society, of the Methodists,
                    of the Communist bodies in America,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    Shakers,—and other enthusiasts, are modifications, more or less pronouncod, of
                    the ascetic way of thinking.</p>
