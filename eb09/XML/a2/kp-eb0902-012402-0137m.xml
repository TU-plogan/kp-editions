                    had its origin in Judaism. According to prophetic anticipations, the Messianic
                    time was to be immediately preceded by a great conflict, in which Jehovah would
                    fight out of Zion for His own people, and defeat the concentrated opposition of
                    the world. An Almighty leader on the one side seemed to require an antagonist on
                    the other, a head of the army of darkness against the Prince of light. Thus
                    Ezekiel depicts Gog proceeding out of Magog, to hazard a decisive battle against
                    the Lord and His saints on the eve of the Messianic age (chapters xxxviii. and
                    xxxix). The idea was subsequently embodied in Antiochus Epiphanes, who tried to
                    eradicate Judaism with savage hatred. When we consider the insane violence he
                    exhibited against the Jews and their temple, his prohibition of Jehovah’s
                    worship, the solemnisation of the Sabbath, and circumcision, it was natural to
                    regard him as the representative of heathenism in its opposition to the true
                    religion. Accordingly, the worshippers of Jehovah termed the small altar erected
                    by him to Olympian Jove in the holy temple at Jerusalem (168 B,c.), the <hi
                    rend="italic">abomination of desolation</hi> (Daniel ix. 27, xi. 31, xii. 11;
                    Mat. xxiv. 15). The apocalyptic visions of Daniel exerted an important influence
                    upon the Jews after the time of Antiochus, animating them with hopes of the near
                    approach of a better day, preceded, it is true, by a fearful struggle, in which
                    a powerful prince, the impersonation of heathenism in its fiercest hate, should
                    persecute the chosen people. The future of Israel was brightened by the visions
                    of one whose predictions had been at least partially fulfilled. After this the
                    idea seems to have been in abeyance till the reign of Caligula (40 A. D.), when
                    Greeks in Alexandria and Syria attempted to introduce images of the emperor into
                    the Jewish synagogues. The express command of Caligula addressed to the Jews, to
                    erect his image in the temple at Jerusalem, in the form of Olympian Zeus,
                    excited an intense commotion throughout Palestine, and must have recalled to the
                    Jews familiar with their Scriptures the similar conduct of Antiochus, as though
                    the prophet Daniel had foretold the blasphemy of the Roman emperor. In the
                    discourse of Christ recorded by Matthew (chapter xxiv.), a personal opponent or
                    antichrist does not appear, but the second advent is preceded by great
                    affliction, the desecration of the temple, false Messiahs, and false apostles.
                    This evangelic eschatology, however, appears in its present form to belong to a
                    late redactor, so that it is difficult to separate Christ’s own utterances from
                    other elements probably incorporated with them. Various sayings of Jesus
                    relative to his second appearing were evidently misapprehended or confused in
                    the reminiscences of the early disciples.</p>
                <p>St Paul resumes the idea of antichrist. Whatever Jewish conceptions he laid
                    aside, and he emancipated himself from the grossest of them, he did not abandon
                    the idea of an antichrist or terrible adversary of the true religion. The
                    prophecies of Daniel, whether in their supposed relation to Antiochus or
                    Caligula, and the impious command of the latter in particular to desecrate the
                    Jewish temple, furnished him with traits for the portrait of Christ’s great
                    enemy, whose manifestation in the Roman empire the state of the world led him to
                    suspect, especially as the empire was then identified by the Jews, as well as by
                    Paul himself, with the fourth and last kingdom of Daniel’s visions. Blending
                    together the notions of an antichrist and false Christ, the picture which St
                    Paul draws is that of the man of sin, “the son of perdition; who opposeth and
                    exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he
                    as god sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God; the wicked
                    one whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and
                    lying wonders,” &amp;c. (2 Thess. ii. 3-9). Here the epithet <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi><hi rend="italic">άνομο;</hi> appears to be borrowed from Isaiah xi. 4,
                    the apostle coinciding with the Chaldee interpreter in understanding the passage
                    of antichrist. The hindrance to the manifestation of the terrible enemy, to
                    which Paul obscurely alludes, seems to be the Roman empire in one or other of
                    its aspects; for we cannot adopt the ingenious conjecture that Claudius is
                    meant, though the name fits the apostolic expression ό <hi rend="italic"
                    >κατίχων,</hi><hi rend="italic">qui claudit, Claudius.</hi> Apart from the fact
                    that the neuter το <hi rend="italic">κaτιχov</hi> is used as well as the
                    masculine it is scarcely probable that one whose reign waa <pb break="no"

                    called the obstacle in the way of antichrist’s manifestation. The apostle, not
                    ignorant of Caligula’s blasphemous edict, seems to have thought of some Caesar
                    in whom the persecuting power of heathenism should culminate, without pointing
                    at either Claudius as the withholder, or Claudius’s successor as the man of sin.
                    The idea of antichrist was not historically fixed in his mind. Here we differ
                    from Hitzig and Hausrath; though the date of the Thessalonian epistles (about 52
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> presents no obstacle to the hypothesis, as De
                    Wette thinks it does.</p>
                <p>The author of the Revelation presents the antichrist idea in a more definite form
                    than St PauL Borrowing characteristic traits from Antiochus Epiphanes, perhaps
                    too from Caligula, whose blasphemous order to set up his own image in the
                    attitude of Olympian Zeus within the holy temple at Jerusalem created intense
                    excitement throughout Palestine, aware of the fearful persecution which the
                    Christians had suffered from Claudius’s successor on the throne of the Caesars,
                    the apostle John makes the man of sin or antichrist to be Nero returning from
                    the East, according to a report then current.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Düsterdieck in vain disputes this fact,
                    believing that the report in the form in which critics put it into the book, had
                    its source in misunderstood passages of the Apocalypse combined with 2 Thess.
                    ii. 8, &amp;c.</p></note> In his view the vicious cruelty of paganism had its
                    incarnation in the monster who set fire to Rome, torturing the Christians there,
                    and hesitating to commit no crime. If the capital of the heathen world had such
                    a head, the character of the great antichrist stood forth in him. Accordingly,
                    the writer describes Nero as the fifth head of the beast that rose out of the
                    sea, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Rome, who received a deadly wound which was
                    healed, who made war upon the saints and overcame them, who disappeared amid the
                    wondering of the world, to return with renewed power for three years and a half.
                    The number of the beast or head, 666, points unmistakably to Nero, for it is the
                    equivalent of pis ιop Kaesar Néron,: = 50, &gt; = 200, -&gt; = 6, s = 50, p =
                    100, ο = 60, i = 200. He is the beast that was and is not, the fifth fallen
                    head, one of the seven; the eighth, because he should reappear after his deadly
                    wound was healed. The succession of emperors is Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
                    Claudius, Nero, Galba. Renan has again sanctioned the reckoning of Julius Caesar
                    as the first of the list, on the authority of Josephus, Suetonius, Aurelius
                    Victor,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aurelius Victor

                    narrative begins with Octavius. Julius Caesar does not appear as
                    emperor.</p></note> Ac.; but Suetonius’s commencement of his lives of the
                    Caesars with Julius, is scarcely a valid proof of his reckoning him to be the
                    first of the line. Tacitus, Aurelius Victor, and Sextus Rufus, not to speak of
                    Hippolytus, favour the opinion that Augustus was the first emperor; and as the
                    birth of Christ was under him, Christianity has nothing to do with Julius
                    Caesar. In the view of the apocalyptist the latter is of no importance. The
                    apostle writing under Galba (68 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> held the
                    opinion then prevalent among Christians as well as others, that the emperor was
                    not really dead, but was in the East, whence he would return with an army of
                    Parthians to conquer and destroy Rome (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi> ii.
                    8; Suetonius, <hi rend="italic">Nero,</hi> cap. 57, Dio Chrysostom, <hi
                    rend="italic">Or.</hi> xxi.) Such belief had then taken possession of the minds
                    not only of the Jewish Christians in Palestine, but of the Jews themselves, who
                    were in a state of feverish excitement because Jerusalem was besieged. Terror
                    had seized all worshippers of the true God, because of the aspect which the
                    empire assumed (Revelation xiii. 3-8, 18, xvii. 11). The apocalyptist also
                    states that false or antichristian prophetism was to unite with the healed
                    beast, and cause men to worship him or be put to death (xiii. 14, 15). We assume
                    that the second beast, which rises out of the earth as the first does out of the
                    sea, is identical with the false prophet in xvi. 13, xix. 20, XX. 10, and that
                    it is a personification of false or heathen prophesying with its soothsaying and
                    auguries. But though Irenaeus sanctions this view, it is not without
                    difficulties, since the second beast ought in consistency to be historically
                    definite like the first. It cannot be that the writer means the apostle Paul;
                    for John, with all his Jewish tendencies, and hints unfavourable to Paul, would
                    not speak so strongly against the latter. If John were not the author, as some
                    incline to think, an unknown writer, with lively Judaic prepossessions, might
                    perhaps describe the apostle Paul in such dark colours, but even then it is
                    highly improbable. Renan supposes that some Ephesian impostor is meant, a
                    partisan of Nero’s, perhaps an agent of the pseudo-Nero, or the pseudo-Nero
                    himself. One thing is pretty clear, that <hi rend="italic">a polity</hi> is not
                    represented by either of the two beasts in the Apocalypse, or by Paul’s man of
                    sin. It is remarkable how long the legend about Nero’s revival continued, and
                    how widely diffused it became, though his body was buried publicly at Rome. Not
                    till the 5th century did it become extinct.</p>
                <p>The author of John’s first epistle has a more general and spiritual conception of
                    antichrist, partly in consequence of the Alexandrian philosophy which had
                    leavened thought in Asia Minor, as is perceptible in the fourth gospel. He finds
                    antichrist <hi rend="italic">within</hi> the church in any false teacher who
                    corrupts the true doctrine respecting the Father and the Son through a tendency
                    idealising away the practical basis of Christology. Such development of the idea
                    agrees better with the general representation in the discourses of Jesus than
                    the restricted individualising it received from Paul and John <hi rend="italic"
                    >outside</hi> Christianity, though the latter bears the older and Judaic stamp.
                    The author of I. John writes: <hi rend="superscript"> tt</hi> As ye have heard
                    that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists. He is
                    antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. This is that spirit of
                    antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is
                    it in the world” (ii. 18, 22, iv. 3). He that denied the Father and the Son,
                    that did not confess Jesus, was an antichrist in this author’s opinion. Probably
                    Gnosticism was in his view more than any other form of error. There was a
                    tendency among the later New Testament writers, as far as we can judge from 2
                    Peter ii. 15, to find antichrist in erroneous doctrine rather than an
                    individual. False teachers are called followers of Balaam. In the Apocalypse
                    itself certain heretics are termed Nicolaitanes or Balaamites, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i. e.,</hi> destroyers of the people.</p>
                <p>The sibylline oracles agree with the Apocalypse in identifying antichrist and
                    Nero. In those of Christian origin belonging to the earliest centuries, we find
                    the current belief that Nero, having fled beyond the Euphrates, should return
                    with an army to perpetrate farther cruelties in Rome. The descriptions in
                    question are based, in part, on those of the apocalyptist, and the tyrant is
                    directly identified with antichrist or Beliar.<note anchored="true"

                    great adversary in connection with the millennial reign was important for such
                    interpreters. The Alexandrian school, however, whose method of interpretation
                    was less literal and gross, generalised the idea in the manner of him who wrote
                    St John’s first epistle, making the principle of error or departure from the
                    faith to be personified in antichrist. The great opponent of Christ is an
                    abstraction, a sceptical tendency or principle, not an historical person.</p>
                <p>The later Jews had also their antichrist or anti-Messiah, whom they furnished
                    with peculiar attributes, and termed Armillus, 0√p∙⅛*κ. The name appears already
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Targum</hi> of Jonathan on Isaiah xi. 4, where the
                    godless Armillus is said to be slain with the breath of Messiah’s mouth. In
                    their description he becomes a terrible giant, golden haired, twelve e∏s in
                    height, as many in breadth, having the width of a span between his deep red
                    eyes. Born in Rome, he will assume to be the Messiah, and obtain many adherents.
                    The first Messiah, Joseph’s son, will make war upon him, but be overcome and
                    slain at Jerusalem. After this the second Messiah, David’s son, will defeat
                    Armillus with the breath of his mouth, and then God will reassemble the
                    dispersed of Israel, forming them into a united people, Christians and

                    Satan, and representing antichrist, is said to descend in the last days, in the
                    form of an impious monarch (Nero), the murderer of his mother. The world will

                    drag him down into Gehenna. The writer’s description is evidently moulded on
                    that of the apocalyptist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Nor is antichrist unknown to Mohammedan theology, in which he is called al Masih
                    al Dajjâl, the false or lying Christ, or simply al Dajjâl. He is to be one-eyed,
                    and marked on the forehead with the letters C. F. R., f.e., Cafir, or infidel.
                    Appearing first between Irak and Syria, or, according to others, in Khorasan, he
                    will ride on an ass, followed by 70,000 Jews of Ispahan, and continue on earth
                    forty days, of which one will be equal in length to a year, another to a month,
                    another to a week, and the rest will be common days; he is to lay waste all
                    places except Mecca, or Medina, which are guarded by angels; but at length he
                    will be slain by Jesus at the gate of Lud, near Joppa, assisted by the Imam
                    Mahedi, after which the Moslem religion will coalesce with the Christian into
                    one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See D’Herbelot’s

                    foretold several antichrists, as many as thirty, but one of greater note than
                    the rest.</p>
                <p>During the Middle Ages, and those which immediately followed, current opinion
                    discovered antichrist in heretics and sects. The Apocalypse and second epistle
                    to the Thessalonians were supposed to point at false doctrine and its leading
                    representatives. In their zeal against such as did not belong to the same church
                    as their own, ecclesiastics mistook the sense of the passages relating to the
                    dreaded adversary of Christ. Thus Innocent III. (1215) declared the Saracens to
                    be antichrist, and Mohammed the false prophet; and Gregory IX. (1234) pronounced
                    the emperor Frederick II. to be the beast that rose up out of the sea with names
                    of blasphemy on his head (Rev. xiii. 1-6).</p>
                <p>As the corruption of the Romish Church increased, and the necessity of reform
                    became more apparent, anti-ecclesiastical thought found antichrist in the
                    Papacy; and that again naturally provoked the church to characterise all
                    heretics as the collective antichrist. The strong language of the apostles
                    became a polemic weapon, easily wielded against any adversary possessing worldly
                    power inimical to the church’s interests, or holding opinions incompatible with
                    traditional orthodoxy. The Church of Rome led the way in misapplying the
                    Apocalypse during her contest with civil powers and heretics; her opponents
                    followed the example in turning the instrument against herself.
                    Anti-christianism could be embodied in the Papacy as well a3 in Protestantism.
                    It might be in a corrupt church as well as in heretical doctrine outside it.
                    Accordingly, the Wal-denses, Wicliffe, Huss, and many others, found antichrist
                    in the Pope. Luther hurled a powerful philippic <hi rend="italic"
                    >adversus</hi><hi rend="italic">execrdbilem</hi><hi rend="italic">bullam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">antichristi;</hi> and the articles of Schmal-kald embody the same
                    view, affirming: “Der Pabst aber, der allen die Seligkeit abspricht welche ihm
                    nicht gehorchen wollen, ist der rechte antichrist.”</p>
                <p>The history of opinion respecting antichrist, or rather the interpretation of
                    such Scriptures as present the idea, is by no means instructive. Conjectures too
                    often supply the place of sound exegesis. Much error has arisen from mixing up
                    portions of Daniel’s vision with those of the Apocalypse, because they refer to
                    different subjects. The apostle borrows characteristic features from Daniel’s
                    Antiochus Epiphanes to fill out his picture of Nero. The combination of St
                    Paul’s man of sin with St John’s antichristian Nero has also led to
                    misapprehension. The idea is variously developed according to the mental
                    peculiarities and knowledge of those who entertained it. Vague and general at
                    first, it was afterwards narrowed, somewhat in the manner of the Messianic one.
                    Its different forms show that it was no article of faith, no dogma connected
                    with salvation. Less definite in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, it is
                    tolerably specific in the Revelation. The author of John’s first epistle gave it
                    a spiritual width, consistently with the pantheistic direction which he follows
                    with feeble footsteps. In each case, however, the writers moved within their own
                    times, their knowledge bounded by the necessary limits of the human intellect,
                    so that their subjective views can hardly be accepted as the emanations of minds
                    projecting themselves into the world’s outer history with full intelligence of
                    its details. Limited to the horizon of their age, they did not penetrate into
                    the future with infallible certainty. What they express about antichrist is
                    their development of an idea which sprang out of Jewish soil and does not
                    harmonise well with the gradual progress of Christ’s spiritual kingdom. It is
                    not unusual, however, for men living in times of peculiar commotion, when the
                    good are oppressed and vice triumphs, to embody rampant opposition to truth and
                    righteousness in a person who concentrates in him seif the essence of
                    antichristian hate. If Christ is to conquer gloriously, a mighty adversary is
                    given Him who must be finally and for ever overthrown. Then commences the
                    universal reign of peace and purity under the benign sceptre of the Victor. Over
                    against Christ as King is set a formidable foe, not an abstract principle,— the
                    latter being an incongruous or less worthy adversary in the view of many. Yet it
                    is the very individualising of the antichrist idea which removes it from the
                    sphere of actual realisation. The extension, indeed, of the divine kingdom will
                    encounter opposition; and the reaction of the <pb break="no"

                    extension is more decided; but the personality and intenseness which the
                    apostles impart to the reaction transfer it to the region of the improbable.
                    Humanity is not so vicious as to break away from God with the extreme insanity
                    which the feelings of the sacred writers conjure up in times of fear for the
                    church. (Comp. Gesenius’s article “Antichrist” in Erseh and Gruber; De Wette’s
