                    does not include Palestine, while it comprehends Mesopotamia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Heb.</hi> Aram of two rivers), a region which the Greeks frequently
                    distinguish from Syria proper. Thus the Aramaic languages may be geographically
                    defined as the Semitic dialects originally current in Mesopotamia and the
                    regions extending S. W. from the Euphrates to Palestine. Philologically these
                    dialects form a distinct group of Semitic languages (North Semitic), separated
                    by grammatical and lexical peculiarities alike from the Middle Semitic (Hebrew,
                    Phoenician) and from the South Semitic (Arabic, Ethiopie). Babylonia is not part
                    of Aram, and the Semitic language of the Assyrian and Babylonian-arrowhead
                    inscriptions is not Aramaic.</p>
                <p>All Aramaic dialects are characterised by poverty of vowels, by the disappearance
                    of many of the forms of internal declension so characteristic of the original
                    genius of Semitic speech, and by a tendency to analytical construction by the
                    aid of relative particles in place of the earlier usage of the construct state.
                    Along with these marks of degradation they retain some antique features lost in
                    Hebrew and Arabic, and in particular, generally present the oldest consonantal
                    forms, having mutes instead of sibilants and aspirates, in a way quite analogous
                    to the relation of Low to High Dutch. A special Aramaic peculiarity is the
                    enclitic use of the article as in modern Danish.</p>
                <p>The tribes of ancient Aram never possessed political unity, their settlements
                    being intersected by strips of desert with Arabian population. Thus, there must
                    have been from an early time considerable diversity of dialect within the group,
                    and apart from differences due to the very various ages of the extant
                    literature, we are able to divide Aramaic into two main branches, commonly known
                    as Chaldee and Syriac respectively, and distinguished partly by differences of
                    pronunciation and vocabulary, but more conclusively by differences of
                    grammatical flexion, especially in the verb. In comparison with the great age of
                    this branch of Semitic, the whole Aramaic literature is of comparatively late
                    date, and presents the languages in an advanced and in some sense exhausted
                    stage of development.</p>
                <p>The historical and geographical relations of Syriac and Chaldee respectively are
                    involved in some obscurity. As the entire Chaldee literature is of Jewish
                    origin, Hupfeld and others have attempted to refer the whole difference of this
                    language from Syriac to an infusion of Hebrew elements. This view, however, is
                    now generally given up, and it is agreed that Chaldee is no corrupt dialect, but
                    a genuine Aramaic development. But where and when did the Jews give up their old
                    language and adopt a foreign tongue? The explanation formerly adopted and
                    embodied in the name Chaldee, which from the days of Jerome has been commonly
                    used to designate the Jewish Aramaic, is that the change took place in Babylon.
                    That the so-called Biblical Chaldee, in which considerable portions of the books
                    of Ezra and Daniel .are written, was really the language of Babylon, was
                    supposed to be clear from Dan. ii. 3, where the Chaldeans are said to have
                    spoken to the king in Aramaic, and accordingly the writer in the following verse
                    passes from Hebrew to that language. But the cuneiform inscriptions show that
                    the proper language of the Chaldeans was not Aramaic; and an examination of the
                    very large part of the Hebrew Old Testament written later than the exile seems
                    conclusively to prove that the substitution of Aramaic for Hebrew as the
                    vernacular of Palestine took place very gradually. Under the Persian empire
                    Aramaic was a sort of official language for the western provinces, and the
                    Hebrews were in constant contact with Aramaic populations, so that the language
                    of the many could not fail ultimately to supersede the language of the few.
                    Hence most scholars are now agreed in holding that the term Chaldee is a
                    misnomer, and that the dialect so called is really the language of the
                    South-Western Arameans, who were the immediate neighbours of the Jews. Probably
                    this doctrine would be no longer disputed but for the connection between the
                    question before us and that of the date and authorship of Daniel. In any case,
                    the substitution of Aramaic for Hebrew as the vernacular of Palestine was
                    completed before the time of Christ, and it is this dialect (not the language of
                    the Old Testament Scriptures) which is designated in the New Testament as
                    “Hebrew.” The old Hebrew Scriptures were understood only by the aid of
                    interpretations, which, at first oral, were set down in writing in the early
                    centuries of our era, and form after the Biblical Chaldee the second main
                    element of Chaldee literature, the so-called Targums. These versions or
                    paraphrases arose partly in the Palestinian, partly in the Babylonian schools,
                    and accordingly display considerable variety of dialect—the Palestinian Targums
                    approaching most nearly to the Aramaic of Daniel and Ezra. But the Aramaic of
                    the Targums is again very different from the language of every day life, as
                    presented in the Talmuds of Babylon and Jerusalem. The Talmudic dialects show
                    extreme phonetic and grammatical decay, but have hitherto been very inadequately
                    investigated. The Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud is more nearly allied to the
                    Aramaic of the East than to the language of Palestine.</p>
                <p>Of much greater historical importance than these Jewish dialects is the Aramaic
                    of the north and east, which rose to a literary language under the name of
                    Syriac, in the Chrstian schools of North Mesopotamia. Like so many other
                    languages, the Syriac first received stable literary form by the translation of
                    the Bible, the so-called Peshito. On this basis the language was assiduously
                    cultivated for many centuries, especially in the renowned schools of Edessa and
                    Nisibis, and possesses a very large literature, in which theology has a leading
                    place, but which is also strong in other forms of composition, as history and
                    poetry, and even extends into the domain of Occidental philosophy and science.
                    The treatment of the latter subjects in a Semitic speech was rendered possible
                    by the very great infusion of Greek elements (not merely technical terms, but
                    even particles and the like) brought into the language by long centuries of
                    Greek domination and culture. The period during which Syriac literature was most
                    flourishing extends from the 4th to the 10th Christian century. From the later
                    date onward, the language began to give way to Arabic, though some very
                    distinguished authors, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Barhebraeus, wrote as late
                    as the 13th century. Even now the Syriac is used to some extent as the
                    ecclesiastical <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0327-0308"/> language of various bodies of Christians,
                    Jacobites, Nes-torians, and Maronites. The systematic study of Syriac by
                    grammars and lexicons was commenced pretty early. Of native grammarians, may be
                    mentioned Jacob of Edessa (7th century) and Barhebraeus; of lexicographers,
                    Bar-Ali and Bar-Bahlul (9th and 10th centuries respectively). By the Maronites
                    the study of Syriac was transplanted to Europe in the 16th century. A corrupt
                    dialect (NeoSyriac) is still spoken in some districts near Mosul, in
                    Antilibanus, &lt;fcc., and has been grammatically handled by Stoddart, Noldeke,
                    and others. Besides the two main branches of Aramaic already discussed, several
                    minor Aramaic dialects claim to be noticed. The Samaritan dialect, spoken by the
                    mixed population introduced into Northern Palestine after the deportation of the
                    Ephraim-ites, has long been superseded as a living tongue by Arabic, but is
                    still the sacred language of the Samaritan communities. The most important
                    literary monument of this dialect is the Samaritan translation of the
                    Pentateuch; but we possess also Samaritan liturgies and other remains. Another
                    written dialect is the Mandean, the language of a mystical sect on the Euphrates
                    and Tigris, whose <hi rend="italic">Book of Adam</hi> has been edited by
                    Norberg. Other dialects are known only from inscriptions, as the dialect of the
                    Hauran, and that of certain Egyptian monuments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Helps to the Study of the Aramaic Dialects.—</hi> There is as
                    yet no good Grammar of the Chaldee dialects. That most commonly used is Winer’s

                    >targumischen ChdUdaismus,</hi>-which has passed through several editions, and

                    Talmudico Babilonese</hi> (Padua, 1865) is in some respects preferable to Winer.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Chaldäische Grammatik</hi> of Fuerst (Leipsic, 1835) is
                    unfinished. The best Chaldee Lexicon is still the old <hi rend="italic"

                    J. Levy, 2 vols. Leipsic, 1867-68, may be used with caution. On the controversy
                    as to the real character of the Chaldee dialects, the student may be referred to
                    the books of introduction to the Old Testament, especially to Schrader’s edition
                    of De Wette, which gives full references to relevant literature. Of recent
                    Syriac Grammars may be mentioned those of Hoffmann <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Grammatical</hi><hi rend="italic">Syriacae</hi><hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi

                    (London, 1858) in English. An elaborate and pretentious reconstruction of
                    Hoffmann’s Grammar by Professor Merx of Tübingen, treats all the Aramaic
                    dialects, but is not yet finished (part i. 1867, part ii. 1870). The Grammar of
                    Amira (Rome, 1596) is still referred to. There is no complete Syriac Lexicon
                    adequate to modern requirements. Michaelis’s edition of Castellus (Gottingen,
                    1788), and Schaafs <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Concordantiale</hi> to the New
                    Testament (Leyden, 1708), are valuable; and a great Thesaurus, compiled from
                    numerous sources, and from the collections of several scholars, is now being
                    published by the Clarendon Press under the editorship of Dr Payne Smith. On the
                    Samaritan literature see the introduction to Nutt’s <hi rend="italic">Fragments
                    of a Samaritan Tar gum,</hi> London, 1874. There is a Samaritan Grammar by

                    (Göttingen, 1862). The Aramaic inscriptions have been investigated by Gesenius,
                    De Vogué, Noldeke, and others. (W. R. S.)</p>
