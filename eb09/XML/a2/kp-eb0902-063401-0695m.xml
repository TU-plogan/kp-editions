                    Although arsenic was not recognised as a metallic element till the 18th century,
                    several of its compounds were known from remote antiquity; and the name <hi

                    applied by Dioscorides to the yellow sulphide of arsenic, orpiment, on account
                    of its very potent properties. To the present day <hi rend="italic superscript">

                <p>the term arsenic is more frequently applied to arsenious acid (the white arsenic
                    of commerce) than to the metallic element to which it strictly applies. Although
                    not very abundant, arsenic is one of the most widely disseminated of all
                    metallic elements, few sulphur ores being free from traces of it. Metallic
                    arsenic is found native in veins in metamorphic rocks in the mining districts of
                    Saxony and Bohemia, and other European localities, at Zmeov in Siberia, and very
                    abundantly in the silver mines at Chanarçillo in Chili. The ores employed in the
                    metallurgy of arsenic are mispickel or arsenical pyrites, smaltite, and
                    cobaltite; the arsenic in the case of the two last being a bye-product of the
                    preparation of cobalt and nickeL</p>
                <p>Arsenic is a highly brittle metal of a steel-grey colour, and of no very great
                    importance in the arts. It may be prepared direct from arsenical pyrites by
                    subliming in closed retorts, but it is more commonly reduced with powdered
                    charcoal from arsenious acid. The physical characteristics of the metal vary
                    according to the mode of its preparation; that produced directly from pyrites
                    being compact, crystalline, and nearly white, while the metal reduced from
                    arsenious acid is grey and pulverulent. It is chiefly used for mixing with lead
                    in the manufacture of small shot, the alloy dropping in rounder forms than pure
                    lead, which produces tailed drops. Arsenic is added to iron and steel for the
                    manufacture of chains and ornaments, the resulting combination taking a very
                    brilliant polish; and an alloy of copper and arsenic produces a brittle grey
                    metal of a brilliant silvery hue, used in the manufacture of buttons.</p>
                <p>Arsenious acid, or more properly anhydride, the arsenic or white arsenic of
                    commerce, is the form in which arsenic is chiefly produced in metallurgical
                    operations. It is found native to a small extent, and known by the mineralogical
                    name arsenite. The greater proportion of arsenious acid is obtained as a
                    bye-product of the reduction of cobalt and nickel from their ores. At
                    Reichenstein in Silesia, and Ribas in Catalonia, mispickel is worked for
                    arsenic. From the returns received at the English Mining Record Office it
                    appears that 5449 tons of arsenic were produced in England in 1873. More than
                    one-third of this came from one mine in Devonshire, where the arsenical pyrites
                    is converted into white arsenic by roasting. In the reduction of the ores, which
                    is accomplished in reverberatory furnaces, special precautions have to be
                    employed to defend the workman against arsenical fumes and dust. The arsenic is
                    obtained as an impure white powder, which is sublimed till sufficiently pure;
                    and thereafter, by sublimation at a high temperature, the product is formed into
                    a glassy mass. This glass is at first perfectly transparent, but it soon assumes
                    the opaque white appearance arsenic presents in commerce. Besides being the
                    basis of most arsenical preparations and compounds, it is used in the
                    manufacture of glass for reducing the iron oxide contained in sand. White
                    arsenic is one of the most violent of the acrid poisons. Its toxicological
                    relations, the tests for it, &lt;fcc., will be treated of under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Medical Jurisprudence.</hi></p>
                <p>Arsenic acid is prepared from arsenious acid on the manufacturing scale by
                    oxidising with strong nitric acid. It also is poisonous, but to a less degree
                    than arsenious acid; and it is noticed that people employed about it become very
                    fat, without any injury to health being apparent. It is now very extensively
                    employed in the manufacture of aniline dyes, and also as a substitute for
                    tartaric acid in discharging colours in calico printing. Both arsenite and
                    arseniate of soda are used as “dung-substitutes” in calico-printing. Scheele’s
                    green is an arsenite of copper, and Schweinfurth green is the aceto-arsenite of
                    copper. Both are brilliant green pigments in extensive use, and their employment
                    by paper-stainers has caused a good deal of excitement and unnecessary terror.
                    The rubbing off of arsenical particles in cleaning wall-papers may be injurious
                    to health, but there is no possibility of any arsenical exhalation arising from
                    the walls as has been alleged.</p>
                <p>Two sulphur compounds of arsenic—realgar and orpiment—are also of industrial
                    importance. Realgar, or ruby sulphur, is the disulphide of arsenic; and in its
                    native form it was known to the ancients, being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >σανδαράκη</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Theophrastus. It is prepared usually
                    from arsenious acid by mixing and melting it with,the required proportion of
                    sulphur. It is used only to a limited extent as a pigment, and is a constituent
                    of the Indian white fire used in fire signals and pyrotechny. Orpiment <hi
                    rend="italic">(auripigmentum),</hi> the yellow sulphide of arsenic (the <hi
                    rend="italic">αρσενικόν</hi> of Dios-co rides), occurs native in many
                    localities. It is, like realgar, artificially prepared by mixing arsenious acid
                    with the requisite quantity of sulphur, and subliming the mixture. Sulphur is
                    used in proportione varying according to the depth of yellow desired, the
                    orpiment of commerce not being a definite chemical compound, but a mixture of
                    arsenious acid and the yellow sulphide, the light tints sometimes containing as
                    much as 97 per cent, of white arsenic. It forms the artists’ colour called
                    king’s yellow; and in addition to some use as a common pigment, it is employed
                    in dyeing and calico-printing. The preparations of arsenic used in pharmacy, in
                    addition to arsenious acid, are <hi rend="italic">Liquor arsenicalis,</hi> or
                    Fowler’s solution, the hydrochloric solution of arsenic, arseniate of iron, and
                    the arseniate of soda.</p>
