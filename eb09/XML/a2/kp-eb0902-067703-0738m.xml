                    Anthony Wingfield having conceived a predilection for his third son Roger, took
                    him into his family, and extended his bounty so far as to give him the advantage
                    of a private education along with his own sons. Under a domestic tutor he made a
                    rapid progress in classical learning, and early discovered a great partiality
                    for reading. The superiority of genius and docility of temper which he
                    constantly displayed induced his patron to send him to St John’s College,
                    Cambridge, in the year 1530.</p>
                <p>The revival of Greek and Roman literature at the period Ascham entered upon his
                    studies was peculiarly favourable to the natural bent of his inclination. A
                    desire of excelling uniformly influenced his conduct; and, adopting the maxim
                    <hi rend="italic">Qui docet</hi><hi rend="italic">discit</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> y</hi> he began to teach boys the rudiments of the Greek language,
                    as soon as he was acquainted with the elementary parts himself. His plan was
                    approved by Pember, and under the direction of this valued friend he soon became
                    acquainted with the best Greek and Latin authors. He devoted himself
                    particularly to Cicero and Caesar, and from his constant study of these writers
                    acquired the elegant Latin style which proved so honourable and so advantageous
                    in the after part of his life. Ascham took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in his
                    18th year, and was chosen fellow of the college about a month afterwards. The
                    favourable disposition, however, which he manifested towards the reformed
                    religion was no small obstacle in the way of his preferment. He was admitted
                    Master of Arts in the year 1537, and about this period he began to act in the
                    capacity of a tutor.</p>
                <p>His reputation for Greek learning soon brought him many pupils, several of whom
                    afterwards rose to considerable eminence. Of these one of the most distinguished
                    was William Grindall, who obtained the station of master of languages to the
                    Lady Elizabeth, upon the recommendation of Sir John Cheke. The reason why Ascham
                    himself was not appointed to that honourable office is not known; but his
                    partiality for the university seems, from a hint in one of his letters, to have
                    been the cause. At that period there was no particular chair appropriated to the
                    Greek language, but Ascham was appointed by the university to read lectures upon
                    that language in the schools. A dispute arose in the university at that time
                    about the pronunciation of the Greek language, in which Ascham first opposed the
                    method observed by Sir John Cheke and Sir Thomas Smith; but, upon more mature
                    deliberation, he adopted that method, which has ever since been practised in the
                    English schools. Both on account of the beauty of his handwriting, and the
                    purity and elegance of his Latin, he was employed to write the public letters of
                    the university. In 1544, on the resignation of Cheke, he obtained the
                    appointment of university orator, an office which he retained with great
                    reputation during the period he was connected with the university.</p>
                <p>By the advice of his friend Pember, he turned his attention to the study of
                    instrumental music, and thereby enlivened his leisure hours, and prepared his
                    mind for renewed exertion. In his study he also amused himself with embellishing
                    the pages of his manuscripts with beautiful drawings, and in the field he took
                    part in the diversion of archery. The learned Ascham did not deem his labour
                    improperly bestowed in writing a book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toxo-philus,</hi> in an age when the proper use of the bow was of more
                    importance than for mere amusement. This work was written in a more natural,
                    easy, and truly English diction than had hitherto been in use; and it also
                    abounds with beautiful allusions and curious fragments of English history.
                    Ascham candidly acknowledges that, being anxious to make the tour of Italy,
                    which was then the great republic of letters, and particularly of Greek
                    literature, he wished, by dedicating his book to the king, to obtain a pension
                    to enable him to make that tour. It reflects credit on Henry VIII. that in the
                    year 1545 he settled upon him an annual pension of £10, which Dr Johnson
                    estimates at the value of £100. Upon the death of Henry this pension was renewed
                    by Edward VI., to whom Ascham was afterwards appointed Latin secretary.</p>
                <p>For some years he received an annual gratuity from Lee, archbishop of York, but
                    the amount of it is not recorded; and, in 1548, upon the death of his pupil
                    Grindall, preceptor to the Lady Elizabeth, his pupils and writings had acquired
                    him such celebrity, that he was appointed to direct the studies of that
                    princess. He successfully acquitted himself in that honourable charge; but two
                    years after, from some unknown cause of dissatisfaction, he returned to the
                    university, having taken an abrupt leave of the princess. This conduct of his
                    did not greatly affect his favour with royalty; for in the same year he was
                    recalled to court, and appointed secretary to Sir Richard Morisine, ambassador
                    to the Emperor Charles V. On his way to London he paid a visit to Lady Jane
                    Grey, whom he found in her chamber reading Plato’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phoedo,</hi> in Greek, “and that,” says he, “with as much delight as some
                    gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace,” while the duke and duchess, and
                    the rest of the household, were hunting in the park.</p>
                <p>In the character of secretary to Sir Richard, besides aiding him in the
                    management of his public affairs, he also conducted his private studies. During
                    the mornings of four days in the week, he read with him a portion of Herodotus
                    or Demosthenes, and in the evenings some pages of Sophocles or Euripides; on the
                    other mornings he wrote the letters of public business, and on the evenings he
                    either wrote his own private letters, or continued his diary and remarks. While
                    Ascham was on his travels, he made a short excursion to Italy, but was much
                    disgusted with the manners of the people, especially of the Venetians. After his
                    return from that tour, he published a curious tract, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >A Report and Discourse of the Afairs and State of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >G</hi><hi rend="italic">err many,</hi> &lt;tc.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Edward VI., Morisine was recalled, and Ascham returned to the
                    university. The accession of a Catholic queen held out little prospect of
                    advancement to a Protestant; but his fortune soon took a favourable turn,
                    through the interest of Bishop Gardiner, who obtained for him the office of
                    Latin secretary to the queen, with a salary of £20 a year, and permission to
                    retain his university emoluments. The prudence of Ascham enabled him to act a
                    respectable part, both under the government of Mary, and also in the most
                    perilous situations during the reign of Elizabeth; and the readiness and ele∙
                    gance of his Latin style rendered him a useful member at court. He is reported
                    to have written, during the course of three days, 47 letters to persons in the
                    highest ranks of life.</p>
                <p>When the crown passed to Elizabeth, it made little alteration in the condition of
                    Ascham, who still retained his station. He spent several hours every day in
                    reading the learned languages with the queen. Her proficiency was equal to his
                    pains; and it might have been expected that his services would have received
                    some reward more ample than £20 per annum, together with the prebend of
                    Westwang. The allegation that the queen kept him poor because he was extravagant
                    and addicted to cock-fighting, is hardly satisfactory.</p>
                <p>In consequence of a conversation which took place in the apartment of secretary
                    Cecil, upon the subject of education, Sir Richard Sackville, who was present,
                    requested Ascham to write a book on the general subject of education. This work
                    is entitled <hi rend="italic">The Scholemaster,</hi> and contains <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0740-0679"/> many excellent· directions to the instructors of
                    youth, particularly with regard to teaching languages, where he recommends the
                    method of double translation. It was published by his widow after his death. By
                    too close application in composing a poem, which he intended to present to the
                    queen on the New Year’s day of 1569, he was seized with an illness which proved
                    fatal. He died on the 23d of December 1568. His death was universally lamented,
                    and the queen expressed her regret by saying, that “she would rather have lost
                    £10,000 than her tutor Ascham.” His epistles, which are valuable both on account
                    of their style and historical information, were published after his death, and
                    dedicated to the queen; the beet edition is that of Elstob, published at Oxford
                    in 1703. His English works were published in 4to, with a life by Dr Johnson, in
                    1771. This edition has been reprinted in 8 vo. The whole works have been edited
                    by Dr Giles, London, 1864-5. Of the <hi rend="italic">Toxopldlus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Schdlemaster</hi> there are several reprints.</p>
