                        >Festum Fortunae Publicae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> on the tenth (?)
                    games in the circus, and on the nineteenth, equestrian combats, in honour of
                    Ceres; on the twenty-first—which was regarded as the birthday of Rome—the <hi
                        rend="italic">Vinalia urbana,</hi> when the wine of the previous autumn was
                    first »tasted; on the twenty-fifth, the <hi rend="italic">Robigalia,</hi> for
                    the averting of mildew; and on the twenty-eighth and four following days, the
                    riotous Floralia. In many countries of Europe, as England, France, and Germany,
                    the first of April has for long been appropriated to a facetious custom, for
                    which no very satisfactory origin has been assigned. To send an unsuspecting or
                    ignorant person on some bootless errand is the great endeavour of the day. In
                    Scotland the unfortunate subject of the trick is called a gowk—which has now,
                    though the words were probably at one time different, the meaning both of “fool”
                    and “cuckoo,”—and the mischievous errand-sending is “hunting a gowk.” In France
                    the dupe is called <hi rend="italic">poisson</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Avril,</hi> or
                    April-fish. One remarkable theory traces the custom to Noah, as sending out his
                    dove on such a quest; it is also referred either to the miracle plays
                    representing the sending of our Saviour from Annas to Caiaphas and from Pilate
                    to Herod, or to the change, in France, in 1564, of New Year’s day to the first
                    of January, which left the first of April destitute of anything but a burlesque
                    of its former festivities; and more recently an identification has been
                    attempted with the Hindoo festival of Huli, which is celebrated in a similar
                    manner on the 31st of March. No references to all-fools’-day have been found in
                    our earlier literature; and it seems that both England and Germany have derived
                    the fashion from France. St George’s day is the twenty-third of the month; and
                    St Mark’s Eve, with its superstition about those who were doomed to die, falls
                    on the twenty-fourth. In China the symbolical ploughing of the earth by the
                    emperor and princes of the blood takes place in their third month, which
                    frequently corresponds to our April; and in Japan a pleasant domestic festival,
                    called the feast of Dolls, is celebrated in the same month. The days of April

                    insurrections at Lyons, Paris, and elsewhere, against the government of Louis
                    Philippe in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous
                    trial known as the <hi rend="italic">Procès</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Avril.</hi>

                <p>A PRIORI and A POSTERIORI. The philosophical distinction expressed by these terms
                    is to be explained by referring to the phraseology of Aristotle. According to
                    him there may be a double starting-point in knowledge. When our individual
                    progress in learning is chiefly considered, the things with which we are first
                    and best acquainted may be termed earlier and <hi rend="italic">prior;</hi>
                    whereas the truths of a more general, primary, and fundamental character, to
                    which we are subsequently led, have a later and <hi rend="italic">posterior</hi>
                    position. But if we lose sight of our personal interest in knowledge, then the
                    priority may be more justly claimed by whatever is the cause or principle from
                    which something else springs. In this sense the causal, original, and primary in
                    the objective world is by nature prior <hi rend="italic">(πρότερον</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">φvσeι)</hi>; whilst the secondary and derivative existence is
                    posterior. Priority in the first acceptation is only relative to us, and for
                    general purposes may be called accidental; in the second acceptation, the
                    priority is absolute, and without qualification. It is the second acceptation
                    which Aristotle laid down as the properly philosophical one, and which regulates
                    the usage of the phrases <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                        posteriori</hi> by the schoolmen. In that sense of the term there can
                    evidently be no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> demonstration of first and
                    fundamental principles. According to Aquinas, for example, there can be no <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> knowledge of God; because He, as uncaused and
                    uncreated, cannot be deduced from anything prior in causation to Himself, and
                    can only be apprehended rationally by means of that which is consequent upon His
                    action, viz., the creatures of the natural world. In other words, our knowledge
                    of Him must be <hi rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> It is obvious that science
                    in the highest sense must be <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> if <hi
                        rend="italic">vere scire</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >per</hi><hi rend="italic">causas</hi><hi rend="italic">scire; i.e.,</hi>
                    the knowledge must spring from an insight into causes, which are the true
                    primaries. By an extension of this usage an argument is said to follow an <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> path, when from the basis of some conception it
                    proceeds to evolve by analysis all or some of the logical consequences; whereas,
                    the mode of reasoning, which endeavours to gather into a single formula the
                    various facts of observation, is described as <hi rend="italic">a
                        posteriori.</hi> The argument of Anselm, which, from the mere conception of
                    God, proposes to deduce his existence, is an example of <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> reasoning. An <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> reasoner has to
                    predict what is or will be, by considering what ought to be in accordance with
                    certain presuppositions. He tries by argument to assign beforehand the place of
                    a fact which may not yet have been discovered by observation. From the analysis
                    of certain given conditions, or by constructing the total product from some
                    given elements, he seeks to anticipate experience. Of course, if the original
                    conception be bad or defective, the conclusions will be false or inadequate.
                    Often too, what <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n228/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0228-0215"/> claims to be the mere deduction from a
                    conception, is secretly and perhaps unconsciously supplemented by more efficient
                    elements of proof. It is this circumstance, that imperfect knowledge is taken as
                    the ground for further conclusions, which has brought <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> reasoning into discredit. Apart from these defects, however,
                    this style of argumentation merely expresses the natural and blameless tendency
                    of the mind to make every acquired truth a sort of lever and fulcrum from which
                    to move the yet undiscovered and untried; and error is introduced only where
                    there is a failure to correct this tendency by constant recurrence to the
                    processes of verification. The <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> argument is based
                    upon what was originally given through experience; but before this experiential
                    truth becomes <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> it must lose its first and
                    empirical character, and be invested with the attributes of universality and
                    necessity. In this sense, which since the time of Kant has been commonly given
                    to the word, the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> is the opposite of the
                    empirical and contingent. Any truth which is relatively universal and necessary
                    may in its own sphere form the basis of an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    argument; and if there be anything which is absolutely universal and necessary
                    throughout the whole range of knowledge, it will be in a supreme sense <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori.</hi> Such, according to Kant, is the self-contained
                    and original faculty of mind, the forms and powers of the intellect and senses,
                    as contradistinguished from the materials presented by the senses and elaborated
                    by the understanding. To ascertain the special constitution of this <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> region, thus marked out by the criteria of
                    universality and necessity, to determine the features of thought when it is
                    independent of and prior to all experience, was the theme of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Critique of the Pure Reason.</hi> The general or universal
                    form and faculty of knowledge, thought in its native purity, constitutes the <hi
                        rend="italic">a priori</hi> element: whilst the particularising data of
                    experience, drifting in from the unknowable thing-in-itself, make up the region
                    of the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> An example of an <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> science, according to Kant, in this sense of the term, as not
                    dependent upon experience, is seen in pure mathematics; and there may also,
                    according to him, be a pure or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> philosophy of
                    nature; but there can be no pure or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> doctrine of
                    the ultimate ideas which regulate experience,—that is, metaphysics in the older
                    sense is impossible. (w. w.)</p>
