                <p><label type="entry">ARNOLD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a clergyman
                    of the Church of England, was born at West Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, on the
                    13th of June 1795. He was the son of William and Martha Arnold, the former of
                    whom occupied the situation of collector of customs at Cowes. Deprived at an
                    early age of his father, who died suddenly of spasm in the heart in 1801, his
                    initiatory education was confided by his mother to her sister, Miss Delafield,
                    who, with affectionate fidelity, discharged the office with which she had been
                    intrusted. From her tuition he passed to that of Dr Griffiths, at Warminster, in
                    Wiltshire, in 1803; and in 1807 he was removed to Winchester, where he remained
                    until 1811, having entered as a commoner, and afterwards become a scholar of the
                    college. In after life he retained a lively feeling of interest in Winchester
                    School, and remembered with admiration and profit the regulative tact of Dr
                    Goddard, and the preceptorial ability of Dr Gabell, who were successively
                    headmasters during his stay there.</p>
                <p>From Winchester he removed to Oxford in 1811, where he became a scholar at Corpus
                    Christi College; in 1815 he was elected Fellow of Oriel College; and there he
                    continued to reside till 1819. This interval was diligently devoted to the
                    pursuit of classical and historical studies, to preparing himself for
                    ordination, and to searching investigations, under the stimulus of continual
                    discussion with a band of talented and congenial associates, of some of the
                    pro-foundest questions in theology, ecclesiastical polity, and social
                    philosophy. The authors he most carefully studied at this period were Thucydides
                    and Aristotle, and for their writings he formed an attachment which remained to
                    the close of his life, and exerted a powerful influence upon his mode of thought
                    and opinions, as well as upon his literary occupations in subsequent years.
                    Herodotus also came in for a considerable share of his regard, but more,
                    apparently, as a book of recreation than one for work. In theology, his mind,
                    accustomed freely and fearlessly to investigate whatever camo before it, and
                    swayed by an almost scrupulous dread of aught that might appear to savour of
                    insincerity, was doomed to long and anxious hesitation upon several points of
                    fundamental importance before arriving at a serene and settled acceptance of the
                    great verities of Christianity. Once satisfied, however, of these, his faith
                    remained clear and firm , and having received his religion, not by tradition
                    from men, but as the result of an earnest, penetrating, and honest examination
                    of the evidence on which it re3ts, he not only held it with a steadfast grasp,
                    but realised it, and felt it as a living and guiding power. From this time
                    forward his life became supremely that of a <hi rend="italic">religious</hi>
                    man. To the name of Christ he was prepared to “surrender his whole soul,” and to
                    render before it “obedience, reverence without measure, intense humility, most
                    unreserved adoration” <hi rend="italic">(Sermons,</hi> vol. iv. p. 210). He did
                    not often talk about religion; he had no inclination to gossip about his
                    experience, or dwell upon the frames and feelings through which he passed; he
                    had not much of the accredited phraseology of piety even when he discoursed on
                    spiritual topics; but no man could observe him for any length of time without
                    feeling persuaded that more than most men he was directed by religious principle
                    and feeling in all his conduct. The fountain of his piety was in his heart’s
                    core; and its streams mingled easily with all the issues of his life. As his
                    biographer has beautifully remarked, “his natural faculties were not unclothed,
                    but clothed upon; they were at once coloured by, and gave a colour to, the
                    belief which they received.”</p>
                <p>He left Oxford in 1819 and settled at Laleham, near Staines, where he was
                    occupied chiefly in superintending the studies of seven or eight young men who
                    were preparing for the university. His spare time was devoted to the prosecution
                    of studies in philology and history, more particularly to the study of
                    Thucydides, and of the new light which had been cast upon Roman history and upon
                    historical method in general by the researches of Niebuhr. He was also
                    occasionally engaged in preaching, and it was whilst here that he published the
                    first volume of his sermons. Shortly after he settled at Laleham, he entered
                    into the marriage relation with Mary, youngest daughter of the Rev. John
                    Penrose, rector of Fledborough, Nottinghamshire.</p>
                <p>After nine years spent at Laleham, he was induced to offer himself as a candidate
                    for the head-mastership of Rugby, which had become vacant; and though he entered
                    somewhat late upon the contest, and though none of the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n688/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0688-0627"/> electors were personally known to him, he was
                    nevertheless successful. He was elected in December 1827; in June 1828 he
                    received priest’s orders; in April and November of the same year he took his
                    degrees of B.D. and D.D., and in August entered on his new office.</p>
                <p>In one of the testimonials which accompanied his application to the trustees of
                    Rugby, the writer stated it as his conviction, that “if Mr Arnold were elected,
                    he would change the face of education all through the public schools of
                    England.” Nobly was the somewhat hazardous pledge redeemed by him in whose name
                    it had been given. Under his superintendence the school became not merely a
                    place where a certain amount of classical or general learning was to be
                    obtained, but a sphere of intellectual, moral, and religious discipline,, where
                    healthy characters were formed, and men were trained for the duties, and
                    struggles, and responsibilities of life.</p>
                <p>Rugby was privileged to enjoy his superintendence for nearly fourteen years.
                    During this period his energies were chiefly devoted to the business of the
                    school; but he found time also for much literary work, as well as for an
                    extensive correspondence. Five volumes of sermons, an edition of Thucydides,
                    with English notes and dissertations, a History of Rome in three vols. 8vo,
                    besides numerous articles in reviews, journals, newspapers, and encyclopaedias,
                    are extant to attest the untiring activity of his mind, and his patient
                    diligence during this period. His interest also in public matters was incessant,
                    especially ecclesiastical questions, and such as bore upon the social welfare
                    and moral improvement of the masses.</p>
                <p>In 1841 Dr Arnold received from Lord Melbourne, then prime minister, the offer of
                    the chair of modern history at Oxford, an offer which he accepted with peculiar
                    satisfaction. On the duties of this new office he entered on 2d December 1841,
                    by delivering his inaugural lecture, amidst circumstances which he felt to be
                    peculiarly gratifying and flattering. Seven other lectures were delivered during
                    the first three weeks of the Lent term of 1842; the whole have been published
                    since his death.</p>
                <p>A few months after the delivery of his lectures, Arnold was suddenly removed from
                    his earthly duties and anticipated enjoyments by an attack of angina pectoris.
                    The midsummer vacation had arrived, and he was preparing to set out with his
                    family to Fox How, a favourite retreat, where he had purchased some property and
                    built a house, in Westmoreland. After a busy day spent in various duties, he
                    retired to rest apparently in perfect health. Between five and six next morning
                    he awoke in severe pain. All attempts to arrest the fatal malady proved
                    fruitless. He bore with heroic fortitude and Christian resignation his
                    sufferings, until eight o’clock, when he expired. The day on which he died was
                    Sunday, the 12th of June 1842. His remains were interred on the following Friday
                    in the chancel of Rugby chapel, immediately under the communion table.</p>
                <p>We have no space left to attempt a delineation of tho separate features of
                    Arnold’s character. We can only remark in general, that the great peculiarity
                    and charm of his nature seemed to lie in the regal supremacy of the moral and
                    the spiritual element over his whole being and powers. His intellectual
                    faculties were not such as to surpass those of many who were his contemporaries;
                    in scholarship he occupied a subordinate place to several who filled situations
                    like his; and he had not much of what is usually called tact in his dealings
                    either with the juvenile or the adult mind. What gave him his power, and secured
                    for him so deeply the respect and veneration of his pupils and acquaintances,
                    was the intensely religious character of his whole life. He seemed ever to act
                    from a severe and lofty estimate of duty. To be just, honest, and truthful, he
                    ever held to be the first aim of his being. With all this, then was intense
                    sympathy with his fellows, the tenderesl domestic affections, the most generous
                    friendship, the mosl expansive benevolence. But to understand aright his claims
                    upon our respect and homage, the history of his life mus1 be read at large. As
                    has been truly observed by one whc seems to have known him well—“His Thucydides,
                    his history, his sermons, his miscellaneous writings, are all proofs of his
                    ability and goodness. Yet the story of his life is worth them all.”— <hi
                        rend="italic">Edin. Rev.,</hi> vol. lxxxi. p. 234. His life has been most
                    ably written by the Rev. A. P. Stanley, M.A., now D.D. and Dean of Westminster,
                    in two volumes, 8vo. Lond. 1845. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">l. a.)</hi></p>
