                <p><label type="entry">ANNE</label>, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, was born on
                    the 6th of February 1664. She was the second daughter of James Duke of York,
                    afterwards James II. She was only seven years old when her mother, Anne Hyde,
                    died, having previously professed adherence to the Church of Rome, a step which
                    was immediately imitated by her husband. The duke, however, had to allow his
                    daughters, the princesses Mary and Anne, to be brought up as Protestants; and
                    Anne always continued to be attached, zealously and even bigotedly, to the
                    Church of England. In her twentieth year she was married to Prince George, the
                    brother of the King of Denmark. In the establishment then formed for her, a
                    place was given, on her own earnest desire, to her early playfellow Lady
                    Churchill, afterwards Duchess of Marlborough; and this ambitious and imperious
                    woman, acquiring rapidly an irresistible authority over the feeble mind of the
                    princess, thenceforth ruled her absolutely for more than twenty years. Not long
                    afterwards, when the Duke of York had become king, he made repeated attempts to
                    convert the princess Anne to his own creed; he engaged that, if she would become
                    a Roman Catholic, she should be placed in the line of succession to the throne
                    before her elder sister Mary. Prince George appears to have received those
                    overtures favourably; but he, an indolent and goodnatured man, who cared for
                    nothing but good eating and field-sports, never had any influence over his wife.
                    She remained firm in her Protestantism, lived in retirement during the whole of
                    her father’s reign, and did not allow her opinions or feelings any further vent
                    than that which they found in her private correspondence with the Princess of
                    Orange. When, in 1688, James’s queen gave birth to a son, the sisters took a
                    lively interest in the suspicions and, inquiries that arose; and Anne was easily
                    led to believe that the child was supposititious; though later in her life she
                    must have been convinced that he was really her brother. Before the landing of
                    the Prince of Orange Prince George was pledged to join him; and his wife and
                    Lady Churchill abandoned King James on the first opportunity.</p>
                <p>From the Revolution till the death of William HL, Anne’s way of life was as quiet
                    and obscure as it had been during the reign of her father. She did, indeed, on
                    the prompting of her favourite, acquiesce in the act of the
                    convention-parliament, which, postponing her place in the succession, gave the
                    throne to William in case he should survive Mary. But the sisters soon
                    quarrelled, and never were reconciled. The misunderstanding began in trifling
                    questions of etiquette, quite fitted to the calibre of both of the royal minds;
                    but considerations of real importance soon compelled the king himself to
                    interfere. The Churchills, traitorous to their new sovereign, as they had been
                    to the old, were known to be intriguing for the restoration of James; and they
                    induced Anne to write secretly to her father, and declare repentance for her
                    desertion of him. Even when William dismissed Marlborough from all his places,
                    the princess obstinately persisted in retaining his wife in her household. After
                    Queen Mary’s death the king and his sister-in-law went through the forms of a
                    reconciliation; but there was no confidence on either side; and indeed the
                    secret correspondence with Saint Germains was still carried on. The state of the
                    succession to the crown threatened new difficulties. Anne had seventeen
                    children, but most of them were still-born; and the Duke of Gloucester, the only
                    one who survived infancy, died in 1700 at the age of eleven. The Jacobites,
                    however, were unable to prevent the passing of the Act of Settlement, which
                    placed the Electress of Hanover after Anne in the succession to the crown.</p>
                <p>On the 8th of March 1702, Anne became queen of England by the death of William,
                    being then thirty-eight years of age. Into her short reign there were crowded
                    events possessing vast importance, both for the British Emp⅛e and for the whole
                    of Europe; and her name is customarily associated with one of the most
                    characteristic epochs in the history of English literature. Marlborough and
                    Peterborough commanded her armies; her councils were directed in succession by
                    Godolphin and Somers, by Harley and St John; Berkeley and Newton speculated and
                    experimented; and the “wits of Queen Anne’s time” were mustered, in poetry and
                    in prose, under such chiefs as Prior and Pope, Swift, Addison, and Steele,
                    Arbuthnot and Defoe. But no sovereign could have exerted less of real and
                    personal influence than Queen Anne did, either on the national polity or on the
                    national enlightenment. A blessed thing it was that she should have been thus
                    powerless. For, beyond her own epicurean comforts, and the petty ceremonial of
                    her court, there were just three ideas which her narrow and uninstructed
                    intellect admitted: each of these ideas was full of danger to the peace and
                    happiness of the state; and each of them was cherished by her with the
                    hereditary stubbornness of a Stuart. She was as eager as any one of her race to
                    enlarge the prerogatives of the crown: her father’s devotion to the Church of
                    Rome was not stronger than was her desire to increase the power of the Church of
                    England; and she never ceased to wish earnestly that her exiled brother should
                    be her successor on the throne. In no stage of Anne’s reign was even the last of
                    these designs impracticable: there were always able statesmen inclined to lead
                    the way; and more than once the tide of public opinion set towards absolutism,
                    both political and ecclesiastical. The queen, however, was not only dull and
                    ignorant, but also indolent, fond of flattery, and accustomed from her youth to
                    let herself be guided by stronger and more active minds than her own. Whatever
                    her wishes might be, her actions were ruled by her female favourites.
                    Fortunately the earlier of her two directresses, a woman of extraordinary force
                    of character, was both willing and able to keep in check the queen’s private
                    inclinations: not less fortunate was it that <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0072-0063"/> the sway exercised by the next possessor of
                    the royal favour was speedily cut short by her mistress’s death. The course of
                    English history might have flowed less smoothly if the Duchess of Marlborough
                    and her husband had not become convinced that their own interest lay in
                    supporting the principles of the Revolution; and those principles might have
                    sustained a rude shock, if Mrs Masham and her Jacobite allies had been allowed a
                    few months longer to mature the queen’s plans and their own.</p>
                <p>The reign of Queen Anne, lasting for twelve years, falls naturally into two
                    unequal periods.</p>
                <p>During the first of these, the Duke of Marlborough was paramount in the houses of
                    parliament, and his wife in the royal closet. A ministry of Tories was formed on
                    the queen’s accession; but the leaders of it were Marlborough and Godolphin, who
                    immediately began to edge off from their party. The principal measures were,
                    from the beginning, in substantial conformity to the policy of King William: the
                    war with France, hardly resisted then by any part of the nation, was prosecuted
                    with ardour and success; and the victories of Oudenarde, Ramillies, and
                    Blenheim, gained by the consummate generalship of Marlborough, made England
                    formidable and illustrious throughout Europe. In the internal affairs of the
                    kingdom, Whig principles for a time prevailed more and more; the party acquired
                    a decided majority in the House of Commons; and the ministry came to be composed
                    almost entirely of Whigs, some of the Tories being dismissed, and others, like
                    the two leaders, showing the accommodating flexibility of opinion which was so
                    rife among the statesmen of that slippery age. The union of England and Scotland
                    was carried through in the face of many difficulties; and, while the proceedings
                    of the ministry in the matter were by no means perfectly pure, the measure owed
                    its success mainly to the independent and honourable assistance of the best man
                    among the Whigs, the accomplished and patriotic Lord Somers. During several
                    years, in short, barriers were gradually and firmly built up against the old
                    system and the old parties. But other days were at hand. The domineering
                    favourite of the queen presumed rashly on her power, and offended the
                    self-esteem of her mistress. Mrs Masham, a poor relation of the duchess, whom
                    she had introduced into the royal household, soothed Anne’s fretful temper,
                    gratified her vanity, and quickly, though secretly, acquired her confidence and
                    affection; and, under the guidance of the new favourite, and her prompter
                    Harley, the queen was encouraged to hope for the attainment of all her most
                    cherished aims. The state of public opinion underwent a corresponding change.
                    Even under the masterly government of William, disappointments had been felt by
                    those who expected impossibilities from the Revolution; discontent now diffused
                    itself very widely, the main cause being the increase of taxation which had been
                    rendered necessary by the Continental war. The Tories and Jacobites, led by some
                    of the ablest of the statesmen, and assisted by some of the most skilful and
                    energetic of the political writers, dexterously used the combustible materials
                    that were accumulating, and made the church also an active engine of mischief.
                    The ministry saw their parliamentary majorities wasting away; they were
                    personally treated at court with open contumely; and their ruin was completed
                    when, still relying too boldly on their supposed strength, they impeached
                    Sacheverell for publicly preaching in favour of^ Jacobitism and the divine right
                    of kings. In August 1710 the Whig administration was ignominiously
                    discarded.</p>
                <p>The second period of the queen’s reign began at this point. She was thenceforth
                    governed by Mrs Masham; Mrs Masham was governed by Harley and St John, the
                    chiefs of the new ministry; and these able and unscrupulous men exerted
                    themselves to the utmost of their power in undoing all that had been done by
                    their predecessors. The fruits of the war were immediately abandoned, and the
                    allies of England shamefully betrayed, by the treaty of Utrecht. If open attacks
                    were not made on the constitution, it was only because the Parhament could not
                    be trusted in such a case, and because, also, the two ministerial leaders became
                    jealous of each other, and formed separate intrigues. Harley, the Sinon of the
                    time, corresponded both with St Germains and with Hanover; St John, more
                    decidedly Jacobite, plotted with Mrs Masham and the queen to procure the crown
                    for the Pretender, on the ostensible condition of his professing Protestantism.
                    But these cabals oozed out sufficiently to alarm the honourable Tories, and to
                    array them and the bishops against the ministry in Parliament. The time,
                    likewise, during which the danger was growing, proved too short to allow it to
                    become ripe. Harley and Mrs Masham came to an open quarrel one evening in Anne’s
                    presence; after they had squabbled for hours, the poor queen just retained
                    strength enough to insist that the minister should resign on the spot; she then
                    retired at two in the morning, and lay down on her deathbed. She was seized with
                    apoplexy, and died on the 1st of August 1714. St John’s schemes were not ready
                    for execution; and, by the prompt activity of a few patriotic statesmen, the
                    accession of George I. was immediately and peaceably secured. (w. s.)</p>
