                    the name given to that part of Gallia which lay between the Garumna and the
                    Pyrenees, and was inhabited by a race distinct from the Celtae. According to
                    Bial and Bello-guet, Aquitani is probably a form of Auscetani, a Hispanic
                    lengthening of Ausces (Ausks, Wasks, Basques), and Aquitania would thus be
                    radically identical with Gascony (Wasconia), a word of much later introduction
                    into geographical nomenclature. Though the greater proportion of the Aquitanian

                    Valerius Messala. In keeping with the imperial policy of denationalisation, the
                    term Aquitania was extended, in the division of Gallia under Augustus, to the
                    whole stretch of country south and east of the continuous course of the Loire
                    and the Allier, and thus ceased to be of ethnographical import. In the 3d
                    century after Christ this extended Aquitania was divided into three parts. <hi
                    rend="italic">Aquitania</hi><hi rend="italic">Prima</hi> consisted of the
                    eastern portion of the district between the Loire and the Garonne; <hi
                    rend="italic">Aquitania Secunda,</hi> of the western part of the same district;
                    and <hi rend="italic">Aquitania Tertia</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >N^ovempopulania,</hi> of the region between the Pyrenees and the Garonne, or
                    the original Aquitania. Like the rest of Gau], Aquitania absorbed a large
                    measure of Roman civilisation which continued to distinguish the district down
                    to a late period. In the 5th century the Visigoths established themselves in
                    Aquitania Secunda, and in some cantons of Narbonensis Prima and Novempopulania.
                    As their power also included Spain, it was usual to speak of their Gallic
                    possessions as Spain likewise. The Merovingian kings extended their authority
                    nominally to the Pyrenees; but as Guizot has remarked <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Essais,</hi> No. ii.) “the conquest of Aquitania by Clovis left it almost as
                    alien to the people and king of the Franks as it had formerly been ’ For a time
                    indeed, about 630, the Aquitanians rallied round Haribert (Charibert), the
                    brother of Dagobert, in hope of national independence, even under a Frankish
                    ruler; but the usual story that their ducal family was descended from him rests
                    on a forgery (z&gt;. Henri Martin, <hi rend="italic">Hist, de France,</hi> vol
                    ii. p. 137). About the end of the 7th century, an adventurer named Eudes or
                    Eudon had made himself master of the region. Attacked by the Saracens, he
                    inflicted on them a crushing defeat but, on their reappearance, was obliged to
                    call in the aid of Charles Martel, who, as the price of his assistance, claimed
                    the homage of his ally. He was succeeded by his son Hunald, who, after carrying
                    on a war against the aggressions of Pepin the Short, retired to a convent, and
                    left the conflict and the kingdom to Guaifer (Waifer). For nine years he
                    strenuously maintained the hopeless strife, till his assassination in 768. With
                    him perished for a time the national independence, but not the national
                    individuality, of the Aquitanians. The kingdom of Aquitania was bestowed by
                    Charlemagne on the infant Louis in 781; and from him it was transmitted to his
                    son Pepin, on whose death the Aquitanians loyally chose Pepin the younger, but
                    were opposed by Louis, who gave the crown to Charles the Bald. Hence ensued a
                    long period of confusion and conflict, which resulted in the comparative success
                    of Charles, who granted the Aquitanians a nominal separation from Neus-tria, and
                    gave them his son Charles, eight years old, to be their nominal king
                    (855)—nominal, not only because he was a child, but because his kingdom was in a
                    state of anarchy through domestic faction and foreign invasion. On his death
                    (866), Louis the Stammerer succeeded to the titular sovereignty. About 886
                    Guilhem (William) the Pious, count of Auvergne, the founder of the abbey of
                    Cluny, obtained the title of Duke of Aquitania, and transmitted it (918) to
                    Guilhem II. He was followed in succession by Raimond Pons, count of Toulouse (d.
                    950), Guilhem Tête d'Etoupes, count of Poitiers (d. 963), Guilhem Fier-à-Bras,
                    whose sister was married by Hugh Capet (970), and Guilhem the Great (977-1030),
                    who had hard work to maintain his ground, but at last changed his title into an
                    effective lordship. His duchy almost reached the limits of the I. and II.
                    Aquitania of the Romans, but did not extend south of the Garonne, that district
                    having been ever since the 6th century in the possession of the Gascons. Guilhem
                    refused the empire offered him by the Italians, and died at Maillezais.
                    Meanwhile civilisation and refinement were gradually increasing. The names of
                    Guilhem VI. (d. 1038), Guilhem VII., who joined Gascony and Bordeaux to his
                    duchy, and married his daughter to Henry the Black, and Guilhem VIII. bring us
                    down to Guilhem IX., who succeeded in 1086, and made himself famous as crusader
                    and troubadour. Guilhem X. (d. 1137) married his daughter to Louis VII. of
                    France, and Aquitania went as her dowry. On her divorce from Louis and marriage
                    with Henry II. of England (1152), her possession passed to her new husband, and
                    from that time continued to follow the fortunes of the English territories in
                    France. The name Guienne, the modern corruption of Aquitania, seems to have come
                    into use about the 10th century. An interesting literary relic of the struggle
                    between the Franks and the Gallo-Roman inhabitants of Aquitania exists under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Walther d'Aquitaine</hi> (see Fauriel·s <hi
                    rend="italic">Poésie Provençale'),</hi> but the historical value of this work
                    has been questioned.</p>
