                <p><label type="entry">ANTONIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus [Mark
                    Antony]</hi></label>, grandson oi Antonius the orator, and son of Antonius
                    Creticus, seems to have been born about 83 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> While
                    still a child he lost his father, whose example, however, had he been spared,
                    would have done little for the improvement of his character. Brought up under
                    the influence of the disreputable Cornelius Lentulus Sura, w hom his mother had
                    married, Antony spent his youth in profligacy and extravagance. For a time he
                    co-operated with the reprobate Clodius in his political plans, chiefly, it is
                    supposed, through hostility to Cicero, who had caused Lentulus, his stepfather,
                    to be put to death as one of the Catiline conspirators; but he soon withdrew
                    from the connection, on account of a disagreement -which, appropriately enough,
                    arose in regard to his relations to his associate’s wife, Flavia. Not long
                    after, in 58 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> he fled to Greece, to <pb

                    length, after a short time spent in attendance on the philosophers at Athens,
                    found an occasion for displaying some of the better features of his character in
                    the wars that were being carried on by Gabinius against Aristobulus in
                    Palestine, and in support of Ptolemy Auletes in Egypt. A new chapter in his life
                    was opened by the visit which he made to Julius Caesar in Gaul (54 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) Welcomed by the victorious general as a valuable
                    assistant in his ambitious designs, and raised by his influence to the offices
                    of quaestor, augur, and tribune of the plebs, he displayed admirable boldness
                    and activity in the maintenance of his patron’s cause, in opposition to the
                    violence and intrigues of the oligarchical party. At length his antagonists
                    prevailed, and expelled him from the curia; and the political contest became a
                    civil war. The Rubicon was crossed; Caesar was victorious, and Antony shared in
                    his triumph. Deputy-governor of Italy during Caesar’s absence in Spain (49),
                    second in command in the decisive battle of Pharsalia (48), and again
                    deputy-governor of Italy while Caesar was in Africa (47), Antony was now
                    inferior in power only to the dictator himself, and eagerly seized the
                    opportunity of indulging in the most extravagant excesses of luxurious
                    licentiousness, — excesses which Cicero depicted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philippics with</hi> all the elaborate eloquence of political hatred. In 46 he
                    seems to have taken offence at Caesar, because he insisted on payment for the
                    property of Pompey which Antony professedly had purchased, but had merely
                    appropriated. But the estrangement was not of long continuance; for we find
                    Antony meeting the dictator at Narbo the following year, and rejecting the
                    advances of Trebonius, who endeavoured to discover if there was any hope of
                    getting Antony to join in the conspiracy that was already on foot. In 44 he was
                    consul along with Caesar, and seconded his ambition by the famous offer of the
                    crown on the 15th of February, thus unconsciously preparing the way for the
                    tragedy of the 15th of March. To the sincerity of his adherence to Caesar the
                    conspirators themselves bore witness on that memorable day, by the care which
                    they took to keep him engaged -without while the daggers were doing their work
                    within. This was the second great epoch in Antony’s life. A brighter prospect
                    than ever was then opened to his ambition. By his eloquence —a hereditary
                    gift—he managed to stir up the minds of the populace against the assassins of
                    Caesar, and drove them from the city. He made peace with the remaining
                    representatives of the senatorial party, and almost seemed to have succeeded to
                    the power and position of his unfortunate patron. But the youthful Octavius,
                    whom Caesar had adopted as his son, arrived from Illyria, and claimed the
                    inheritance of his “father.” Agreement was impossible, and war ensued. Octavius
                    obtained the support of the senate and of Cicero; and the veteran troops of the
                    dictator flocked to his standard. Antony was denounced as a public enemy; and
                    the city gave its loudest applause to the tirades of his most eloquent accuser.
                    His cause gradually lost ground, and at last seemed to be totally ruined when
                    his army was defeated in the siege of Mutina (43 B.C.) But escaping to Cisalpine
                    Gaul, he formed a junction with Lepidus, and they marched towards Rome with 17
                    legions and 10,000 cavalry. The wily Octavius now 1 etrayed his party, and
                    entered into terms with Antony and Lepidus. It was agreed that they three should
                    adopt the title—so beautifully ironical—of <hi rend="italic">Triumviri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">reipublicoe</hi><hi rend="italic">constituendas,</hi> and share
                    the power and the provinces among them. Gaul was to be Antony’s; Spain fell to
                    the lot of Lepidus, and Africa, Sardinia, and Sicily were to belong to Octavius.
                    A conjunct proscription followed, each of the partners in the vιllanous design
                    bartering the life of his friends for the pleasure of destroying his foes. The
                    detested author of the <hi rend="italic">Philippics</hi> was given up to
                    Antony’s revenge; and, according to Appian, the number of the victims amounted
                    to 300 senators and 2000 knights. In the following year Antony and Octavius
                    proceeded against the conspirators Cassius and Brutus, who still maintained
                    themselves in Macedonia; and, in the battles of Philippi, stamped out the last
                    embers of republican Rome. While Octavius returned to Italy, Antony proceeded to
                    Greece, and thence to Asia Minor, for the sake of recruiting his funds,
                    completing the subjugation of the eastern provinces, and obtaining satisfaction
                    about the conduct of the Egyptian queen during the recent contest. On his
                    passage through Cilicia in 41 he was visited by Cleopatra, who came to answer
                    the charges in person. She sailed up tho Cydnus in a gorgeous bark, with a
                    fantastic and brilliant equipage, and brought all her allurements to bear on the
                    heart of the voluptuous Roman. Her success was complete; and he who was to have
                    been her judge, was led captive to Alexandria as her slave. All was forgotten in
                    the fascination and delight of the passing hour; and feasting and revelry found
                    perpetual and ever-varying renewal. At length Antony was aroused by the Parthian
                    invasion of Syria, and the report of an outbreak between Fulvia his wife and
                    Lucius his brother on the one hand and Octavius on the other. On arriving in
                    Italy he found that the war was over, and Octavius the victor; and the chief
                    cause of disagreement being soon after removed by the death of Fulvia, a
                    reconciliation was speedily effected between tho triumvirs, and cemented by the
                    marriage of Antony with Octavia, the sister of his colleague. A new division of
                    the Roman world was agreed on at Brundusium, Lepidus receiving Africa, Octavius
                    the west, and Antony the east. Returning to his province, Antony was for a time
                    successful; his general, Ventidius, beating the Parthians, and Socius capturing
                    Jerusalem and conquering Antigonus. But after another visit to Italy, during
                    which the triumvirate was prolonged for five years, Antony sent away his wife,
                    yielded himself completely to the evil influence of Cleopatra, indulged not only
                    in licentiousness, but in tyranny, and allowed his affairs to be neglected or
                    delayed. An expedition against the Parthians was a failure; but for this his
                    success against Artavasdes, the Armenian king, in some measure compensated.
                    Octavius at length determined to get rid of Antony, and had little need of
                    invention to bring charges sufficient against him. About two years were spent in
                    preparations and delays on both sides, and it was not till the year 31 that the
                    fate of Antony was decided by the battle of Actium. Defeated and deserted, he
                    once more sought refuge and repose in the society of Cleopatra, but was followed
                    even there by his relentless rival. At first he made a gallant effort to defend
                    himself, and partially succeeded. But convinced of the hopelessness of his
                    position, and assured of the suicide of his mistress, he followed the example
                    which he was falsely informed she had given (30 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    Antony had been married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fid via, and Octavia,
                    and left behind him a number of children. A short but vivid sketch of Antony is
                    given by De Quincey in his “Essay on the Caesars,” see his <hi rend="italic"
