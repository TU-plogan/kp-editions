                <p><label type="entry">ARCHDEACON</label>. The office of archdeacon is of ancient
                    institution in the Christian church, as archdeacons are mentioned in the 4th
                    century after Christ. The title was originally given to the chief deacon in each
                    diocese, who had the charge of the temporal affairs of the church, and the
                    supervision of all matters which appertained to the order and decency of divine
                    service. In the course of time the archdeacons encroached upon the episcopal
                    jurisdiction, but their encroachments were restrained in England by the Council
                    of London, 1237 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d,</hi> and in other countries by
                    ecclesiastical councils held in the 13th and 14th centuries.</p>
                <p>There was originally one archdeacon in every English diocese, but there are at
                    present by statute 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 97, at least two archdeaconries in each
                    diocese, and in some dioceses there are four archdeacons. The archdeacons are
                    appointed by their respective bishops, and they are by 3 and 4 Vict. c. 27, §
                    27, required to have been six full years in priest’s orders. The functions of
                    the archdeacon are in the present day ancillary in a general way to those of the
                    bishop of the diocese. The archdeacon is sometimes styled “Oculus Episcopi,” and
                    it is his especial duty to inspect the churches within his archdeaconry, and to
                    hold annual visitations of the clergy and churchwardens of each parish, for the
                    purpose of ascertaining that the clergy are in residence, of admitting the
                    newly-elected churchwardens into office, and of receiving the presentments of
                    the outgoing churchwardens. It is his privilege to present all candidates for
                    ordination to the bishop of the diocese. It is his duty also to induct the
                    clergy of his archdeaconry into the temporalities of their benefices after they
                    have been instituted into the spiritualities by the bishop or his vicargeneral.
                    Every archdeacon is entitled to appoint an official to preside over his
                    archidiaconal court, from which there is an appeal to the Consistory Court of
                    the bishop. The archdeacons are <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> members of the
                    Convocations of their respective provinces. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Convocation.</hi></p>
                <p>It is the privilege of the archdeacon of Canterbury to induct the archbishop and
                    all the bishops of the province of Canterbury into their respective bishoprics,
                    and this he does in the case of a bishop under a mandate from the archbishop of
                    Canterbury, directing him to induct the bishop into the real, actual, and
                    corporal possession of the bishopric, and to install and to enthrone him; and in
                    the case of the archbishop, under an analogous mandate from the dean and chapter
                    of Canterbury, as being guardians of the spiritualities during the vacancy of
                    the archi-episcopal see. (τ. τ.)</p>
