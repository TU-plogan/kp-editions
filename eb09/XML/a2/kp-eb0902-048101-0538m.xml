                    river Ahr, and has a castle which was formerly the residence of the dukes of
                    Aremberg. About the year 1298 the earldom of Aremberg, which had previously
                    belonged to a branch of the house of Hostaden, came by his marriage with Matilda
                    to John of Engelbert, earl of Mark (Westphalia), and continued in his family
                    till 1547, when John of Barbançon, of the celebrated house of Ligne, by marrying
                    the only sister of the childless Robert III., obtained possession of the lands,
                    which were raised by Maximilian II. to a principality, and ranked among the
                    German states. John, who is remembered as the leader of troops from the
                    Netherlands to serve against the Huguenots, having fallen (1568) in the battle
                    of Heiligerlee, was succeeded by his son Philip Charles, admiral of Flanders,
                    who greatly increased his possessions by marrying Ann of Croy, heiress of Croy,
                    Arschot, Chimay, &lt;fcc. He died in 1616, and was followed by his eldest son,
                    stadtholder of Namur, who, having informed the Spanish government of a
                    conspiracy, was rewarded by arrest (1634) and imprisonment at Berdessillas,
                    where he died in 1640. Under his son, Philip Francis, Aremberg was raised to a
                    dukedom (1644). Alexander Joseph and Philip Charles Francis both fell in battle
                    against the Turks, the former in 1663, and the latter in 1691. Charles’s widow,
                    Maria Henrietta, left her country and possessions rather than recognise the duke
                    of Anjou as king of Spain, and lived in dignified poverty till the battle of
                    Ramilies gave back the Netherlands to their rightful possessor. She died in
                    1744. Her only son Leopold is known in history as a military leader (at
                    Malplaquet, Belgrade, Ettinghen, &amp;c.), and as the patron of Rousseau and
                    Voltaire. His son and successor, Charles Leopold, was distinguished in the Seven
                    Years’ War as an Austrian field-marshal, and increased his possessions by
                    marriage with Margaret of Mark. By the peace of Luneville (Feb. 1801), the next
                    duke, Engelbert, lost the greater part of his ancestral domain, but received in
                    compensation Meppen and Recklinghausen. On the establishment of the
                    confederation of the Rhine, his son Prosper-Louis (to whom, becoming blind, he
                    had ceded his domains in 1803) became a member (1807), and showed great devotion
                    to the interests of France; but in 1810 he lost his sovereignty, Napoleon
                    incorporating his dukedom with France and the grand duchy of Berg, and
                    indemnifying him by a rent of 240,702 francs. In 1815 he received back his
                    possessions, -which were mediatised by the Congress of Vienna, part falling to
                    Prussia and part to Hanover. On account of the one portion he became a peer of
                    the Westphalian estates, and by the other, a member of the House of Lords in
                    Hanover. George IV. of England, on 9th May 1826, elevated the duke’s Hanoverian
                    possessions to a dukedom under the title of Aremberg Meppen. His territory
                    extended over 780 geographical square miles, with 94,000 inhabitants; of which,
                    544 square miles, with 50,000 inhabitants, were in Hanover; besides which he had
                    large estates in France, and extensive tracts of forest in the Pyrenees. His
                    brother Augustus-Raymond (b. 1753, d. 1833) became famous, under the title of
                    Count of Mark, for his connection with the French Revolution and his friendship
                    with Mirabeau. Duke Prosper-Louis died in 1861, and was succeeded by his son
                    Engelbert.</p>
