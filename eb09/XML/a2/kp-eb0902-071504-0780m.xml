                    (άσφαλτο?, Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Bitumen,</hi> Pliny), the German <hi
                    rend="italic">Bergpech,</hi> or mineral pitch, so called from the Lacus
                    Asphaltites or Dead Sea, where it was found in ancient times, is a product of
                    the decomposition of vegetable and animal substances. It is usually found of a
                    black or brownish-black colour, externally not unlike coal, but it varies in
                    consistency from a bright pitchy condition, with a-sharp conchoidal fracture, to
                    thick viscid masses of mineral tar. Asphalt melts at or a little below the
                    boiling point of water, and it burns with a rather smoky flame. It is regarded
                    as the ultimate result of a series of changes which take place, under certain
                    conditions, in organised matter, producing—1st, naphtha; 2d, petroleum; 3d,
                    mineral tar; and 4th, asphalt or hard bitumen. The whole of these substances
                    merge into each other by insensible degrees, so that it is impossible to say at
                    what point mineral tar ends and asphalt begins. Naphtha, which is the first of
                    the series, is in some localities found flowing out of the earth as a clear,
                    limpid, and colourless liquid. As such it is a mixture of hydrocarbons, some of
                    which are very volatile and evaporate on exposure; it takes up oxygen from the
                    air, becomes brown and thick, and in this condition it is called petroleum. A
                    continuation of the same process of evaporation and oxidation gradually
                    transforms the material into mineral tar, and still later into solid glassy
                    asphalt. Asphalts are very variable in composition, and their proximate
                    constituents have not been subjected to a thorough examination. Traces of
                    naphtha or light oils are usually found in them, and they always contain a
                    percentage of the heavier hydrocarbons not vaporisable below boiling point.
                    Resins soluble in alcohol, and solids, some soluble in ether, and some resisting
                    the solvent action of both ether and alcohol, are found in varying porportions.
                    According to Dana “asphalt may consist of either—(1), unoxygenated, or (2),
                    partly unoxygenated and partly oxygenated (the usual fact), or (3), solely of
                    oxygenated hydrocarbons (very rarely, if ever, true in nature). The state of
                    solidity is not proof that any part of the bitumen is oxygenated.” Asphaltic
                    deposits exist widely diffused throughout the world, more especially in tropical
                    and subtropical regions. It is found in a state of great purity in the
                    interstices of the older rocks, but its occurrence is not characteristic of any
                    particular formation or period. The most remarkable deposit of asphalt exists in
                    Trinidad, where it forms a Jake 99 acres in extent, and of unknown depth,
                    intersected with rivulets of water. At tw o or three places on the surface of
                    the lake an emission of semi-fluid tar may still be seen in progress,
                    accompanied with an evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen. At these points the
                    substance is still soft and viscid, but by exposure it gradually obtains the
                    consistency of the rest of the mass. In addition to the lake deposit, asphalt
                    occurs in the surrounding country—named La Brea, on account of this
                    peculiarity—in detached patches, or in sheets of considerable size, at one point
                    protruding into the sea, and pieces of asphalt are frequently cast up on the
                    neighbouring shore. A considerable quantity of a fine asphalt is also derived
                    from Cuba under the name “Chapapote,” or Mexican asphalt; and from Caxatambo in
                    Peru, a very pure variety of high lustre is exported. The asphalt of the Dead
                    Sea is more a tradition than a reality, it being now found there in very small
                    quantities; but the source of the supply of ancient Babylon, the fountains of
                    Is, on a tributary of the Euphrates, still yields asphalt. It occurs in many
                    localities throughout Europe, but not to any considerable extent. The following
                    table gives the ultimate composition of specimens from several localities :—</p>

                <p>Of greater importance industrially than simple asphalt is asphalt stone,—a
                    limestone impregnated with bituminous matter, which occurs in large quantities
                    at several European localities. The most valuable deposits are in the Vai de
                    Travers, canton of Neufchatel; in the neighbourhood of Seyssel, department of
                    Ain; at Bechelbronn in Alsace, Limmer near the city of Hanover, and Hölle in
                    Dit-marachen<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0781-0716"/>; in Holstein, àc. These bituminous stones contain
                    from 7 or 8 to about 20 per cent, of asphalt in their composition, that from Vai
                    de Travers being richest in bituminous matter and of most value in its
                    industrial applications. The asphalt beds of the Vai de Travers were first
                    discovered and utilised by Eirinus, a Greek physician, in 1712, who recommended
                    the material as being “peculiarly suitable for covering all kinds of
                    constructions; to protect wood and stone work against decay, worms, and the
                    ravages of time, rendering them almost indestructible even when exposed to wind,
                    wet, and extreme variations of temperature.” Eirinus was aware that asphaltic
                    mortar had been used in the building of ancient Babylon, and he himself
                    succeeded in using it with great effect for the lining of cisterns and walls as
                    a cementing material, and for the flooring of warehouses, Ac. After some time
                    the material fell into disuse; the quarries of Vai de Travers were even
                    forgotten, and it was not till the year 1832 that the material was again
                    prominently and successfully reintroduced, the credit on this occasion being due
                    to the Count Sassenay. Under his direction asphaltic stone came to be
                    extensively used in France for pavements and roadways, and for protecting floors
                    and walls from the effects of damp. From France the application of the material
                    for such purposes extended to other countries, and there is now a wide-spread
                    demand for asphaltic pavements. Two principal methods are adopted in laying
                    asphalt pavements,—1st, the mastic process; 2d, the hot compressed process. The
                    mastic process is ess*entially as follows :—The bed of the road-way is prepared
                    with a smooth level foundation of concrete, which must be thoroughly dry before
                    the application of the asphalt. The mastic is prepared for application by
                    heating the asphaltic stone and breaking it into small pieces, which are then
                    melted up with a quantity of mineral tar, to which some sand is added. The
                    molten mass is then poured over a section of the prepared concrete uniformly to
                    the requisite depth; the surface is smoothed, and covered with a coating of fine
                    sand which is stamped into the asphalt. The proportions of tar and sand used
                    vary with the composition of the asphaltic stone employed and the position
                    occupied by the pavement The other mode of laying pavements, now extensively
                    adopted, consists in spreading hot powdered asphaltic stone on the prepared
                    surface, which is then heavily pressed till it forms a homogeneous elastic
                    coating. Roadways so prepared are very durable, smooth, cleanly, and noiseless,
                    but the material is not well adapted for other than level streets on account of
                    the difficulty of foothold. Complaints are also made against such pavement, to
                    the effect that accidents to horses from slipping and falling are much more
                    frequent than is the case on ordinary stone pavement. An artificial asphalt is
                    prepared by boiling up the pitch of gas-tar with chalk and sand, but such a
                    substitute, though much cheaper, has not the durability of the natural compound.
                    Gas-tar asphalt is also applied for other purposes in which the natural product
                    is used. Asphalt was used by the ancient Egyptians in their process of embalming
                    bodies. It is the principal ingredient in black Japan varnish. It is distilled
                    in large quantities for the illuminating and lubricating oil which it yields,
                    but the bituminous shales from which paraffin and paraffin oils are distilled
                    must not be confounded with asphaltic deposits. It is also used for preparing
                    roofing felts; paper water-proofed with asphalt haβ been used, and drain-pipes
                    of compressed asphalted paper are manufactured.</p>
