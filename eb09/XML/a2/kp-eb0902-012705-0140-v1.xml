                <p><label type="entry">ANTIGONE</label>, the daughter of (Edipus, known in Greek
                    legend, first, for the faithfulness with which she attended her father when he,
                    on discovering that Jocaste, the mother of his children, was also his own
                    mother, put his eyes out and resigned the throne of Thebes; secondly, for
                    having, in defiance of a decree, buried with due rites the body of her brother
                    Polynices, for which act she was sentenced to be buried alive in a vault. Her
                    character and these incidents of her life presented an attractive subject to the
                    Greek tragic poets, especially Sophocles, whose plays of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Antigone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oe</hi><hi rend="italic">dipus
                        at</hi><hi rend="italic">Colonus</hi> still exist; and Euripides, whose <hi
                        rend="italic">Antigone,</hi> though now lost, is partly known from extracts
                    incidentally preserved in later writers, and from passages in his play of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Phoenissoe.</hi> In the order of the events, at least,
                    Sophocles departed from the original legend, according to which the cremation of
                    Polynices took place while Oedipus was yet in Thebes, not after he had died at
                    Colonus. Possibly his having left Thebes at all is an invention of the poet
                    Again, in assigning Antigone the tragic end of being buried alive, Sophocles
                    differs from Euripides, in whose play that calamity was averted by the
                    intercession of Bacchus, and was followed by the marriage of Antigone and
                    Haemon, the son of her persecutor Creon, who had succeeded to the throne. In
                    another version of the legend (Hyginus, <hi rend="italic">Fab.</hi> 72), founded
                    apparently (Heydemann, <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">eine
                        nach</hi><hi rend="italic">Euripideische Antigone,</hi> Berlin, 1868) on a
                    tragedy by some follower of Euripides, Antigone, on being handed over by Creon
                    to her lover Haemon to be slain, was instead secretly carried off by him, and
                    concealed among herdsmen, where she bore him a son Maeon. The boy having grown
                    up, went to the games at Thebes, and being there recognised by the mark of a
                    dragon on his body, the secret was discovered. Hercules pleaded with Creon in
                    vain for Haemon, who now slew both Antigone and himself. On a painted vase
                    (engraved by Heydemann, <hi rend="italic">supra}</hi> appears the scene of the
                    intercession of Hercules. Antigone placing the body of Polynices on the funeral
                    pile occurs on a sarcophagus in the villa Pamfili in Rome, and in the
                    description of an ancient painting by Philostratus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(ffmag.</hi> ii. 29), in which it is stated that the flames consuming the
                    two brothers burnt apart, as indicative of their hostility in life.</p>
