                    of the return of Spring, at which period took place, it was believed, Ariadne’s

                    the great feature in her worship, which appears to have originated in Crete, and
                    to have been mostly confined to that island and to Naxus, where annually it was
                    celebrated by the people with dances and a festival called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theodaisia.</hi> But though married to Dionysos, and sometimes called his wife
                    (άκοιτι?, Hesiod, <hi rend="italic">Theogony,</hi> 948), she did not generally
                    appear in this character. On the contrary, in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>
                    (xi. 321-325), it is said that Artemis slew her, with the consent of Dionysos,
                    at Dia (near Cnossus), before she could reach Athens with Theseus. Her death
                    would thus seem a punishment for her infidelity. But in the current legend her
                    connection with Dionysos did not begin till he found her asleep in Naxus after
                    her despair at being abandoned by Theseus, with whom she had escaped from Crete
                    after assisting him against her father, the fierce Minos, to slay the Minotaur.
                    She had given Theseus a clue by means of which, while she retained the other
                    end, he could find his way through the labyrinth, in which he had to fight that
                    monster with human body and bull’s head. In the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>
                    (xviii. 591) she is spoken of as the fair-haired Ariadne, for whom Daedalus had
                    skilfully made a dancing-place (χορό?) in Cnossus, and it is probable that the
                    reference here is to the dances with which her marriage was celebrated in Crete.
                    Possibly also the description of her as a daughter of Minos, which is as early
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xi. 321), was not founded in the belief
                    of the Cretans, to whom she was a goddess, but arose elsewhere from observation
                    of her peculiarly local character. Another form of her name in Crete, Αpιδτ)λα (
                    = φανερά), refers to her as a being connected with the return of a bright season
                    in nature. In works of art her marriage with Dionysos, and her abandonment by
                    Theseus in Naxus, are known to have been frequently the subject of
                    representation. Examples of both still exist on the vases and in mural
                    paintings. The scene where she holds the clue to Theseus occurs on a very early
                    vase in the British Museum.</p>
