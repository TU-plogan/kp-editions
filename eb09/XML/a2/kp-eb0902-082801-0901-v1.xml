                <p><label type="entry">ATHANASIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, Bishop of
                    Alexandria, and one of the most illustrious defenders of the Christian faith,
                    was born at Alexandria about the year 297. Of his family, circumstances, or
                    early education nothing can be said to be known, although a legendary story has
                    been preserved by Rufinus of Aquileia as to the manner in which he came, while
                    yet a boy, under the notice of his predecessor, Alexander. It seems certain that
                    Alexander became his patron, took him as a youth into his house, and employed
                    him as his secretary. This was probably about 313, and from this time Athanasiue
                    may be said to have been devoted to the Christian ministry. He was, no doubt, a
                    student in the “Didascaleion,” or famous “catechetical school” of Alexandria,
                    which included amongst its already illustrious teachers the names of Clement and
                    Origen. In the museum, the ancient seat of the Alexandrian university, he may
                    have learned grammar, logic, and rhetoric. His mind was certainly well
                    disciplined, and accustomed to discuss from an early period the chief questions
                    both in philosophy and religion. The persecution under which the Alexandrian
                    Church suffered at this time, and his intimacy with the great hermit Antony, of
                    which he himself has told us, had all their effect upon his character, and
                    served to nurture in him that undaunted fortitude and high spirit of faith by
                    which he became distinguished.</p>
                <p>Before the outbreak of the Arian controversy, which began in 319, Athanasius had
                    made himself known as the author of two essays addressed to a convert from
                    heathenism, one of them entitled <hi rend="italic">Against the Gentiles,</hi>
                    and the other <hi rend="italic">On the Incarnation of the Word.</hi> Both are of
                    the nature of apologctical treatises, arguing such questions as monotheism, and
                    the necessity of divine interposition for the salvation of the world; and
                    already in the second may be traced that tone of thought respecting the
                    essential divinity of Christ as the “God-man’’for which he afterwards became
                    conspicuous. The origin of the Arian controversy has been already described
                    under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Arius.</hi> There is no distinct evidence
                    of the connection of Athanasius with the first contentions of Arius and his
                    bishop, which ended in the exile of the former, and his entrance into Palestine
                    under the protection of Eusebius the historian, who was bishop of Caesarea, and
                    subsequently of his namesake the bishop of Nicomedia. It can hardly be doubted,
                    however, that Athanasius would be a cordial assistant of his friend and patron
                    Alexander, and that the latter was strengthened in his theological position by
                    the young enthusiastic student who had already expounded the nature of the
                    divine Incarnation, and who seems about this time to have become archdeacon of
                    Alexandria. At the Council of Nicaea, in the year 325, he appears prominently in
                    connection with the dispute. He attended the council, not as one of its members
                    (who were properly only bishops or delegates of bishops), but merely as the
                    attendant of Alexander. In this capacity, however, he was apparently allowed to
                    take part in its discussions, for Theodoret (i. 26) states that “he contended
                    earnestly for the apostolic doctrines, and was applauded by their champions,
                    while he earned the hostility of their opponents. Within ‘ five months’ after
                    the return of Alexander to the scene of his episcopal labours he expired, and
                    his friend and archdeacon was chosen to succeed him. He was elected ‘in the
                    sight and amidst the acclamations of the people.’ He was now about 30 years of
                    age, and is spoken of as remarkable both for his physical and mental
                    characteristics. He was small in stature, but his face was radiant with
                    intelligence, as ‘ the face of an angel.’ This is the expression of Gregory of
                    Nazianzus <hi rend="italic">(Orat.,</hi> xxii. 9), who has written an elaborate
                    panegyric upon his friend, describing him as fit ‘ to keep on a level with
                    common-place views, yet also to soar high above the more aspiring,’ as
                    accessible to all, slow to anger, quick in sympathy, pleasant in conversation,
                    and still more pleasant in temper, effective alike in discourse and in action,
                    assiduous in devotions, helpful to Christians of every class and age, a
                    theologian with the speculative, a comforter of the afflicted, a staff to the
                    aged, a guide of the young.”</p>
                <p>The first few years of the episcopate of Athanasius were tranquil; but the storms
                    in which the remainder of his life was passed soon began to gather around him.
                    The Council of Nicaea had settled the creed of Christendom, but had by no means
                    composed the divisions in the church which the Arian controversy had provoked.
                    Arius himself still lived, and his friend Eusebius of Nicomedia rapidly regained
                    influence over the Emperor Constantine. The result of this was a demand made by
                    the emperor that Arius should be re-admitted to communion. Athanasius stood
                    firm, and refused to have any communion with the advocates of a “heresy that was
                    fighting against Christ.” Constantine was baffled for the moment; but many
                    accusers soon rose up against one who was known to be under the frown of
                    imperial displeasure. The archbishop of Alexandria was charged with cruelty,
                    even with sorcery and murder. It was reported that a Meletian bishop in the
                    Thebaid, of the name of Arsenius, had been unlawfully put to death by him. He
                    was easily able to clear himself of such charges, but the hatred of his enemies
                    was not relaxed, and in the summer of 335 he was peremptorily ordered to appear
                    at Tyre, where a council had been summoned to sit in judgment upon his conduct.
                    He did not venture to disobey the imperial order, and a commission was appointed
                    to inquire into an alleged instance of cruelty urged against him,
                    notwithstanding the explanations which he had made. There appeared plainly a
                    predetermination to condemn him, and he fled from Tyre to Constantinople to
                    appeal to the emperor himself. “He resolved,” says Gibbon, “to make a bold and
                    dangerous experiment, whether the throne was inaccessible to the voice of
                    truth.” He presented himself suddenly with five of his suffragans before the
                    emperor, while riding into his new capital. Refused at first a hearing, his
                    perseverance was at length rewarded by the emperor’s consent to his reasonable
                    request—that his accusers should be brought face to face with him in the
                    imperial presence. The leaders of the Tyrian council, amongst the most
                    conspicuous of whom were the two Eusebii, were accordingly summoned to
                    Constantinople, just after they had celebrated, at a great dedication festival
                    at Jerusalem, the condemnation of Athanasius and the restoration of Arius to
                    church communion. In confronting the former before Constantine they did not
                    attempt to repeat the charge of cruelty, but found a more ready and effective
                    weapon to their hands in a new charge of a political kind—that Athanasius had
                    threatened to stop the Alexandrian corn-ships bound for Constantinople. Here, as
                    in other matters, it is very difficult to understand how far there was any truth
                    in the persistent accusations made against the prince-bishop of Alexandria.
                    Probably there was in the very greatness of his character and the extent of his
                    popular influence a certain species of dominance which lent a colour of truth to
                    some of the things said against him. On the present occasion his accusers
                    succeeded in at once arousing the imperial jealousy; and the consequence was,
                    that, notwithstanding his earnest denial of the act attributed to him, he was
                    banished to Trier, or Treves, the capital of Gaul.</p>
                <p>This was the first banishment of Athanasius, which lasted about two years and a
                    half. It was only brought to a close by the death of Constantine, and the
                    accession of Constantine II. as emperor of the West. It is recorded by himself
                        <hi rend="italic">(Anol.</hi> 7) that, on his return to Alexandria, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n902/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0902-0829"/> “the people ran in crowds to see his face;
                    the churches were full of rejoicing; thanksgivings were offered up everywhere;
                    the ministers and clergy thought the day the happiest in their lives.” But this
                    period of happiness was destined to be short-lived. His position as patriarch of
                    Alexandria placed him, not under his friend Constantine II., but under
                    Constantius, another son of the elder Constantine, who had succeeded to the
                    throne of the East. He in his turn fell, as his father had done, more and more
                    under the influence of theNicomedian Eusebius, now transferred to the see of
                    Constantinople. A second expulsion of Athanasius was accordingly resolved upon.
                    The old charges against him were revived, with the addition of his having set at
                    naught the decision of a council. It was further resolved on this occasion to
                    put another bishop in his place. Accordingly, in the beginning of the year 340,
                    a Cappadocian named Gregory, said to be an Arian, was installed by military
                    force on the throne of the great defender of the faith, who, to save his
                    followers from outrage, withdrew to a place of concealment. As soon as it was
                    possible he repaired to Rome, to “lay his case before the church.” He was
                    declared innocent at a council held there in 342, and in another held at Sardica
                    some years later. Julius, the bishop of Rome, warmly espoused his cause, and,
                    generally, it may be said that the Western Church was Athanasian in its
                    sympathies and its creed, while the majority of the Eastern bishops sided with
                    the Eusebian party. This severance was clearly shown at the Council of Sardica,
                    where the Orientals refused to meet with the representation of the Western
                    Church, because the latter insisted on recognising the right of Athanasius and
                    his friends to attend the council as regular bishops. The commonly received date
                    of this council is 347, but the rediscovered <hi rend="italic">Festal
                        Letters</hi> of Athanasius have had the effect of throwing back this date
                    for some years. It has been placed by some as early as the end of 343, by Mansi
                    and others in the end of 344. The decision of the Council of Sardica, however,
                    had no immediate effect in favour of Athanasius. Constantius continued for some
                    time implacable, and the bold action of the Western bishops only incited the
                    Arian party in Alexandria to fresh severities. Gradually, however, the excesses
                    of the Arian party brought their own revenge, while the death of the intruded
                    bishop Gregory, in the beginning of 345, opened up the way for a reconciliation
                    betwixt the Eastern emperor and the banished prelate. The result was the
                    restoration of Athanasius for the second time, amidst the enthusiastic
                    demonstrations of the Alexandrian populace, which is represented by his
                    panegyrist, Gregory Nazianzen, as streaming forth “like another Nile” to meet
                    him in the distance as he approached the city. His restoration is supposed to
                    have taken place, according to the more accurate chronology based upon the <hi
                        rend="italic">Festal Letters,</hi> in October 346.</p>
                <p>For ten years at this time Athanasius held his ground in Alexandria. But the
                    intrigues of the Arian or court party were soon renewed against him, and the
                    feeble emperor, who had protested that he would never again listen to their
                    accusations, was gradually stimulated to new hostilities. A large council was
                    held at Milan in the spring of the year 355, and here, notwithstanding the
                    vigorous opposition of a few faithful men amongst the Western bishops, a renewed
                    condemnation of Athanasius was procured. This was followed up by the banishment
                    of the faithful prelates, even of Hosius of Cordova, whose conciliatory
                    character and intimate connection with the imperial family had not prevented him
                    from addressing to Constantius a pathetic remonstrance against the tyranny of
                    the Arian party. When his friends were thus scattered in exile, their great
                    leader could not long escape; and on the night of the Sth of February 356, while
                    he was engaged in service in the church of St Thomas, a band of armed men burst
                    into the sacred building. He has himself described the scene <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Apol. de fuga,</hi> 24). Here for a time he maintained his composure, and
                    desired the deacon to read the psalm, and the people to respond—“<hi
                        rend="italic">For His mercy endureth for ever;”</hi> and how, as the
                    soldiers rushed forward with fierce shouts towards the altar, he at length made
                    his escape in the crowd, and sought once more a place of safe retirement. The
                    solitudes of Upper Egypt, where numerous monasteries and hermitages had been
                    planted, appear to have been his chief shelter at this time. Here, protected
                    from pursuit, he spent his time in literary labours in behalf of his cause; and
                    to this period, accordingly, belong some of hri most important writings, above
                    all the great <hi rend="italic">Orations, or Discourses against the Arians,</hi>
                    which furnish the best exposition of his theological position and
                    principles.</p>
                <p>For six years at this time Athanasius continued in exile, till the death of
                    Constantius in November 361 opened once more the way for his return to his
                    episcopate. Julian, the successor to the imperial throne, professed indifference
                    to the contentions of the church, and granted permission to the bishops exiled
                    in the late reign to return home. Amongst others, Athanasius took advantage of
                    this permission, and seated himself once more upon his throne, amidst the
                    jubilations of the people. He had begun his episcopal labours with renewed
                    ardour, and summoned a council to Alexandria to decide various important
                    questions, when an imperial mandate yet again drove him from his place of power.
                    The faithful gathered around him weeping. “Be of good heart,” he said, “it is
                    but a cloud: it will soon pass.” His forecast proved true; for within a few
                    months Julian had closed his brief career of Pagan revival, and Athanasius
                    “returned by night to Alexandria.” He received a letter from the new emperor,
                    Jovian, praising his Christian fidelity, and encouraging him to resume his work.
                    With the emperor he continued to maintain friendly relations, and even drew out
                    for him a synodal letter embodying the Nicene Creed, which was graciously
                    received. During the brief reign of this bluff soldier-prince, comparative quiet
                    prevailed in the church. But the repose was of short duration. In the spring of
                    365, after the accession of Valens, troubles reappeared. An order was issued for
                    the expulsion of all bishops who had been expelled by Constantius, and
                    Athanasius was once more forced to take refuge in concealment from his
                    persecutors. His concealment, however, only lasted for four months, when an
                    order came for his return; and from this time (Feb. 366) he was left undisturbed
                    to pursue his episcopal labours. Those labours were unceasing in refuting
                    heretics, in building churches, in rebuking rapacious governors, in comforting
                    faithful bishops, and in strengthening the orthodox everywhere, till at length,
                    in the spring of 373, “in a good old age,” he ceased from all his work. Having
                    consecrated one of his presbyters his successor, he died quietly in his own
                    house. His “many struggles,” according to his panegyrists, won him “many a
                    crown.” He was gathered to his fathers, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and
                    martyrs, who had contended for the truth. Even those who fail to sympathise with
                    the cause which Athanasius stedfastly maintained, cannot refuse their tribute of
                    admiration to his magnanimous and heroic character. The cynic eloquence of
                    Gibbon grows warm in recounting his adventurous career, and the language of
                    Hooker breaks into stately fervour in celebrating his faith and fortitude. “The
                    whole world against Athanasius, and Athanasius against it; half a hundred of
                    years spent in doubtful trial which of the two in the end should prevail —the
                    side which had all, or else the part which had no <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n903/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0903-0830"/> friends but God and death—the one a defender
                    of his innocency, the other a finisher of all his troubles.” If imperious in
                    temper and inflexible in dogmatic determination, Athanasius had yet a great
                    heart and intellect, enthusiastic in their devotion to Christ, and in work for
                    the good of the church and of mankind.</p>
                <p>His chief distinction as a theologian was his zealous advocacy of the essential
                    divinity of Christ as co-equal in substance with the Father. This was the
                    doctrine of the Homoousion, proclaimed by the Nicene Creed, and elaborately
                    defended by his life and writings. Whether or not Athanasius first suggested the
                    use of this expression, he was its greatest defender; and the catholic doctrine
                    of the Trinity has ever since been more identified with his “immortal” name than
                    with any other in the history of the church and of Christian theology. (For an
