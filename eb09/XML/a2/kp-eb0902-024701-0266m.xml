                <p>population,—are rarely bloody; the object being most often with the one party to
                    carry off, and with the other to protect, a flock of sheep or a herd of camels':
                    booty is aimed at, not slaughter. If positive hatred or a desire to kill exist,
                    such feelings are usually limited to two or three individuals at most, one of
                    whom has perhaps been ridiculed in satirical verse, to which they are very
                    sensitive, or had a distant relation killed in some previous fray. Bloodshed,
                    too, is expensive, as it must be made up for either by more bloodshed or by
                    paying the price,—the “deeah,” as it is called, and which varies, according to
                    the importance of the person killed, from ten to fifty camels, or even more.
                    Previous to Mahomet’s time it was left optional to the injured tribe either to
                    accept this kind of compensation or to insist on blood for blood; but the
                    Prophet, though by his own account despairing of ever reducing the nomade
                    portion of his countrymen to any fixed observances, succeeded on this point in
                    establishing among them the rule, that a fair “deeah,” if offered, must of
                    necessity be accepted: a merciful regulation, tending to cut short otherwise
                    interminable feuds.</p>
                <p>Instances are, however, not wanting in Arab history of fiercer and more general
                    Bedouin conflicts, in which the destruction, or at least the complete
                    subjugation, of one tribe has been aimed at by another, and when great slaughter
                    has accordingly taken place. Such were the wars of Pekr and Thagleb in the 6th
                    century, of Kelb and Howazin in the 8th, of Harb and Oteybah in the 18th, with
                    others. But these are comparatively rare events.</p>
                <p>Brigand-The Bedouins regard the plundering of caravans or <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> 8 <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> ∙ travellers, whether on business or
                    otherwise, simply as a supplementary measure that takes the place of passports
                    or custom dues exacted elsewhere. The land is theirs, they say, and trespassers
                    on it without leave must pay the forfeit. Hence whoever can show anything
                    equivalent to a permission of entrance into their territory, has, in the regular
                    course of things, nothing to fear. This permission is obtained by securing the
                    protection of the nearest Bedouin sheykh, who, for a politely-worded request and
                    a small sum of money, will readily grant the pass, in the shape of one or two or
                    more men of his tribe, who accompany the wayfarers as far as the next encampment
                    on their road, where they hand their charge over to fresh guides, equally bound
                    to afford the desired safeguard. In the interior of the peninsula the passport
                    is given in writing by one of the local town governors, and is respected by the
                    Bedouins of the district; for, however impudent and unamenable to law these
                    nomades may be on the frontiers of the impotent Ottoman government in Syria or
                    the Hejaz, they are quiet and submissive enough in other and Arab-governed
                    regions of the peninsula. But the rash traveller who ventures on the desert
                    strip without the precautions above mentioned is likely enough to atone for his
                    negligence by the loss of his luggage; and should he resist, perhaps his life
                    also.</p>
                <p>(Tribes Utterly ignorant of writing and unacquainted with books, the Bedouins
                    trust to their memory for everything; where memory fails, they readily eke it
                    out with imagination. Hence their own assertions regarding the antiquity,
                    numbers, strength, &amp;c., of their clans are of little real worth; even their
                    genealogies, in which they pretend to be eminently versed, are not to be much
                    depended on; the more so that their own family names hardly ever exceed the
                    limits of a patronymic, whilst the constantly renewed subdivisions of a tribe,
                    and the temporary increase of one branch and decrease of another, tend to efface
                    the original name of the clan. Few tribes, accordingly, now preserve their
                    ancient, or at least their historical titles; and the mass of the Bedouin
                    multitude resembles in this respect a troubled sea, of which the substance is
                    indeed always the same, but the surface is continually shifting and changing.
                    As, however, no social basis or ties are acknowledged among them except those of
                    blood and race, certain broad divisions are tolerably accurately kept up, the
                    wider and more important of which may here be noted.</p>
                <p>First, the Anezah clan, whose pasture-grounds extend Anezah. from Syria southward
                    to the limits of Jebel Shomer. It is numerous, and, for a Bedouin tribe, well
                    armed. Two-thirds of the Arab horse trade, besides a large traffic in sheep,
                    camels, wool, and similar articles, are in the hands of these Anezah Bedouins.
                    Their principal subdivisions are the Sebaâ. on the north, the Woold-Alee on the
                    west, and the Ruâla on the south; these are generally on bad terms with each
                    other. If united, they could muster, it is supposed, about 30,000 lances. They
                    claim descent from Rabeéah. Second, the Shomer Bedouins, whose pasturages
                    Shomer. lie conterminous to those of the Anezah on the east. Their numbers are
                    about the same. Thirdly, in the northern desert, the Howeytat and Sherarat,
                    comparatively small Howeytat. and savage tribes. Also the Soleebee clan, which,
                    however, is disowned by the Arabs, and seems to be of gipsy origin. Next follow,
                    in the western desert, the Benoo-Harb, a Harb, powerful tribe, supposed to
                    muster about 20,000 lances. Their origin is from Keys-Eylan. They are often
                    troublesome to the Meccan pilgrims. In the eastern desert are the Moteyr, the
                    Benoo-Khalid, and the Ajmans, all numerous Moteyr. clans, often at war with each
                    other. To the south, in Nejd itself or on its frontiers, are the Hodeyl,
                    Oteybah, and others, others. These all belong to the “Mustareb,” or northern
                    Arabs.</p>
                <p>The Bedouins of southern or “pure Arab” origin are Southern comparatively few in
                    number, and are, it seems, with few Bedouins, exceptions, even poorer and more
                    savage than their northern brethren. Al-Morrah, on the confines of Oman, Al-Yam
                    and Kahtan, near Yemen, and Benoo-Yas, between Hareek and the Persian Gulf, are
                    the best known. The total number of the Bedouin or pastoral population
                    throughout Arabia appears, including men, women, and children, not to exceed a
                    million and a half—it may even fall short of it.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the clan, the only authority it submits to Organisais that of its
                    “elder,” or “sheykh,” a title which, however, tion. does not necessarily imply
                    advanced age, but is given to any one who, on account of birth, courage, wealth,
                    liberality, skill, prudence, or some other fortunate quality or accident, has
                    been chosen to the leadership. Descent has something to do with rank, but not
                    much, as every individual of the tribe considers himself equal to the others;
                    nor are the distinctions of relative riches and poverty greatly taken into
                    account. This is natural in a state of things where property itself, consisting
                    almost wholly of live stock, is of an essentially uncertain and fluctuating
                    character, and the Bedouins have no other. To the “sheykh” all disputes are
                    referred; he is consulted, though not necessarily obeyed, on every question
                    which regards the general affairs of the tribe, whether in peace or war; there
                    is no other magistrate, and no law except what he and the other chief men of the
                    clan may consider proper. But in fact, for most personal and private affairs,
                    every man does pretty much what is right in his own eyes.</p>
                <p>Nominally Mahometan, most of the Bedouins pay slight Religkn. attention to the
                    ceremonial precepts of the Koran; the five daily prayers and the annual fast of
                    Ramadhan are not much in favour among them; and however near a tribe may be to
                    Mecca, few of them visit it as pilgrims. Wahhabee influence exercised, sword in
                    hand, has, however, of late enforced some degree of Islamitic observance among
                    the Bedouins of Nejd and the adjoining districts: elsewhere nomade Mahometanism
                    is pretty nearly confined to the profession of the Divine Unity; among the
                    remoter and wilder tribes sun-worship, tree-worship, and no worship at <pb

                <p>all, are not uncommon. Some clans even omit the rite of circumcision altogether;
                    others, like the tribe of Hodeyl, south of Mecca, perform it after a fashion
                    peculiar to them-y <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> τalx selves. Nor are the social
                    and moral injunctions of Islam <hi rend="superscript"> 3 X</hi> better observed.
                    Marriages are contracted without any legal intervention or guarantee; the
                    consent of the parties, and the oral testimony of a couple of witnesses, should
                    such be at hand, are all that are required; and divorce is equally facile. Nor
                    is mutual constancy much expected or observed either by men or women; and the
                    husband is rarely strict in exacting from the wife a fidelity that he himself
                    has no idea of observing. Jealousy may indeed occasionally bring about tragic
                    results, but this rarely occurs except where publicity, to which the Bedouins,
                    like ah other Arabs, are very sensitive, is involved. A maiden’s honour is, on
                    the other hand, severely guarded; and even too openly avow ed a courtship,
                    though with the most honourable intentions, is ill looked on. But marriage, if
                    indeed so slight and temporary a connection as it is among Bedouins deserves the
                    name, is often merely a passport for mutual licence. In other respects, Bedouin
                    morality, like that of most half-savage races, depends on custom and public
                    feeling rather than on any fixed code or trained conscience, and hence admits of
                    the strangest contradictions. Not only are lying and exaggeration no reproach in
                    ordinary discourse, but even deliberate perjury and violation of the most solemn
                    engagements are frequent occurrences. Not less frequent, however, are instances
                    of prolonged fidelity and observance of promise carried to the limits of
                    romance. “The wind,” “the wood,” and “the honour of the Arabs,” are the most
                    ordinary oaths in serious matters; but even these do not give absolute security,
                    while a simple verbal engagement will at other times prove an inviolable
                    guarantee. Thus, too, the extreme abstemiousness of a Bedouin alternates with
                    excessive gorgings; and, while the name and deeds of “robber” are hardly a
                    reproach, those of “thief” are marked by abhorrence and contempt. Patience, or
                    rather endurance, both physical and moral, few Bedouins are deficient in;
                    wariness is another quality universally developed by their mode of life. And in
                    spite of an excessive coarseness of language, and often of action, gross vice,
                    at least of the more debasing sorts that dishonour the East, is rare among them.
                    Of their hospitality, as also of many other points common between them and the
                    town Arabs, we shall speak further on.</p>
                <p>Personal In person most Bedouins, men or women, are rather appearance.
                    undersized, the result probably of hardships endured through uncounted
                    generations; their complexion, especially in the south, is dark; their hair
                    coarse, copious, and black; their eyes dark and oval; the nose is commonly
                    aquiline, and the features well formed; beard and moustache are apt to be
                    somewhat scanty. The men are active, but not strong; the women, rarely otherwise
                    than plain.</p>
                <p>Dress. Their dress is simple enough; that of the men consist ing in a long cotton
                    shirt, open at the breast, and often girt with a leathern girdle; a black or
                    striped cloak of hair is sometimes thrown over the shoulders; a handkerchief,
                    folded but once, and generally black, more seldom striped yellow and red, covers
                    the head, round which it is kept in its place by a piece of twine or a twisted
                    hairband. To this costume a pair of open sandals is sometimes added. No other
                    article of dress is worn,—neither trousers nor turban; but under the shirt,
                    round the naked waist, a thin strip of leather plait is wound several times, not
                    for any special object, but merely out of custom. In his hand a Bedouin almost
                    always carries a slight crooked wand, commonly of almond-wood; with this he
                    guides his camel when on the road, and amuses himself by playing with it at
                    other times. Among the Bedouins of the south a light</p>
                <p>BIA <hi rend="smallcaps">[arab rack—·</hi> wrapper takes the place of the
                    handkerchief on the head, and a loin-cloth that of the shirt.</p>
                <p>A woman’s attire is hardly more complicated; wide loose Women’s drawers, though
                    these are sometimes dispensed with; next dress, a long shirt, and over it a wide
                    piece of dark blue cloth enveloping the whole figure, the head included, and
                    trailing on the ground behind. Very rarely does a Bedouin woman wear a veil, or
                    even cover her face with her overcloak, contenting herself with narrowing the
                    folds of the latter over her head on the approach of a stranger. Her wrists and
                    ankles are generally adorned with bracelets and rings of blue glass or copper or
                    iron, very rarely of silver; her neck with glass beads; earrings are rare, and
                    noserings rarer. A few comparatively rich women indulge in more elegant
                    ornaments and fuller dress. Boys, till near puberty, usually go stark naked;
                    girls up to six or seven.</p>
                <p>On a journey a Bedouin invariably bears with him a Weapons, light sharp-pointed
                    lance, the stem of which is made of Persian or African cane; the manner in which
                    this is carried or trailed often indicates the tribe of the owner. The lance is
                    the favourite and characteristic weapon of the Arab nomade, and the one in the
                    use of which he showβ the greatest skill, throwing it, at need, to a
                    considerable distance with unerring aim. Frequently, too, he girds on, or rather
                    suspends from a kind of shoulder-belt, a sword, straight or crooked a3 may be;
                    the blade is often of little value, rusty, and not over sharp; the scabbard of
                    wood. The weapon which comes third in frequency is a gun; this is still in
                    almost every instance a matchlock, clumsy and foul, taking from five to ten
                    minutes to load and fire, when, indeed, it can be fired at all, which is not
                    always the case. Yet with such wretched implements at his disposal, a Bedouin is
                    seldom other than a good marksman. Flint-guns may here and there be met with
                    nowadays; but percussion or breech-loaders never. Nor are pistols any part of a
                    Bedouin’s war equipment. But whether in peace or war, he is seldom without a
                    knife: this in the north is only a large clumsy clasp or sheath knife; but in
                    Yemen, Oman, and the intervening regions it develops into a broad and crooked
                    dagger, a truly formidable weapon, on the ornamentation of which the Bedouin of
                    the south bestows what skill or wealth he may happen to possess.</p>
                <p>For defensive armour a Bedouin on a foray, or preparing Armour, for a serious
                    engagement, sometimes puts on a coat of mail, the manufacture of Yemen or
                    Baghdad; its links are thin, but closely plaited, and often are two or even
                    three deep. To this he adds a helmet, a mere iron head-piece, without visor or
                    crest. Pennons and banners are rarely used by the nomades, whose chief tactics
                    consist in surprise, as their main object is plunder, both of which require, not
                    display, but secrecy. For though the Bedouins are undoubtedly brave and reckless
                    enough of life, their own as well as that of others, where a cause requires it,
                    they have the good sense never to venture blood unnecessarily or on insufficient
                    grounds. Indeed on all points and in all their dealings, shrewd, calm, good
                    sense, joined with a humorous and sarcastic turn of mind, may be said to be the
                    base of their character; their passions, strong and lasting, are kept in
                    habitual control; and in these regards, as in a lively and poetical imagination,
                    and a wonderful power of untaught eloquence, they resemble their more settled
                    countrymen of the towns and villages. In their principal faults,
                    too—instability, restlessness, envy, rancour, untruthfulness, and
                    sensuality—they resemble them also.</p>

                <p>ever, but to be merely the natural result of condition and circumstances. À
                    nomade popιdation, thinly scattered over a large and open space of meagre
                    pasture-land, will always be unconquerable, because it offers next to nothing to
                    conquer. When in camp, a Bedouin’s tent consists of a few coverings of the
                    coarsest goat-hair, dyed black, and spread over two or more small poles, in
                    height from 8 to 9 feet, gipsy fashion. If it be the tent of a sheykh or man of
                    consequence, its total length may be from 30 to 40 feet; if of an ordinary
                    person, it w ill offener fall short of 20. Sometimes a partition separates the
                    quarters allotted to the women and children; sometimes they are housed under a
                    lower and narrower covering. A piece of rough carpet or an old mat may or may
                    not be spread on the sandy floor; while camel-saddles, ropes, halters, and the
                    like, constitute the entire furniture of the dwelling; ornament there is none.
                    To the list two or three cauldrons for cooking, one or two platters, and a
                    wooden drinking bowl, must be added; and with these, including the master’s arms
                    in one side of the tent, and his spear stuck in the ground at the door, the
                    household valuables are complete. When the time comes for moving, all these
                    several articles are easily fastened in bundles on the backs of one or more
                    camels; the men mount their saddles, the women their litters; and in an hour the
                    blackened stones that served for a cooking hearth remain as almost the only sign
                    where the encampment has been. When the tribe is once on its way across the
                    desert, pursuit is difficult; and were the fugitives overtaken, they would offer
                    nothing to repay the trouble of their pursuers. It may be worth the while of
                    nomades such as these occasionally to plunder each other, but it can hardly be
                    worth the while of any foreign power to plunder, still less to attempt to subdue
                    them, and in this lies the whole secret of their imagined independence.</p>
                <p>From the Bedouins, or “Ahl Bedoo,” we now turn to the “Ahl Hadr,” or the dwellers
                    in fixed abodes. These constitute about six-sevenths of the population of Arabia
                    proper, and it is from them alone that a just appreciation of the Arab character
                    and customs can be formed.</p>
                <p>Though the clan and the family form the basis and are the ultimate expression of
                    the civilised Arab society, they do not, as is the case among the Bedouins, sum
                    it up altogether; local feelings and duties, the consequences of settled life,
                    having deeply modified the character alike of the individuals and the race among
                    all Arabs, town or country. Still, blood is the first thing taken into account;
                    and, indeed, the possession of written records, and habits of order and
                    reflection, enable the settled Arabs to acquire and retain a more accurate
                    knowledge and nicer distinction of pedigree and race than could be expected or
                    found among the unreflecting and half-barbarous Bedouins.</p>
                <p>Throughout the peninsula, but especially on the western side, the family of
                    Koreysh is even yet regarded as the noblest of Arab races, indeed of the world;
                    and its members, on the strength of their connection with the Prophet, all bear
                    the title of “Shereef,” sometimes also, as in Yemen, that of “Seyyid,” or
                    “lord.” Besides the advantages which naturally follow popular respect, they hold
                    in several districts of Arabia—in Mecca itself, for example, in Aboo-Areesh, and
                    in some parts of Yemen—the positions and emoluments of local hereditary
                    governors. But they do not assume any regular distinctive mark, like the green
                    turban so often worn in Turkey or Persia; nor in private life do they enjoy any
                    immunity, either explicit or prescriptive, from the ordinary obligations of
                    law.</p>
                <p>“Sheykh,” or elder, “Emeer,” or ruler, “Imam,” or preceder, and “Sultan,” or
                    monarch, are personal and often, though not necessarily, hereditary titles of
                    rank. “Walee,” or governor, is a word the use of which is limited</p>
                <p>BIA 249</p>
                <p>to Yemen and Oman. “Sheykh,” on the contrary, is universal; every village,
                    however small, every separate quarter of a town, has a “sheykh,” in whom is
                    lodged the executive power of government—a power loosely defined, and of more or
                    less extent according to the personal character and means of the individual who
                    wields it. A village “sheykh” is a sort of head magistrate and chief of police,
                    or like a sheriff of old times. His power is, however, occasionally limited,
                    particularly in towns, by that of the “kadee,” or “judge,” whose duty consists
                    in the official, though rather arbitrary, interpretation of the law, and whose
                    sentence ought, in theory at least, to precede the action of the sheykh. But as
                    the Koran, the sole authentic authority in all matters, legal or civil,
                    throughout Arabia, never accurately distinguished between the two classes, and
                    its phrases, besides, are vague and capable of admitting different and even
                    opposite interpretations, the administration of law and justice has in
                    consequence always remained extremely irregular, and dependent much more on the
                    personal good sense and integrity of the officials, or too often on their want
                    of those desirable qualities, than on any methodised system. The sheykh has no
                    fixed income; he is usually a landed proprietor, sometimes a merchant; many
                    sheykhs, however, abuse their power for their own private advantage. Nor is his
                    office strictly hereditary, though it may become accidentally so.</p>
                <p>Emeer is a higher title, restricted to a governor of a Emeer, district or
                    province, especially in Shomer, Nejd, and the rest of the central region. An
                    emeer is in most respects nothing but a magnified sheykh; he has, however, the
                    advantage of drawing a considerable portion of his income from the country he
                    administers. Thus in Nejd the emeers receive and retain, partially in Wahhabee
                    governments, wholly in others, the “zekat,” or tithes, varying from
                    one-twentieth up to one-fifth of the value of property, besides other occasional
                    dues, fines, &lt;fcc.; in Hasa, Bahreyn, Katar, Mahrah, and Hadramaut the emeer
                    can also claim the fishery tax and customs. Beyond Wahhabee limits he has the
                    ordinary, within them the extraordinary, power of life and death; in all cases
                    he can punish by imprisonment and fine. Part of his office is to hold public
                    audiences daily, on which occasions every one who chooses, of whatever rank or
                    condition, has the right of coming forward and of presenting any complaint or
                    petition. Sometimes the emeer takes the matter thus brought before him into his
                    own hands at once; sometimes he refers it to the radee, or to the elder and more
                    respectable inhabitants, who in these meetings take seat near the emeer, and
                    form a kind of improvised council. The emeer himself wears about him no
                    distinctive badge of office; nor is he approached with any ceremony beyond that
                    of ordinary Arab politeness. In the Wahhabee provinces, or those where
                    Wahha-beeism, though no longer dominant, has made a permanent impression, as in
                    Shomer for instance, the emeer commonly takes on himseif the duties of the
                    Friday “imam,” not unlike those of precentor in Presbyterian worship, in the
                    public mosque; now and then he preaches a sermon. Ilis position is generally
                    hereditary, but not always in direct line.</p>
                <p>The title of “sultan,” or king, one of doubtful antiquity, Sultan, has been
                    assumed by the hereditary Wahhabee ruler of Riad, the capital of Nejd; it is
                    also often applied to the sovereign of Oman, and to some petty princes in the
                    south of the peninsula. In practice it adds little or nothing to the dignity of
                    emeer, but implies a larger territorial range of authority.</p>
                <p>Where the Wahhabee doctrines have definitely estab-Religion, lished themselves,
                    as in Nejd, Yemameh, Hareek, Aflaj, and Jebel Aseer, the Mahometan code, as laid
                    down in the Koran, is observed more strictly perhaps than in any other</p>

                    Besides the principal mosque, or « ia≡ " for Friday prayers, indispensable in
                    every town o∕ village, smaller praying-places, or mesjids, are erected in eveιy
                    quarter. These buildings are mere oblong rooms, flat-roofed, supported on
                    numerous rough pillars placed close to each other, and with no architectural or
                    decorative beauty whatever; but are kept scrupulously clean, and laid down
                    partly with mats, partly gravel In most cases there is no minaret attached, the
                    times of prayer being merely announced by the “mùeddin,” or crier, from the roof
                    itself. Punctuality in attendance is enforced by the « mu tow was,” or
                    “compellers” of “obedience,” a set of self-elected zealots, who parade the towns
                    and villages with sticks in their hands, take note of the defaulters from
                    prayers, or transgressors otherwise of the letter of-the law, and punish them
                    with reproaches or even blows. Marriage, divorce, inheritance, purchase, every
                    detail of life is regulated in exact accordance with the Koran; even
                    conversation is liable to censure unless thickly interlarded with words of
                    religious import; while after night-prayers talking is a luxury prohibited
                    altogether. Yet, though these Wahhabee Arabs are bigoted even to fanaticism
                    among themselves and with their fellow-countrymen, they are remarkably tolerant
                    towards strangers, and often unite with the extreme of theoretical exclusiveness
                    a good deal of the practical scepticism and indifference common to their
                    race.</p>
                <p>Orthodox These Wahhabees all belong to the orthodox sect of sects. Ebn-Hanbal,
                    and are in fact its most exaggerated expression. In the eastern provinces, Hasa,
                    Katee, Bahreyn, and Katar, the Malikee sect is more common; as also, it is said,
                    in Hadramaut, and in some parts of Yemen. But in Yemen generally, and throughout
                    the Hejaz, the Shaféyee sect, orthodox like the two others, predominates. There
                    are no Hanefees in Arabia, except a few Turks or Indians settled on the western
                    coast. “Sheéah,” too, or votaries of Ali and his family, in the Persian sense of
                    the word, are by no means common in the peninsula, and where found are often of
                    foreign origin.</p>
                <p>Khowaιij. But all along the Persian Gulf, in Hasa, Bahreyn, and Katar, a
                    considerable proportion of the inhabitants are not Mahometans at all, that is,
                    in the ordinary acceptation of the word, but “Khowarij,” or “secedere,”
                    belonging to the Karmathian school already mentioned; while in Oman, the little
                    peninsula or cape of Ras-el-Rheymah excepted, where Wahhabeeism has made good
                    its footing, the bulk of the people belong to the Beyadee or Abadee sect, a
                    Karmathian offshoot nearly allied in doctrines and in practice to the
                    “Ismaileeyah” of Syria. For a detailed account of either the reader may with
                    advantage consult Silvestre de Sacy’s admirable treatise on the “Batineeyah,” or
                    secret sects of the Mahometan East, prefixed to his History of the Druses.
                    Somewhat akin to these, but of a less marked divergence from orthodox Islam, are
                    the Zeydees, of whom great numbers exist in Yemen. Lastly, paganism, or rather
                    the fetichism that takes for its scope a stone, tree, or some other natural
                    object, appears to exist in Mahrah, in the southern Jowf, and in various small
                    half-isolated spots on the borders of the great desert, or Dahna. Vestiges of
                    Sabaism, or the worship of the heavenly bodies, are said to linger among the
                    wilder Bedouin tribes, who even yet compute the year from the rising of Soheyl
                    or Canopus, and prostrate themselves to the morning sun. It is also noticeable
                    that even such of the southern Arabs as are professedly Mahometan, are far less
                    zealous and much laxer in their ways than the Arabs of the north; in fact, the
                    Islam of the latter was indigenous, that of the former acquired or
                    compulsory.</p>

                    >Thousand and One Nights</hi> for example, are less frequently of Arab than of

                    Mahometanism, or molest those of other religions. Jews exist undisturbed in
                    great numbers near Teyma and in the south; Hindoos worship cows and burn their
                    dead without interference in Oman; only old custom, it would seem, and the
                    memory of long and bitter ware, prohibits the practice of the Christian religion
                    in Arabia proper,—Aden alone, of course, where the British flag proclaims
                    absolute tolerance, excepted.</p>
                <p>Slavery is still, as of old times, a recognised institution Slavery, throughout
                    Arabia; and an active traffic in blacks is carried on along the coasts of the
                    Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, but especially the former.</p>
                <p>The slaves themselves are chiefly brought from the east African coast districts
                    down as far as Zanzibar, and from the Galla tribes in the interior; a few
                    Abyssinians, too, are sometimes imported. Slaves are usually employed in Arabia
                    as herdsmen or as domestic servants, rarely in agricultural works; they also
                    form a considerable portion of the bodyguards with which Eastern greatness loves
                    to surround itself. Like their countrymen elsewhere, they readily embrace the
                    religion of their masters, and become zealous Mahometans, though rarely
                    according to knowledge. Arab custom enfranchises a slave who has accepted Islam
                    at the end of seven years of bondage; and when that period has arrived, the
                    master, instead of exacting from his slave the price of freedom, generally, on
                    giving him his liberty, adds the requisite means for supporting himself and a
                    family in comfort. Further, on every important occasion, such as a birth,
                    circumcision, a marriage, or a death, one or more of the household slaves are
                    sure of acquiring their freedom. Hence it comes that Arabia is densely sprinkled
                    with a free black population; and these again, by intermarriage with the whites
                    around, have filled the land with a mulatto breed of every shade, till, in the
                    eastern and southern provinces especially, a white skin is almost an exception.
                    This has taken place all the more readily that in Arabia there exists no
                    prejudice against negro alliances; no social or political line separates the
                    African from the Arab. A negro may become a sheykh, a kadee, an emeer, or
                    whatever his industry and his talents may render him capable of being. This
                    occurs frequently, particularly in Nejd, Yemen, and Hadramaut; in the Hejaz and
                    the north, on the contraτy, a faint line of demarcation may be observed between
                    the races.</p>
                <p>Both town and village Arabs are, as a rule, serious in Character, gait and
                    demeanour, and very observant of politeness, not only in the manner, but even in
                    the substance of their conversation. In temper, or at least in the manifestation
                    of it, they are studiously calm; and an Arab rarely so much as raises his voice
                    in a dispute. He prides himself on an unnιffled exterior, and will bear much
                    with careful seeming calm that would drive a European to the extreme of
                    impatience and rage. But this outward tranquillity covers feelings alike keen
                    and permanent; and the remembrance of a rash jest or injurious word, uttered
                    years before, is too often the cause of violence and bloodshed.</p>
                <p>Besides, however, the individual shades of character, there exist marked tribal
                    or almost semi-national diversities<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0270-0251"/>, among the Arabs. Thus, the inhabitants of Hejaz
                    are noted for courtesy and blamed for fickleness; those of Nejd are
                    distinguished by their stern tenacity and dignity of deportment; the nations of
                    Yemen are gentle and pliant, but revengeful; those of Hasa and Oman cheerful and
                    fond of sport, though at the same time turbulent and unsteady. Anything
                    approaching to a game is rare in Nejd, and in the Hejaz religion and the yearly
                    occurrence of the pilgrim ceremonies almost exclude all public diversions; but
                    in Yemen the well-known game of the “jereed,” or palm-stick, with dances and
                    music—the latter very barbarous, it must be allowed—is not rare. In Oman such
                    amusements are still more frequent. Again, in Yemen and Oman, coffee-houses,
                    where people can resort for conversation, and where public recitals, songs, and
                    other diversions are to be met with, stand open all day; while nothing of the
                    sort is tolerated in Nejd. So it is also with the ceremonies observed on
                    occasion of circumcision or marriage—occasions of gaiety and pastime on the
                    coast, but passed over with little of the like observance in the central
                    provinces.</p>
                <p>An Arab town, or even village, except it be the merest hamlet, is invariably
                    walled round; but the ramparts are low, and seldom of any stronger material than
                    dried earth; they are occasionally flanked by towers of like construction, such
                    as befit a country where cannon are unknown and fire-arms are yet at the
                    matchlock stage. A dry-ditch often surrounds the whole. The streets are utterly
                    irregular— some broad, some narrow, all tortuous; the houses are of one or two
                    storeys, very rarely of three, with flat mud roofs, little windows, and no
                    external ornament. If the town be large, the expansion of one or two streets
                    becomes a market-place, where are ranged a few shops of eatables, drugs, coffee,
                    and, very rarely, cottons or other goods. Many of these shops are kept by women.
                    The chief mosque is always near the market-place; so is also the governor’s
                    residence, which, except in size and in being more or less fortified Arab
                    fashion, does not differ from a private house. Drainage is unthought of; but the
                    extreme dryness of the air obviates the inconvenience and disease that under
                    other skies could not fail to ensue, and which in the damper climates of the
                    coast make themselve3 seriously felt. But the streets are roughly swept every
                    day, each householder taking care of what lies before his own door. Whitewash
                    and colour are occasionally used in Yemen, Hejaz, and Oman; elsewhere a light
                    ochre tint, the colour of the sun-dried bricks, predominates in an Arab town or
                    village, which looks at a distance like a large dust-heap in the centre of the
                    bright green ring of gardens and palm-groves all around. Baked bricks are
                    unknown in Arabia, and stone buildings are rare, especially in Nejd. Palm
                    branches and the like, woven in wattles, form the dwellings of the poorer
                    classes in the southern districts. Many Arab towns possess watchtowers, like
                    huge round factory chimneys in appearance, built of sun-dried bricks, and
                    varying in height from 50 to 100 feet, or even more. Indeed, two of these
                    constructions at the town of Birket-el-Mawj, in Oman, are said to be each of 170
                    feet in height, and that of Nezwah, in the same province, is reckoned at 140;
                    but these are of stone. Some of these watch-towers are so built as to serve also
                    for citadels or places of refuge; but none could offer a minute’s resistance to
                    any kind of artillery, though formidable obstacles to men whose only means of
                    attack are lances and matchlocks.</p>
                <p>The principal feature in the interior of an Arab house is the “kahwah,” or
                    coffee-room, as from its destination it is commonly called. It is a large
                    apartment spread with mats, and sometimes furnished with carpets and a few
                    cushions. At one extremity is a small furnace or fireplace, for preparing
                    coffee. In this room the men congregate; here guests are received, and even
                    lodged; women rarely enter it, except at times when strangers are unlikely to be
                    present. Some of these apartments are very spacious, and supported by pillars;
                    one wall is usually built transversely to the compass direction of the kâabeh;
                    it serves to facilitate the performance of prayer by those who may happen to be
                    in the kahwah at the appointed times. The other rooms are ordinarily small, and
                    appropriated to the use of the females of the family and to domestic life.</p>
                <p>In hospitality the Arabs of our time have in no degree degenerated from their
                    former reputation, though Shomer, Nejd, Yemamah, and Hasa excel in this respect
                    the other provinces. A stranger’s arrival is often the occasion of an amicable
                    dispute among the wealthier inhabitants as to who shall have the privilege of
                    receiving him; and though three days are often popularly spoken of as the limit
                    of such entertainment, practice sets no precise bounds to its length; and an
                    Arab host always carefully abstains from putting any question to his guest as to
                    when he is going, or where. Indeed, if the guest be discreet and acceptable in
                    his manners, he will soon find himself on the footing of one of the family; and
                    even the women of the house will come in to sit and converse with him not less
                    freely than they would with their own relations.</p>
                <p>Arab cookery is of the simplest. Roughly-ground wheat cooked with butter; bread,
                    in thin cakes, prepared on a heated iron plate or against the walls of an open
                    oven; a few vegetables, generally of the leguminous kinds; boiled mutton or
                    camel’s flesh, if the circumstances of the host allow of such luxuries; dates
                    and fruits,—this is the <hi rend="italic">menu</hi> of an ordinary meal. Roast
                    meat, fried, stewed—in a word, anything but boiled—is rarely seen, such dishes
                    exceeding the skill of the cooks, who, as a rule, are the women of the
                    household. Rice is eaten in wealthy houses, and fish is common on the coasts.
                    Among the Bedouins, millet-cakes, half-cooked in ashes, or a broth prepared from
                    the gritty seeds of the “samh” (a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesembry-anthem,um)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> often take the
                    place of bread; and their meat cookery is equally wretched. Game, such as
                    venison, partridge, and hare, is served up on rare occasions. Camel meat is a
                    favourite, but to a stranger a very insipid dish, in southern Nejd, Yemamah,
                    Hareek, and Aflaj. Spices are freely employed in town cookery; butter much too
                    largely for a European taste.</p>
                <p>After eating, the hands are always washed with soap, or some substitute for it,
                    commonly the ashes of an alkaline plant. A covered censer with burning incense
                    is then passed round, and each guest perfumes his hands, face, and sometimes his
                    clothes; this censer serves also on first receptions, and whenever special
                    honour is intended. In Yemen and Oman scented water often does duty for it.
                    Coffee, without milk or sugar, but flavoured with an aromatic seed brought from
                    India, is served to all· This, too, is done on the occasion of a first welcome,
                    when the cups often make two or three successive rounds; but, in fact, coffee is
                    made and drunk at any time, as frequently as the desire for it may suggest
                    itself; and each time fresh grains are sifted, roasted, pounded, and boiled—a
                    very laborious process, and one that requires in the better sort of
                    establishments a special servant or slave for the work. Among the Bedouins the
                    use of coffee is rare, though they are fond of it when they can get it Arabs in
                    general make only one solid meal a-day—that of supper, soon after sunset; nor
                    even then do they eat much, gluttony being rare among them, and even daintiness
                    esteemed disgraceful. Wine, like other fermented drinks, is prohibited by the
                    Koran, and is, in fact, very rarely to be met with, though the inhabitants of
                    the mountains of Oman are said to indulge in it On the coast spirits of the
                    worst quality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0271-0252"/> are sometimes procured; opium and hasheesh have
                    also but few votaries in Arabia. On the other hand, wherever Wahhabeeism has
                    left freedom of action, tobacco-smoking prevails, the manner of smoking varying
                    considerably, according to the district. Among the Bedouins and the poorer
                    classes of the upland regions a short pipe of clay, called a “sebeel,” red or
                    black, is in vogue. The wealthier townsmen prefer long pipes with large open
                    bowls; but the most frequent use is made of the water-pipe, or “narghileh,” of
                    which implement every form, kind, and dimension imaginable may be found in
                    Arabia. The tobacco smoked is generally strong, and is either brought from the
                    neighbourhood of Baghdad or grown in the country itself. The strongest quality
                    is that of Oman; the leaf is broad and coarse, and retains its green colour even
                    when dried; a few whiffs have been known to produce absolute stupor. The
                    aversion of the Wahhabees to tobacco is well known; they entitle it “mukhzee,”
                    or “the shameful,” and its use is punished with blows, as the public use of wine
                    would be elsewhere.</p>
                <p>In dress much variety prevails. The loose cotton drawers, girded at the waist,
                    which in hot climates do duty for trousers, are not often worn, even by the
                    upper classes, in Nejd or Yemamah, where a kind of silk dressing-gown is thrown
                    over the long shirt; frequently, too, a brown or black cloak distinguishes the
                    wealthier citizen; his head-dress is in its character the same as that of the
                    Bedouins — namely, a handkerchief fastened round _ the head by a band—only of
                    better materials. But in Hejaz, Yemen, and Oman, turbans are by no means
                    uncommon; the ordinary colour is white; they are worn over one or more
                    skull-caps—sometimes fifteen—till the head is rather burdened than protected.
                    Trousers also form part of the dress in the two former of these districts; and a
                    voluminous sash, in which a dagger or an inkstand is stuck, is wrapped round the
                    waist. Meanwhile the poorer folk and the villagers often content themselves with
                    a broad piece of cloth round the loins, and another across the shoulders. In
                    Oman trousers are rare, but over the shirt a long gown, of peculiar and somewhat
                    close-fitting cut, dyed yellow, is often worn. The women in these provinces
                    commonly put on loose drawers, and some add veils to their head-dresses; they
                    are fond of ornaments (gold and silver), and overcharge themselves with them;
                    their hair is generally arranged in a long plait hanging down behind. All men
                    allow their beards, whiskers, and moustaches full growth, though none of these
                    are much to speak of, particularly among the Arabs of the south, who are a
                    thin-haired race. Most shave their heads, and indeed all, strictly speaking,
                    ought by Mahometan custom to do so; but many, peasants especially, Bedouins, and
                    the like, neglect it. An Arab seldom or never dyes his hair. Sandals are worn
                    more often than shoes, but the heat of the ground in the daytime allows none
                    except the very poorest to go wholly barefoot. Lastly, though no class or
                    occupation lays claim to any particular style or article of dress, legists,
                    writers, imams, and others connected with the service of the mosques, generally
                    affect greater amplitude and less variety of colour in their turbans and
                    vestments than other people.</p>
                <p>In person the Arabs are a remarkably handsome race,— tall, lithe, well-formed,
                    dark-eyed, and dark-haired. Deformed individuals or dwarfs are rare among them;
                    nor, except leprosy, of which frequent instances may be met with throughout the
                    peninsula, does any disease seem to be hereditary among them. The frequency of
                    ophthalmia, though not in the virulent Egyptian form, is evidently attributable
                    to the nature of the soil and the climate. They are scrupulously clean in their
                    persons, adding to the prescribed ablutions of the Mahometan code frequent
                    supererogatory washings of their own; and take special care of their teeth,
                    which are generally fine, though toothache is by no means unknown in Arabia.
                    Simple and abstemious in their habits, they often reach an extreme yet healthy
                    old age; nor is it common among them for the faculties of the mind to give way
                    sooner than those of the body. To sum up, physically and morally they yield to
                    few races, if any, of mankind; mentally, they surpass most, and are only kept
                    back in the march of common progress by the remarkable defect of organising
                    power and incapacity for combined action which they share with many other
                    nations of the East, and some, it would seem, of the West also. Lax and
                    imperfect as are their forms of government, it is with impatience that even
                    these are borne; and we have already seen that of the four caliphs who alone
                    reigned—if reign theirs could be called—in Arabia proper, three died a violent
                    death; and of the Wahhabee princes, the most genuine representatives in later
                    times of pure Arab rule, almost all have met the same fate.</p>
                <p>Of the revenues of Arabia it would be difficult to form anything like a correct
                    estimate. Palgrave has stated the yearly receipts of the Nejdean treasury,
                    inclusive of the tribute then (1862) paid into it by Bahreyn and the west of
                    Oman, to be nearly £106,000 sterling—no very large sum.</p>
                <p>The revenues of Oman itself, then in a comparatively prosperous condition, are
                    estimated by the same author at nearly ten times the amount, but may possibly
                    have been overrated by him, as those of Yemen were perhaps by Niebuhr. Certainly
                    the general condition of these provinces—the restricted character of the
                    cultivation and the evident poverty (not absolute want, indeed, for that is
                    rare) of the greater number of the inhabitants—do not convey to the visitor the
                    idea of large national wealth or extensive resources. There can, however, be no
                    doubt that both the coast districts of Arabia, in their varied and valuable
                    products, and the central plateau, with its palmgroves, well irrigation, and
                    wide pasture-lands, might, under a judicious administration, become the sources
                    of much greater revenues, both public and private, than is now the case. The
                    mines, too, in the metamorphic districts of Yemen and Oman, remain yet to be
                    properly worked. As for the desert proper, which, as we have seen, occupies
                    about one-third of the peninsula, it must, like the ocean of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Childe Harold,</hi> remain what it is to the end of time.</p>
                <p>In the 7th century Arabia sent forth armies that attacked and conquered nearly
                    half the then known world. But the secret of her conquests lay not in the number
                    of her warriors, but in a resolute purpose, a unity of aim, and an enthusiasm
                    which concentrated in itself and intensified every motive of human action. In
                    later ages she has been reduced to the defensive, and has shown herself not
                    always equal even to that: witness her conquest by the Turks in the 16th, and by
                    the Egyptians in the present century. Once only, at the moment when Wahhabee
                    union and zeal half restored for a few years the energy of early Islam, did her
                    armies go forth to invade the neighbouring territories of Mesopotamia and Syria;
                    but it was to plunder rather than to conquer, and the results lasted no longer
                    than the invasions themselves.</p>
                <p>Yet on the defensive Arabia had much in her favour, and that from many causes.
                    The first is, that there is little to defend, since, the coast of Yemen and the
                    districts of Bahreyn and Oman excepted, there is very little to excite the
                    cupidity of an invading, and nothing to satisfy the exigencies of an occupying
                    force. The second is, that the mountainous nature of Yemen and Oman themselves,
                    and the narrowness of their labyrinthine defiles added to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0272-0253"/> the extreme heat of the climate, and the scarcity
                    of available provisions, would make even those provinces hard to attack, harder
                    to retain. A third cause is in the broad strips of desert that gird the central
                    districts as with a moat of sand, and send long arms of barrenness here and
                    there into the heart of the cultivated or pastoral regions, so as to render
                    military operations on a large scale in the interior almost impossible. A fourth
                    and a very serious obstacle to invasion is the character of the inhabitants.
                    Personal courage, wonderful endurance of privation, fixity of purpose, and a
                    contempt of death rare even in the bravest Europeans, are qualities common to
                    almost every race, tribe, and clan that compose the Arab nation; and though
                    their undisciplined troops are unfitted to meet a better trained enemy in a
                    regular battle, in skirmishing and harassing they have few equals, while at
                    close quarters their individual impetuosity often disconcerts the more
                    mechanical fortitude of organised regiments. To this our own troops gave
                    testimony in the engagements of Shenaz, 1810, and of Ras-el-Hadd, 1819 and 1820,
                    when, with swords and spears alone, the Arabs of Oman maintained a desperate
                    struggle against guns and bayonets, neither giving nor receiving quarter. Nor
                    are they wholly ignorant of tactics, their armies, when engaged in regular war,
                    being divided into centre and wings, with skirmishers in front, and a reserve
                    behind, often screened at the outset of the engagement by the camels of the
                    expedition. These animals, kneeling, and ranged in long parallel rows, form a
                    sort of entrenchment, from behind which the soldiers of the main body fire their
                    matchlocks, while the front divisions, opening out, act on either flank of the
                    enemy. This arrangement of troops may be traced in Arab records as far back as
                    the 5th century, and has often been exemρhfied during the Wahhabee wars in our
                    own day.</p>
                <p>The military contingent of Nejd, including that of all the adjoining provinces
                    that constitute central Arabia, Jebel Shomer excepted, is reckoned by Palgrave
                    at 47,300 from among the settled, and at about 8000 from among the nomade
                    inhabitants. That of Shomer is estimated by the same authority at 14,000 of the
                    first, and at about 16,000 of the second category. Oman, including the
                    neighbouring and allied districts, is said to supply about 112,000, all from
                    towns or villages.</p>
                <p>We thus obtain a total of about 197,300 fighting men for what represents a full
                    half of the Arab peninsula. If, therefore, we calculate the entire military
                    force of the land from Suez to Aden, and from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean,
                    at 400,000 fighting men, we shall probably be not far from the truth. But while
                    remembering, on the one hand, that this is no standing army, nor composed of
                    regular and disciplined soldiers, it should not be forgotten that, in case of
                    invasion, their energy, and, it may be, their numbers, would be doubled by the
                    enthusiasm of patriotism; and that not every male only, but every woman would,
                    in the excitement of the struggle, take part in the national defence.</p>
                <p>Indeed, at all times Arab women have distinguished themselves by their bravery
                    hardly less than Arab men. Records of armed heroines occur frequently in the
                    chronicles or myths of the pre-Islamitic time; and in authentic history the
                    Battle of the Camel, 656 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> where Ayeshah, the wife
                    of Mahomet, headed the charge, is only the first of a number of instances in
                    which Arab amazons have taken, sword in hand, no inconsiderable share in the
                    wars and victories of Islam. Even now it is the custom for an Arab force to be
                    always accompanied by some courageous maiden, who, mounted on a blackened camel,
                    leads the onslaught, singing verses of encouragement for her own, of insult for
                    the opposing tribe. Round her litter the fiercest of the battle rages, and her
                    capture or death is the signal of utter rout; it is hers also to head the
                    triumph after the victory of her clan.</p>
                <p>There is little education, in our sense of the word, in Arabia. Among the
                    Bedouins there are, of course, no schools, and few, even of the most elementary
                    character, in the towns or villages. Where they exist, little beyond the
                    mechanical reading of the Koran, and the equally mechanical learning of it by
                    rote, is taught. On the other haud, Arab male children, brought up from early
                    years among the grown-up men of the house or tent, learn more from their own
                    parents and at home than is common in other countries; reading and writing are
                    in most instances thus acquired, or rather transmitted; besides such general
                    principles of grammar and eloquence, often of poetry and history, as the elders
                    themselves may be able to impart. To this family schooling too are due the good
                    manners, politeness, and self-restraint that early distinguish Arab children. In
                    the very few instances where a public school of a higher class exists, writing,
                    grammar, and rhetoric sum up its teachings. Law and theology, in the narrow
                    sense that both these words have in the Islamitic system, are explained in
                    afternoon lectures given in most mosques; and some verses of the Koran, with one
                    of the accepted commentaries, that of El-Beidawee for example, form the basis of
                    the instruction.</p>
                <p>(jreat attention is paid to accuracy of grammar and purity of diction throughout
                    Arabia; yet something of a dialectic difference may be observed in the various
                    districts. The purest Arabic, that which is as nearly as possible identical in
                    the choice of words and in its inflections with the language of the Koran, is
                    spoken in Nejd, and the best again of that in the province of Sedeyr. Next in
                    purity comes the Arabic of Shomer. Throughout the Hejaz in general, the
                    language, though extremely elegant, is not equally correct; in Hasa, Bahreyn,
                    and Oman, it is decidedly influenced by the foreign element called Naba-thaean,
                    that removes it still further from its original character. In Yemen, as in other
                    southern districts of the peninsula, Arabic merges by insensible degrees into
                    the Himyaritic or African dialect of Hadramaut and Mahrah. The Arabic spoken by
                    the nomade or Bedouin tribes, especially those of the north, is tolerably
                    correct, but the pronunciation is often inexact.</p>
                <p>The principal territorial divisions of Arabia have been already indicated, but a
                    detailed list may here not be out of place. They are, accordingly, on the
                    western side—</p>
                <p>The Hejaz, subject in great measure to Ottoman authority, and extending from 28°

                    described in the articles under these headings. The inhabitants are partly
                    nomade, partly settled, in about equal proportions. The Hejaz includes the
                    Beled-el-Haram, of sacred territory, immediately adjoining Mecca; and the Tâif,
                    a mountainous but fertile district to the S. E. of that town.</p>
                <p>Jebel Aseer, a mountainous tract along the coast immediately south of the Hejaz.
                    Its inhabitants are of the Wahhabee sect, and are governed by their own sheykhs,
                    with an emeer residing at Kolakh, the principal town or rather village of the
                    region. The Turks have lately invaded it, but to no great purpose.</p>
                <p>Aboo Areesh, along the coast, from 17° 40' to 15° 50' N. lat. This . district,
                    now occupied by the Turks, detached itself from Yemen . about a century ago. Its
                    inhabitants live in villages: the soil is poor, but the fisheries abundant. <hi

                    these are seaports, of 4000 or 5000 souls each; the last is celebrated for its
                    export of coffee, but its population does not exceed 8000 souls at most. There
                    are numerous fishing villages along the coast, and some inland hamlets; the

                <p>Jowf, a large oasis in the desert, adjoining Yemen on the east. It contains the

                    bears its name, besides many villages. The inhabitants are warlike; the country
                    is said to be fruitful, but little is known of it with certainty, nor has any
                    European ever visited it.</p>
                <p>Nejran, an independent province on the north-east of Yemen. It is fertile and
                    thickly peopled; the inhabitants are mostly villagers, and belong to a sect
                    allied to that of the Beyadees in Oman. The principal town, situated on the
                    highroad of Sanaa, bears the same name as the district.</p>

                <p>Hadramaut, an extensive region, occupying the south-east coast and inland.
                    Niebuhr, our best authority for this part of Arabia, as for Yemen, describes it
                    as being divided into several small principalities, of which Shibam on the
                    south, and Ainad further north, are the chief. The only towns really known are
                    Dafar and Kesheen, ports of the coast; they are both small and unimportant. The
                    inhabitants are all governed by their own chiefs. Of their race and language
                    mention has been made before; their mode of life is partly nomade, partly
                    settled.</p>
                <p>Mahrah, a continuation of Hadramaut northwards, up to Ras-el-Hadd. Its
                    inhabitants, who appear to be the least civilised among all the Arab races, pay
                    an irregular allegiance to the sultan of Oman: The country is said to be sandy,
                    and thinly peopled; the Bedouin tribes of Al-Morrah and Aboo-Alse frequent its
                    pasturages.</p>
                <p>Returning inland, we find the north and centre of Arabia thus divided :—</p>
                <p>Jowf, an oasis south of the Syrian frontier. It contains seven principal and some
                    smaller villages. The population is set down at 40,000 souls; they are governed
                    by an emeer, who depends on the prince of Shomer.</p>
                <p>Teyma, a thinly-peopled district west of Jowf. Its inhabitants are mostly.
                    Bedouin, and each clan obeys its own sheykh. The total population is 12,000.</p>
                <p>Kheybar, a collection of small villages and encampments on the north-west of the
                    Hejaz; several of the tribes inhabiting it are of Jewish origin. The population
                    is given at 25,000.</p>
                <p>Jebel Shomer, an important province, including the mountain ranges of Aja and
                    Solma south of Jowf. Its capital, Hayel, stands on the highroad between Bosrah
                    and Medinah; it possesses a public market-place, and may contain about 15,000 or
                    16,000 souls. The villages of the province are forty; the total population
                    162,000, who are given to agricultural and pastoral pursuits in about equal
                    proportions. The emeer or prince is hereditary, and allied with, though not
                    dependent on, the government of Nejd.</p>
                <p>Upper Kaseem, an oblong strip of land, lying between the mountains of Shomer and
                    the valley of Lower Kaseem, which latter belongs to Nejd. The soil is sandy, but
                    not unfertile. It contains about twenty villages, besides many hamlets. The
                    population is stated at 35,000. This district is subject to the emeer of
                    Shomer.</p>
                <p>The principal Bedouin tribes of this part of Arabia are the Shomer, who indeed
                    have given their name to the province; the Sherarat; the Howeytat; the
                    Benoo-Ateeyah; the Maaz; the Téy, a very ancient and famous tribe, of southern
                    origin, whose emigration hither dates from many centuries before Mahomet; and
                    the Wah-hideyah. The total population is estimated at 166,000 souls; but this
                    does not include the Bedouins of Teyma and Kheybar, who together, it is said,
                    muster an equal number.</p>
                <p>There remains Nejd, a name including the whole central inhabitable district of
                    Arabia, and which is divided into nine provinces. They are as follows :—</p>
                <p>Ared, the centre province, in which the present Wahhabee capital, Riad, is
                    situated. The town is very ancient, and has a population of 30,000. It possesses
                    a palace, where the sultan of Nejd resides, and many other considerable
                    buildings. The fortifications are extensive, but of unbaked brick only, as are
                    also the dwellings of the town; near Riad may still be seen the mins of the
                    ancient capital, Dereyéeah, demolished by Ibrahim Pasha in 1817. Besides Riad,
                    Ared contains many villages so large as to merit the name of towns; the land is
                    generally fertile, cultivation abounds, and the total population exceeds, it is
                    said, 100,000. <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi>.</p>
                <p>Sedeyr, an extensive province, north of Ared, and situated in the highlands. of
                    the Toweyk mountain chain. Its principal town, Mejmaa, is fortified, Arab
                    fashion; the ancient towns, Jelajib, Toweym, and others are situated here. The
                    number of large villages is twenty-five; the entire population is 140,000. They
                    are a brave and intelligent race, and furnish the choicest contingent to the
                    Wahhabee armies.</p>
                <p>Yemamah, a fertile district, south of Ared, celebrated in all ages of Arab
                    history for the bravery of its men and the beauty of its women. It forms an
                    important part of the Wahhabee empire. Its principal town is Manfoohah; but it
                    includes many others, such as Khorj, the neighbourhood of which, from its
                    fertility, is called the paradise of Nejd; the number of inhabitants is said to
                    equal that of Sedeyr.</p>
                <p>Hareek, a mountainous oasis on the extreme southern verge of Nejd, at the
                    commencement of the great desert, or Dahnâ. Principal town, Hootah. The
                    inhabitants are all zealous Wahhabees; their number is stated at 14,000. The
                    villages are 16 in number.</p>
                <p>Aflaj, a small and hilly district south-west of Ared. The inhabitants are
                    Wahhabees, and number 16,000; the villages, of which Kharfah is the chief, are
                    twelve in all.</p>
                <p>Wadi Dowasir, a long shallow valley, reaching down from Aflaj in the direction of
                    Yemen; the soil is sandy and unproductive. It contains fifty small villages,
                    besides hamlets, and the population is estimated at 100,000, all Wahhabees. They
                    have a bad reputation for illiberality and meanness of disposition.</p>
                <p>Soleyel, also a Wahhabee province. It forms the junction between Wadi Dowasir and
                    Yemen; its principal town bears the same name as the district. Its villages are
                    given at twenty-five, its inhabitants at 30,000.</p>
                <p>Woshem, a small, compact, but important district west of Ared, of which it is the
                    key. Its principal town, Doramah, offered a determined resistance to Ibraham
                    Pasha in 1817. Here, too, is Shakrah, a large commercial centre; Kowéy, near
                    which was fought the decisive battle between the Egyptian and Wahhabee troops;
                    and other villages, twenty in all. Inhabitants, 80,000, all Wahhabees. The
                    country is well supplied with water, and the ground productive.</p>
                <p>Kaseem, a wide fertile valley west of Woshem, and belonging to the Wahhabee
                    government. It possesses three large towns—Onezzah, Bereydah, and Rass—besides
                    about 60 villages and numerous hamlets. The inhabitants are a busy and thriving,
                    but not a very warlike race; they are computed at 300,000. These districts
                    constitute Nejd proper, and form the bulk of the present Wahhabee monarchy.</p>
                <p>Coming now to the east coast, we find Hasa, a large province occupying almost the
                    whole region conterminous with the upper half of the Persian Gulf. Its principal
                    town, Hofhoof, possesses a remarkable fortress, said to be of Karmathian
                    construction, besides a large market-place and several handsome buildings. Close
                    by is the more modern town of Mebarrez, almost equalling the capital itself in
                    size. The province is in general well-watered and fertile; the number of
                    villages about fifty, that of the population 160,000. This region belongs to the
                    Wahhabee government, but has lately been occupied by the Turks.</p>
                <p>Kateef, a small, marshy, but fertile district on the shores of the Persian Gulf,
                    directly opposite to Bahreyn. It belongs, like Hasa, to the Wahhabees; the
                    principal town, also called Kateef, was once the residence of the dreaded
                    Karmathian princes. The climate is unhealthy; the population is estimated at
                    about 100, 000 souls.</p>
                <p>The most considerable nomade tribes in this district are the Ajman, Benoo-Hajr,
                    Benoo-Khalid, Meteyr, Oteybah, Sebaâ, Kahtan, Harb (a numerous and warlike
                    clan), Anezeh, and Al-morrah. Their whole number does not probably exceed
                    80,000; the nomade population of central Arabia bearing no proportion to the
                    settled, whereas a reverse condition exists on the northern frontier, and above
                    all in the Syrian desert.</p>
                <p>Continuing our review of the eastern districts, we next find—</p>
                <p>Bahreyn, a name given to the two large islands of Menameh and Moharrek, both
                    celebrated for pearl fisheries off their shores. They are governed by a chief of
                    their own, of the family name of Khaleefah; but pay an uncertain allegiance,
                    sometimes to the government of Baghdad, sometimes to that of Oman. Numerous
                    villages cover the islands, of which the soil is fertile; but the chief
                    resources of the inhabitants are maritime and commercial. Population,
                    70,000.</p>
                <p>Katar, the pearl-fishery coast east of Hasa. Its inhabitants, said to be 135,000
                    in number, find an almost exclusive occupation in the pearl trade; inland the
                    region is barren and desert. This province depends on the chiefs of Bahreyn, but
                    it also pays tribute to Oman.</p>
                <p>Sharjah, a coast strip, with a seaport of the same name, east of Katar. It
                    belongs to Oman, but has been often occupied by the Wahhabees. Sharjah is a
                    great depot for slaves brought from the east African coast; the inhabitants are
                    mostly concerned in the trade. The province counts thirty-five villages and
                    85,000 inhabitants. The present governor, Khalid-ebn-Sakar, whose authority also
                    extends over the two next districts, is almost independent of the sultan of
                    Mascat.</p>
                <p>Roos-el-Jebal, also known as the Jowasimah, or Private Coast. The chief village,
                    Râs-el-Kheymah, was destroyed by the English in 1810, and again in 1819;
                    although since rebuilt, it has ceased to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n274/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0274-0255"/> a nest of robbers. This coast is very
                    mountainous, and the inhabitants, mostly Wahhabees, are savage in the extreme.
                    Their number is said not to exceed 10,000; they speak a dialect of their own,
                    almost unintelligible to the Arabs of the neighbourhood.</p>
                <p>Kalhat, the coast region east of Cape Mesandom. Its principal village is the
                    small seaport of Leemah; the other hamlets are about forty in number. The
                    population, a rough seafaring set, is stated at 60,000.</p>
                <p>Batineh. This district includes the whole plain between the mountains of Oman and
                    the sea-coast as far as Ras-Heyran, east of Mascat. It is the richest,
                    best-watered, and most thickly populated in all Arabia, and contains several
                    considerable towτιs, of which Mascat is the chief; and where the sultan, or, as
                    he is sometimes called, imam, of Oman resides. The other principal towns are
                    Matrah, Barkah, Sohar, and Shcnaz, all seaports of some activity along the
                    coast; more than seventy other small towns and villages are reported to be
                    scattered through the interior. The population, all Biadeeyah, and mortal
                    enemies of the Arabs of Neid, is said to be 700,000.</p>
                <p>Dahirah, the north-western province of Oman, having for its principal town that
                    of Bereymah, besides several places of less importance. It is the only district
                    where the nomade population nears any proportion to the settled: the total
                    population is given at 80,000. The Wahhabees of Nejd have often occupied and
                    still continue to harass this part of the country.</p>
                <p>Jebel Akhdar. This province, including the great fertile and well-peopled chain
                    of the “Green Mountains,” is to the kingdom of Oman what the province of Ared is
                    to that of Nejd, the backbone of the land. Here are the two towns of Nejwah and
                    Bahhileh, formerly residences of the sultan; besides Zekee, Minah, and about
                    seventy villages. The inhabitants are warlike, the women stately and beautiful;
                    all belong to the sect of the Biadeeyah. The population is stated at about
                    600,000.</p>
                <p>• Belad Soor, a coast district, said to be moderately fertile from Mascat to
                    Ras-el-Hadd. The port of Soor is the only place of any note, but several small
                    villages are said to exist near the coast. Population about 100,000; among them
                    are the Benoo-Aboo-Alee Arabs, famous for their brave resistance to our own
                    troops in 1819-20.</p>
                <p>Lastly, Jaylan, a wild region of which little is known, except that the
                    inhabitants are uncivilised, and resemble in all respects those of Mahrah, with
                    which province theirs is conterminous.</p>
                <p>The entire population of Arabia proper has been variously estimated; some authors
                    make it reach 12,000,000, others reduce it to 7,000,000. Taking the approximate
                    statistics above given, we find for the whole of central Arabia, including Jowf,
                    Shomer, and Nejd, about 1,500,000 settled inhabitants, with 500,000 Bedouins or
                    nomades; thus 2,000,000 may perhaps fairly represent the complete number. The
                    east coast--Hasa, Bahreyn, Oman, and their adjoining districts—furnishes
                    2,500,000 more. Yemen is said to contain over 1,000,000: Hadramaut and Mahrah
                    cannot be very populous: the Hejaz certainly is not. 3,000,000 is the maximum
                    estimate of both taken together, nomades or villagers. To these must be added
                    the tribes of the Sinaitic peninsula, and of the northern frontier. These, may
                    possibly bring the sum of the Arab population to 8,500,000, or even 9,000,000,
                    with a quota of about one-fifth Bedouin to four-fifths of settled Arabs; to such
                    small numerical proportions has the nation shrunk that once ruled by land and
                    sea from the Indus to the Atlantic, and that even now, by its religion and
                    institutions, gives the law to one-eighth of the human race.</p>
                <p>The history of Arabia and its inhabitants naturally divides itself into two
                    distinct and even dissimilar periods, that, namely, which preceded the era of
                    Mahomet, and that which followed it. Each of these two periods, though
                    comprising in its extent several minor phases and fluctuations, now of advance,
                    now of retrogression, bears, however, a well-marked general character of its
                    own. The first of the two periods is distinguished as one of local monarchies
                    and federal governments; the latter commences with theocratic centralisation
                    dissolving into general anarchy.</p>
                <p>The unrestrained imagination of Arab chroniclers has indeed added to their annals
                    a third or pre-historic tract, peopled with heroes and giants, men of renown,
                    sons of Anak, much resembUng thoso who figιιre in early Jewish records, and, it
                    may be not unfairly presumed, of analogous authenticity. To such belong the
                    fabulous tribes of ’Ad in the south, of Thamood in the north, anil of Tasm and
                    Jadis in the oentre of the peninsula. Very gorgeous are the descriptions given
                    of “Irem,” the “city of pillars,” as the Koran styles it, supposed to have been
                    erected by Shedad, the latest despot of ’Ad, in the regions of Hadramaut; and
                    which yet, after the annihilation of its tenants, remains entire, so Arabs say,
                    invisible to ordinary eyes, but occasionally, and at rare intervals, revealed to
                    some heaven-favoured traveller. Vague reports of the colossal ruins of Egyptian
                    Thebes and Karnak probably originated the fancy. To Thamood are ascribed the
                    more substantial traces of rock excavations in the north-western Hejaz; while
                    Tasm and Jadis are described as more scenite or Bedouin-like in their manners
                    and mode of living. Mahometan tradition, a mere travestie of the Jewish, and
                    mostly derived from rabbinical sources, has attempted to construct a
                    pseudo-genealogy of a Noachian character for every one of these imaginary or
                    vanished clans. Further yet, it has, in its eagerness to find a confirmation of
                    its own central idea, everywhere ascribed their extinction to supernatural
                    wrath, brought down on them, now by the rejection of some apocryphal prophet of
                    the Divine Unity, now by atrocious misdeeds like those recorded of the
                    inhabitants of Canaan or the Cities of the Plain. The sober historian, however,
                    will, in the absence of any reliable evidence, documentary or monumental,
                    abstain from pronouncing either on the character of these aboriginal tribes, or
                    on the manner and causes of their disappearance.</p>
                <p>The first dawning gleams of anything that deserves to be called history disclose
                    Arabia wholly, or nearly so, under the rule of a race of southern origin; the
                    genuine, or, as they are sometimes termed from a mythical ancestor Kahtan, the
                    Kahtanee Arabs. These, again, we find subdivided into several aristocratic
                    monarchical governments, arranged so as to form a broad framework or rim round
                    the central wilds of the peninsula.</p>
                <p>Oldest and chiefest among the Arab monarchies was that of Yemen; its regal
                    residence is said to have been in the now abandoned town of Mareb, in the
                    extreme south. After a devastating inundation, referred with some probability to
                    the first centuιy of the Christian era, the seat of government was removed from
                    the ruins of Mareb to Sanaa, a city which has continued the metropolis of Yemen
                    to the present day. The Yemenite kings, descendants of Kahtan and Himyar “the
                    dusky,” a name denoting African origin, and each adorned with the reiterated
                    surname of “Tobba,” a word of African etymology, and signifying “powerful,” are
                    said to have reigned, with a few dynastic interruptions and palace revolutions,
                    for about 2500 years; dining which long period they commanded the direct
                    obedience of the entire southern half of the peninsula; while, by their
                    tribute-collectors, and by chiefs of kindred or delegated authority, they
                    indirectly governed the northern. One of these monarchs is asserted, though
                    historical criticism will hardly admit the assertion for fact, to have subdued
                    the whole of central Asia, and even to have reached the boundaries of China;
                    while another anticipated, so runs the story, the later and more authentic
                    conquests of his race on the north African continent. In both these cases Arab
                    chroniclers seem to have appropriated for their own rulers, not without some
                    additional exaggerations, the glories and exploits of the Egyptian kings. But
                    that theirs was a vigorous and in some respects a civilised government, is
                    attested alike by the literary and architectural relics of their time. Their
                    sovereignty was at last overthrown, 529 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> by an
                    Abyssinian invasion, and was re-established 603 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    as a dependency of the Persian empire, till in the year 634 it was finally
                    absorbed by Mahometan conquest</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the kingdom of Yemen came the subsidiary monarchy of Hira,
                    or, more correctly, Heerah, situated in the northeasterly province of Arabian
                    Irak. Its kings, a collateral branch of the royal race of Sanaa, governed the
                    western shore of the lower Euphrates, from the neighbourhood of Babylon down to
                    the confines of Nejd, and along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The duration of
                    their empire, founded in the second century after Christ, was 424 years. This
                    kingdom paid an uncertain allegiance to their more powerful neighbours, the
                    Persian despots; and from time to time exercised considerable influence over the
                    turbulent tribes of Central Arabia, till, like Yemen, it sank before the rising
                    fortunes of Mahomet and his followers.</p>
                <p>A third monarchy, that of Ghassan, lorded it on the north-west over lower Syria
                    and the Hejaz: its independence was somewhat tempered by unequal alliances with
                    the Homan, and subsequently the Byzantine empire. It was founded in the first
                    century of tho Christian era, shortly after the flood of Mareb; and its
                    duration, till subdued by the all-conquering prophet, exceeded 600 years.</p>
                <p>A fourth government, that of Kindeh, detached itself from Irak ] early in the
                    fifth century, and united under its sceptre the tribes of ] northerly Nejd and
                    even those of Oman, for about 160 years. Its kings were, like those before
                    mentioned, of Yemenite origin; but their rule was weak and disturbed by frequent
                    wars.</p>
                <p>Much has been written by Arab authors regarding the great inundation, as they
                    term it, of Arem or Mareb, possibly a tropical cyclone of more than ordinary
                    destructiveness, like that of 1867 in the West Indies; and this event they love
                    to assignas the proximate cause which dispersed the families of Yemen over
                    northern Arabia, and led to the foundation of the kingdoms of Irak and Ghassan.

                <p>This is however, certain, that the Yemenite Arabs, and especially those who
                    tenanted the south of the peninsula, had during the period now cursorily
                    sketched, attained a very fair degree of civilisation · that arts and commerce
                    flourished, that wealth was accumu-late⅛ literature cultivated, and talent held
                    in esteem. On all these points we have not only the uncertain and distorted
                    testimony of foreign authors, such as Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Ptolemy, and the
                    like, but the more positive though fragmentary evidence afforded by the national
                    writings, chiefly verse, that have survived to our day. In its general character
                    and institutions the kingdom of Yemen seems to have borne a considerable
                    resemblance to the neighbouring one of the Nile valley, on the other side of the
                    Red Sea, and, like it, to have reached at a very early epoch a relatively high
                    degree of prosperity and social culture, from which, however, it had long
                    declined before its final extinction in the 7th century. But the
                    daughter-kingdom of Hira had, as was natural, something of a Persian tinge;
                    while that of Ghassan took a more Byzantine colouring. Lastly, the nomadic
                    element predominated in the ill-cemented monarchy of Kindeh.</p>
                <p>But while the sceptre of Yemen was yet, in one form or other, outstretched over
                    the length and breadth of the land, and its children, the genuine or African
                    Arabs, formed a complete and dense circle of population all around, the centre
                    of Arabia remained the stronghold of a different though kindred race, composed
                    of tribes almost wholly scenite, in their mode of living wild and ferocious;
                    less susceptible of culture, but gifted with greater energy and concentration of
                    purpose than their southern cousins. The latest recorded emigration of this
                    branch of the Arab stock had been not from the south but the north; and instead
                    of the mythical Kahtan, they claimed a no less mythical Adnan, or his supposed
                    grandson Nezar, for their ancestor; their language, though radically identical
                    with that spoken by the genuine Arabs, was yet dialectically different in
                    several respects, and nearer to the Syriac or Hebrew. Lastly, unlike the Arabs
                    of the south, they had little disposition for agriculture, and even less for
                    architecture and the fine arts; their instincts leading them to a pastoral and
                    consequently a nomade life. The almost infinite ramifications of these
                    “Mustareb” or ‘ ‘ adscititious Arab” tribes lead ultimately up to five principal
                    stocks. These were Rabeéah, which, however, laid some claim to a Yemenite
                    kinsmanship in the east centre of the peninsula; Koreysh, on the west; Keys, or
                    Keys-Eylan, and Hawazin, on the north; and Γameem in the middle.</p>
                <p>History has left unrecorded the exact date of their arrival in Arabia; nor has
                    she defined the period during which they remained tributaries, though often
                    refractory, of the kings of Yemen. But in the 5th century of the Christian era
                    there appeared among the Mustareb tribes a leader of extraordinary talent and
                    energy named Koleyb, sprung from the tribe of Rabeéah, who having, in the
                    fashion of William Tell, slain with his own hand the insolent and licentious
                    tax-gatherer sent them from Sanaa, raised the banner of general revolt in Nejd;
                    and, in the battle of Hazaz, 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> broke for ever
                    the bonds of Yemen from off the neck of the northern or scenite Arabs. This
                    done, Koleyb aspired to unite his countrymen into one vast confederacy, over
                    which he himself exercised for a time an almost kingly power; but the scheme was
                    prematurely broken off by his own assassination. Left now without a master, but
                    also without a ruler, the “Mustareb” tribes found themselves involved in a
                    series of wars that lasted during the whole of the 6th century, their heroic
                    period. Yet in spite of severe losses sustained in battie by this or that
                    particular clan, their power as a whole went on increasing, till at t⅛e dawn of
                    the 7th century they had wholly absorbed the feeble kingdom of Kindeh, and
                    encroached yearly more and more on the narrowing bounds of Yemen, Irak, and
                    Ghassan. Nor, probably, would they have stayed till they had become absolute
                    lords over the whole, or nearly the whole, of the peninsula, had there not
                    developed itself from among themselves a still more energetic element which,
                    before many years had passed, reduced both northern and southern Arabs alike to
                    common obedience, then raised them to an unexpected height of common glory, and
                    at last plunged them, along with itself, into one comprehensive decline and
                    ruin. This new and potent element was the well-known clan of Fihr or Koreysh.
                    Its families, of Mustareb descent, had at an early period, which subsequent and
                    Mahometan chroniclers have tried to identify with the fortunes of the mythical
                    Ismael, established themselves in the southerly Hejaz, near the town of Mecca, a
                    locality even then the principal religious and commercial centre of Arabia.
                    Already, at the beginning of the 5th century, the chiefs of Koreysh had, by a
                    mixture of violence and craft very characteristic of their race, rendered
                    themselves the masters and the acknowledged guardians of the sacred “Kâabeh.”
                    This square stone temple, or rather shrine, itself of unknown antiquity, was
                    situated within the precincts of the town of Mecca; and to it the Arabs were in
                    the habit of bringing yearly offerings, and of making devout pilgrimages, for
                    centuries before Mahomet had adopted it into the new ritual of Islam as the
                    house of the true God. The keys of the consecrated building had originally been
                    in possession of delegates appointed by the monarch of Yemen, but the Koreysh
                    Arabs, having once obtained them, held them fast for ever after, and
                    successfully repelled every effort, both of their own pagan competitors and of
                    the invading Christian Abyssinians, 570 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> to
                    recapture or to seize them. Their possession of the temple-keys not only gave
                    the tribe of Koreysh a semi-religious pre-eminence over all the other clans of
                    Arabia, but also placed at their disposal the treasures of gold, silver, jewels,
                    and other offerings accumulated by the pagan piety of ages in the temple of
                    Mecca.</p>
                <p>A more important, as also a more creditable, source of wealth to the Koreysh clan
                    was their Red Sea coast traffic, particularly with the ports of Yemen and
                    Abyssinia. Jiddah has been always the chief westerly seaport, and Mecca, which
                    is only a few leagues distant, the principal inland emporium of Arab trade; and
                    under the dominating influence of the clever and active merchants of Koreysh,
                    both places acquired special prosperity and importance.</p>
                <p>Lastly, only a day’s journey distant from Mecca, was held, in the pre-Islamitic
                    times, the great yearly fair and gathering of Okad, so called from the name of
                    the plain where it used to assemble,—a national meeting, frequented by men of
                    all conditions, from all quarters of the Arab peninsula, and lasting through the
                    entire month of Dhoo-l-kaadeh, which in pagan, as subsequently in Mahometan
                    reckoning, immediately preceded the ceremonies of the annual pilgrimage. Here
                    horse-races, athletic games, poetical recitals, and every kind of public
                    amusement, diversified the more serious commercial transactions of an open fair,
                    that, in its comprehensiveness, almost assumed the proportions of a national
                    exhibition; here, too, matters of the highest import, questions of peace and
                    war, of treaty and alliance, of justice and revenge, were habitually treated by
                    the chiefs of the northern Arabs; the “children of Mezar,” to give them their
                    favourite “Mustareb” patronymic, assembled in a sort of amphictyonie council,
                    not less ancient, but, while it lasted, much more influential throughout Arabia
                    than that of Thebes ever had been in classic Hellas. In this assembly the
                    immediate local proximity of the Koreysh chiefs, joined to their personal
                    wealth, courage, and address, assigned them a predominant position.</p>
                <p>Of their pedigree, which, as is well known, includes that of Mahomet himself, ¼
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e have a carefully—too carefully, indeed, for
                    authenticity—constructed chronicle, bringing the family tree up in due form to
                    Ishmael, the son of Abraham, of whom the Koreysh figure as the direct
                    descendants. In the same artificial annals the Yemenite or genuine Arabs appear
                    under the cousinly character of the children of Joktan, the son of Heber. On
                    these points all Mahometan annalists are equally positive and distinct; all
                    other Arab testimony equally adverse or silent. That a fable so utterly defiant
                    of reasonable chronology, and even of the common sense of history itself, should
                    have been adopted as matter of fact by Arab vanity and ignorance, is less
                    surprising than that it should have found favour in the eyes of not a few,
                    indeed of most, of our own European writers. Enough here to say that Mahometan
                    chroniclers, by adopting as irrefragrable historical authoιity the Jewish
                    records, and then retouching them here and there in accordance with their own
                    special predictions and tenets, have succeeded in concealing the truth of their
                    own national identity and story from themselves and even from others, under an
                    almost hopeless incrustation of childish fiction. A correcter version of Arab
                    history and pedigree will, so far as possible, be given towards the end of the
                    present article. To sum up, at the opening of the 7th century of our era, and
                    coincidently with the first appearance of the prophetic autocrat and destined
                    remodeller of Arabia, the overteeming ħfe and energy of the great peninsula was,
                    broadly taken, thus divided :—Foremost stood the tribe of Koreysh, with their
                    allies, a powerful confederacy composed of tribes belonging to the Mustareb or
                    northern stock, and occupying the upper half of the westerly coast and region.
                    Next in importance came the countless independent and, thus far, uncentralised
                    clans of the centre of the peninsula; they, too, mostly are of Mustareb origin,
                    though a few claimed the more ancient and aristocratic kinsmanship of Yemen; but
                    without, however, paying any allegiance to its rulers. Lastly, to the south,
                    east, and north, still existed the noble but enfeebled relics of the old
                    Yemenite kingdoms of Sanaa, Hira, and Ghassan, half-sunk into Persian or
                    Byzantine vassalage, and exerting little authority, even within their own
                    ancestral limits.</p>
                <p>But, however important to the country itself and in their ultimate results to the
                    world at large, might be the events that took place within Arabia during the
                    pre-Islamitic epoch, they had small bearing on the nations outside the
                    peninsula. The Yemenite queen of Sheba’s ambassage to Solomon, even if an
                    historical event, led at least to no historical results; and with other coeval
                    rulers and nationalities, Greek, Persian, and Macedonian, the Arabs rarely came
                    into any other contact than that of distant and desultory traffic. Nor do the
                    frontier skirmishes by which an Antigonus or a Ptolemy attempted, without
                    success, to gain a footing in Arabia, deserve more than a passing notice; and
                    Pompey him seif, victorious elsewhere, was foiled on its frontiers.</p>
                <p>At last, during the reign of Augustus, Aelius Gallus, the Roman <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n276/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0276-0257"/> prefect of Egypt, undertook a military expedition
                    against Yemen itself, with the -view of annexing that region, which report
                    enriched with immense treasures, to the Roman empire. With an army composed of
                    10,000 Roman infantry, 500 Jews, and 1000 Naba-theans, he crossed the Red Sea in
                    210 galleys, and landed at Moilah, or Leuce Come, in 25° N. lat., near the
                    modern Yambo. After some delay, the consequence of disease and disorganisation
                    among his troops, he marched southward until he reached the inland district and
                    city of Nejran, on the nearer frontier of Yemen. The town of Nejran he is said
                    to have taken by assault, as well as a few neighbouring places, probably mere
                    villages, of little note. Meanwhile a large force of Arabs had assembled to
                    oppose him, but Gallus easily defeated them, and advanced to Mareb itself, then,
                    we may suppose, the capital of Yemen. But the Roman soldiers, unaccustomed to
                    the heat of the tropical climate, and much reduced in numbers, were incapable of
                    laying siege to that town; and their general found himself thus forced to
                    retreat, and recrossed the sea to Egypt without having effected any permanent
                    settlement on the Arab side. Later attempts made by Roman governors or generals
                    under Trajan and Severus were restricted to the neighbourhood of the Syrian
                    frontier; and the ruined cities of Bosrah and Petra yet indicate the landmarks
                    of the extreme southerly limits reached by imperial dominion over Arab
                    territory.</p>
                <p>More serious, and more lasting in its consequences, was the great Abyssinian
                    invasion of Yemen in 529, when Aryat, son or lieutenant of the king of
                    Abyssinia, landed in Aden with an army of 70,000 men, to avenge his
                    co-religionists, the Christians, who had been cruelly persecuted by Dhow-Nowas,
                    king of Yemen, himself a proselyte to, and an ardent propagator of, the Jewish
                    code. The expedition was successful; Dhow-Nowas perished; Christianity was
                    proclaimed; and for seventy-six years the Ethiopian conquerors retained subject
                    to their rule the southern and ricner half of the peninsula. Their king Abraha
                    even advanced, in 569 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the year of the birth of
                    Mahomet, as far as Mecca; but beneath its walls suffered a repulse, which has
                    been magnified by the Koran and Mahometan tradition into the proportions of a
                    miracle. Persian assistance, furnished by the great Chosroes, ultimately enabled
                    the Arabs under Seyf, son of Yezen, the last direct lineal descendant of the old
                    kings of Sanaa, to liberate their territory from its dusky usurpers, 605
                    A.D.</p>
                <p>The 7th century had now commenced, and before long the wonderful successes of
                    Mahomet, or, in more correct orthography, Mohammed, 622-632 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> while they closed in one great centralising effort the era of Arab
                    progress and development within the land, opened a marvellous phase of new
                    activity and almost boundless extension without. The story of the great prophet
                    and of his book, the obstacles he encountered and overcame, his labours, his
                    reverses, his wars, his final and decisive success, belong to the separate
                    article that bears his name. Here it may suffice to state that at his death, 632
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the eleventh year of the Islamitic era of the
                    Hejrah or flight, which he himself had founded, Mahomet left the entire Arab
                    peninsula, with the sole and transient exception of the tribe of Tameem, and a
                    few Yemenite clans, who for a short while preferred the revelations of his rival
                    Moseylemah, the “false prophet” of Nejd, united under one sceptre, and in one
                    creed.</p>
                <p>After the disputes which might naturally be expected from a general election and
                    turbulent electors, and which, fomented by the ambitious and intriguing Ali,
                    nephew and son-in-law of the prophet, ran so high between the “Ansar,” or chiefs
                    of Medinah, and the “Mohajireen,” or those of Mecca, as to threaten the
                    premature disruption and extinction of the Islamitic empire, Abu-Bekr, father of
                    Ayeshah, the favourite wife of Mahomet, was chosen to be the great man’s
                    caliph,—“Khaleefah” is the Arab word— or successor. His reign lasted only two
                    years; but it sufficed for the subjugation of the rebel tribes of Ncjd and
                    Yemen, the conquest of Damascus, and the commencement of the long career of
                    victory that carried the arms, the language, and the institutions of Arabia over
                    half the old world, from the banks of the Indus to the shores of the Atlantic,
                    and from the burning sands of the mid-African desert to the green vineyards of
                    pleasant France. These events we will now pass in cursory review.</p>
                <p>Syria, distracted by long sedition and the bitter rivalry of ecclesiastical
                    sects, fell a first and comparatively easy prey to the hardy invaders. Led by
                    Khaled, the boldest and most talented among the early Mahometan generals, the
                    Arab troops occupied Bosrah, overran the region of Hauran, and advanced against
                    Damascus. The Byzantine army hurriedly sent by the Greek emperor Heraclius to
                    the relief of the besieged town, was defeated with tremendous slaughter on the
                    plains of Lznadin, where fifty thousand men are said to have fallen on the
                    Christian side alone; and Khaled, following up his victory, instantly invested
                    the capital of southern Syria. After a seventy days’ siege, and in spite of the
                    brave defence made by the Christian garrison under the leadership of Thomas the
                    patrician, son-in-law of the emperor himself, Damascus was taken, half by storm,
                    half by capitulation, on the 3d of August, 634 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>

                    centuries has remained ever since, not only a Mahometan, but an Arab city.</p>
                <p>Heraclius, who, unaware at first of the importance of the crisis, had hitherto
                    remained almost inactive in Antioch, his north-Syrian residence and capital,
                    now, roused to exertion, collected an army of 80,000 men, the greater number of
                    whom, reinforced by 20,000 auxiliaries from among the Ghassanide Arabs, were led
                    at first by the emperor himself, then by Manuel, a tried Byzantine general, to
                    meet the ever-advancing Mahometans. These last, under the standard of Khaled,
                    had already added Homs or Emesa, Baalbec or Heliopolis, and Hama, the Hamath of
                    Scripture, to their list of conquests. They now fell back on a strong position
                    behind the windings of the Yermook or Hieromax, a small stream issuing from the
                    southern slopes of Mount Hermon, which now bears the name of Jebel-esh-Sheykh.
                    The battle, in which Manuel took the offensive, Khaled the defensive part, raged
                    for several days, and ended in the total defeat of the Greeks, 636 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> who are said to have lost upwards of 100,000 men,
                    including Manuel himself, while at least 5000 of the victors remained on the
                    field. Syria was now open to the Arabs; and Jerusalem, which, with the difficult
                    and mountainous district of south-eastern Palestine, had hitherto been prudently
                    neglected by Mahometan strategy,; capitulated, 637 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> to the caliph Omar, who, apprehensive lest Khaled, if left to
                    himself in Syria, should establish a semi-independent principality of his own,
                    came thither in person to receive the keys of the holy city. Aleppo, and Antioch
                    itself, soon followed last the sea-coast, with Jaffa, Beyrout, Tripoli, and its
                    many other towns and ports, was overrun; and within six years from the death of
                    Mahomet the entire Syrian region, from Mount Taurus to the Red Sea, had become
                    what, so far as language and usages are concerned, it has never since ceased to
                    be, an Arab province. Within a short time after, Mesopotamia underwent the same
                    fate; and the conquests of Tarsus and Diar-Bekr brought the Arabs in immediate
                    contact with the uplands of Armenia and Koordistan, which for all succeeding
                    times remained the ultimate limits of their permanent occupation.</p>
                <p>With so much fighting on their hands to the west of the Euphrates, the Arab
                    conquerors had for awhile refrained from attacking the great Persian empire to
                    the east of that river, except by a few desultory and for the most part
                    unsuccessful raids. Nor did the battle of Hira, in which the Arab armies under
                    Jereer destroyed a large body of Persian troops, and avenged the previous losses
                    of their countrymen, more than restore the apparent balance between the two
                    empires. But Yezdegird, the last <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Persian monarchs,
                    rashly provoked the extreme chances of a decisive war by sending his best
                    general, Rustum, across the Euphrates with an army of 120,000 men, to offer
                    battle to the Arabs, then commanded by Saad, a native of Yemen, in the open
                    plains of Kadeseeyah or Cufa, not far from the site of ancient Babylon. After
                    four days’ hard fighting, the Persians gave way, having lost the greater number
                    of their men, besides the imperial standard, once the apron, so tradition said,
                    of an Ispahan patriot blacksmith, and for many ages the palladium of Iran. T he
                    Arab general, profiting by the utter discomfiture of his opponents, crossed the
                    Euphrates and the Tigris, took possession, almost without resistance, of the
                    royal capital of Medain or Ctesiphon, where spoils of immense value were found,
                    and pushed on to the more ancient metropolis of Susa, in Chusistan. But the
                    completion of the work of conquest was reserved to his successor in the field,
                    Nooman Ebn-Mekran, who in the battle of Maha vend, 641 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> near Ecbatana or Hamadan, destroyed the last hopes of Persian
                    independence. Yezdegird fled, to fall soon after by the hand of an obscure
                    assassin; and his daughter, earned away captive, was taken in marriage by Hasan,
                    the son of Ali—an ill-omened marriage, that, by its dower of Persian pretensions
                    and sympathies, contributed not a little to the disunion and subsequent downfall
                    of the Arab empire. The whole of Persia, from the Caspian and the Euphrates to
                    the Indian Ocean, now received the religion and the rule, though not the
                    language, of Arabia; Khorasan, Kerman, Mekran, Seistan, and Balkh, were next
                    subdued, and for a while the Oxus became the eastern limit of Arab dominion.
                    Thus before a century had elapsed the entire region west of the Indus obeyed the
                    Arab and Mahometan caliph of Damascus.</p>
                <p>Westerly the first Arab conquest was Egypt. This important acquisition was made
                    by Aτnroo, a man alike distinguished as a general and a statesman, during the
                    reign of the caliph Omar. Farmah, or Pelusium, the easterly key of Egypt, was
                    first reduced, and the conquerors, proceeding inland, assured their
                    communications with Arabia and the Red Sea by the occupation of the Delta and
                    Cairo. Thence, after much hard fighting, they reached and invested the city of
                    Alexandria, and a fourteen months siege was rewarded by the capitulation of that
                    city, December 22, 640 A.D. No further resistance was offered; the Coptic
                    population gladly exchanged the polished but heavy Greek yoke for the barbarous
                    but lighter rule of the Arabs; and Egypt, like Syria, has remained socially,
                    though not politically, a dependency of Arabia to the present day. The
                    subjugation of northern Africa, including Tripoli, Carthage, Tangier, and the
                    entire coast from the Nile to the Atlantic, occupied sixty years more; but in

                    the well-known message of the traitor, Count Julian, that brought on the
                    invasion of Spain. At the order of Musa, his lieutenant, lank, crossed the
                    straits which yet bear his name, 711 A.D.; and soon after disembarking in
                    Andalusia, met and defeated the armies oi Spain in the decisive battle of Xeres,
                    where Roderick, last ot the Gothic kings, lost his crown and life. Tarik, 16,000
                    of whose soldiers are said to have remained on the field, requested and received
                    fresh troops, with which he speedily reduced Malaga, Granada, Cordova, Seville,
                    and finally the Spanish capital, Toledo, itself. Musa now followed in person,
                    took the command somewhat abruptly from his lieutenant, received the submission
                    of Saragossa and Barcelona, reached the Pyrenees, and reduced the whole of Spam,
                    Galicia excepted, to an Arab dependency. His own recall and disgrace, the result
                    of court intrigue and royal ingratitude, stayed awhile the further spread of the
                    Arab torrent.</p>
                <p>But in 731 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the celebrated Mahometan general,
                    Abd-er-Rahman, at the head of a numerous army, crossed the Pyrenees, and by the
                    victories, or rather massacres, of Arles and Bordeaux, reduced the whole of
                    France south of the Loire. But at Tours he met the main French army, commanded
                    by Charles Martel, mayor of the palace, and founder of the Carlovingian dynasty.
                    Here, in a bloody battle of seven days, the tide was turned. Abd-eτ-Rahman
                    himself fell, and his troops were dispersed, and fled, never to return. Not long
                    after, 759 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> Pepin, son of Charles, delivered
                    France from the lingering vestiges of Mahometan rule. Spain, however, remained
                    for more than five centuries an Arab settlement; and her language, literature,
                    and usages bear even yet the imprint of those who ιτιled her so long. Sicily
                    too, Candia, Rhodes, Cyprus, Malta, Sardinia, and even Corsica, with other
                    islands of less note in the Mediterranean, became each in turn, though none for
                    long, Arab possessions. In Asia Minor, on the contrary, on the shores of the
                    Black Sea, and east of Samarkand, the Arab invaders, in spite of brave and
                    reiterated attempts, two of which, 670 and 717 A.D., were directed against
                    Constantinople itself, were never able to make good their footing. But at the
                    close of the Benoo-Omeyyah dynasty, 755 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> their
                    empire comprised the whole basin of the Mediterranean, with the exception of its
                    northern side; in Africa its only limits were the great central desert, in Asia
                    the plateau of Kobi and the Indus, and throughout almost all these regions the
                    Arab element either remained absolutely predominant down to our own time, or has
                    at least left distinct traces of its existence.</p>
                <p>We must now give a brief glance at the internal condition and institutions of
                    this vast empire, which were such as to afford from the very first no favourable
                    omen of political stability. Mahomet, when dying, not only omitted to name a
                    successor, but, worse still, designated no electors; and through all the
                    centuries of Arab rule the conditions both of elective and of hereditary right
                    were never accurately defined. Hence the early rivalries, already alluded to,
                    between the “Ansar” and the “Mohajireen;” and hence, not long after, the yet
                    more dangerous contention between the family of Omeyyah, from which 0thman, the
                    third Mahometan caliph, descended, and the kindred house of Hashim, the more
                    immediate relatives of the prophet. Meanwhile, within the ranks of Hashim,
                    itself, Ali, nephew of Mahomet, and husband of Fatimah, his only daughter,
                    denying every right of free election, advanced his own special title to the
                    throne by the presumed claim of nearness of blood, a title persistently urged by
                    his descendants, and for centuries a constant source of dissension and weakness
                    in the empire. Nor, whilst the nomination of the caliph himself, the centre and
                    keystone of the Arab political edifice, was thus left undefined, were the
                    remaining details of the construction at all préciser in their character. No
                    accurate line of demarcation separated the executive from the judicial, or these
                    again from the financial department; no municipal organisations were established
                    or even acknowledged; absolute despotism was the only form of government,
                    whether primary or delegated, in the capital as in the provinces; actual
                    resistance and revolt the only remedies against its abuse. Such an empire might
                    conquer, but could not govern, at least for long.</p>
                <p>These inherent evils manifested themselves by their unmistakeable bad effects
                    from the very first. Once only, when Abu-Bekr died, 634 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> after only two years of reign, the elective accession of Omar, the
                    austerest, but also the most capable of all the early Arab rulers, was
                    sanctioned by an almost unanimous approval; though even then the restless
                    intrigues of the ambitious and unprincipled Ali made themselves manifest. After
                    a glorious reign of ten years, the conqueror of Syria, Persia, and Egypt,
                    perished, 644 A.D., assassinated by a Persian slave, Firooz by name; and Othman,
                    son of Affan, of the noble family of Abd-esh-Shems, was elected in his place.
                    The twelve years of his administration were ceaselessly disturbed bv the
                    insubordination of Ali and his partisans, who at last, impatient of delay, broke
                    into the residence of the ancient caliph at Medinah, and murdered him there, 656
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">A.d.</hi> Stained with blood, Ali usurped the throne; while
                    Aye-shah, daughter of Abu-Bekr, and widow of the prophet, collected round her
                    the avengers of the blood of Othman, and the first civil war of Islam was
                    inaugurated by a hard-fought battle, known as the “Day of the Camel,” near
                    Bosrah, 656 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Ayeshah was defeated; but the cause
                    of Othman was soon after taken up by his talented kinsman, Muawwiyah, governor
                    of Syria, who in tho battle, or rather series of battles, fought near Sofeyn, on
                    the upper Euphrates, 658-9 A.D., broke the strength of Ali’s faction. Driven
                    from Syria, Egypt, and Arabia, Ali retired to Cufa, where an assassin’s dagger
                    avenged on his own person the crime by which he had opened the way to ill-gotten
                    and precarious power, 660 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>Muawwiyah, left by his rival’s death sole though not undisputed
                    emeer-el-moomeneen, or “ruler of the faithful, fixed his seat of government at
                    Damascus, where he and the fourteen succeeding princes of his line ruled for
                    eighty-nine years. Victorious abroad, his dynasty, generally called by European
                    authors the “Ommiade,” from the name of Omeyyah, father of the race, was for its
                    first forty years harassed by frequent insurrections within the limits of the
                    empire. The initial disturbances from which all that succeeded directly or
                    indirectly took rise, were due to the intrigues of the two sons of Ali, Hasan
                    and Hoseyn, both of whom were deeply imbued with Persian superstition, and who
                    thereby soon gave the schism that they headed a religious as well as a political
                    character.</p>
                <p>After the death of the lazy and contemptible Hasan, his younger and more active
                    but equally faithless brother Hoseyn, raised the standard of revolt in the
                    eastern provinces, where he hoped to gather round him his Persian auxiliaries;
                    but before he could draw his followers to a head he was met at Kerbela, on the
                    Euphrates, by the well-organised troops of the caliph Yezeed, son of Muawwiyah,
                    and perished miserably, 680 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His descendants and
                    kinsmen, for there were many, continued, however, now one of them, now another,
                    to revive the pretensions of their family; and for more than a century they
                    disquieted the empire, especially on its eastern and southern frontiers, with
                    sedition and rebellion. At last their evident defection from orthodox belief,
                    joined to the extravagance and licentiousness both of their teaching and
                    practice, so disgusted the Arab race that scarcely any adherents were left them,
                    except among the Moorish tribes of northern Africa, where their influence,
                    founded on the strangest impostures, predominated for a time, and. in the still
                    more congenial soil of Persia. There indeed the sect obtained a permanent
                    footing and ultimate supremacy. Thus originated and thus was perpetuated the
                    first and widest spread of Mahometan schisms; the adherents of the legitimate
                    caliphate and the orthodox doctrine assuming the name of “Soon-nees” or
                    “Traditionalists,” while the sectaries of Ali are known as “Sheéah” or
                    “Separatists” to this day. .</p>
                <p>More formidable, however, to the Damascus princes, though sooner extinguished,
                    was the revolt of Abd-Allah, son of Zobeyr, a brave but narrow-minded leader,
                    and nearly connected by blood with Mahomet himself. Supported by the townsmen of
                    Mecca and Medinah, besides a great proportion of the northern or “Mustareb”
                    tribes, he was for more than ten years acknowledged as caliph by half the Arab
                    world, till slain by Hajjaj Ebn-Yousef, the greatest of the Syrian generals,

                    but afterwards his rival, and head of the “Khowarij” or “seceders,” maintained a
                    separate revolt on his own account in Cufa, till slain in battle by Musâab, son
                    of Zobeyr, brother of Abd-Allah. The “Khowarij,” however—brave and well-meaning
                    though visionary men, some of whom were nothing else than over-zealous Mahometan
                    priests or reformera; others, sectaries of Ali and his family; others, again,
                    free-thinkers of republican tendency—found a new and successful leader in the
                    courageous Shebeeb, a native of Hasa, who for several years maintained their
                    cause on the upper Euphrates, while the revolt of a large portion of the Ommiade
                    army itself, in the extreme east of the empire, where the caliph’s own general,
                    Abd-er-Rahman, headed the insubordination, shook the empire to its foundations.
                    But over these and other enemies triumphed the military and administrative skill
                    of Hejjaj; and it was only under him, the scourge of rebels, and pillar of the
                    Ommiade caliphs, 705 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> that anything like real
                    internal tranquillity was even for a brief period given to the empire.</p>
                <p>Half hereditary, half elective, the family of Omeyyah numbered fifteen successive
                    princes on the throne, mostly men of talent, able administrators, and some of
                    them distinguished authors and poets. But their personal merits were unavailing
                    against the downward progress of disorganisation, the necessaιy result of an
                    essentially defective system of government, and rapid territorial extension out
                    of all proportion with the means of consolidation; and the latter years of their
                    dynasty present a melancholy scene of turbulence and confusion. Then appeared a
                    new enemy, more dangerous than any of the preceding, to the Damascus sceptre, in
                    the person of Ibrahim, great-grandson of Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet, who
                    after long and secret intrigues, now gave himself out as the acknowledged <pb

                    hereditary enemies of the no less noble family of Abd-esh-Shems and Omeyyah, and
                    consequently the legitimate claimant of sovereign power. His cause was upheld by
                    the terrible Abu-Muslim, a gloomy but talented fanatic, native of Khorassan, who
                    raised on Ibrahim’s behalf the standard of revolt in Kerman. Soon Persia and its
                    adjoining provinces, despairing of findin" to themselves a worthy leader among
                    the frivolous descendants of Ali, joined the kindred ranks of the children of
                    Abbas. Ibrahim, indeed, perished; but his younger brother, Abd Allah Abu-Abbas,
                    more known in history as “Es Saffah,” or “the Bloodshedder,” took his place, and
                    was proclaimed caliph everywhere to the west of the Euphrates. Syria, Arabia,
                    and Egypt still held out for Merwan, the last of the Ommiade caliphs; but the
                    great military talents, stained by remorseless cruelty, of Abu-Muslim, turned
                    the scale. The decisive battle was fought on the banks of the river Zab, near
                    Irbeel (the <hi rend="italic">Arbela</hi> of classic history), 749 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and the whole of Syria was soon after overrun by the
                    black-turbaned aιτnies of Persia. Merwan himself, after much unavailing display
                    of personal courage, fled to Damascus, and thence to Egypt, where he was
                    overtaken and killed by his pursuers, 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>Urged on by the pitiless Abu-Muslim, who shortly after himself fell a victim to
                    the suspicions of his own equally cruel but more treacherous master, the
                    victorious Saffah sought out everywhere the members, however remote, of the
                    Omeyyah family, and put them to death under circumstances of the most infamous
                    barbarity. The very tombs of the dead were broken open, and the bones of the
                    great Muawwiyah and his noble successors dispersed. One youth of the doomed
                    house alone, Abd-er-Rahman byname, effected his escape to the still friendly
                    provinces of Africa, and thence to Spain, where he founded the illustrious
                    dynasty that reigned in Cordova over the Iberian peninsula for two centuries and
                    a half.</p>
                <p>But with the fall of the Benoo-Omeyyah dynasty and the caliphate of Damascus fell
                    the prosperity of Arabia herself, never again to rise. Arabs of the noblest,
                    wealthiest, and most gifted stock, descendants of the princely Abd-Shems, the
                    head of Koreysh in pre-Islamitic times, the Ommiade princes had established the
                    centre of their government in a city intimately connected by land and by sea, by
                    commerce and by nationality, with Arabia proper and the Hejaz, and in steady
                    adherence alike to the feelings and policy of their race, they always regarded
                    their native country as the choicest jewel in their own imperial crown. They
                    were Arabs first and caliphs afterwards. Hence it was from Arabia that they drew
                    almost exclusively the officials of their world-wide administration, both for
                    peace and war; the provincial governors, generals, collectors, judges,
                    administrators of their nomination were all, or nearly all, of Arab blood; and
                    the improvement or enrichment of Arabia herself, the facilitation and extension
                    of Arab trade and commerce, and the encouragement of Arab talent, literary and
                    artistic, were the foremost of their cares. Meanwhile the peninsula, obedient
                    indeed to the caliph as to its supreme head, but retaining in great measure the
                    local institutions of its hereditary government by chiefs and in tribes, enjoyed
                    a degree of general tranquillity, and even of comparative unity, that it had
                    never realised before, nor has ever since. Even the hereditary rivalry between
                    the northern or “Mustareb” Arabs, who about this time assumed the title, which
                    they still bear, of ‘ ‘ Keysee,”—a title derived from the numerous and
                    influential stock of “Keys-Eylan,” and thence communicated to the rest—and the
                    southern or “Yemenee” Arabs, a rivalry founded in diversity of race, fostered by
                    long and bloody wars, and continued, though under certain modifications, to our
                    own time, might, and often indeed did disquiet, but could not overthrow, the
                    beneficial order of prevailing tranquillity.</p>
                <p>With the accession, however, of the Abbaside caliphs, 750 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> the good days of Arabia came to an end. Though they also were, like
                    their Ommiade predecessors, Arabs by origin, and indeed of the purest Arab
                    blood, they owed their place on the throne, not to Arab partisans, but to the
                    influence and the aπns of the anti-Arab and eastern provinces, Persian, Tatar,
                    and Turkoman, beyond the Tigris; whilst the Arab half of the empire had almost
                    unanimously declared for their supplanted rivals. Hence the Abbaside policy
                    rested on a non-Arab base; and its representatives, although descendants of
                    Koreysh and Hashim, systematically neglected or even depressed the Arab element
                    of their rule, while they strengthened and elevated the Irano-Turanian or
                    central Asiatic. Their throne, at first transferred from Damascus to
                    Hashimeeyah, the newly-founded residence of Abd-Allah Es Saffah, on the
                    Euphrates, was soon after removed further east to the banks of the Tigris. Here,
                    close to the ruins of the old Persian capital of Madain, the second Abbaside
                    caliph, Almansur, laid, 760 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the foundations of
                    that great city which, under the Persian name of Baghdad, still remains a
                    monument of his personal energy and of the policy of his race.</p>
                <p>Within its walls, surrounded by Persian ministers or slaves, amongst whom the
                    family of Barmek has attained a tragical celebrity, and by an armed body of
                    Turkish or Turkoman guards, at first their servants, but before long their
                    masters the descendants of Abbas held for a century the substance, and for four
                    centuries more the shadow of a sceptre. Some of their names, and that of
                    Haroon-el-Rasheed, 768 to 809 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in particular, are
                    connected with great events and famous memories, but the records of their reigns
                    belong to .Perso-Asiatic rather than to Arab history. Indeed, from the death of
                    the eighth caliph of the race, El-Mosta-sim, 842 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    to the accession of the last of their dynasty, El-Mostasim, 1242 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> these princes were mere puppets in the hands of the
                    Persian, Koord, Turkoman, or Turkish mercenaries, by whom they surrounded
                    themselves as a protection against their own Arab subjects. Meanwhile province
                    after province separated itself from their empire, and reasserted its own native
                    character and independence, till in 1258 A.D. the pagan and Tatar chief Holagoo,
                    grandson of Genghis-Khan, stormed Bagdad, and extinguished the decrepit dynasty
                    of Abbas in the blood of the last caliph. Yet Arab genius, though deprived of
                    political support, maintained by its philosophical and literary vigour through
                    all those dreary centuries, nor has even in our own time wholly lost, a certain
                    intellectual ascendancy in Baghdad and its vicinity.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the Arabian peninsula itself, neglected or despoiled by the Abbaside
                    caliphs, had sunk year by year more deeply into clannish disorganisation, till
                    the revolt of the Karmathians, about the end of the 10th and the beginning of
                    the 11th century, detached Arabia definitely from the overgrown empire that she
                    herself had founded. This revolt had been long preparing. Hatred of centralised
                    rule, a strong attachment to local, tribal, and even in some places
                    semi-municipal organisation, both joined to a deep underlying scepticism, had
                    from the very first originated and fostered throughout Arabia a wide-spread,
                    though covert opposition to the establishment of Islamitic despotism, and
                    jealousy of the predominance conferred by Mahomet and his successors on their
                    kinsmen of the northern and western tribes, and on Koreysh in particular, had
                    united in secret antagonism to Islam and the caliphate the other tribes of the
                    peninsula, but especially those of the centre, east, and south. Hence the
                    Karmathian outbreak soon took the form of an Arab reaction against foreign and
                    uncongenial influences and institutions, and being such, could hardly fail of
                    substantial success. As to the special tenets professed by the Karmathians—so
                    called from Karmath, their mystic founder, circ. 890 A.D.—they were, in their
                    ultimate expression, pantheistic in theory and socialist in practice.</p>
                <p>From the sea-coast provinces of Bahreyn and Katar, its first avowed centre, the
                    uprising, headed by its terrible leader Suleyman Abu-Jahir, spread rapidly over
                    the rest of Arabia; and in the year 929 of our era Mecca itself was stormed, and
                    the Kâabeh ruined by his troops, while the sacred black stone itself was carried
                    off to Hasa, where it remained twelve years. The feeble attempts of the Abbaside
                    caliphs to check the movement proved utterly ineffectual; all was confusion, and
                    for two centuries more a bloody partisan war, or rather an ever-recurring series
                    of petty wars, devastated the peninsula. When this at last gave place to the
                    quiet, not of peace but of exhaustion, Arabia, from Syria to Aden, was, with the
                    sole exception of the narrow Hejaz coast-strip, detached in fact as in name from
                    the pseudo-Arab empire of Baghdad, and had returned to its primitive
                    independence. But by the same process the land had relapsed, hopelessly this
                    time, into the semi-barbarism that invariably follows a prolonged vicissitude of
                    petty tyrants, vicinal wars, interrupted communications, waste of life and
                    property, and the fatal insecurity of universal lawlessness. Ease, wealth,
                    trade, science, literature, all had perished from Arabia, till after a long
                    anarchy, of which little memory is preserved, and that little of less interest,
                    the country subdivided itself into · the provincial sections that, with slight
                    modifications, it has retained ever since. Oman, with the adjoining regions of
                    Katar and Hasa, was organised into a semi-elective monarchy of a limited
                    character, under the leadership of the Nebhan and subsequently of the Yâarebah
                    clan; while its rulers, in opposition to the orthodox head of Islam at Baghdad
                    or elsewhere, assumed the half spiritual title of Imam, and have since retained
                    it. Yemen, the wealthiest and most populous territory of Arabia, split up into
                    an infinity of petty provinces, governed each by a distinct prince, while some
                    one or other would from time to time assert a transient sovereignty over the
                    rest. The barbarous districts of Mahrah and Hadramaut on the south-east, with
                    the mountain fastnesses of Nejd and Shomer, were abandoned to the anarchy of
                    clannish alliances or feuds. The Hejaz alone, with the sacred territory or Haram
                    of Mecca, under the headship of the “shereefs” or “nobles,” the lineal
                    descendants of Koreysh, retained some kind of constituted authority connected
                    with the outer world, and paid a respectful but distant allegiance, sometimes to
                    the government of Baghdad, more often to that of Egypt.</p>
                <p>For, on the ruins of the Aghlabite dynasty, founded by Ibrahim Ebn-Aglab, the
                    general of Haroon-el-Rasheed in North Africa, 797 A.D., with the inland city of
                    tbo Keyrawan for capital, there had arisen, 909 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    a new kingdom, that oftheFatimites, so designated from one Obeyd-Allah, its
                    originator, a real or pretended descendant of Ali and Fatimah. These Fatimites,
                    able but tyrannical mvstics, having united under their rulo the whole of the
                    north <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"

                    their caliph, hav-i∏o ’ 972-3 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> driven the
                    Abbasιde governor from the shores of the Nile, established his own throne in the
                    city of Cairo, which his victorious general Jowher had founded the year
                    previous. From this capital he and his descendants ruled for two centuries more,
                    not only over Egypt, lower and upper, but, though at the price of frequent wars,
                    over Syria to the east and Tripoli to the west, till the last of the Fatimite
                    caliphs, Adhid-Billah, was, 1171 A.D., dethroned by the Koordish conqueror
                    Salah-ed-Deen, better known in history and romance as Saladin, the chivalrous
                    opponent of our own Richard I. But though no Arab prince has ever since reigned
                    in Egypt, the Hejaz with its sacred cities remained annexed to that country, and
                    Yemen in part followed suit.</p>
                <p>At last, 1517 A.D., the Turkish sultan, Selim I., conquered Egypt, and obtained
                    from the last real or supposed surviving Abba-sise kinsmen of the prophet a
                    formal investiture of the Mahometan caliphate, which thus definitely changed the
                    character of that office from national to politico-religious. On this occasion
                    the shereef of Mecca presented the sultan with the keys of the city; and the
                    Arab tribes in general, those of the east excepted, proffered their allegiance
                    to the Ottoman government. This subjection, real in Hejaz and Yemen, nominal
                    elsewhere, the country continued for half a century, till the shereef Muttahir,
                    impatient of a foreign yoke, attacked and routed the Turkish force of
                    occupation, then commanded by Murad Pasha, and for a short time re-established
                    Arab independence. Selim II. sent fresh troops, who at first gained some
                    advantages over the Arabs; but in 1630 the Yemenite chief Khasim expelled the
                    Turks from the whole of his native province, and restored a shadow of the old
                    Himyarite throne at Sanaa. Here, 1761 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the
                    celebrated Danish traveller, Niebuhr, found the Imam, as he was styled, of
                    Yemen, governing thirty provinces, six on the coast and twenty-four inland,
                    besides several smaller states; and possessed of an income, chiefly derived from
                    the custom-dues of Loheya, Mokha, and other seaports, equalling, it was thought,
                    £1,000,000 sterling per annum. The standing army was reekoned at 5000 men,
                    mostly infantry. Subsequently, Wahhabee encroachments on the north, the British
                    occupation of Aden to the south, and Egyptian invasion under Mehemet Ali and his
                    successors, considerably weakened the power of the Imam of Sanaa, till in 1871 a
                    Turkish army, sent from Syria, took the capital, and put an end to the Arab
                    dynasty of Khasim. At the present date Yemen is a province of the Ottoman
                    empire, though with every prospect of not long remaining so.</p>
                <p>Between the Hejaz and the Ottoman government the yearly pilgrimage, with the
                    accompanying largesses of the Ottoman sultans, formed a more enduring link; one
                    interrupted, indeed, from time to time by occasional rebellions, but as often
                    renewed by Arab neediness, till the province, with its sacred cities, was
                    definitely annexed, though only for a time, by the great Egyptian usurper
                    Mehemet Ali.</p>
                <p>But in the rest of the peninsula, in Nejd, Oman, Mahrah, Had-ramaut, and the
                    other adjoining districts, the Ottoman claims were from the beginning of the 17
                    th century absolutely ignored, and no collision was possible, because no point
                    of contact existed. This state of things was, however, at last modified by the
                    Wahhabee movement, one of the most important in the history of Arabia, and the
                    end of which we have not yet seen. Of this a brief account must now be
                    given.</p>
                <p>Bom at the town of Horeymelah, in the centre of Nejd, 1691 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> Abd-el-Wahhab, or the “Servant of the Bountiful,” had in early life
                    travelled far in Mesopotamia and Syria, report even adds India, seeking
                    knowledge in observation and the conversation of the learned, to whom his own
                    superior intelligence gave him recommendation everywhere. Returning in mature
                    life to the secluded quiet of his native land, he gave himself up to thought and
                    study, mostly theological. Convinced by the comparison between what he read and
                    what he had seen in his travels, and continued to see around him in Nejd itself,
                    where hardly a vestige of Mahometanism remained, that the primitive faith of
                    Islam had become considerably corrupted in theory and totally so in practice,
                    and that Turks, Persians, and Arabs, were all of them in fact, though after
                    different fashions, no longer true Muslims, but mere idolaters and polytheists,
                    he determined himself to inaugurate a reform that should reassert the doctrine
                    and practice of the Koran as they had been at the beginning.</p>
                <p>The invocation of saints, including Mahomet himself, a practice borrowed by
                    Mahometanism from foreign example; the honours paid at the shrines and tombs of
                    the dead; the use of intoxicating liquors; the wearing of silk and gold—to sum
                    up, every belief or practice directly or indirectly condemned by the Koran, or
                    even not sanctioned by it—with all these Abd-el-Wahhab declared open war. His
                    special and notorious prohibition of tobacco, a prohibition rigorously observed
                    by his followers, and which subsequently became in a manner their distinctive
                    badge, must be attributed to an excess of sectarian puritanism; nor can it be
                    doubted that hatred of foreigners, and of the Turks in particular, had a large
                    share in the zeal manifested by himself and his disciples for what they, not
                    altogether wrongly, considered as in a peculiar sense the national or Arab
                    religion; it was a view that had the sanction of the Koran itself.</p>
                <p>Like Mahomet, Abd-el-Wahhab commenced his preaching when about forty years of
                    age, and, like the prophet, soon drew down on himself the persecution of those
                    he failed to convert. Driven from Eyaneh, where he had established himself, by
                    the hostility of its chiefs, themselves stirred up to persecution of the
                    rigorous doctrines by the far-sighted Arav, governor of the neighbouring
                    province of Hasa, he found refuge with the sheykh Mohammed Ebn Saood, the
                    warlike chief of Dereyceyah, who put his sword and that of his clan at the
                    disposal of the new apostle. The reform thus supported soon extended itself,
                    partly by persuasion, partly by force; and when Abd-el-Wahhab died in 1787, at
                    the advanced age of ninety-six, he had already seen his doctrines dominant from
                    the coast of Bahreyn to the confines of Mokha and Aden.</p>
                <p>His disciple and patron, Ebn Sâood, after many victories gained over the governor
                    of Hasa and other enemies or rivals, died in 1765, leaving the whole of Nejd,
                    now consolidated into one government under one head, to his son and successor
                    Abd-el-Aziz, who, on his accession, now assumed the titles of Imam and Sultan.
                    Under this chief the important provinces of Abu-Areesh, south of Mecca, and of
                    Nejran, on the frontier of Yemen, were added to tho Wahhabee dominions. These
                    conquests, or rather annexations, naturally enough excited the alarm of Ghalib,
                    the shereef or governor of Mecca, who by his representations succeeded in at
                    last awakening the long negligent Turks to the danger which threatened their
                    frontiers from the national and religious union of the Arab race. Orders were
                    issued from Constantinople, and in 1797 an army of 5000 Turks, with an equal
                    number of allied Arabs, advanced into Hasa, which had already become Wahhabee
                    territory, and laid siege to Hofhoof, the capital of the province. But harassed
                    by the Wahhabees and fearful of risking a general engagement, they retired
                    without having effected anything except to provoke the bitter resentment of an
                    enemy who had now learned not only to hate but to despise them. The consequence
                    was that the Wahhabees before long took the initiative; and in 1801 their
                    collected armies invaded the territory of Baghdad, and laid siege to Kerbela, a
                    locality famous for the tomb of Hoseyn the martyr, son of Ali, and a centre of
                    popular Mahometan superstition. The town was stormed, the inhabitants massacred,
                    and spoils of immense value were transferred from its shrines to the Wahhabee
                    treasury. Victorious on the east, the Wahhabee arms were next directed westward;
                    Taif, the well-known pleasure-ground of Mecca, was invaded and subdued with
                    great bloodshed in 1802; and in the April of the following year Mecca itself,
                    though not till after a brave resistance, came into Wahhabee possession. Ghaleb
                    fled to Jiddeh, the only place in Hejaz that held out against the invaders; and
                    Sâood, son of Abd-el-Aziz formally assumed the government of Mecca, whence he
                    dictated to the Porte the terms on which alone he declared that he would
                    henceforth permit the observances of the yearly pilgrimage from all parts of the
                    Mahometan world. Shortly afterwards he succeeded in person to the Wahhabee
                    imamate, his father having been assassinated by a Persian in the mosque at
                    Deréyeeyah.</p>
                <p>Under Sâood the Nejdee kingdom attained its greatest extension and prosperity.
                    Internally its government was such as that of Arabia had been under the first
                    caliphs and their 0mmiade successors,—namely, a despotism regulated by the
                    prescriptions of the Koran; and the revenues at Sâood’s disposal fluctuated
                    between £200,000 and £300,000 yearly. This sum he expended chiefly for military
                    purposes. In 1804 he conquered Medinah, plundering the rich offerings
                    accumulated by the superstition of ages round the prophet’s tomb, besides
                    treating the inhabitants of the town with great severity.</p>
                <p>From this date till 1811, open war, in which the Wahhabees were generally
                    successful, was waged between them and all their neighbours on every side, but
                    especially against the Turks, whose Synan possessions were ravaged sometimes by
                    Sâood’s best general Abu-Noktah, sometimes by his gigantic negro lieutenant
                    Hark, up to Anah on the Euphrates, and within sight of the walls of Damascus. At
                    this time, too, the inhabitants of Bahreyn and the adjoining coast having
                    embraced Wahhabee doctrines, combined them with profitable piracy on the Persian
                    Gulf, till the British expeditions sent from Bombay in 1810 and 1819 broke up
                    the robber nest of Ras-el-Kheymah, and set bounds to the insolence of the
                    piratical zealots.</p>
                <p>For during these events the customary pilgrimage of Mecca and Medinah had been
                    interrupted, the Wahhabees allowing none but such as conformed to their own
                    doctrines and habits to approach the sacred cities. Thus the whole extra-Arabian
                    Mahometan world was roused to indignation against the new and exclusive reform;
                    and the Ottoman Porte, after some futile efforts of its own, consented to
                    entrust the chastisement of the Arabs to its doubtful and already over-powerful
                    Egyptian vassal, Mehemet Ali.</p>
                <p>In 1811 this cruel and treacherous but highly talented man began the work, and,
                    in spite of many difficulties and even reverses, never faltered in it till it
                    was fully accomplished. The details of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0280-0261"/> the campaign that reduced Arabia, though only for
                    a few years, to an Egyptian province, being well known, a very summary mention
                    may here suffice.</p>
                <p>Tousoon Beg, son of Mehemet Ali, commanded the first expedition. It was directed
                    against the northern Hejaz, and landed in 1811 at Yembo, which town the Turks
                    took and made a base of further operations. A severe check inflicted on them by
                    the Arabs in January 1812 retarded their advance, but by the end of the year
                    Tousoon stormed Medinah, and his troops made a frightful massacre of the
                    Wahhabee garrison and inhabitants; to which atrocity the treacherous murder of
                    1500 more, who after holding out long and bravely in the town castle, had
                    surrendered on terms of safe-conduct, was soon added. Meantime the intrigues of
                    Mehemet Ali detached the shereef Ghaleb from the Wahhabee cause; and Jiddeh was
                    treacherously surrendered to the Turks in 1813. Mecca and the Taif district were
                    immediately occupied by Ottoman troops. Mehemet Ali now came over in person; and
                    his troops having been reinforced by those of his son Tousoon, he felt himself
                    strong enough to break his promises to the sheykh Ghaleb, whom he arrested,
                    dispossessed of power, and sent to die in exile.</p>
                <p>For a year and a half Mehemet Ali remained at Mecca, collecting his forces for a
                    decisive blow. Meanwhile, in 1814 Sâood had died, leaving as successor his son
                    Abd-Allah, a chief equal to his father in every respect except prudence, in
                    which he was unfortunately deficient. Mehemet Ali having completed his
                    preparations, left Mecca early in 1815 with a large army, and advanced towards
                    Yemen; while the Wahhabees, who are said to have been 30,000 strong, occupied
                    the mountain pass of Bishâ on the way, and rashly hazarded a general engagement.
                    The battle, in which Mehemet Ali displayed much personal courage, was desperate,
                    and ended in the utter discomfiture of the Arabs, several thousands of whom were
                    killed on the field. Mehemet Ali followed up his victory, and in a few months
                    had reduced the entire mountainous district north of Yemen, besides taking alive
                    as prisoners Bakrooj and Tami, two of the most renowned Wahhabee chiefs, both of
                    whom, in violation of his promises, he made be put to death with atrocious
                    tortures. But the exhaustion of his own soldiers obliged him to relinquish his
                    further march south; he returned to Mecca, and in the summer to Egypt; Tousoon
                    Pasha, left to conduct the war, concluded peace with the Wahhabees, and shortly
                    after himself died of the plague. The treaty he had signed was disavowed both at
                    Cairo and Constantinople; and in September 1816 the celebrated Ibrahim Pasha,
                    adopted son of Mehemet Ali, landed at Yembo, and commenced the final campaign.
                    For more than a year he exercised his troops in frequent but well-timed and
                    generally successful skirmishes with those of Abd-Allah, who in person commanded
                    the Wahhabee armies; while his crafty diplomacy, equal to that of Mehemet Ali
                    himself, won over tribe after tribe to the Egyptian cause. Well supplied with
                    provisions, and his flanks covered by his Arab allies, Ibrahim, in spite of a
                    severe repulse beneath the walls of El-Rass, subdued the entire province of
                    Kaseem, entered Nejd on the northwest by the pass of Shakrah, and in April 1818
                    appeared beneath the walls of the capital, Deréyeeyah, on which Abd-Allah with
                    his forces had retreated.</p>
                <p>The siege lasted five months, and was conducted with great ability by Ibrahim,
                    whose military skill at last triumphed over the determined courage of the
                    garrison and inhabitants. Not, however, till the town had been gradually reduced
                    to a confusion of ruinous heaps did Abd-Allah consent to surrender, and then
                    only on honourable terms, which, as usual, the conqueror granted freely, but
                    with no intention of observing. The Wahhabee chief was sent under strong guard
                    to Egypt, and thence to Constantinople, where, December 19th, 1818, ho was
                    beheaded in the public square in front of St Sophia.</p>
                <p>Deréyeeyah was razed to the ground by the conqueror, and remains at this day,
                    like Eyaneh, a formless heap. The provinces of Hareek and Hasa submitted after
                    slight resistance; and the whole of Arabia, Oman excepted, now lay at the mercy
                    of Ibrahim, who showed none. After a bloody series of executions and massacres,
                    he placed garrisons in all the strongholds that he permitted to remain standing;
                    and Arabia had to submit to the military conscriptions and other exactions and
                    oppressions that have ruined, and still ruin, every other province of the
                    Ottoman empire, aggravated in this case by the licentiousness of the conquerors
                    and the long outstanding mutual hatred of Turk and Arab.</p>
                <p>Ibrahim returning to Egypt, left Khaleel Pasha as vice-regent of Arabia, who for
                    a while maintained despotic rule over the country. But Turkee, the younger son
                    of Abd-Allah, who on the downfall of his family had fled to the mountainous
                    fastnesses of Toweyk, soon organised guerilla bands, that, aided by the
                    peasants, succeeded in rendering the central and eastern provinces of the land
                    untenable by the Turks. The inhabitants of Hareek and Hasa were the first to
                    throw off the yoke; and the town of Riad, celebrated as the birthplace, 1400
                    years before, of the prophet Museylemah, now became the restored Wahhabee
                    capital. Turkee, like so many other Arab rulers, fell the victim of an assassin,
                    but his son Feysul succeeded to his ability as well as to hi« popularity and
                    power. The Egyptian government, by this time at open war with the Ottoman, made
                    several unavailing attempts to put down the revolt; but the wars between Mehemet
                    AH and the Porte in Syria and Anatolia diverted its serious attention from the
                    less important, because poorer, acquisitions made by Ibrahim in Arabia, till in
                    1842 Khoorshid Pasha, the last representative of Egyptian rule, was, partly by
                    force, partly by craft, for Feysul was a master in both, compelled to quit his
                    frontier residence in Kaseem; and this populous province was re-annexed to the
                    Wahhabee empire, while Aseer, throwing off foreign rule, returned to Wahhabeeism
                    and independence.</p>
                <p>Hasa, Hareek, the whole of Nejd, Kaseem, and the provinces adjoining Yemen on the
                    north, with Aseer, were now re-united under the sceptre of Feysul, and a broad
                    belt of Wahhabee rule thus again stretched across the centre of the peninsula,
                    from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. But over Bahreyn, Oman, and Yemen, the
                    Wahhabees, though they have frequently attempted it, have never been able to
                    re-establish their former dominion; and in Shomer and Jowf to the north, between
                    Nejd and Syria, a new kingdom of a different and much more liberal character,
                    that of the brave and clever Telal, sprung up, and has since maintained its
                    independence. Nor have the often-repeated Wahhabee inroads on Mecca and the
                    Hejaz been attended with their former success. Still, within its actual though
                    narrowed limits, the ΛVahhabee government has remained we <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> l-organised and strong,—a constant menace to its neighbours, and a
                    genuine specimen, nor a wholly unfavourable one, of Arab autoι omy. But in 1870,
                    Feysul, already aged and blind, was assassinated, as his father had been before
                    him, and the dissensions of his two sons, Abd-Allah and Sâood, the former of
                    whom advanced the rights of first-bcm, the latter those of popularity to the
                    throne, led to a civil war, and gave occasion to Ottoman interference. An armed
                    force was sent, and advanced along the shore of the Persian Gulf into the
                    province of Hasa, where it occupied the capital, Hofhoof. With this, however,
                    its success terminated, and the difficulties of crossing the “Dahnà” desert
                    strip seem likely to place an effectual barrier to any further progress. Aseer,
                    however, a stronghold of Wahhabeeism, has been invaded by the Turks, who have
                    gained there some temporary and superficial advantages, while the new kingdom of
                    Shomer, weakened by the untimely death of its accomplished prince Telal, has
                    also offered facilities for Turkish interference, though not of a military
                    description.</p>
                <p>To these varied changes the kingdom of Oman has for many generations remained in
                    great measure a stranger. But its capital, Mascat, was occupied by the
                    Portuguese in 1508, who retained it till the middle of the 17th century. It was
                    then retaken by the Yâarebah princes, who had all along maintained their power
                    in the interior, and now for a century more became the sole though not the
                    undisputed rulers of Oman, which was at this time often harassed by Persian
                    invasion. In 1737 the country was formally attacked by the armies of Nadir Shah;
                    the principal towns were at last taken, the inhabitants massacred, and for four
                    years Oman groaned under the Persian tyranny. A deliverer, however, appeared in
                    the person of Ahmed Ebn-Sâood, of Yemenite drigin, but not of ths reigning
                    family. By a series of daring deeds he succeeded in expelling or destroying the
                    enemies of his country, and was in return elected Imam in the year 1741, since
                    which time his family have occupied the throne of Oman. Under the Imam Sultan
                    Sâood and his son the Seyyid Sâood, the 0manee kingdom attained its greatest
                    splendour at the beginning of the present century. Its power then extended not
                    only over Oman and a large tract of the Arabian mainland, but also over Bahreyn,
                    Ormuz, Larej, Kishm, and the other islands of the Persian Gulf; besides the
                    coast of Katar, with its celebrated pearl fisheries, on the Arab side, that of
                    Barr-Faris, with the harbours of Linja and Bander Abbas, on the Persian, and a
                    long strip of African sea-shore, south of Cape Guardefui, with the islands of
                    Socotra and Zanzibar. Sultan Sâood was killed in 1804, but his son, of the same
                    name, proved his not unworthy successor; and though unable to prevent
                    considerable encroachments of the Nejdee Wahhabees on the north and west of his
                    dominions, saved Oman itself from conquest and annexation. He consolidated the
                    Arab power in Zanzibar and the east African coast; and when he died in 1856,
                    after reigning fifty-two years, he left the kingdom of Oman the most flourishing
                    state in the entire Arabian peninsula. Its proximity to India has often mvolved
                    this government in relations, sometimes amicable, sometimes hostile, with
                    ourselves; but a detail of them need not detain us here. Suffico it to say, that
                    on the death of Sultan Sâood, Zanzibar was, partly by British influence,
                    detached from the Arab empire; while the death of the late Imam, Thoweynee, son
                    of Sâood, who. perished, assassinated by his own son, in 1866, inaugurated a
                    period of civil wars, from which Oman is still suffering. Her Wahhabee
                    neighbours, too, continue their restless attempts at encroachment on her western
                    frontier, while Katar and Bahreyn, with their pearl fisheries, have been wholly
                    lost to the Muscat sceptre.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the Hejaz is at the present date absolutely under the Turkish government,
                    while Aden has, ever since its first capture in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n281/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0281-0262"/> 1839 remained a British possession. Thus Nejd
                    itself, vιth the inland districts immediately adjoining, and the desolate coast
                    districts of Mahrah and Hadramaut, are now the only parts of the peninsula where
                    Arab independence can be said fully to maintain itself· though with this
                    difference, that in the last-named provinces it is merely the independence of
                    barbarism and poverty, while in the former it is that of organisation and not
                    contemptible resources. Nor can it be well doubted that the recent encroachments
                    of the Ottoman government, or rather misgovernment, will prove equally ephemeral
                    with those of Sultan Selim or Mehemet Ali, and that Arabia will in a short
                    time,.probably within a few years, regain its previous autonomy. Arab
                    institutions are far from perfect, yet they are better than Ottoman oppression,
                    and the Wahhabee empire might easily, under a judicious head, relax from its
                    intolerance and become a centre, not of strength only, but of order, prosperity,
                    and even civilisation, for the whole Arab nation, restoring, not, indeed, for
                    external conquests, the days of which have long gone by, but for internal
                    wellbeing, the better times of the Ommiade dynasty.</p>
                <p>Arabia proper is singularly destitute of antiquities, in the ordinary sense of
                    the word, the northern or “Adscititious” Arabs having been, so long as they
                    remained within their own territory, a remarkably unconstructive race, and the
                    “pure” or southern Arabs not much better in this respect. Niebuhr, in his justly
                    celebrated Travels through Yemen, mentions the ruins of Ghamdan, the ancient
                    palace of the Himyarite kings, near Sanaâ, as well as the remains of several
                    other fortresses in adjoining villages; but these ruins, like those subsequently
                    visited by Palgrave in Jowf, bore no distinctive traces of architecture or date,
                    beyond a barbaric coarseness of material and great thickness of wall. More
                    remarkable, because better defined in history, are the remains of the great dyke
                    of Mareb already mentioned: its vestiges, said to be colossal in their
                    dimensions, extend across a ravine of about 2 furlongs in breadth; they are in
                    part of hewn stone, and testify, if not to the skill, at least to the diligence
                    of the Himyarite Arabs. A few Himyaritic inscriptions have been discovered, some
                    in Yemen, more in the provinces of Hadramaut and Mahrah, but have been too
                    carelessly copied to afford proper materials for philological investigation.
                    When decipherable, they indicate a dialect resembling the Abyssinian or Amharic;
                    but throw no real light on the history of the country or the condition of its
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>It is true that in addition to the non-constructive character of the early Arab
                    race, account must be taken of the destructive policy, aggravated by
                    iconoclastic zeal, pursued by the conquering Mahometan tribes of the north, who
                    within their own territory, even more than in the acquired lands of Egypt, North
                    Africa, and elsewhere, carried out the plan of establishing their own religion
                    and system, not merely on the ruins, but, so far as possible, on the effacement
                    of whatever had preceded it. Hence, of the old idol temples which once covered
                    Arabia, nothing now remains except the megalithic vestiges of an enormous stone
                    circle, resembling those found in some parts of Europe, and consisting of large
                    boulders, each about 14 feet high, placed on end, and originally crowned by a
                    similar horizontal series. This was visited by Palgrave when travelling in the
                    province of Kaseem, near Bereydah; two others are reported to exist in the same
                    district. Nor, the Meccan relics apart, had any of the numerous idols once
                    worshipped throughout the peninsula been discovered till the Swiss Munzinger,
                    three years since, found among the heaps of a deserted village near Aden a small
                    bronze statue representing a naked hermaphrodite figure, over the head of which
                    rises an ornament resembling the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">pshent.</hi></p>
                <p>The black stone of the Meccan Kâabeh, said to be of volcanic formation, and
                    perhaps an aerolite, had, however, been an object of popular adoration long
                    before Mahomet preserved it from destruction by giving it a place in a new and
                    more enduring superstition; and the Kâabeh itself, though ruined and rebuilt
                    again and again, the last time in 1627, till not a vestige probably of the
                    original structure now remains, has yet, it appears, certainly preserved the
                    outline, and, in all essential respects, the dimensions of the original pagan
                    shrine. It is an oblong massive structure, almost a trapezium, though the sides
                    and angles are slightly unequal; its length 18 paces, its breadth 14, and its
                    height from 35 to 40 feet. There are no windows, and the only entrance door is
                    placed 7 feet above the ground; the entire building is of large, irregular, and
                    unpolished blocks of ordinary stone. Its ornamentation is wholly modern.</p>
                <p>Lastly, several wells, jotted with seeming capriciousness over the desert, are
                    said to be, and probably are, of great antiquity; certainly they are works which
                    much exceed the skill of the Arabs of our own day. One such, “Beer Shekeef” by
                    name, in the north-west of the peninsula, presents a cylinder of about 5 feet in
                    diameter at top, but gradually enlarging till it reaches the water at a depth of
                    nearly 200 feet, and is lined with hewn stone throughout. The Arabs declare it
                    to be a work of pre-Islamitic times. Less remarkable in its proportions, but not
                    less ancient, is the holy well called of Zemzem, at Mecca. But this and the
                    great mosque of that city, as also the famous mosque of Medinah, which encloses
                    the tomb of the prophet, and other buildings of the same category, will find
                    their proper place in other articles. So will also the celebrated excavations of
                    Petra, which, besides their being beyond the limits of Arabia proper, are not in
                    themselves Arab but Graeco-Roman in their character. With regard to the numerous
                    mosques and other buildings, some of great beauty, erected by Arab architects in
                    conquered countries, as in Syria, Egypt, Africa, or Spain, they are in fact
                    nothing more than adaptations of the various local styles, and often of the very
                    materials that the conquerors found ready to their hand.</p>
                <p>But if poor in architectural, Arabia is superabundantly rich in literary
                    monuments. Passing over as of more than doubtful authenticity the verses
                    ascribed to kings and heroes of Yemen, especially at dates of a thousand years
                    or more before the Christian era, we find undeniable specimens, at least two
                    full centuries before Mahomet, of poems which in vigour and polish yield to few
                    ever composed in the Arab or in any other language. To give at length the names
                    and stories of the authors, many of them men, and even women, no less
                    distinguished in their day by the sword than by the pen, would be, in a brief
                    review like this, merely to note a dry and unmeaning catalogue. Suffice it that,
                    even at this early date, we find the metrical and rhythmical laws, simple yet
                    susceptible of the highest art, which have ever since regulated Arab poetry,
                    already laid down in their completeness, and exemplified, the former by a
                    scansion of almost Ξoratian elegance and variety, the latter by a severe nicety
                    that Pope himself might have admired, but could hardly have imitated. Divided
                    into sixteen classes, each class including several variations, the metres are
                    based, like the Greek and Roman, on long and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0282-0263"/> i&gt;lιort vowels, irrespective of accent, but
                    admitting caesura, elision, and every prosodiacal delicacy. Some are adapted to
                    gay, some to serious topics: love, war, description, moral precepts,
                    philosophical speculation, elegy, satire—all find here their appropriate
                    expression. The rhyme, which often involves not one but two syllables, is in
                    every piece determined by that of the opening line. Alternate rhymes, choruses,
                    and accentuated instead of quantitative metre, did not appear till later, and
                    were imitated from extraArab models.</p>
                <p>Yearly, at the festival of Okad, the best masters of the art used to meet for the
                    purpose of reciting their compositions, and receiving the reward, not of
                    applause only, but also of more tangible advantages. Eulogies of chiefs, rulers,
                    and distinguished men, formed a considerable portion of the poetry of those
                    days; and a single ode or “kaseedah,” as it was called, has been known to be
                    rewarded, according to the means or liberality of the person eulogised, with a
                    hundred valuable camels, or several thousand gold pieces. Love and war had also
                    their inevitable share in the domain of verse, and descriptions of manner and
                    scenery occur, though rarely in comparison. Lastly, elegies—some of them very
                    touching in their deep and tender melancholy —and didactic pieces, chiefly
                    ethical, take rank among the most carefully finished productions of the early
                    Arab muse. Meanwhile, the greater number of poets had each his special patron,
                    whose generosity took charge of the remuneration that in our days is looked for
                    from the press; while a greater degree of publicity was given to a few chosen
                    works of genius by the custom of suspending in some place of common resort (the
                    Kâabeh, it is asserted) such pieces as in the yearly gatherings of Okad had
                    obtained the highest palm of acknowledged excellence. Seven of these, known in
                    Arab literature by the title of the <hi rend="italic">Mιiallakat</hi> or
                    “Suspended,” as being emphatically the best of their kind, and all of them
                    belonging to the 6th century, have become for succeeding ages the accepted and
                    classical standards of Arab poetical composition.</p>
                <p>Written prose up to the date of Mahomet’s appearance there was absolutely none;
                    and spoken eloquence, though always highly esteemed and diligently cultivated
                    among the Arabs, had never been embodied in the permanence of writing. The
                    irregular, half-rhythmical, half-rhyming sentences of the Koran were the first
                    attempt in the direction of prose, which afterwards came into general use, and
                    was applied to history, biography, philosophical treatises, romance, and every
                    other description of subject. But prose never emancipated itself wholly from its
                    original trammels of a misapplied cadence, to which was also too often added a
                    redundant phraseology, the latter partly due to Persian literary influence; this
                    florid style being, however, with many authors varied by breaks, as it were, of
                    writing as excessive in its plainness as the other in its ornamentation.</p>
                <p>But if unsuccessful in prose, the Arabs were not so in poetry. This, even before
                    the era of the prophet, had, as we have seen, attained no ordinary degree of
                    excellence; and it reached its highest point during the following century, under
                    the Ommiade dynasty, when Omar Ebn Rabeeyah, of the tribe of Koreysh; Jameel, of
                    the Benoo Adhrah; Jareer and Farazdak, both of Tameem; and Noseyyeb, a negro by
                    birth—the first and second masters of erotic, the third and fourth of satirical,
                    and the fifth of descriptive poetry—with a cloud of lesser celebrities, lived
                    and sang in the sunshine of the Damascene court. The 8th and 9th centuries,
                    agitated by civil dissensions or oppressed by the tyranny of the Abbasides, were
                    less favourable to the Muses, till the reaction of the Greek and Persian minds,
                    with which the Arab spirit was now yearly brought into more intimate contact,
                    gave rise to a new and brilliant school, less true to the simplicity of nature
                    or the purity of Arab diction, but richer in imagery and deeper in philosophic
                    thought, illustrating, too, the transition from the objective to the subjective
                    which has accompanied and half veiled decline in the literature of every nation,
                    turn after turn. Abu-Teman, of the tribe of Tai, known not as a poet only, but
                    also as a critic and the compiler of the celebrated anthology, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hamasa,</hi> the “Golden Treasury” of the Arabs, first came
                    forward in this field. His successor, the well-known Mutenebhe, is still
                    esteemed by many the greatest of Arab poets; in range of thought and polish of
                    diction he certainly excels all besides. Later still, in the 11th century,
                    appeared Toghrai, who in his <hi rend="italic">Lameyyalι,</hi> the title of his
                    principal piece, entered the lists against Shanfarah, the most brilliant of
                    pre-Islamitic poets, and, it seems, furnished our own Tennyson with the model of
                    his “Locksley Hall while a little later, Ebn Faridh, in Egypt, composed the
                    mystico-erotic volume that has never in its kind been surpassed, or even
                    equalled, by the poets of any land.</p>
                <p>With the decline of the Arab race, however, their muse 1 drooped also, and for
                    many centuries maintained but a <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> languishing
                    existence, which in our own time has been galvanised rather than invigorated
                    into a kind of revival by the modern literary schools of Beyrout, Damascus,
                    Baghdad, and the Hejaz. In Nejd, Yemen, and Oman, rough poems on the primitive
                    Arab model, besides others modulated with alternate rhymes, and in which accent
                    takes the place of prosody, a species commonly called “Nabtee” or Naba-thean
                    verse, are yet in vogue. The Hispano-Arab poets, mostly mere imitators, and in
                    bad taste too, need not detain us here. Epic and dramatic poetry were never even
                    attempted by the Arabs.</p>
                <p>Romance, analogous though not similar to the European novel, was always a
                    favourite branch of Arab literature; and in the <hi rend="italic">Thousand and
                    One Nights</hi> it obtained a worldwide celebrity and success. The original of
                    this entertaining work appears to have been composed in Baghdad about the IIth
                    century; another less popular but very spirited version is probably of Tunisian
                    authorship, and somewhat later in date. The stories of Antarah, of the Benoo
                    Hilal, of Mohalhel, of Barakat, and countless others, belong to the same class
                    of writings, though cast in more of a biographical form, not unlike that adopted
                    by the great Defoe. Strictly objective in character, the Arab novel, though
                    often a vivid portraiture of the outside of men and customs, has never
                    portrayed, or attempted to portray, the inner workings of the human mind.</p>
                <p>With memoirs, biographies, collections of anecdotes, and the Eke, Arab literature
                    is stored in excess, the bulk of such works being, as might be supposed, of
                    somewhat superficial interest; while not a few of them are, on the contrary,
                    possessed of great merit, and value. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Songs,</hi> or “Kitab el Aghanee," composed in the latter part of the 10th
                    century by Abu-Faraj, of Ispahan, and containing, in twenty successive volumes,
                    short but entertaining notices of all the principal Arab poets or singers, with
                    specimens of their compositions, is, in addition to its speciality, a perfect
                    treasure of the most varied information regarding the men and the times; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of Mahomet,</hi> by Abul-Feda, of Aleppo, displays
                    considerable critical acumen as well as narrative power. Nor should we forget
                    the judiciously-selected biographies of Mahometan celebrities by Ebn Khallikan,
                    in the 12th century, or those of Koteybah of an earlier date; but of such
                    compositions as these the Arab name is legion.</p>
                <p>History, however, proved from first to last an effort 1 beyond Arab skill, which
                    contented itself with the less intellectual task of multiplying chronicles to an
                    almost unparalleled amount. In this the voluminous work of Ebn <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n283/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0283-0264"/> Atheer, which, after commencing the Arab annals,
                    along with those of the world from the creation itself, carries them down to the
                    overthrow of the Abbaside caliphate in the 13th century; that of Musa’oodee,
                    containing a pre-Islamitic summary of the geography and history of the world in
                    general, till the birth of Mahomet, after which the chronicle confines itself
                    exclusively to the fortunes of the Arab empire; and that of Abul-Feda,
                    especially interesting by its curious notices of pagan Arabia, may be mentioned
                    as favourable specimens in their line. In particular, Egypt was amply chronicled
                    by Makreezee and Siyootee; Spain by Makkaree; Africa by Ebn Kateeb; Syria and
                    Baghdad by writers out of number. A more voluminous, and, it must be added, a
                    more childish collection of writings could scarcely be found in any
                    language.</p>
                <p>We may imagine (for it would be a waste of time to catalogue) the theological
                    writings, glossaries, commentaries, discourses, and so forth, which, from the
                    first century of Mahometanism to the extinction of Arab empire, have illustrated
                    or obscured the great book on which that empire was founded—the Koran. Beydawee
                    in the 10th, Jelal-ed-deen and Bokharee in the 11 th, and El Ghazalee in the
                    12th century of our era, each was in his day considered a master in Islam, and
                    their treatises are still reverentially studied in its schools. Legal
                    dissertations by Malek, Ebn Hanbal, Shafeyee, Hanefee, and their disciples, load
                    the shelves of every Arab bookcase; but the authors themselves were mostly of
                    extra-Arab origin, and often reflect the Persian, the Turkoman, and even the
                    Byzantine, rather than the genuine Arab mind.</p>
                <p>From the fancies of astrology, in which the early Arabs —not wiser than their
                    neighbours, but favoured with clearer skies—seem to have indulged freely, and
                    which, though discountenanced by the practical good sense of Mahomet himself,
                    have never been wholly abandoned by their descendants, a not unnatural
                    transition led to the more useful study of astronomy. Specially patronised by
                    the Abbaside caliph Al-Mamun, the Augustus of his race (813-833 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> this science made great and rapid progress. The
                    obliquity of the ecliptic, the diameter of the earth, and even the precession of
                    the equinoxes, were then calculated with commendable accuracy; and shortly
                    after, Abul-Mezar ’ s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astronomy</hi> and his
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Conjunction of the Planets,</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements</hi> of Al-Furjanee (though this last author was largely
                    indebted to the Egyptian labours of Ptolemy), proved that the caliph’s
                    liberality had been well bestowed. But Al-Batinee, a native of Syria (879-920
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> surpassed all his predecessors in the nicety
                    alike of his observations and computations. Geber, at Seville, constructed (1196
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the first astronomical observatory on record;
                    and Ebn-Korrah in Egypt proved by his example that the Arabs could be even
                    better astronomers than the Greeks had been before them. Yet although the
                    doctrine of attraction seems to have been dimly surmised by some of them, none
                    ever succeeded in emancipating themselves from the clumsy and erroneous
                    Ptolemaic geocentric system.</p>
                <p>In mathematics the Arabs based themselves on what they had acquired from the
                    Greek and Indian originals; the former gave them geometry, the latter algebra.
                    Satisfied at first with translations of Euclid, Apollonius, and others, they
                    ultimately left their masters behind. They reached in the 10th century the
                    limits of spherical trigonometry, and solved quadratic and even cubic equations.
                    In these studies the astronomers Geber and Ebn-Moosa chiefly distinguished
                    themselves. Optics, too, and hydrostatics were investigated by the professors of
                    Baghdad; but no special progress or remarkable discoveries are recorded as
                    having been made in these sciences. In mixed as well as in pure mathematics the
                    leading-strings of the Greek became the fetters of the Arab mind. Their
                    practical application, however, of hydraulics in the construction of wells,
                    waterworks, reservoirs, sluices, canals, and the like, does them great credit;
                    and of this peculiar skill ample traces, ill maintained by succeeding
                    governments, remain in Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia.</p>
                <p>Debarred by religious scruples from the representation of animated forms in
                    sculpture or painting, Arab decorators (for they are no more) found themselves
                    restricted to vegetable or fantastic patterns and colour combinations, and in
                    these, as the Spanish Alhambra and other buildings can testify, showed
                    themselves no mean proficients. They made great use of glazed tiles and stucco,
                    and possessed the art—one that they have lost long ago—of staining glass.
                    Lastly, music, as the handmaid and enhancer of poetry, was a favourite and
                    honoured pursuit among the Arabs, who, with comparatively rough instruments,—the
                    rudiments of the flute, harp, tabor, and guitar, rather than the instruments
                    themselves,—and with a scale, carefully and scientifically elaborated, but
                    essentially differing from our own, produced results that real excellence alone
                    could have merited or obtained. The voluminous “Book of Songs” already alluded
                    to contained the history and points out the distinctive characteristics of a
                    hundred airs, each esteemed a masterpiece by competent judges. For one alone its
                    composer received from the Caliph Al-Nathik Billah (842 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi>) a sum equivalent to nearly £2300 sterling. It is noticeable that
                    though the best voices were furnished by the Hejaz, the instrumental and
                    scientific part was perfected by Persian instruction under the Abbaside caliphs
                    of Baghdad.</p>
                <p>More widely recognised, however, are the Arab claims to proficiency in medicine,
                    an art which Mahomet himself appears to have dabbled in, showing himself, if
                    tradition speaks true, by no means so good a physician as he was a preacher.
                    Under the caliphs, however, regular schools of the therapeutic science were
                    established in Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo, where the works of Hippocrates and
                    Galen, translated from their originals in Greek, were adopted as the basis of
                    instruction. Hence the great medical treatise entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >El-Melekei,</hi> or “The Royal,” of Ali-Ebn-Abbas, which appeared in Aleppo
                    towards the end of the tenth century, was essentially an enlargement of and
                    appendix to the Galenic teaching. Shortly after Er-Razi, the Baghdad professor,
                    published his writings on pathology, containing the first authentic description
                    of exanthematous diseases. The <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi> of Ebn-Sina,
                    commonly known as Avicenna, born 980 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> with his
                    <hi rend="italic">Materia</hi><hi rend="italic">Medica,</hi> which preluded in
                    some respects that of Paracelsus, ultimately, however, superseded every other
                    work in the Arab schools. But the neglect of anatomical study, with a
                    superstitious horror of the practice of dissection, rendered the surgery of the
                    Arabs imperfect and their medicine empirical. The invention of the probang and
                    some improvements in the lancet and the couching needle are due, nevertheless,
                    to Arab surgeons.</p>
                <p>Botany was chiefly studied as subsidiary to medicine; nor did chemistry ever
                    attain the dignity of a separate science; as, however, an adjunct to the old
                    herbal pharmacopoeia, it received close and not unsuccessful attention. The
                    principal mercurial and arsenical preparations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >materia</hi><hi rend="italic">medica,</hi> the sulphates of several metals, the
                    properties of acids and alkalies, the distillation of alcohol,—in fine, whatever
                    resources chemistry availed itself of up to a very recent date—were, with their
                    practical application, known to Er-Razi and Geber, already mentioned. In fact,
                    the numerous terms borrowed from the Arabic language— alcohol, for instance,
                    alkali, alembic, and others—with the signs of drugs and the like, still in use
                    among modem apothecaries, have remained to show how deeply this science is
                    indebted to Arab research.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n284/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0284-0265"/>
                <p>Finally, and as though to counteract any foreign influence that the cultivation
                    of these exotic sciences might correlatively introduce, Arab grammar and
                    rhetoric were, from the days of the first Ommiade to those of the last Abbaside
                    caliph, considered an indispensable item of respectable education. Every nicety
                    of the language was investigated in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries by the
                    rival schools of Cufa and Bosrah; and the <hi rend="italic">Alfeeyah,</hi> a
                    grammatical treatise of the celebrated Ebn-Maiek, a native of the latter city,
                    who flourished in the 9th century, is even now the standard work in the hand of
                    every professor. But for absolute mastership, joined with exquisite taste, in
                    the use of the subtlest refinements both of rhetoric and grammar, the palm must
                    be assigned to Hareeree, the author of the celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Makamat</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stations,</hi> a work esteemed by many as
                    hardly less wonderful in the talent it displays than the Koran itself. It
                    belongs to the 11th century, and though it has had many imitators, has never yet
                    acknowledged a rival.</p>
                <p>Industrious and enterprising, the Arabs led the way by their invention and skill
                    to most of the more complicated manufactures of our own times. In metallurgy,
                    their art in tempering and enamelling has become justly famous; nor did any
                    sword-blades ever rank higher than those of Damascus, nor any coppersmiths excel
                    those of Baghdad, or gold and silver workmanship that of Oman. Specimens of
                    their skill in porcelain yet remain in Spain and Syria; while the popular words
                    “morocco” and “cordovan” attest their cleverness in preparing and dyeing
                    leather. The pendulum and the semaphoric telegraph, if not invented, as some
                    think, by the Arabs, were certainly introduced by them into Europe, as was also
                    the manufacture of silk and of cotton, and an invention of the highest value—the
                    mariner’s compass. As early as 706 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> writing-paper
                    was made at Mecca, whence it spread through all the Arabian dominions, and
                    ultimately reached the Western world. In the discovery or use of gunpowder, so
                    far back as the 11th century, the Arab claim to priority is contested by the
                    Byzantines alone.</p>
                <p>In a word, the literature, arts, and sciences of the Arabs: formed the
                    connecting-link between the civilisations of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    ancient and modern times; and the culture which they <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> introduced into the countries they conquered has in almost every instance
                    outlasted the rule of the conquerors themselves. To them, directly and
                    indirectly, we owe the revival of learning and philosophy in Western Europe, and
                    the first awakening of the critical and inquiring spirit that has in great
                    measure rescued Europe from the lethargy of monkish ignorance and ecclesiastical
                    bigotry; to them also, at least indirectly and by deduction, are due most of the
                    useful arts and practical inventions laboriously perfected by later nations.
                    Wide-spread as was the empire of the Arab sword, it has been less extended and
                    less durable than the empire of the Arab mind. (w. o. p.)</p>
