                <p><label type="entry">APELLES</label>, the most celebrated of ancient Greek
                    painters. The date assigned to him by Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Nat. Hist.,</hi>
                    xxxv. 79) is 332 B.C., and with this agrees the fact of his having been the
                    court painter of Alexander the Great, who it was said would allow no one else to
                    paint his portrait, though, in point of fact, portraits of him by other artists
                    are known (Pliny, vii. 93 and 125 <hi rend="italic">; Horace, Epist.,</hi> ii.
                    1, 239; Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Ad Fam.,</hi> v. 12, 13). Apelles had worked
                    before then for Philip, the father of Alexander, and with a career of nearly
                    half a century, was at work after in the time of the first successors to
                    Alexander’s empire. He was bom at Colophon, where it appears his father Pytheas,
                    also a painter, resided. His first instractor was a certain Ephorus, of Ephesus,
                    which was then the centre of the Asia Minor school of painting; the rival school
                    being that of Sicyon in Greece proper, whither Apelles next proceeded,
                    apparently to undergo the stricter discipline in drawing for which that school
                    was renowned, and perhaps also, as is said (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arat.,</hi> 13), to win a share of the good fortune and fame of its
                    leaders. He was here in the neighbourhood of Corinth, and it was probably then
                    that he was taken by the beauty of the young Lais, on seeing her drawing water
                    at the fountain of Peirene. Another incident, that of his having seen the
                    notorious Phryne bathing at Eleusis, and from this conceived the design of his
                    picture of Aphrodite Anadyomene, would also fall about this time, for the two
                    reasons that Phryne’s celebrity occurred in the period before Alexander, and
                    that Apelles is not known to have made a second stay in that district of Greece.
                    From Sicyon he went to the Macedonian court, and was there employed until
                    Alexander departed on his expedition into Asia, on which the painter accompanied
                    him as far as Ephesus, where he settled. Of the intimacy between him and his
                    royal patron there are a number of stories, which, however, from the variety in
                    the telling, may be without foundation in fact. According to Pliny (xxxv. 85),
                    Alexander having betrayed ignorance by some remark about painting, was told by
                    Apelles to be silent, lest the boys who were rubbing down colours in the studio
                    might laugh at him. But the version of the same story given by Plutarch <hi
                        rend="italic">(He Adul.,</hi> 15) has, in the place of Alexander, the
                    Megabyzos, or priest of Diana at Ephesus; while in Aelian <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Var. Hist.,</hi> ii. 2) the story is told of Zeuxis, not of Apelles.
                    Again, Aelian <hi rend="italic">(Var. Hist.,</hi> ii 3) relates, that while
                    Alexander was inspecting a painting of a horse by Apelles, a horse neighed
                    towards the picture, upon which the painter remarked that the horse knew more of
                    art than the king. But Pliny (xxx. 95) instances the neighing of a horse, only
                    as having decided a competition between Apelles and some other painter. Still,
                    so far as the painter’s readiness of rebuke is concerned, these stories are
                    confirmed by other incidents, as when he told an artist, who boasted of his
                    speed in work, that the wonder was why he could not produce more of such stuff
                    in the same time; or, when having once accepted correction from a shoemaker
                    about a wrongly painted boot in one of his pictures, he declined further
                    criticism from him, with the observation which has since become a proverb, A <hi
                        rend="superscript"> τ</hi> e <hi rend="italic">supra</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >crepidam sutor judicaret</hi> (Pliny, xxxv. 84). Of an opposite kind were
                    his relations with Protogenes, the Rhodian painter, whose abilities he readily
                    recognised, and whom he brought into notice by spreading a report that he
                    intended to purchase his friend’s pictures, and sell them as his own. Finding
                    Protogenes not at home on one of his visits, Apelles, instead of leaving his
                    name, drew with a brush an exceedingly fine line on a prepared tablet.
                    Protogenes knowing the hand, and accepting the challenge, drew within the line a
                    still finer one in another colour. But Apelles returning, divided the line a
                    third time, and was confessed the victor. Though Ephesus continued to be his
                    home, Apelles worked also elsewhere, as in Smyrna, Samos, and Rhodes, but
                    principally in Cos, where he received the rights of a burgess, and where
                    probably he died. For an account of his works and style, see <hi
