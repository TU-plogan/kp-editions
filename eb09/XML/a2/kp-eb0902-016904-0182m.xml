                    height. By the Greek and Latin writers the name is generally used in the
                    singular, as <hi rend="italic">Apenninus Mons, b Απcwιvoς,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> to</hi><hi rend="italic">Aπervιvov</hi><hi rend="italic">όρος.</hi>
                    The name may have been originally applied only to a particular mountain, and
                    afterwards extended to include the whole chain.</p>
                <p>The Apennines may be considered as a southern branch of the great Alpine system
                    of Europe. Both the mountain systems have a general resemblance as regards the
                    age and lithological character of the rocks and strata which compose them.

                    the Alps. Some have placed it at the pass of Bocchetta; others at the Col di
                    Tenda; and others at the low pass which runs from Savona to Cairo. Strabo, who
                    gives a very accurate account of the general features and direction of this
                    chain, considers it as beginning in the vicinity of Genoa. From Col di Tenda the
                    Apennines run in a semicircle round the Gulf of Genoa, in a general direction
                    from west to east; they afterwards turn to the south, and traverse the whole of
                    the Italian peninsula to the Strait of Messina. The entire length of the chain
                    is about 600 miles measured in a direct line, and about 800 miles if measured
                    along the windings. The chain lies between 38° and 44° 30' N. lat., and 7° 40'
                    and 18° 20' E. long. The mountains are divided into the Northern, Central, and
                    Southern Apennines.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Northern Apennines</hi> include what are usually designated
                    the Ligurian and Tuscan Apennines. The Ligurian Apennines extend from the
                    Maritime Alps past Monte Gisa to the borders of Tuscany. The principal passes
                    here, between Piedmont and the duchy of Genoa, are through the valleys of the
                    Tanaro, the Bormida, and the Lemma. The pass of Pontremo leads up the Magra
                    Valley from Spezzia to Parma. The Tuscan Apennines extend from Monte Pellegrino
                    to Monte Cornaro, in 12° 3' E. The Alpi Appuani form an outlying mass of
                    mountains between the valley of the Magra and the Secchio. The chief passes are
                    those of Bratello, Fiumalbo, Monte Carelli or Pietra-Mala, and that proceeding
                    from the valley of the Sieve, over Borgo di San Lorenzo, through the valley of
                    the Lamone, and on towards Faenza.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Central or Roman Apennines</hi> comprehend that part of the
                    chain between Monte Cornaro, in which the Tiber rises, and Monte Velino, north
                    of Lake Fucino. Its general direction is from N.N.W. to S.S.E. or nearly
                    parallel to the Tiber. The descent towards the Adriatic is continuous and
                    direct, but towards the Mediterranean it forms two distinct inclined planes. The
                    principal passes from the north are at the village of Scheggia, where the
                    Cantiano rises; at Serra valle, south-east of Monte Pennino, at the head of the
                    valley of the Chienti; at Castellucio, between Norcia and Arquata; and the chief
                    pass of all between Rieti and the valley of the Pescara.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Southern Apennines</hi> include the remaining portion of
                    this chain. From Monte Velino they proceed in a southeasterly direction to the
                    valley of the Ofanto, which cuts through the range. South of that limit, one
                    short branch extends eastward towards Altamura, another runs westward to the
                    neighbourhood of Salerno, while the main chain is prolonged nearly due south to
                    the heights of Aspromonte overlooking the Strait of Messina. In the upper part
                    of the Southern Apennines a number of sharp pyramidical points raise themselves
                    above the mountain chain. Among these are Monte Forcone at the source of the
                    Sangro, Monte Sant’ Angelo, above the sources of the Volturno and Trigno, and
                    Monte Calvello north-east of Salerno. The principal pass over this part of the
                    Apennines is that of Sulmona, near the sources of the Volturno, so called from
                    the town of Sulmona, where the roads from Rome, Pescara, and Aquila unite. The
                    passes above Castel Franco and Ariano are the highest points of the roads over
                    the ridge, from Benevento to Troja, and from Avellino to Foggia.</p>
                <p>The geology and palaeontology of the Apennines have been fully investigated by
                    Savi, Meneghini, Pareto, Lavini, Orsini, Bianconi, Mortillet, and others. As a
                    general rule, the same formations occur here as in the Alps, and the system
                    usually consists of a central ridge having secondary and lower ridges running
                    parallel with the main range, the intervening country being formed of but
                    slightly disturbed newer Tertiary deposits. Thus, in that portion of the
                    Apennines which borders on and extends into Tuscany and Bologna, the system
                    consists of two parts. The one which is most distant from the Mediterranean
                    forms the Apennines proper; here the Eocene beds prevail, and are covered,
                    especially on the north flank, by Miocene and Pliocene beds; the axes of
                    elevation are numerous and parallel to each other, following strikes which run
                    from W.N.W. to E.S.E., and from N.W. to S.E. The other part is nearer the
                    Mediterranean, and is remarkable for its richness in metalliferous ores; the
                    rocks prevalent in it belong to the Palaeozoic and Oolitic periods, and have a
                    N.N.W. to S.S.E. strike. Between Spezzia and Cività Vecchia it is represented by
                    numerous outliers of verrucano (probably of Carboniferous age), and trias
                    surrounded by Oolitic rocks. The district of Carrara abounds in marbles
                    belonging to the Liassic and Oolitic periods. Nearly all the mountains between
                    Carrara and Monte Sagra have beds of marble, which sometimes acquire
                    considerable thickness, as for instance in the vertical escarpments of Monte
                    Corchio. The mountains between the meridians of Genoa and Parma form but one
                    chain, composed of parallel ridges striking W.N.W. to E.N.E. The strata consist
                    of Eocene formations flanked by Miocene and Pliocene beds, pierced by numerous
                    ophiolitic masses. Towards Genoa the mountains conform to the S.S.W. and N.N.E.
                    directions of the Western Alps; the rocks are of Eocene age, but are much
                    metamorphosed by the serpentines of Pegli, Voltri, and Varagine. In the Central
                    Apennines there is a large development of secondary beds from the trias to the
                    upper chalk, and of the Tertiaιy formation, which is represented by strata of
                    the Eocene, Miocene, Pliocene, and Post-Pliocene periods. The main axis of the
                    chain is chiefly formed of the Secondary rocks, while the minor ranges are
                    formed of Tertiary beds. The mountains, as a whole, rise from N. to S.,
                    culminating in Monte Corno, 9593 feethigh, beyond which their height again
                    decreases. Mount Amaro is 8960 feet, and Mount Velino 7910 feet high. The oldest
                    rock seen in this part is a dolomite; it is unfossiliferous, and acquires its
                    greatest massiveness in the mountains of Cesi, Spoleto, and Ventosa. Above it
                    follows a limestone, which is in places many hundred yards thick. Fossils are
                    rare in it as a whole, though locally abundant in a few places. The strata which
                    next succeed are ferruginous limestones and marls, abounding in Middle Liassic
                    fossils; then red limestones, yielding ammonites and other shells of the Upper
                    Lias; then a vast series of limestones, marls, and siliceous beds, which compose
                    a large part of the flanks and summits of the Apennines, and which represent the
                    Oolitic period. The hippuritic chalk is largely developed, and in places it
                    forms the mass of the Apennines, as in the Rossa Chain, and the loftj ranges of
                    the Abruzzi. Fossils are abundant in this limestone. The Upper Cretaceous beds
                    are represented by massive limestones with comparatively few fossils. Above
                    these follow a nummulitic limestone, marly schists, arenaceous macigno, &amp;c.
                    The Miocene beds are varied in their lithological nature and rich in fossils.
                    The more recent strata seldom occur at any great height above the sea.</p>
