                    lakes; but in the delta, and on the banks of the rivers, grapes and other fruits
                    of southern climates are raised. The population in 1867 was estimated at
                    573,954, comprising Russians, Tatars, Georgians, Armenians, Per sians, Hindus,
                    &lt;fcc., who engage in the rearing of horses, cattle, and sheep, and also in
                    fishing for sturgeon, which forms the principal source of the wealth of the
                    government. The vicissitudes of climate are great; with a mean annual
                    temperature of 48° Fahr., the summer averages 70°, and the winter 13° Fahr. The
                    government is divided into four districts: Astrakhan, Krasnoi-Yar, Zenotalesk,
                    and Chemyi-Var. Its capital, Astrakhan, is the only place of much
                    importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Astrakhan,</hi> the capital of the above government, is
                    situated on a small island in the Volga, about 30 miles above the influx of that
                    river into the Caspian. It is a large, rambling, wood-built city, “dusty in
                    summer, windy in autumn, frozen-up in winter, and knee-deep in mud in spring.”
                    It consists of three parts,—(1.) The <hi rend="italic">Kremlin,</hi> or citadel,
                    dating from 1550, which stands on a hill, and contains the cathedral of the
                    Assumption (1582), a spacious brick edifice of peculiar architecture, with the
                    archbishop’s palace, and the convent of the Trinity. (2.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belogorod,</hi> or white town, containing the government buildings, bazaars,
                    &lt;fcc. (3.) The <hi rend="italic">Llobodeo,</hi> or suburbs, where the bulk of
                    the population reside. Astrakhan is the seat of a Greek and of an Armenian
                    archbishop; and, besides a number of Greek and Armenian churches and convents,
                    it contains a Catholic and a Lutheran church, a Hindu temple, and several
                    mosques. Mention may also be made of a botanic garden, bazaars, a theatre, a
                    gymnasium, an ecclesiastical seminary, and several inferior schools. From its
                    favourable position the town enjoys a very considerable trade both with the
                    interior of Russia, and with India, Persia, &amp;c. Besides its importance as a
                    fishing station, it has considerable manufactures of cotton, silk, leather,
                    &lt;fcc. Living is very cheap,—£20 per annum being a fair income for the
                    maintenance of an ordinary family. This city was anciently the capital of a
                    kingdom belonging to the Tatars, who were expelled about 1554 by the Russian
                    prince, Ivan Vassilivich. In 1569 it was besieged by the Turks under Selim, but
                    they were defeated with great slaughter by the Russians. In 1670 it was seized
                    by the rebel Stenko Razin; but in 1671 he was dispossessed of it by his uncle,
                    Jacolof, who remained faithful to the Czar. In 1722, when Peter the Great
                    extended his conquests on the Caspian, Astrakhan was his headquarters. In 1702,
                    1718, and 1767, it suffered severely from conflagrations, it was plundered by
                    the Persians in 1719, and, in 1830, the cholera swept away a great portion of
                    its inhabitants. Lat. 46° 21' N., long. 47° 55' E. Population estimated at
                    50,000 or 60,000.</p>
