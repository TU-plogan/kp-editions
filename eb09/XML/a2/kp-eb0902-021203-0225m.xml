                    the public they were favoured. In those times it was believed that the arts and
                    sciences would not flourish unless such only were allowed to practise them as
                    had given proofs of reasonable proficiency and were formed into bodies
                    corporate, with certain powers of self-government and the exclusive monopoly of
                    their respective arts within certain localities.</p>
                <p>It has sometimes been supposed that these mediaeval corporations were confined to
                    such occupations as are now followed by artisans. This, however, is a mistake.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">universitas</hi> is the correct Latin name for any
                    corporation whatsoever; and in mediaeval parlance it was just as proper to speak
                    of the university of smiths or tailors, as of the university of Paris or Oxford.
                    It is, indeed, very probable that, at the dawn of returning civilisation, the
                    humbler arts first received the attention and the fostering care of the state;
                    but it is certain that as each lost art or science was recovered, its professors
                    were formed into a university or corporation, composed of such as were entitled
                    to practise and teach, and such as were in course of learning. The former were
                    the masters, the latter the apprentices. Hence the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apprentice</hi> was applied indifferently to such as were being taught a trade
                    or a learned profession, and even to undergraduates or scholars who were
                    qualifying themselves for the degree of doctor or master in the liberal <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0226-0213"/> arta. When barristers were first appointed by
                    Edward I. of England, they were styled <hi rend="italic">apprenticii ad
                    legem,—</hi> the serjeants being <hi rend="italic">servientes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad legem;</hi> and these two terms corresponded respectively to
                    the trade names of apprentices and journeymen. During the middle ages the term
                    of apprenticeship was seven years, and this period was thought no more than
                    sufficient to instruct the learner in his profession, craft, or mystery, under a
                    properly qualified master, teacher, or doctor—for these names were synonymous—
                    and to reimburse the latter by service for the training received. After this the
                    apprentice became himself a master and a member of the corporation, with full
                    rights to practise the business, and to teach others in his turn; so also it
                    would seem that undergraduates had to pass through a curriculum of seven years
                    before they could attain the degree of doctors or masters in the liberal arts.
                    On the Continent of Europe these rules were observed with considerable rigour,
                    both in the learned professions and in those which we now designate as trades.
                    In England they made their way more slowly, and did not receive much countenance
                    from our ancestors, who were always jealous of anything savouring of
                    interference with the freedom of trade. Nevertheless the formation of guilds and
                    companies of tradesmen in England dates probably from the 12th century, and it
                    is almost certain that the institution of apprenticeships cannot be of much
                    later date. In 1388 and 1405 it is noticed in Acts of Parliament. By various
                    subsequent statutes provisions were made for the regulation of the institution,
                    and from them it appears that seven years was its ordinary and normal term in
                    the absence of special arrangement. By the 5th of Eliz. c. 4, this was made the
                    law of the land, and it was enacted that no person should exercise any trade or
                    mystery without having served a seven years’ apprenticeship. In no place did the
                    apprentices become so formidable by their numbers and organisation as in London.
                    During the great rebellion they took an active part as a political body, and
                    were conspicuous after the Restoration by being frequently engaged in tumults.
                    It was probably owing to this circumstance, quite as much as to economical
                    considerations of freedom of trade, that the Act of Elizabeth never found much
                    favour with the courts of law. Soon after the great rebellion we find the
                    apprentice laws strongly reprobated by the judges, who endeavoured, on the
                    theory that the Act of Elizabeth could apply to no trades which were not in
                    existence at its date, to limit its operation as far as possible. Such
                    limitation of the Act gave rise to many absurd anomalies and inconsistencies,
                    e.y., that a coachmaker could not make his own wheels, but must buy them of a
                    wheel-wright; while the latter might make both wheels and coaches, because
                    coachmaking was not a trade in England when the Act of Elizabeth was passed. For
                    the like reason all the great manufactures which have arisen in Manchester and
                    Birmingham in modern times were held exempt from the operation of the statute.
                    Concurrently with the dislike to the apprentice laws which such anomalies
                    generated, the doctrines of the celebrated Adam Smith, that all monopolies or
                    restrictions on the freedom of trade were injurious to the public interest, had
                    gradually been making their way, and notwithstanding much opposition, an Act was
                    passed in 1814 (54 Geo. III. c. 96), by which the statute of Elizabeth, in so
                    far as it enacts that no person shall engage in any trade without a seven years’
                    apprenticeship, was wholly repealed. The effect of this Act has been to give
                    every person the fullest right to exercise any occupation or calling of a
                    mechanical or trading kind for which he deems himself qualified. Apprenticeship,
                    therefore, which was formerly a compulsory, has now become a voluntary contract.
                    It is still, however, the usual avenue to such avocations, because experience
                    has shown that it is the only effectual means of acquiring such a knowledge of
                    the mechanical arts as shall enable a man to exercise them with advantage. In
                    the case of the learned professions, the principles and theories which gave
                    birth to corporations with monopolies, and required apprenticeship or its
                    equivalents, have—contrary to what has taken place in trade—been not only
                    maintained but intensified; that is to say, not only have such bodies retained
                    and even extended in some cases their exclusive privileges, but in general no
                    one is allowed to practise in such professions unless his capabilities have been
                    tested and approved by public authority. Thus, no man is allowed to practise law
                    or medicine in any of their branches who ha≡ not undergone the appropriate
                    training by attendance at a university or by apprenticeship—sometimes by both
                    combined. Entrance to the church is guarded by similar checks; and even in the
                    case of education great advances have been made to bring the practice of that
                    art under the like restrictions. In such instances the old principle—now
                    abandoned in trade—of granting a monopoly to those possessing a certain standard
                    of qualification is maintained in greater vigour than ever.</p>
                <p>As already noticed, Dr Adam Smith and most of his school strongly disapproved of
                    apprenticeship, but only as it would seem when applied to trade and
                    manufactures. They urged that the institution interfered with the property which
                    every man has or ought to have in his own labour, and interfered not only with
                    the liberty of the workman, but with that of such as might choose to employ him,
                    and who were the best judges of his qualification. They further argued, that
                    such laws tended to restrain competition to a much smaller number than would
                    otherwise enter a trade; that a long apprenticeship, or indeed any at all, was
                    unnecessary even for the nicest mechanical arts; that a few weeks or even days
                    were sufficient to enable a man to set to work in such trades as clock and watch
                    making; and that if the workman was from the outset paid the full price of his
                    work, under deduction of such materials as he might spoil from carelessness or
                    inexperience, he would learn his art more effectually, and be more apt to
                    acquire habits of attention and industry, than by working under a master who had
                    a right to share in the produce of his labour. It was further contended that the
                    λvhole system of apprenticeship, like that of the corporations of which it
                    formed an integral part, was a mere device by which masters sought to limit the
                    number of entrants into their respective trades, and so enhance their monopolies
                    at the expense of the general public. That there is considerable truth in much
                    of this reasoning is undeniable. At the time when Dr Smith began to attack the
                    trade corporations, the narrow and vexatious rules of apprenticeship by which
                    they sought to guard their exclusive privileges were, like their privileges,
                    grievous restraints on the freedom of trade. But taking all this in its worst
                    view will hardly justify the sweeping charges brought against the institution of
                    apprenticeship. It is not conceivable that an institution, which for centuries
                    found acceptance in every part of Europe, should have no better justification
                    than the greed of master workmen. The abolition of the laws which rendered
                    apprenticeship compulsory has not, as Dr Smith and his followers thought, led to
                    its disuse. On the contrary, it or its equivalents have been voluntarily
                    submitted to by such men as desired to exercise a trade to a profit; for the
                    public were not long in discovering that the regularly trained artisan was the
                    only one whose work could be relied on. It is not very easy to see why those
                    principles of monopoly, based on ascertained proficiency, which are so
                    rigorously enforced in the learned professions, should not at least have some
                    application in the case of skilled artisans. It is also worthy of notice that
                    the rise of trades’ unions has been coincident with the fall of the old trade
                    corporations —thus indicating <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0227-0214"/> that artisans feel the necessity for some more
                    powerful and orderly protection than the mere operation of the blind principle
                    of supply and demand. For these and similar reasons, it is believed that few
                    practical men will in the present day deny the advantages of apprenticeship. No
                    one would probably advocate the restoration of the old guilds -with their
                    exclusive privileges; but many would perhaps incline to advise the institution
                    of some order or degree by which, in certain trades, the workman who has passed
                    through a regular apprenticeship may be distinguished from the man who is not so
                    qualified, <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. w. c.)</hi></p>
