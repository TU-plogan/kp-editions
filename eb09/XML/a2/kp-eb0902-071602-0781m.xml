                    rend="italic">Asinus</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgaris,</hi> Gray—differs chiefly
                    from the horse in its smaller size, in the presence of long hair, forming a
                    tuft, only at the extremity of the tail, and in the absence of warts on its hind
                    legs. Its fur, usually of a gray colour, is characteristically marked with a
                    longitudinal dorsal streak of a darker hue, with a similar streak across the
                    shoulders, but white and black varieties also occur. The ass has been from time
                    immemorial under the dominion of man, and it is doubtful w hether the original
                    wild stock is anywhere to be found at the present day,— the specimens that have
                    been described as wild being probably the descendants of individuals that have
                    escaped from the domestic βtate. A wild variety of ass <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Asinus</hi><hi rend="italic">toeniopus),</hi> found in Abyssinia, has the long
                    acute ears and the bray peculiar to the domestic kinds. It is said also to have
                    cross bands on its legs, a feature occasionally met with in our tame breeds; and
                    this fact has led Darwin and others to conclude that in the wild ass of
                    Abyssinia the original of the domestic animal is to be found; the stripes which
                    occasionally appear on the legs of the latter being regarded as instances of
                    reversion to the ancestral type <hi rend="italic">(Proceedings of Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1862). The marked aversion of the domestic ass to cross the
                    smallest streamlet, an aversion which it shares with the camel, and the evident
                    delight with which it rolls itself in the dust, seem to point to arid deserts as
                    its βriginal home. The ass has generally been the object of neglect and ill
                    treatment; and attempts have seldom been made to improve the breed by selecting
                    and matching the finer specimens. It has thus gradually sunk into the dull and
                    obstinate creature -which we are accustomed to see. Its reputation for stupidity
                    is not, however, of recent origin. The ancient Egyptians hated it, and
                    symbolised an ignorant person by the head and ears, and the Romans thought it a
                    bad omen to meet an ass (Fosbrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Antiquities').</hi> In
                    the Middle Ages the Germans of Westphalia made the ass the symbol of St Thomas,
                    the unbelieving apostle; and the boy who was last to enter the school on St
                    Thomas’ day was called the “Ass Thomas” (Gubernatis’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoological Mythology,</hi> vol. i. p. 362). That the ass possesses qualities,
                    which, if developed by careful selection and humane treatment, would make it a
                    worthy companion of the horse as the servant of man, is seen in the too rare
                    instances in which it has received proper attention. In Southern
                    Europe—especially in Spain, Italy, and Malta—the ass is carefully bred, and has
                    thus been greatly improved. No less than £200, it is said, is sometimes paid in
                    Spain for a stallion ass. In the state of Kentucky, where mules are in great
                    request as beasts of burden, asses, imported from the south of Europe, are
                    reared with scrupulous care, and with such success, that from an average height
                    of fourteen hands the Ken-tuckiana<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0782-0717"/> have raised these animals to fifteen and even
                    sixteen hands. That the diminutive size of the ass in cold countries is due as
                    much to neglect as to rigour of climate seems proved by the fact, that in the
                    north of India, where it is used by the lowest castes, the ass does not attain a
                    height greater than that of a Newfoundland dog. It is, however, among the
                    south-western nations of Asia and in Egypt that the ass has received that
                    attention usually bestowed in this country on the horse, and it is there that it
                    is to be seen in greatest perfection. The Arabs and Persians know the pedigrees
                    of their asses, and by careful selection and interbreeding they have formed and
                    perpetuate many useful races. Thus in Syria, according to Darwin, there are four
                    distinct breeds:—“a light and graceful animal with agreeable gait used by
                    ladies, an Arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle, a stouter animal used
                    for ploughing and various purposes, and the large Damascus breed with peculiarly
                    long body and ears.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    62.</p></note></p>
                <p>The ass, there is little doubt, was first domesticated in Asia,—probably prior to
                    the domestication of the horse,— whence it passed at a comparatively late period
                    into Europe, for in the time of Aristotle it was not found in Thrace. In England
                    there is evidence of its presence so early as the time of the Saxon Ethelred,
                    but it does not appear to have been common till after the time of Queen
                    Elizabeth. The koulan, or wild ass <hi rend="italic">(Asinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Onager,</hi> Gray), differs from the domestic species in its
                    shorter and more rounded ears, and in the greater length and finer form of its
                    limbs. Its fur shows the dark streak along the back, but the streak across the
                    shoulders does not appear to be a constant character. It is chiefly to be met
                    with in the plains of Mesopotamia, in Persia, in Cutch, on the shores of the
                    Indus, and in the Panjab, congregating in herds under a leader, and migrating
                    southwards on the approach of winter. The adults are exceedingly shy, so that it
                    is difficult to get within rifle range of them. According to Layard, who had
                    ample opportunity for observing them during his researches around Nineveh, “they
                    equal the gazelle in fleetness, and to match them is a feat which only one or
                    two of the most celebrated mares have been known to accomplish.” In the same
                    region, over 2000 years ago, Xenophon, during the famous expedition of Cyrus,
                    observed herds of wild asses so “fleet that the horsemen could only take them by
                    dividing themselves into relays, and succeeding one another in the chase.” The
                    young are sometimes caught during spring by the Arabs, who feed them with milk
                    in their tents. They are hunted chiefly by the Arabs and Persians, by whom their
                    flesh is esteemed a delicacy. Their food, according to Dr Shaw, consists mainly
                    of saline or bitter and lactescent plants; they are also fond of salt or
                    brackish water. The leather known as shagreen, from the Turkish term <hi
                    rend="italic">sagri,</hi> is made from the skin of the ass; the ingrained aspect
                    which it bears is not, however, natural to it, but is produced by a chemical
                    process described by Pallas. The milk of the ass, containing more sugar and less
                    caseine than that of the cow, closely resembles woman’s milk, and has long been
                    valued as a nutritious diet where the digestive organs are weak.</p>
