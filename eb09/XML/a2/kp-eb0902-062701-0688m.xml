                    philosophy subjects, taught at that time by Professor Copland, a skilful
                    experimenter. There his natural bent to physical science was greatly
                    strengthened. He studied medicine first at Aberdeen, and subsequently under Sir
                    Everard Home, through whom he obtained, while yet in his nineteenth year, the
                    appointment of full surgeon to an East Indiaman. After making two voyages to
                    China he settled in 1811 to practise in London, and speedily acquired high
                    reputation in his profession. Within a few years he was made physician to the
                    French and Spanish embassies. In 1836 he was appointed a member of the Senate of
                    the new university of London, and became a fellow of the Royal and Geological
                    Societies. In 1837 he was made a physician extraordinary to the Queen. From his
                    earliest youth Arnott had an intense love of natural philosophy, constantly
                    using illustrations and applications of its principles. To this liking was added
                    an inventiveness which served him in good stead in his profession, and to which
                    we owe the “Arnott water-bed,” the “Arnott ventilator,” the “Arnott stove,”
                    &amp;c., all of which, with characteristic philanthropy, he refrained from
                    patenting. He was the author of several works bearing on physical science or its
                    applications. The most important of these is his <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Physics,</hi> published in 1827, the most successful attempt that had ever been
                    made to popularise a scientific subject. It went through six editions in his
                    lifetime. In 1838 ho published a treatise on <hi rend="italic">Warming and
                    Ventilating,</hi> and, in 1855, one on the <hi rend="italic">Smokeless
                    Fireplace.</hi> He took a lead in sanitary improvements generally. The chief
                    characteristic of his writings and inventions is their high practical utility.
                    He was a strong advocate of scientific, as opposed to purely classical,
                    education; and he manifested his interest in natural philosophy by the
                    munificent gift of .£2000 to each of the four universities of Scotland and to
                    the university of London, to promote its study in the experimental and practical
                    form. He died in London, 2d March 1874.</p>
