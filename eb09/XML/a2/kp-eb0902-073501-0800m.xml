                    later he was appointed professor of classical literature in the university of
                    Landshut, where he remained until 1826. when that institution was transferred to
                    Munich. In this latter city he spent the rest of his life. In recognition of his
                    services as a teacher and author he was made an aulic councillor, and a member
                    of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. He died on the 30th of December 1841. Ast
                    was an independent although not an original thinker. He was more of a scholar
                    and critic than a philosopher. He belonged to the school of Schelling, but was
                    ready to welcome truths from the most diverse quarters. His writings on
                    aesthetics,— <hi rend="italic">System</hi><hi rend="italic">der Kunstlehre</hi>
                    (1805) and <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der</hi><hi rend="italic">Aesthetik</hi>
                    (1807),—although containing no distinctively new thoughts, had the merit not
                    only of combining and elaborating the principles of Schelling on beauty and art,
                    but of supplementing them to some extent by the views of Winckelmann, Lessing,
                    Kant, Herder, Schiller, Jean Paul, and others, on these subjects. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundlinien der Philosophie,</hi> published in 1807, was
                    republished in 1809, but soon after sank into oblivion. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grundriss einer Geschichte der Philosophie,</hi> also published in 1807, was
                    longer lived, and deservedly. It was the best book of the kind which the
                    Schelling school could show, at least until the publication of Rixner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual,</hi> fifteen years later. It is among the earliest of the
                    works pervaded by the thought, so familiar now but so fresh then, that the
                    history of philosophy is not a history of opinions, but the history of reason,
                    the several philosophies being only stages in the development of the one true
                    philosophy, the gradually self-revealing absolute reason. It is also among the
                    earliest attempts to “construe” the history of philosophy and to formulate its
                    law of movement. The author published a second edition of it in 1825, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie</hi> in 1829. In two
                    works, both published in 1808, he sought to determine and expound the principles
                    of the chief divisions of the study in which he was strongest. They are his <hi
                    rend="italic">Grundlinien der Philologie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Grundlinien
                    der Grammatik, Hermeneutik, und Kritik.</hi> Both have been commended by
                    competent judges. His reputation as a philologist, however, rests mainly on the
                    vast and toilsome labours on Plato, which occupied the last twenty-five years of
                    his life. His <hi rend="italic">Platon’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Leben und
                    Schriften,</hi> published in 1816, is the earliest of those elaborate critical
                    inquiries regarding the life of Plato, the authenticity of the works which have
                    come down to us under his name, the order of their composition, their purpose,
                    plan, &amp;c., which may be regarded as having had their proximate cause in the
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Introductions</hi> of Schleiermacher, and their
                    primary cause in the historical scepticism of Niebuhr and Wolf. He allows
                    scarcely any weight to the ancient biographies and traditions; but, taking a few
                    of the finest dialogues as standards, he draws from them the criteria in virtue
                    of which he accepts or rejects the others. He pronounces spurious not only those
                    compositions which are generally admitted to be so,—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epinomis, Minos, Theages,</hi><hi rend="italic">Erastae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Clitopho, Hipparchus, Eryxias,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Letters and
                    Definitions,</hi> but also the <hi rend="italic">Meno, Euthydemus, Charmides,
                    Lysis, Laches,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">First and Second</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alcibiades,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hippias</hi><hi rend="italic">Major and
                    Minor,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ion, Euthyphron, Apology,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crito,</hi> and even, in defiance of the explicit testimony of
                    Aristotle, the <hi rend="italic">Laws.</hi> He arranges the dialogues, which he
                    admits to be genuine, into three series; the group which he regards as the
                    earliest in date of composition, and which he describes as characterised by the
                    predominance of the poetical and dramatical element, consists of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protagoras,</hi><hi rend="italic">Phoedrus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gorgias,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phoedo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    second, distinguished by the marked prominence of dialectic keenness and
                    subtility, comprises the <hi rend="italic">Theaetetus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophist, Statesman, Parmenides,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cratylus;</hi> while
                    the third, displaying the dialectical and poetical qualities of Plato’s mind in
                    interpenetration and harmony, includes the <hi rend="italic">Philebus, Banquet,
                    liepublic, Timaeus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Critias.</hi> This book was
                    followed by a complete edition of Plato’s works (1819-32) in 11 vols., with a
                    Latin translation, and a learned commentary, which occupies the last two
                    volumes. Professor Ast crowned these laboura by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lexicon</hi><hi rend="italic">Platonicum</hi> (1834-9), in 3 vols., one of the
                    most comprehensive and valuable of special dictionaries. He wrote various other
                    works of less importance than those which have been mentioned. <hi
