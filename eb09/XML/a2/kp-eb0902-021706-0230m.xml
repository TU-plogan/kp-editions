                    accurately traced. The aquarium, as we find it at Hamburg or Brighton, has, like
                    many other things now in daily use, been elaborated from small beginnings. It is
                    known that more than two centuries ago marine animals were, for the purposes of
                    study and observation, removed from the sea and kept in confinement; and there
                    is extant a drawing, of the date of 1742, which represents the form of an
                    aquarium containing zoophytes. Esper, a distinguished entomologist, a century
                    ago kept aquatic insects in water for observation. Sir John Graham Dalyell, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Rare and Remarkable Animals of Scotland, 2</hi>
                    vols. 4to, 1847-48, <hi rend="italic">The Poxver of the Creator displayed in the
                    Creation,</hi> 3 vols. 4to, 1851-58, and numerous other works, was during his
                    lifetime a keen student of marine animals; and, at his house in Edinburgh, he
                    had constructed for the purposes of observation an aquarium of a very humble
                    kind indeed, but quite sufficient for his purpose. It is well known that some of
                    the animals which he kept for the purposes of study lived for a very long period
                    in confinement: one sea anemone is mentioned on good authority as having been
                    taken from the sea in the year 1828, and being alive and well in 1873 (W. A.
                    Lloyd). Sir John’s tanks, as has been stated, were of the humblest description,
                    and never contained any of that vegetation which forms so beautiful and
                    interesting a feature of the modern aquarium, and which, as Priestley had
                    discovered long before, purifies the water in which it is kept growing. About
                    the year 1839 a movement was made towards the construction of aquariums of a
                    more elaborate description, which lasted for more than twenty years, during
                    which time a large number were made, and many descriptive works published on the
                    subject. Agencies were during that period established in London and elsewhere
                    for the supply of animals; and some at the same time made it a business to
                    purvey sea-water—the obtaining of this, and keeping it fresh, being with many
                    persons who lived far from the sea a great difficulty. Indeed the difficulty was
                    so great that an artificial compound was in numerous instances resorted to for
                    lack of genuine sea-water. A solution of this difficulty came tardily, in 1841.
                    Mr Ward at that time constructed in London a fresh-water aquarium, in which
                    aquatic plants were very successfully grown for the purpose of keeping the water
                    pure and the animals healthy; and a year later, Dr George Johnston of
                    Berwick-on-Tweed, accidentally discovered, in the course of making an experiment
                    for another purpose, that the animal and p⅛nt life of the sea could also be made
                    to support each other. For a period of sixty days he kept some animals in a jar
                    without once changing the water, and thus solved the problem. Early in 1847 Mrs
                    Thynne of London successfully investigated the problem, whether it was possible
                    to keep the animals in good condition of health without changing the water. In
                    1849 Mr R. Warington, also of London, and afterwards Mr P. H. Gosse, conducted
                    successful experiments having fortheir object the balancing of vegetable and
                    animal life, which afterwards came to be thoroughly recognised. Sea-weeds,
                    however, do not bear transplanting, but sea-water is so impregnated with the
                    seeds or germs of vegetable life, that when a few stones or fragments of rock
                    are taken from the ocean, marine vegetation speedily commences and proceeds. Mr
                    Price, Mr Lankester, Mr Bowerbank, and others, also made experiments in the same
                    direction; and in 1853 a fish-house or aquarium of considerable size was
                    constructed by the Zoological Society of London in their garden in the Regent’s
                    Park. This erection gave such an impetus to the popular aquarium movement as
                    rendered it almost a mania, and for a year or two these scientific toys, some of
                    them of large size, became much appreciated household ornaments. The movement
                    was further accelerated by Mr Gosse and Mr Warington, who published formulae for
                    the manufacture of artificial salt water, in which sea animals would thrive as
                    well as in their native element. Many large public aquariums have been erected
                    since the example was set by the Zoological Society of London. A great aquarium
                    has been usually a popular feature of the numerous Continental
                    fishery-exhibitions held since I860, particularly at those of Amsterdam,
                    Boulogne, Havre, Arcachon, and the Hague. These, of course, were temporary
                    aquariums, ending when the exhibition of which they formed a part came to a
                    close; but permanent aquariums are now a feature of seve&gt;∙ ral large towns
                    and cities. In England there is a very large aquarium at Brighton; while at the
                    Crystal Palace there is one on a smaller scale, as also at Manchester and
                    Southport, and preparations are being made [1874] forth© erection of similar
                    edifices in other towns and cities of Great Britain. The aquarium at Hamburg has
                    already been mentioned; there are others at Berlin and Vienna; and the aquarium
                    at Naples affords special accommodation <pb break="no"

                    delicate scientific investigations.</p>
                <p>The modern aquarium is essentially different from the vivaria or fish-stews of
                    ancient times. These were constructed for every day kitchen use, for the purpose
                    of supplying the tables of their wealthy possessors with various kinds of fish;
                    some of those kept being of great value. Wonderful stories are told by ancient
                    authors of the pains taken to procure fine breeds of fish, and the care with
                    which they were fed and fattened for use. Fish were borrowed and returned; the
                    keeping of them became a fashion, and extravagant sums of money were expended on
                    the purchase of rare kinds. The remains of vivaria and fish-stews are still to
                    be found in the neighbourhood of Naples, and at other places in Italy.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of the great aquarium at Brighton are as follows:—Its area is 715
                    feet in length by 100 feet in breadth. It contains many tanks, some of them
                    being of vast capacity; there is one in particular (No. 6) which contains
                    110,000 gallons of water, and has a plate-glass front 130 feet long, through
                    which the habits of very large fish may be studied. The rock-work of the tanks
                    is entirely artificial, and admirably adapted to afford shelter to the fish and
                    crustaceans which disport in them. The management of a large aquarium, such as
                    that at the Crystal Palace or at Brighton, involves constant anxiety and daily
                    trouble: the fish must of course be fed so that they may enjoy good health, and
                    to ensure this they must live under conditions as nearly as possible the same as
                    they have been accustomed to in the waters from which they have been taken. At
                    one time much difficulty was experienced in keeping the inhabitants of
                    sweet-water tanks in good health; in numerous instances the fish died in a day
                    or two after their places of residence had been changed; and it was not till
                    after many different plans had been tried, that safe modes of keeping them in a
                    healthy state were found out. Thousands of fish died in ornamental fresh-water
                    tanks from over-attention, from a too frequent changing of the water, and from
                    lack of a supply of those elements of growth which are essential to all animated
                    nature.</p>
                <p>The aquariums at Brighton and the Crystal Palace exemplify two distinct systems
                    of construction and management. At the former there is no actual circulation of
                    water from one tank to another—but it can, if necessary, be renewed from the
                    sea; the mass of the water in the reserve cisterns is small as compared with
                    that in the show tanks, and aeration is effected by pumping air into the tanks
                    through tubes of large diameter. Purification of the water is also assisted by
                    the presence of large bivalve molluscs in the tanks. At the Crystal Palace
                    aquarium, a constant circulation is maintained from one tank to another; the
                    bulk of water in the reservoir is five times as much as that in the show tanks,
                    while aeration is accomplished by carrying a main over their entire length, from
                    which, under pressure, a small stream of water pours from a tap into each,
                    breaking the surface of the water, and carrying down to the bottom of the tanks,
                    and distributing over the body of their contents, myriads of minute bubbles of
                    air, which present an enormous oxidising surface to the water, rendering it
                    bright and sparkling.</p>
                <p>It does not answer very well, even when an aquarium is at the sea-side, to be
                    constantly changing the water, as the new supply is so disturbed and impregnated
                    with impurities as to be fatal to delicate animals, besides not being in a
                    proper state for exhibition. Some of the inhabitants of an aquarium foul the
                    water very much more than others, notably the flat fish family, and provision
                    has to be made for this by putting such other animals in the same tank as will
                    aid in purifying the water. Various small animals have of course to be provided
                    as food for the larger marine specimens; others of them act as scavengers,
                    helping to keep the water constantly sweet and clean. The light admitted to the
                    fish in the tanks is also a matter of careful adjustment. As the animal life and
                    vegetable life mutually support each other, the kind of material necessary for
                    maintaining the “compensating system” must be watchfully supplied. Mr W. R.
                    Hughes of Birmingham recommends the growth of sea-lettuce (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Ulva</hi><hi rend="italic">latissima)</hi> in tanks, as suitable both for
                    oxygenating the water and for food for the fishes; the stock plants being
                    introduced in the autumn months, when they are loaded with spores. Now that such
                    excellent aquariums as those at Brighton, Manchester, Southport, and Sydenham
                    are in full working order, the construction of others will not be difficult,
                    even when projected on a larger scale. Distance from the sea is of no
                    consequence, as sea-water may be obtained by railway, and can be kept stored as
                    already suggested.</p>
                <p>Scientific discovery, or the promotion of experiments in natural history, is
                    usually no direct part of the plan of modern aquariums, except in so far as this
                    may be incidental to the daily conduct of the collection. Nevertheless, it is
                    not too much to expect that the aquariums already in existence, and those which
                    are projected, may be made useful in determining many questions connected with
                    the life and growth of our food fishes, in regard to which naturalists and
                    economists are alike ignorant. The fish of which we know most is the salmon, and
                    our knowledge of that “monarch of the brook” arises from the fact of its being
                    accessible to constant observation. It would tend to the better regulation of
                    our fisheries, and to the augmentation of our food supplies, if we knew as much
                    about the herring or the haddock as we know about the salmon. Were a large
                    marine observatory erected by the State, say at Brighton, or were the present
                    aquarium there considerably extended, the best results might follow. Precise
                    information might be obtained as to the period of spawning of the common
                    herring, the length of time which the ova require to come to life, and the age
                    at which the fish becomes reproductive. The conditions under which fish grow and
                    remain in good health, the best kinds of food on which to feed them, the best
                    methods of protecting them from their numerous enemies, are all questions which
                    a properly conducted aquarium would aid our naturalists to study. It is well
                    known that very uneconomical modes of fishing are at present resorted to, and
                    that the largest portion of our fish is captured at a time when fish ought not
                    to be captured—at a time, indeed, when they are most unfit for use. It is only
                    by studying the habits of these denizens of the ocean, in some place where they
                    can be constantly under observation,—such as a great aquarium, where the
                    conditions of their captivity should resemble as much as possible their native
                    <hi rend="italic">habitat,—</hi> that we can ever hope to fathom the mysteries
                    of the great deep, and ultimately have at our command the treasures of the sea.
