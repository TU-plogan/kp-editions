                    accompaniment of votive offerings. Such compositions were termed epigrams, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> inscriptions. The modern use of the word is a departure
                    from the original sense, which simply indicated that the composition was
                    intended to be engraved or inscribed. Such a composition must necessarily be
                    brief, and the restraints attendant upon its publication concurred with the
                    simplicity of Greek taste in prescribing conciseness of expression, pregnancy of
                    meaning, purity of diction, and singleness of thought, as the indispensable
                    conditions of excellence in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended
                    to any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled. The transition from the
                    monumental to the purely literary character of the epigram was favoured by the
                    exhaustion of more lofty forms of poetry, the general increase, from the general
                    diffusion of culture, of accomplished writers and tasteful readers, but, above
                    all things, by the changed political circumstances of the times, which induced
                    numbers who would otherwise have engaged in public affairs to addict themselves
                    to literary pursuits. These causes came into full operation during the
                    Alexandrian era, in which we find every description of epigrammatic composition,
                    perfectly developed. About 90 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the sophist and
                    poet, Meleager of Gadara, undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his
                    predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections of monumental
                    inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects, had previously been formed by
                    Polemon the grammarian, Alcetas, and others; but Meleager first gave the
                    principle a comprehensive application. His selection, compiled from forty-six of
                    his predecessors, from Sappho downward, and including numerous contributions of
                    his own, was entitled <hi rend="italic">The Garland</hi> (5τ∈φαvoς); and in an
                    introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed
                    appropriate to his genius. The arrangement of the collection was alphabetical,
                    according to the initial letter of each epigram.</p>
                <p>In the age of Tiberius (rather than of Trajan, as commonly stated) the work of
                    Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist, Philip of Thessalonica, who
                    first employed the term anthology. His collection included the compositions of
                    thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager. Somewhat later, another supplement was
                    formed by the sophist Diogenianus, and, under Hadrian, Strato of Sardis compiled
                    his elegant but tainted Μοΰσα <hi rend="italic">παιδική</hi> from his own
                    productions and those of earlier writers. No further collection from various
                    sources is recorded until the time of Justinian, when epigrammatic writing,
                    especially in its amatory department, experienced a great revival at the hands
                    of Agathias, the historian, Paulus Silentiarius, and their circle. Their
                    ingenious but mannered productions were collected by Agathias into a new
                    anthology, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Circle</hi> (Κύκλος); the first to be
                    divided into books, and arranged with reference to the subjects of the
                    pieces.</p>
                <p>Five Greek anthologies, accordingly, existed at the commencement of the Middle
                    Ages. The partial incorporation of these into a single body was the work of a
                    certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved in the single MS.
                    of his compilation extant, but who probably lived during the temporary revival
                    of letters under Constantine Porphyrogenitus, at the beginning of the 10th
                    century. He appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies,
                    with the addition of selections from Lucillius, Palladas, and other
                    epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published separately. His
                    arrangement, to which we shall have to recur, is founded on a principle of
                    classification, and nearly corresponds to that adopted by Agathias. His
                    principle of selection is unknown; it is only certain that while he omitted much
                    that he should have retained, he has preserved much that would otherwise have
                    perished. The extent of our obligations may be ascertained by a comparison
                    between his anthology and that of the next editor, the monk Maximus Planudeτ <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n117/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0117-0104"/> (1320 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> who has
                    not merely grievously mutilated the anthology of Cephalas by omissions, but has
                    disfigured it by interpolating verses of his own. We are, however, indebted to
                    him for the preservation of the epigrams on works of art, which seem to have
                    been accidentally omitted from our only transcript of Cephalas.</p>
                <p>The Planudean was the only recension of the anthology known at the revival of
                    classical literature, and was first published at Florence, by Janus Lascaris, in
                    1594. It long continued to be the only accessible collection, for although the
                    Palatine MS., the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered
                    at Heidelberg by Salmasius in 1606, it was not published until 1772, when it was
                    included in Brunck’s <hi rend="italic">Analecta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Veterum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetarum</hi><hi rend="italic">Groecorum.</hi>
                    This edition was superseded by the standard one of Friedrich Jacobs (Leipsic,
                    1794-1803, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more convenient form
                    in 1813-17, and occupies three pocket volumes in the Tauchnitz series of the
                    classics. The best edition for general purposes is perhaps that of Μ. Diibner in
                    Didot’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi> (Paris, 1864-72), which contains the
                    Palatine Anthology, the epigrams of the Planudean Anthology not comprised in the
                    former, an appendix of pieces derived from other sources, copious notes selected
                    from all quarters, a literal Latin prose translation by Boissonade, Bothe, and
                    Lapaume, and the metrical Latin versions of Hugo Grotius. The best edition of
                    the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by Van Bosch and Van Lennep
                    (Utrecht, 1795-1822). Weicker, Meineke, and other German scholars have written
                    valuable monographs on the Anthology.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrangement of the Anthology.—</hi> The Palatine MS&lt; the
                    archetype of the present text, was transcribed by different persons at different
                    times, and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond with
                    that signalised in the index. It is as follows :—Book 1. Christian epigrams; 2.
                    Christodorus’s description of certain statues; 3. Inscriptions in the temple at
                    Cyzicus; 4. The prefaces of Meleager, Philip, and Agathias to their respective
                    collections; 5. Amatory epigrams; 6. Votive inscriptions; 7. Epitaphs; 8. The
                    epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 9. Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 10.
                    Ethical pieces; 11. Humorous and convivial; 12. Strato’s Μούτα παιδική; 13.
                    Metrical curiosities; 14. Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 15. Miscellanies. The
                    epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are missing from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Palatinus,</hi> and must be sought in
                    an appendix of epigrams only occur-iug in the Planudean Anthology. The epigrams
                    hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and similar sources form another
                    appendix in the second volume of Diibner’s edition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Style and Value of the Anthology.—</hi> One of the principal
                    claims of the Anthology to attention is derived from its continuity, its
                    existence as a living and growing body of poetry throughout all the vicissitudes
                    of Greek civilisation. More ambitious descriptions of composition speedily ran
                    their course, and having attained their complete development became extinct, or
                    at best lingered only in feeble or conventional imitations. The humbler strains
                    of the epigrammatic muse, on the other hand, remained ever fresh and animated,
                    ever in intimate union with the spirit of the generation that gave them birth.
                    To peruse the entire collection, accordingly, is as it were to assist at the
                    disinterment of an ancient city, where generation has succeeded generation on
                    the same site, and each stratum of soil enshrines the vestiges of a distinct
                    epoch, but where all epochs, nevertheless, combine to constitute an organic
                    whole, and the transition from one to the other is hardly perceptible. Four
                    stages may be indicated :—1. The Hellenic proper, of which Simonides is the
                    characteristic representative. This is characterised by a simple dignity of
                    phrase, which to a modern taste almost verges upon baldness, by a crystalline
                    transparency of diction, and by an absolute fidelity to the original conception
                    of the epigram. Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> inscriptions, or addresses to real personages, whether living or
                    deceased; narratives, literary exercises, and sports of fancy are exceedingly
                    rare. 2. The epigram received a great development in its second or Alexandrian
                    era, when its range was so extended as to include anecdote, satire, and amorous
                    longing; when epitaphs and votive inscriptions were composed on imaginary
                    persons and things, and men of taste successively attempted the same subjects in
                    mutual emulation, or sat down to compose verses as displays of their ingenuity.
                    The result was a great gain in richness of style and general interest,
                    counterbalanced by a falling off in purity of diction and sincerity of
                    treatment. The modification,—a perfectly legitimate one, the resources of the
                    old style being exhausted,—had its real source in the transformation of
                    political life, but may be said to commence with and to find its best
                    representative in the playful and elegant Leonidas of Tarentum, a contemporary
                    of Pyrrhus, and to close with Antipater of Sidon, about 140 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> It should be noticed, however, that Callimachus, one of the most
                    distinguished of the Alexandrian poets, affects the sternest simplicity in his
                    epigrams, and copies the austerity of Simonides with as much success as an
                    imitator can expect 3. By a slight additional modification in the same
                    direction, the Alexandrian passes into what, for the sake of preserving the
                    parallelism with the eras of Greek prose literature, we may call the Roman
                    style, although the peculiarities of its principal representative are decidedly
                    Oriental. Meleager of Gadara was a Syrian; his taste was less severe, and his
                    temperament more fervent than those of his Greek predecessors; his pieces are
                    usually erotic, and their glowing imagery sometimes reminds us of the Song of
                    Solomon. The luxuriance of his fancy occasionally betrays him into far-fetched
                    conceits, and the lavishness of his epithets is only redeemed by their exquisite
                    felicity. Yet his effusions are manifestly the offspring of genuine feeling, and
                    his epitaph on himself indicates a great advance on the exclusiveness of antique
                    Greek patriotism, and is perhaps the first clear enunciation of the spirit of
                    universal humanity characteristic of the later Stoical philosophy. With respect
                    to his more strictly poetical qualities, Mr Symonds does not overpraise him when
                    he says “his poetry has the sweetness and the splendour of the rose, the rapture
                    and full throated melody of the nightingale.” His gaiety and licentiousness are
                    imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary, the Epicurean
                    Philodemus, perhaps the liveliest of any of the epigrammatists; his fancy
                    reappears with diminished brilliancy in Philodemus’s contemporary, Zonas, in
                    Crinagoras, who wrote under Augustus, and in Marcus Argentarius, of uncertain
                    date; his peculiar gorgeousness of colouring remains entirely his own. At a
                    later period of the empire another <hi rend="italic">genre,</hi> hitherto
                    comparatively in abeyance, was developed, the satirical. Lucillius, who
                    flourished under Nero, and Lucian, more renowned in other fields of literature,
                    display a remarkable talent for shrewd, caustic epigram, frequently embodying
                    moral reflections of great cogency, often lashing vice and folly with signal
                    effect, but not seldom indulging in mere trivialities, or deformed by scoffs at
                    personal blemishes. This style of composition is not properly Greek, but Roman;
                    it answers to the modern definition of epigram, and has hence attained a
                    celebrity in excess of its deserts. It is remarkable, however, as an almost
                    solitary example of direct Latin influence on Greek literature. The same style
                    obtains with Palladas, an Alexandrian grammarian of the 4th century, the last of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n118/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0118-0105"/> the strictly classical epigrammatists, and the
                    first to be guilty of downright bad taste. His better pieces, however, are
                    characterised by an austere ethical impressiveness, and his literary position is
                    very interesting, as that of an indignant but despairing opponent of
                    Christianity. 4. The fourth or Byzantine style of epigrammatic composition was
                    cultivated by the <hi rend="italic">beaux-esprits</hi> of the court of
                    Justinian. To a great extent this is merely imitative, but the circumstances of
                    the period operated so as to produce a species of originality. The peculiarly
                    ornate and <hi rend="italic">recherché</hi> diction of Agathias and his compeers
                    is not a merit in itself, but applied for the first time, it has the effect of
                    revivifying an old form, and many of their new locutions are actual enrichments
                    of the language. The writers, moreover, were men of genuine poetical feeling,
                    ingenious in invention, and capable of expressing emotion with energy and
                    liveliness; the colouring of their pieces is sometimes highly dramatic. The
                    charge of impurity, alleged by Mr Symonds against them as a body, applies to
                    Rufinus alone in any considerable degree, and he is purity itself compared with
                    Martial. There is something very touching in the attitude of these last belated
                    stragglers towards the antique culture from which they are hopelessly
                    severed,—their half-conscious yearning for the glorious past, whose monuments
                    still surrounded them on every side, but whose spirit had departed for ever.
                    With them the volume of the Greek anthology is closed, for the “Christian
                    epigrams” are totally valueless in a literary point of view.</p>
                <p>It would be hard to exaggerate the substantial value of the Anthology, whether as
                    a storehouse of facts bearing on antique manners, customs, and ideas, or as one
                    among the influences which have contributed to mould the literature of the
                    modern world. The multitudinous votive inscriptions, serious and sportive,
                    connote the phases of Greek religious sentiment, from pious awe to irreverent
                    familiarity and sarcastic scepticism; the moral tone of the nation at various
                    periods is mirrored with corresponding fidelity; the sepulchral inscriptions
                    admit us into the inmost sanctuary of family affection, and reveal a depth and
                    tenderness of feeling beyond the province of the historian to depict, and which
                    we should not have surmised even from the dramatists; the general tendency of
                    the collection is to display antiquity on its most human side, and to mitigate
                    those contrasts with the modern world which more ambitious modes of composition
                    force into relief. The constant reference to the details of private life renders
                    the Anthology an inexhaustible treasury for the student of archaeology; art,
                    industry, and costume receive their fullest illustration from its pages. Its
                    influence on European literatures will be appreciated in proportion to the
                    inquirer’s knowledge of each. The further his researches extend, the greater
                    will be his astonishment at the extent to which the Anthology has been laid
                    under contribution for thoughts which have become household words in all
                    cultivated languages, and at the beneficial effect of the imitation of its
                    brevity, simplicity, and absolute verbal accuracy upon the undisciplined
                    luxuriance of modern genius.</p>

                    best versions of the Anthology ever made are the Latin renderings of select
                    epigrams by Hugo Grotius. They have not been printed separately, but will be

                    incapacity of approximating to the form of the original, and their poets have
                    usually contented themselves with paraphrases or imitations, often exceedingly
                    felicitous. Dehesme’s French prose translation, however (1863), is most
                    excellent and valuable. The German language alone admits of the preservation of
                    the original metre,—a circumstance advantageous to the German translators,
                    Herder and Jacobs, who have not, however, compensated the loss inevitably
                    consequent upon a change of idiom by any added beauties of their own. Though
                    unfitted to reproduce the precise form, the English language, from its superior
                    terseness, is better adapted to preserve the spirit of the original than the
                    German; and the comparative ill success of many English translators must be
                    chiefly attributed to the extremely low standard of fidelity and brevity
                    observed by them. Bland, Merivale, and their associates (1806-13), are often
                    intolerably diffuse and feeble, from want, not of ability, but of painstaking.
                    Archdeacon Wrangham’s too rare versions are much more spirited; and John
                    Sterling’s translations of the inscriptions of Simonides deserve high praise.
                    Professor Wilson <hi rend="italic">(Blackwood's Magazine,</hi> 1833-35)
                    collected and commented upon the labours of these and other translators, with
                    his accustomed critical insight and exuberant geniality, but damaged his essay
                    by burdening it with the indifferent attempts of William Hay. In 1849 Dr
                    Wellesley, principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthologia Polyglotta,</hi> a most valuable collection of the best translations
                    and imitations in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared some
                    admirable versions by Mr Goldwin Smith and Dean Merivale, which, with the other
                    English renderings extant at the time, will be found accompanying the literal
                    prose translation of the <hi rend="italic">Public School Selections,</hi>
                    executed by the Rev. George Burges for Bohn’s Classical Library (1854). This is
                    a useful volume, but the editor’s notes are worthless. In 1864 Major R. G.
                    Macgregor published an almost complete translation of the Anthology, a work of
                    stupendous industry and fidelity, which almost redeem the general mediocrity of
                    the execution. <hi rend="italic">Idylls and Epigrams,</hi> by R. Garnett (1869),
                    include about 140 translations or imitations, with some original compositions in
                    the same style. An agreeable little volume on the Anthology, by Lord Neaves, is
                    one of Collins’s series of <hi rend="italic">Ancient Classics for Modern
                    Beaders.</hi> Two recent critical contributions to the subject should be
                    noticed, the Rev. James Davies’s essay on Epigrams, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review</hi> (vol. cxvii,), especially valuable for its lucid
                    illustration of the distinction between Greek and Latin epigram; and the
                    brilliant disquisition in Mr J. A. Symonds’s <hi rend="italic">Studies of the
                    Greek Poets</hi> (1873).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Latin Anthology</hi> is the appellation bestowed upon a
                    collection of fugitive Latin verse, from the age of Ennius to about 1000 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> formed by Peter Burmann the Younger. Nothing
                    corresponding to the Greek anthology is known to have existed among the Romans,
                    though professional epigrammatists like Martial published their volumes on their
                    own account, and detached sayings were excerpted from such sententious authors
                    as Publius Syrus, while the <hi rend="italic">Priapeia</hi> were probably but
                    one among many collections on special subjects. The first general collection of
                    scattered pieces made by a modern scholar was Scaliger’s, in 1573, succeeded by
                    the more ample one of Pithceus, in 1594. Numerous additions, principally from
                    inscriptions, continued to be made, and in 1759 Burmann digested the whole into
                    his <hi rend="italic">Anthologia</hi><hi rend="italic">veterum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Latinorum Epigramma-tum</hi><hi rend="italic">et Poematum.</hi>
                    This, occasionally reprinted, has been the standard edition until recently; but
                    in 1869 Alexander Riese commenced a new and more critical recension, from which
                    many pieces improperly inserted by Buπnann are rejected, and his classified
                    arrangement is discarded for one according to the sources whence the poems have
                    been derived. The first volume contains those found in MSS., in the order of the
                    importance of these documents; those <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0119-0106"/> furnished by inscriptions are to follow. Being
                    formed by scholars actuated by no aesthetic principles of selection, but solely
                    intent on preserving everything they could find, the Latin anthology is much
                    more heterogeneous than the Greek, and unspeakably inferior. The really
                    beautiful poems of Petronius and Apuleius are more properly inserted in the
                    collected editions of their writings, and more than half the remainder consists
                    of the frigid conceits or pedantic professional exercises of grammarians of a
                    very late period of the empire, relieved by an occasional gem, such as the
                    apostrophe of the dying Hadrian to his spirit, or the epithalamium of Gallienus.
                    The collection is also, for the most part, too recent in date, and too
                    exclusively literary in character, to add much to our knowledge of classical
                    antiquity. The epitaphs are interesting, but the genuineness of many of them is
                    very questionable. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
