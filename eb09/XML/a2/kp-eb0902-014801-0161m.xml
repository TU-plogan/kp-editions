                    Welsh), a word of uncertain, and not improbably African origin, and by some
                    supposed to have originated in an imitation of the animal’s “chatter.”</p>
                <p>The zoological group denoted by the term “ape,” when used in its widest sense,
                    includes animals known by the familiar terms of “monkeys” and “baboons,” as well
                    as others bearing the less known names of “sapajous,” “sakis,” and “marmosets.”
                    In a more restricted sense the term “ape” is sometimes emphatically applied to
                    those of the whole group which are most man-like in structure, namely, to the
                    orang, the chimpanzee, the gorilla, and the gibbons.</p>
                <p>Certain other animals, of very different structure, are generally associated in
                    the same ordinal group with the apes. These other animals are the lemurs, or
                    lemuroids; called also “half-apes,” after their German designation of <hi
                    rend="italic">Halbaffen.</hi></p>
                <p>By Linnaeus these creatures, together with bats and man, were placed in his
                    highest and first order, to which he gave the name “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates,”</hi> dividing its contents into the four genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homo,</hi><hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Lemur,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Vespertilio.</hi> The bats are now by universal consent removed
                    from the order; and some eminent naturalists, notably Professor Alphonse
                    Milne-Edwards, are disposed to remove from it the lemurs also; but in every case
                    there can be no question but that the latter animals must at least rank as a <hi
                    rend="italic">sub-order,</hi> for which the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >“Lemuroidea”</hi> has been proposed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological
                    Society</hi> for 1864, ρ. 635.</p></note></p>
                <p>The question whether man should or should not be placed in the same zoological
                    order with the apes, must be decided according to the principles of
                    classification adopted. If that classification be purely morphological, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> be determined by form and structure only, he cannot
                    well be separated from them, at least by any naturalist who would also include
                    the lemurs in such order. The Linnean name <hi rend="italic">“Primates</hi>” has
                    been retained for the ape order, not only by naturalists who (like Professor
                    Huxley) retain man within its limits; but also by others <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> the Professors Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaire and Gervais), who
                    consider that he should be excluded from it. Cuvier, on the other hand, proposed
                    for the ordinal group of apes and lemurs only the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quadrumanes</hi> (or four-handed), giving to that order, within which he placed
                    man alone, the antithetical term <hi rend="italic">Bimanes.</hi> In this he has
                    been followed by very many naturalists, and in England, amongst others, by
                    Professor Owen; and, perhaps, the majority of writers since Cuvier have bestowed
                    on two distinct <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> the names <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quadrumana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bimana</hi> respectively.</p>
                <p>Priority of use determines our preference for the Linnean <hi rend="italic"
                    >naxas“</hi><hi rend="italic">Primates,”</hi> but this preference is reinforced
                    by considerations derived from anatomy and physiology.</p>
                <p>The whole of the apes, as indeed the whole of the halfapes also, differ from man
                    in having the great toe, or (as it is called in anatomy) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hallux,</hi> so constructed as to be able to oppose the other toes (much as our
                    thumb can oppose the fingers), instead of being parallel with the other toes,
                    and exclusively adapted for supporting the body on the ground. The prehensile
                    character of the hallux is fully maintained even in those forms which, like the
                    baboons, are terrestrial rather than arboreal in their habits, and are quite
                    quadrupedal in their mode of progression. It was this circumstance that led
                    Cuvier to bestow the name <hi rend="italic">Quadrumanes</hi> upon the apes and
                    lemurs. Now, if we accept, with Professor Owen, as the definition of the word
                    “foot,” <hi rend="italic">“an extremity in which the hallux forms the fulcrum in
                    standing or walking,”</hi> then man alone has a pair of feet. But, anatomically,
                    the foot of apes (as well as that of half-apes) agrees far more with the foot of
                    man than with his hand, and similarly the ape’s hand resembles man’s hand and
                    differs from his foot. Even estimated physiologically, or according to use and
                    employment, the hand throughout the whole order remains the <hi rend="italic"
                    >special</hi> prehensile organ; while the predominant function of the foot,
                    however prehensile it be, is constantly locomotive. Therefore the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Quadrumana</hi> is apt to be misleading, since, anatomically as
                    well as physiologically, both apes and men have two hands and a pair of
                    feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See further on
                    this subject, <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1867, p.
                    362.</p></note></p>
                <p>Apart then from man, the apes constitute the first sub-order of that which is the
                    most man-like order of the class <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> (beasts), and
                    which bears the name <hi rend="italic">“Primates.”</hi> Such being the position
                    of apes as a whole, they are zootomically divisible into a number of more and
                    more subordinate groups, termed respectively <hi rend="italic">families,
                    subfamilies,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi></p>
                <p>The following table exhibits what is believed to be, on the whole, the most
                    natural and convenient arrangement of these groups of apes :—</p>

                    warmer latitudes of the Old World. The second family, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cebidae,</hi> is as strictly confined to those of the New World.</p>
                <p>Of the three sub-families into which the Simiadae are divided, the first, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Simiinae,</hi> contains only the orang, the chimpanzee, the
                    gorilla, and the gibbons. These are the creatures which, anatomically, are the
                    most like man of all the apes, on which account they are often called the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t,</hi> ' anthropoid” apes. They are also termed, on account
                    of the relative breadth of their breast-bone or sternum, the “latisternal” or
                    “broad breast-boned” apes.</p>
                <p>The orang (N. <hi rend="italic">satyrus)</hi> constitutes the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Simia,</hi> which gives its name to the whole family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Simiadae),</hi> as well as to the sub-family <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Simiinae)</hi> to which it belongs. Of this genus there is but one certain
                    species, which is, however, subject to considerable variation. The orang is
                    exclusively confined to the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, where it frequents
                    the swampy forests near the coast. It attains a height of about 4 feet 4 inches;
                    but its bulk is considerable, its legs, however, being exceedingly short. Its
                    arms, on the contrary, are exceedingly long, reaching down to the ankle when the
                    animal is placed in an erect posture. In harmony with this structure the animal
                    rarely assumes, naturally, a truly erect posture, but walks resting on the
                    knuckles of its hands and the outer sides of its feet, the soles of the latter
                    being turned mainly inwards. Its motions are ordinarily very slow and
                    deliberate, and its demeanour in captivity is languid and melancholy. It is, in
                    a "wild state, exclusively a vegetable feeder, and arboreal in its habits,
                    forming in the trees a sort of nest or shelter of interwoven branches. The
                    animal is covered with long, reddish-brown hair, and there are no naked spaces
                    on the hinder part of the trunk. The forehead is rounded and rather high. Adult
                    males are furnished with a longish beard on the chin, and they may also develop
                    a large warty prominence, consisting of fibro-cellular tissue, on each side of
                    the face. There is no vestige of a tail. The hands are very long; but the thumb
                    is short, not reaching to the end of the metacarpal bone of the adjacent <hi
                    rend="italic">(index)</hi> digit. The feet have exceedingly long toes, except
                    the great toe <hi rend="italic">(hallux),</hi> which only reaches to the middle
                    of the proximal phalanx of the index digit of the foot. The hallux is often
                    destitute not only of a nail, but of the second or distal phalanx also; it·
                    nevertheless possesses an <hi rend="italic">opponens</hi> muscle. The orang has
                    twelve pairs of ribs, and has, compared with man, an extra wrist bone, or an <hi
                    rend="italic">os intermedium</hi> in its carpus. The brain of the orang has the
                    cerebrum greatly convoluted, and is altogether more like the brain of man than
                    is that of any other ape. A prolongation is developed from each ventricle of the
                    larynx, and these processes in the adult become enormous, uniting together in
                    front over the windpipe, and forming one great sac which extends down between
                    the muscles to the axilla. There are, however, no cheek pouches. The canine
                    teeth, especially of the adult males, are very large.</p>
                <p>The chimpanzee and gorilla together form the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes.</hi> Both of these species agree with the orang in being destitute
                    of any rudiment of a tail, in having no cheek pouches, and no naked spaces at
                    the hinder part of the trunk, as also in possessing tusk-like canines, and in
                    the habit of resting on the knuckles of the hand in walking on the ground and of
                    mainly dwelling in trees. The chimpanzee <hi rend="italic">(T.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">niger)</hi> is found in Western Africa, from the Gambia to the
                    Benguela, and extending inland to 2⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> E.</p>

                <p>long. It is the most man-like of the latistcrnal apes in the proportions of its
                    arms, as these only reach a little below the knees when the body is placed
                    upright. It is of moderate stature, never appearing to exceed 5 feet in height
                    In disposition it is lively and intelligent, and its playfulness in captivity
                    contrasts greatly with the lethargy of the orang. The forehead is not rounded,
                    but a bony, supra-orbital ridge extends transversely above the eyes. Its ears
                    are very large, and it has distinct eyebrows, eyelashes, and whiskers. The
                    pollex reaches nearly or quite to the base of the first phalanx of the index of
                    the hand, and the hallux to the proximal end of the second phalanx of the index
                    of the foot. There is no <hi rend="italic">os intermedium,</hi> in the carpus.
                    The laryngeal sacculus may, as in the orang, extend downwards to the axilla.
                    There are thirteen pairs of ribs.</p>
                <p>The gorilla (7 ’. <hi rend="italic">gorilla)</hi> is also West African, but has a
                    less extended range than the chimpanzee, namely, between the Cameroon and Congo
                    rivers only. It is the largest ape known, attaining a bulk of body considerably
                    exceeding that of man, though, on account of the shortness of its legs, it never
                    seems to exceed the height of 5 feet 6 inches. It was first made known to modems
                    by Dr Thomas Savage, but it appears to have been seen by Hanno of Carthage,<note

                    south of the pillars of Hercules. The gorilla has not such dark hair as has the
                    chimpanzee, being blackish-dun in colour, and becoming grey when old. Its skin,
                    however, is black. Its arms are longer than those of its congener, reaching
                    half-way down the shin. Its pollex reaches but very little beyond the proximal
                    end of the first phalanx of the index of the hand (slightly further than in the
                    chimpanzee), and its hallux to about the distal end of the proximal phalanx of
                    the index of its foot. The fingers and toes, however, are curiously syndactyle,
                    being bound together by the integument to the ends of the proximal phalanges.
                    The forehead is not rounded, the supra-orbital crest beinsj more prominent than
                    even in the chimpanzee; the ears too are smaller relatively. The larynx is
                    provided with enormous air-sacs, communicating with the ventricles and meeting
                    over the trachea, and extending to the axilla with age. There is no os
                    intermedium in the carpus, and there are thirteen pairs of ribs.</p>
                <p>The gibbons, or long-armed apes, form the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylo-bates,</hi> confined in the present day to the south-eastern continent of
                    Asia and the Indian Archipelago. There are several species, but individual
                    variation and sexual difference in colour are so great that their limits are not
                    yet well defined. One well-marked species, the largest of the genus, is the
                    siamang (77. <hi rend="italic">syndactylus)</hi> of Sumatra, which is remarkable
                    as being the ape with the best developed chin and widest breast-bone. It has
                    also the second and third toes united by skin down to the last joint of each.
                    Another well-marked form is the hoolock of Assam (77. <hi rend="italic"
                    >hoolock).</hi> In the gibbons we first find that part upon which the body rests
                    in sitting provided with naked callous spaces, termed (from that part of the
                    haunch bone to which they are applied, the <hi rend="italic">ischium)</hi>
                    “ischial callosities; <hi rend="superscript"> υ</hi> they are, however, still
                    small. Though vegetable feeders, the gibbons are probably less exclusively so
                    than are the yet higher apes before noticed. In captivity their manners are
                    gentle, although their activity is surprising; especially remarkable are the
                    enormous distances they can swing themselves by their long arms. In spite of
                    this length of arm, which seems to render their bodily proportions so unlike
                    those of man, the length of leg, when compared with the length of the trunk of
                    the body, is more human than in either of the two preceding genera. Another
                    point in which they approach nearest to man, is the quality of voice which at
                    least some of the species <hi rend="italic">(e.g. II. hoolock)</hi> possess.</p>
                <p>None of the gibbons have any rudiment of a tail, and they have no cheek pouches,
                    but the canines are elongated and tusk-like. When the body is erect, the arms
                    are so long that they reach the ground. The hallux is well developed, reaching
                    to the middle or end of the proximal phalanx of the index of the foot, while the
                    pollex only attains to, or reaches a little beyond, the proximal end of the <pb

                    is an os intermedium in the carpus. The laryngeal sacs are no longer
                    prolongations of the laryngeal ventricles, but open into the larynx above the
                    false vocal chords. The number of species is, as has been said, doubtful, but
                    the following kinds are often reckoned as distinct,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syndactylus, Lar, Leuciscus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Agilis,</hi><hi

                <p>On leaving the gibbons, which close the series of Anthropoid apes, we come at
                    once upon animals of very different aspect, and from creatures devoid of any
                    vestige of a tail, we pass at once to monkeys, which have that organ at its
                    maximum of development. These are the two genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semnopithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coldbus,</hi> which so closely
                    resemble each other as to be hardly separable, but for their different
                    geographical distributions. Together they form the subfamily <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semnopilhecinoe,</hi> and agree in having, as well as the long tail, arms
                    shorter than the legs, and a slender body. They have small ischiatic
                    callosities, but no cheek pouches. Their nails are compressed and pointed. Their
                    stomach is very elongated and exceedingly sacculated, and their hinder-most
                    lower grinding tooth has five tubercles. The laryngeal sac opens medianly into
                    the front of the larynx, and is an extension of the thyro-hyoid membrane. The
                    thumb is small or absent.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus,</hi> in which there is a small thumb,
                    is confined to South-Eastern Asia from the Himalaya southwards, the Indian
                    Archipelago being its headquarters. One species, Ä <hi rend="italic"
                    >entellus</hi> (the hounaman), is an object of religious veneration to the
                    Hindoos. Another very remarkable kind is found in Borneo. It is <hi
                    rend="italic">S.</hi><hi rend="italic">nasalis</hi> (the kahau, or proboscis
                    monkey), and, as its name implies, it has an exceedingly long nose. In the young
                    state, the nose is much smaller relatively, and is bent upwards. No similar
                    structure was known to exist in any other ape whatever till quite recently. Now,
                    however, the Rev. Father David (a Lazarist missionary, who has made many other
                    important discoveries in zoology), has found high up in the cold forests at
                    Moupin in Thibet, a large well-clothed species, with a small but distinct nose
                    excessively turned up, on which account the name &amp; <hi rend="italic"
                    >roxellanoe</hi> has been bestowed upon it. It is remarkable that a form,
                    reminding us of the young condition of <hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nasalis,</hi> should have been discovered in a region so remote
                    from the island of Borneo as is Thibet. It is also very remarkable that a monkey
                    of a genus the home of which is the warm Archipelago of India, should be found
                    in forests where frost and snow last several months in the year, when their only
                    food is tree buds, and tender shoots and twigs. The species of the genus to be

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Colobus</hi> is exclusively African, but the species
                    composing it only differ from the <hi rend="italic">Semnopitheci,</hi> in that
                    the thumb is generally absent or reduced to a small tubercle, which may or may

                <p>We now come to the concluding genera of the apes of the Old World, together
                    forming the third sub-family <hi rend="italic">Cyno-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pithecinoe.</hi> This is a very natural group, but one exceedingly difficult to
                    subdivide in a satisfactory manner, because the different characters gradually
                    alter as we pass from round-headed, long-tailed, and comparatively slender
                    monkeys to dog-faced, short-tailed, and massive baboons. All the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynopitliecinoe</hi> agree in having pretty well-developed thumbs
                    and a single stomach, as also in having the sides of the face distensible,
                    serving as pockets wherein food may be temporarily stored, and technically
                    called “cheek pouches.” The hair is often annulated. The ischiatic callosities
                    are larger than in the forms hitherto noticed, and in some kinds these parts
                    become greatly swollen at the period of sexual excitement, the enlargement
                    extending sometimes (as in <hi rend="italic">Macacus cyclopis)</hi> even to the
                    tail. The male external generative organs tend to assume a bright and varied
                    coloration, which is often accompanied with vivid hues on and about the face. By
                    common consent, the <hi rend="italic">Cynopithednoe</hi> are divided into at
                    least three genera, and by some naturalists <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> Μ.
                    Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaire) they have been divided into as many as seven.</p>
                <p>The first genus, <hi rend="italic">Cercopithecus,</hi> includes those species of
                    the sub-family, which by their length of tail and comparative slenderness, most
                    nearly approach the members of the preceding sub-family. Many of the species <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> the Diana and white-nosed monkeys) are very attractive
                    animais. Commonly the <hi rend="italic">Cercopitheci</hi> have four tubercles to
                    the last lower molar. The talapoin monkey <hi rend="italic">(C. talapoin)</hi>
                    has been made the type of a separate genus <hi rend="italic">(Miopithecus),</hi>
                    because it has but three such tubercles, while the mangabeys and white-eyelid
                    monkeys <hi rend="italic">(C.</hi><hi rend="italic">oethiops,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">collaris,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">/uliginosus)</hi> have been
                    separated off into a genus <hi rend="italic">Cercocebus,</hi> because in them
                    the last lower molar has five tubercles. All the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The next genus, <hi rend="italic">Macacus,</hi> is Asiatic, with the exception of
                    the Barbary ape, or magot (Jf. <hi rend="italic">imius),</hi> which is found in
                    Northern Africa and on the Rock of Gibraltar. Already, <pb break="no"

                    >Cercopitheci,</hi> notably in the mangabeys, the muzzle has acquired a greater
                    prolongation. This becomes still more marked in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macaci.</hi> It is this greater production of muzzle, the greater size in the
                    ischiatic callosities, the frequent shortness of the tail, and the different
                    geographical distribution, which can alone be given as differentiating these
                    animals from the <hi rend="italic">Cercopitheci.</hi> In some kinds the tail is
                    long. Occasionally (as in the wanderoo, Jf. <hi rend="italic">silenus)</hi> it
                    is tufted at the end and short. Sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic">Μ.

                    inuus,</hi> it is absent. On account of this absence of tail, this species has
                    sometimes been made the type of a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inuus.</hi></p>
                <p>Another species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">niger</hi> (from
                    Celebes and Batchian), has, on account of the much greater production of its
                    muzzle, been made the type of another genus, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynopithecus.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Macaci</hi> present us with the most northern forms of
                    apes, namely, that of Gibraltar, and <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >speciosus</hi> of Japan. Father David has lately brought from Moupin, in
                    Thibet, a new species (Jf. <hi rend="italic">thibetanus')</hi> which inhabits
                    snowy mountains, and is clothed suitably for such a habitat, in thick and dense
                    fur. In addition to the <hi rend="italic">Macaci</hi> already mentioned, we may
                    name the species <hi rend="italic">Sinicus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pileatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aureus, Cynomolgus, Silenus, Rhesus,

                <p>The remaining apes of the Old World are the baboons, which are entirely confined
                    to Africa, and to that part of Asia which is zoologically African, namely,
                    Arabia. These animals, which constitute the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephalus,</hi> have the characters of the <hi rend="italic">Macaci</hi>
                    still further developed in having still larger callosities, and a muzzle so
                    extremely produced as to give the head the appearance of that of a dog, whence
                    their generic name. The general form has also here become very massive, and the
                    limbs being sub-equal in length, the appearance, like the locomotion, is
                    quadrupedal. But the baboons have not only the muzzle so greatly produced, they
                    have also the nostrils terminal in position like those of a hound and unlike
                    what we have yet met with. The species <hi rend="italic">C. gelada</hi> of
                    Abyssinia and <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">obscurus</hi> form
                    exceptions to this condition, as they have the nostrils placed as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Macaci,</hi> on which account they have been made the type of a
                    distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Theropithecus.</hi></p>
                <p>In the other <hi rend="italic">Cynocephali,</hi> the tail may be moderately long,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">C. hamadryads,</hi> or very short, as in the mandrill,
                    <hi rend="italic">C. mormon.</hi> In the last-named species we again meet with
                    much bulk of body, as it exceeds the chimpanzee in this respect. It is also
                    remarkable for its bright coloration, the cheeks being brilliant blue, the nose
                    vermilion, and the beard golden-yellow. Other species described are <hi
                    rend="italic">Sphinx, Olivaceus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Babuin,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Anubis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Doguera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Porcarius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leucophaeus.</hi></p>
                <p>The baboons are the least arboreal and the least frugivorous of the Old World
                    apes, some species, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the chacma of Southern Africa
                    <hi rend="italic">(C. porcarius'),</hi> living habitually amidst rocks, and
                    feeding on eggs, large insects, and scorpions, as well as on vegetable food.</p>
                <p>In the whole series of Old World apes we find the same number of different kinds
                    of teeth as in man, the dental formula being—</p>
                <p>τ «Z« 1-1 2 — 2 <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> 3—3 <hi rend="subscript"> =</hi> 16

                <p>or thirty-two teeth in all. Again, in the whole series the two nostrils are
                    divided the one from the other by a narrow septum; and if the skull be examined,
                    a long bony tube (the <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius
                    externus)</hi> is seen to lead inwards on each side to the internal ear.
                    Moreover, the thumbs, when present, are always more or less opposable to the
                    other fingers.</p>
                <p>In passing to the second family of apes—the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi> or
                    apes of the New World—we find them to form a very distinct and easily-defined
                    group, and a little experience readily enables an observer to pronounce at a
                    glance that a given ape belongs either to the Old or the New World, as the case
                    may be.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> are more thoroughly arboreal in their habits
                    than are the <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe.</hi> Ranging over tropical America,
                    they have their headquarters in the forests of Brazil, a region where most
                    animal forms put on a more decidedly arboreal character. Accordingly, it is
                    amongst the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> that we meet with, for the first
                    time, a special arboreal organ—namely, a prehensile taiL Such a tail has its
                    free end curled, and capable of grasping with greater or less tenacity the
                    objects about which it coils. Again, in the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi> the
                    septum between the nostrils is broad, instead of narrow, imparting to the
                    physiognomy a markedly different character. In passing to these American apes we
                    entirely lose cheek pouches and ischial callosities; while the thumb, even where
                    best developed, is capable of but a very partial opposition to the other
                    fingers, bending almost in the same plane with the latter, so as to be more like
                    a fifth finger than a thumb. We also constantly find an additional premolar
                    tooth on each side of each jaw, and that bony tube, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius externus,</hi> is wanting.</p>

                <p>None of the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> attain the bulk of the larger baboons,
                    nor have any such prominent muzzles as have the latter</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> are subdivisible into five sub-families :—1.
                    <hi rend="italic">Cebinae;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Mycetinoe;</hi> 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pitheciinoe;</hi><hi rend="italic">4.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nyctipithecinae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, 5. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapalinae.</hi></p>
                <p>The first sub-family consists of the four genera, <hi rend="italic">Ateles,
                    Enodes, Lagothrix,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cebus.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> is composed of the spider monkeys, which,
                    as their name implies, have long and slender limbs. They have also a very long
                    tail, which is in the highest degree prehensile, being naked beneath towards the
                    tip, for more secure prehension. So powerful is the grasp of this organ that the
                    whole body can be sustained by it alone. It even serves as a fifth hand, as
                    detached objects, otherwise out of reach, can be grasped by it, and brought
                    towards the hand or mouth. Their prehension is in other respects exceptionally
                    defective, as the spider monkeys alone amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae</hi> (like the <hi rend="italic">Colobi</hi> amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadoe)</hi> have the thumb reduced to a mere tubercle. Their
                    laryngeal sac opens medianly, but from the back part of the trachea, just below
                    the cricoid cartilage.</p>
                <p>The spider monkeys are very gentle in disposition, and, by this and by their long
                    limbs and special fitness for treelife, seem to represent in an analogous manner
                    in the New World the gibbons of the Old. Nevertheless, in spite of their
                    admirable adaptation for arboreal life, their comparatively slow progression
                    offers a marked contrast to the vigorous agility of the gibbons. Their hair is
                    long, but not woolly. Species described are— <hi rend="italic">Ater,
                    Pentadactylus, Paniscus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Marginatus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Belzebuth, Melanochir, Hybridus, Vellerosus, Albifrons, Rufiventris,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Variegatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Griescens, Cucullatus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Fuscipes.</hi></p>
                <p>Three species of ape having much general resemblance to spider monkeys have been
                    erected into the genus <hi rend="italic">Eriodes (E.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arachnoïdes,</hi><hi rend="italic">hemidactylus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypoxanthus').</hi> These animals, which are from South-Eastern Brazil, have
                    the fur woolly, the thumb more or less rudimentary, the nails very laterally
                    compressed, and the nostrils more approximated than in the other <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The woolly monkeys, <hi rend="italic">Lagothrix,</hi> differ from the two
                    preceding genera in having the thumbs well developed. Their nails are compressed
                    laterally, as in <hi rend="italic">Eriodes,</hi> but their nostrils are not
                    approximated. As their name implies, their fur is woolly. Like <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eriodes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> they have the tail strongly
                    prehensile, and naked beneath towards the tip. The species which have been
                    described as distinct are— <hi rend="italic">Canus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Humboldtii, Castelnaui, Tschudi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Geoffroyi.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Cebus,</hi> the typical genus of American apes, is
                    composed of the sapajous, so commonly seen in captivity, and so much used for
                    the exhibition of tricks of various kinds. Smaller in size, they are more robust
                    in form than are the spider monkeys. They have well-developed thumbs, and their
                    tail is curled at the end, but, not being naked beneath, is less strongly
                    prehensile than in the three preceding genera. The sapajous have a pleasing
                    voice, a flute-like whistling tone. The different species are very ill-defined,
                    the individual differences being so numerous and so considerable. The species
                    described are the following :— <hi rend="italic">Capucinus, Hypoleucus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elegans, Robustum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Apella, Cirrifer,
                    Flaυus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Castaneus, Barbatus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Frontatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Chrysopus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Variegatus,
                    Versicolor, Leucocephalus, Flavescens, An-nellatus, Subcristatus, Capillatus,
                    Fatuellus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vellerosus.</hi></p>
                <p>The next sub-family of American apes is very distinct, consisting, as it does, of
                    a single genus, <hi rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> composed of the howling monkeys.
                    These creatures are the most bulky of the American apes, and are those the
                    muzzles of which are the most projecting. If the spider monkeys may be
                    considered the analogical representatives of the gibbons, the howlers may
                    similarly be esteemed those of the baboons. They are sluggish, and apparently
                    stupid animals, but have a wonderful power of voice, facilitated by an enormous
                    distension of the body of the hyoid bone into a large, deep, bony cup, sheltered
                    between the jaws, which are specially deep for that purpose. Into this cup is
                    received one of the three or five sacs with which the larynx is provided. The
                    thyroid cartilage is very large. The howlers have long, very prehensile tails,
                    naked beneath towards the tips. Their thumbs are well developed. Some of the
                    species show much brilliance of colour, with bright <pb break="no"

                    however, so much individual variation, or so many local varieties, that the
                    species are as yet very little determined. The sexual difference in colour is
                    great in one species—the male being deep black, and the female pale straw
                    colour. Amongst the species described may be named— <hi rend="italic">Seniculus,
                    Ursinus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Caraya, Rufimanus, Niger,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Villosus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Palliatus.</hi></p>
                <p>The third sub-family of American apes is composed of very peculiar forms, termed
                    Sakis, which are subdivided into two genera, <hi rend="italic">Pithecia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Brachyurus,</hi> according as the tail is long or short. They
                    are together distinguished from all the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> yet
                    noticed, by not having the tail prehensile, even when long; also by having the
                    lower incisor teeth inclined forwards, instead of standing up vertically. Great
                    differences as to the hair exist in this group, some having long hair over the
                    whole body, others on the head, and others on the chin and cheeks, while a
                    species of Brachyurus (A. <hi rend="italic">Caimis')</hi> has the head naturally
                    bald. Of the genus <hi rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> the following species have
                    been described :— <hi rend="italic">Leucocephala, Rufiventer,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Monachus, Satanas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Chiropotes,
                    Albinasa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysocephala.</hi> Of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachyurus,</hi> besides <hi rend="italic">Caimis,</hi> only <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rubicundus</hi> has as yet been described.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Brachyuri</hi> are the only American apes with short tails,
                    and they are the least arboreal, frequenting bushes rather than trees. They are
                    very timid creatures, and gentle, and rather slow in their movements. It is but
                    very rarely that any of the <hi rend="italic">Pitheciinae</hi> have been brought
                    to Europe alive.</p>
                <p>The next sub-family, <hi rend="italic">Nyctipithecinae,</hi> contains three
                    genera, which have a long but not prehensile tail, fairly-developed thumbs, and
                    vertical lower incisor teeth. These animals are, in part at least,
                    insectivorous.</p>
                <p>The typical genus, <hi rend="italic">Nyctipithecus,</hi> contains only the
                    night-apes, or douroucoulis (2V. <hi rend="italic">felinus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">leτnurinus, oseryi, rufipes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spixii),</hi> which have, in harmony with their noctural habits, enormous eyes.
                    The orbits, though closely approximated, are nevertheless separated by a
                    complete bony system. The head is rounded, but greatly drawn out posteriorly.
                    The nostrils are rather approximated.</p>
                <p>The beautiful little squirrel monkey, or Saimiri, and three allied species <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ch.</hi><hi rend="italic">ustus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >entomophagus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oerstedii),</hi> form the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysothrix.</hi> They are distinguished from all other apes by
                    the great backward prolongation of the bony cranium, the orbits of which, though
                    smaller than those of <hi rend="italic">Nyctipithecus,</hi> are, nevertheless,
                    separated, but by an imperfect bony septum.</p>
                <p>A few other kinds of American apes, together forming the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Callithrix,</hi> somewhat resemble the night apes, but that the eyes are much
                    smaller, and the nostrils wider apart. They differ from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysothrix</hi> in having small canine teeth, and the tail furnished with long
                    hairs. The species of this genus are— <hi rend="italic">Moloch,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Personatus, Amictus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gigo, Melanochir,
                    Biscolor, Bonacophilus, Omatus,</hi> and Cαsiαnecwenim.</p>
                <p>There remains now to notice but one more group of apes, those which have been
                    classed as the last sub-family —the <hi rend="italic">Hapalinoe,</hi> marmosets,
                    or oustitis. These animals are so different from all that have gone before that
                    there is probably almost as much to be said for ranking them as a family by
                    themselves as for considering them, as is here done, but a sub-family. Much,
                    however, as they differ from all the other apes, they manifest their affinity to
                    the rest of the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> by the absence of the <hi
                    rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius externus,</hi> and by the
                    presence of the extra premolar tooth on each side of each jaw. They have,
                    however, the same total number of teeth as have man and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadae.</hi> This is occasioned by their not possessing any third true molar,
                    either above or below; so that their dentition thus differs from that of the Old
                    World apes in two points, instead of only one. In all the apes we have yet
                    noticed, except the orang, the hallux is well developed, while in the marmosets
                    it is exceedingly small. The hand, however, is yet more exceptional, as the
                    thumb is not at all opposable, while, in common with all the other fingers, it
                    is furnished with a long, curved, and pointed claw. The tail is not prehensile,
                    but long, and furnished with more or less elongated hairs. In several, and
                    especially the more commonly seen species, a tuft of long hairs projects
                    outwards and backwards on each side of the head. These animals are very small,
                    the largest being about the size of squirrels. They are, like squirrels, active
                    in their motions, and arboreal in their habits, living in small troops, and
                    eating insects as well as fruit. They are very difficult to keep in captivity in
                    northern climates; but, nevertheless, they have occasionally bred in England,
                    bringing forth as <pb break="no"

                    apes habitually bring forth but one. There arc many different species of
                    marmosets, and they have been divided into two genera, according as tho lower
                    canine (eye) teeth arc or are not decidedly larger than the incisors
                    (cutting-teeth) between them; those kinds in which the inferiorand incisor
                    canines are almost of equal length being retained in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >∏apale,</hi> while those in which the lower incisors are much shorter than the
                    adjacent canines are taken to form the genus <hi rend="italic">Midas.</hi> It
                    seems doubtful, however, whether this generic distinction can ultimately be
                    maintained, an intermediate condition existing in some forms. The species of the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> are— <hi rend="italic">Jacchus, Albιcottιs,

                <p>To describe generally the anatomy of apes would be, in fact, to describe in an
                    elementary manner the general anatomy of man. It is necessary, therefore, here
                    to assume that the reader has already an elementary knowledge of human anatomy,
                    and to refer such readers as have not such knowledge to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">The External Form and
                    Clothing.</hi></p>
                <p>The difference in bulk between the different members of the group <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g. Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hapale)</hi> is
                    extreme, being greater than that between a man and a common squirrel.</p>
                <p>The proportions of the body as regards the relative lengths of the two pairs of
                    limbs one with the other, and both with that of the trunk, vary considerably.
                    Both pairs may be much elongated, as in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobaies,</hi> and either sub-equally, as in the first of these
                    genera, or with the arms very greatly in excess, as in the second. The legs may
                    be excessively short, and the arms, at the same time, excessively long, as in
                    the orang. Both pairs may be short and sub-equal, as often in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynopithecinoe.</hi> Only in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nyctipithecinoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hapxalinoe</hi> does the excess in
                    length of the lower limbs over the upper exceed or equal that which is found in
                    man. The length of the tail presents some noteworthy points. At its first
                    appearance it is found at once at its greatest absolute length, and also greatly
                    developed relatively, being about twice the length of the trunk. Its greatest
                    relative length is, however, attained in <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> where it
                    reaches three times the length of the trunk. The constancy of the degree of its
                    development varies much in different groups. In the greater number of genera it
                    is long in all the species, and in some <hi rend="italic">(Simia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Troglodytes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hylobates)</hi> it is

                    >Cynocephalus.</hi> A production of the muzzle, necessitated by the presence of
                    large teeth, exists already in <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes;</hi> but in the
                    baboons, not only is this prolongation carried much further, but the terminal
                    position of the nostrils gives an emphatically dog-like aspect to the face.</p>
                <p>The eyes may be small compared with the size of the head, as in the baboons; they
                    may, on the contrary, attain a relatively enormous size, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nyctipithecus.</hi> They are always forwardly directed, and never much more
                    separated one from another than in man. They may, however, be much more closely
                    approximated, as notably in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix.</hi></p>
                <p>The external ears are always well developed, and have very generally their
                    postero-superior angle pointed. They may be large and small in the same genus,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes.</hi> Only in the gorilla do we find
                    present, even in a rudimentary condition, that soft depending portion of the
                    human ear which is termed the “lobule.”</p>
                <p>The nose has scarcely ever more than a very slight prominence, and yet an
                    enormous development is to be met with in <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi> has been just mentioned. These apertures may
                    be closely approximated, as in all the <hi rend="italic">Simiadae,</hi> or they
                    may be separated one from the other by a broad septum, as in the <hi

                <p>The lips are generally thin, but may be very extensive, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia.</hi></p>
                <p>The hands are generally provided with thumbs, though these organs (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Colobus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles)</hi> may be represented
                    only by small nailless tubercles. The thumb <hi rend="italic">(pollex)</hi> is
                    more human in its proportions in the chimpanzee than in any other of the highest
                    apes. As compared with the length of the hand, it is most man-like in the lowest

                    <hi rend="italic">Hapalinoe.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hallux</hi> (great toe) is never rudimentary like the
                    pollex. It is never, as it often is in man, the longest digit of the foot, but
                    is constantly the shortest one. As compared with the entire length of the foot,
                    it is most human in the chimpanzee and some gibbons, and smallest of all in the
                    orang, and next smallest in <hi rend="italic">Hapale.</hi> More detailed
                    proportions will be more appropriately given in speaking of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>Every digit is provided with a nail, except the hallux of the orang and those
                    rudimentary tubercles already spoken of as representing thumbs in <hi

                    hallux is flat in every species, but the other nails are never so flat as are
                    the nails of man. The lateral compression of the nails becomes more strongly
                    marked in some <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">Eriodes,</hi> but attains its extreme in the <hi rend="italic"

                    of a long, curved, and sharply-pointed claw.</p>
                <p>All the apes, without exception, differ from man in having the body almost
                    entirely clothed with copious hair, and especially in never having the back
                    naked. In the gibbons, the <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecinoe,</hi> and the <hi

                    posture. These naked spaces increase in size as we descend through the series of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cynopithecinae,</hi> and are subject to a tumefaction
                    (sometimes excessive and extending to parts adjacent) at the season of sexual

                    thereon in <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi><hi rend="italic">oedipus</hi> and in
                    some of the <hi rend="italic">Semnopitheci,</hi> whilst certain of the <hi

                    monkey, <hi rend="italic">Μ. sinicus)</hi> have the hair of the head long, and
                    radiating in all directions from a central point on the sinciput. A beard is
                    developed in the male orang, and <hi rend="italic">Cercopithecos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Diana</hi> has long hair on the cheeks and chin. The wanderoo <hi
                    rend="italic">(Macacus sιlenus)</hi> has the face encircled by a kind of mane of
                    very long hairs, and many of the marmosets have a long tuft of hairs on each
                    side of the head. The American apes exhibit some extremes respecting hair
                    development. Thus in some of the howlers (as in some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colobi</hi> of the Old World) the hair of the flanks is greatly elongated. Some
                    also have an elongated beard, but the latter structure attains its maximum of
                    development in the couxio <hi rend="italic">(Pithecia satanas).</hi> Some of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pitheciinae</hi> have the hair of the whole body and tail very
                    long, others have the head of the female furnished with elongated hair, while
                    another species <hi rend="italic">(Brachyurus</hi><hi rend="italic">calvus)</hi>
                    has the head bald. Long hair may be developed from the shoulders, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">hamadryas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hapale humeralifer;</hi> or may form a tuft at the end of the

                    >Cynocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">gelada.</hi></p>
                <p>The direction of the hair may sometimes vary in nearly allied forms. Thus the
                    hairs on the arm and forearm respectively may be so directed that the apices
                    converge towards the elbow. Such is the case in most of the lati-stemal apes,
                    yet in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi><hi rend="italic">agilis</hi> all the
                    hair of both these limb segments is directed towards the wrist.</p>
                <p>The hair presents generally no remarkable character as to its structure. It may,
                    however, assume a very silky nature, as in <hi rend="italic">Hapale
                    rosalia,</hi> or assume the character of wool, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eriodes,</hi> and as in that remarkable form recently discovered by Father

                    inhabits the snowy ranges of the Thibet mountains, and is provided for this
                    habitat by a modification in its hairy clothing similar to that which suited the
                    extinct mammoth for the severity of its Siberian home. This fact as to <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. thibetanus</hi> has an interesting bearing on fossil forms,
                    which we shall have to consider later.</p>
                <p>Great brilliance of colour is sometimes found in the naked parts of the body,

                    turquoise blue, green, golden yellow, and vermilion appear, in various
                    combinations, in one or other or both of these regions, and become especially
                    brilliant at the epochs of sexual excitement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>The skeleton of apes generally, if we except the tail, consists of but few more
                    bones than that of man. The proportions of its parts, except as regards the
                    relative length of the limb bones, are also much as in man; nor are their
                    shapes, except those of the jaws and haunch bones, greatly different. The same
                    general resemblance may be predicated of their minute structure, though the
                    osseous tissue is generally rather dense, and the medullary cavity in the long
                    bones small <hi rend="italic">The Axial Skeleton.—The Skull.</hi></p>
                <p>The axial skeleton consists of the skull and the vertebral column, and the
                    general shape of its more anterior portion, the skull, has already been
                    indicated when speaking of the head as part of the external form. It is scarcely
                    ever so evenly balanced on the occipital condyles as in man.</p>
                <p>The artificial division of the skull into a <hi rend="italic">cranial</hi> and a
                    <hi rend="italic">facial</hi> portion may be here conveniently adopted from
                    human anatomy. The proportion of the latter portion to the former varies greatly
                    from age and sex, owing mainly to the differences produced through the
                    development of large and powerful canine teeth in the adult males of most
                    species. This proportion also varies in an irregular manner as we descend
                    (through the series of apes) from those which are most like man. Thus the facial
                    part is already very large in the orang and chimpanzee, much more so than in <hi
                    rend="italic">Scmnopithecus,</hi> where most of the ape cranial characters are
                    moderately developed, or even than in many <hi rend="italic">Cercopitheci;</hi>
                    but it attains its maximum of relative size in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephali,</hi> above all in <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >porcarius.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> the facial part is
                    relatively smaller than in the <hi rend="italic">Simiadae,</hi> with the

                    >Chrysothrix</hi> the facial portion of the skull is relatively smaller than
                    even in man himseif. The relation of the face to the cranium (or brain case) is
                    best shown by the craniofacial angle, which is estimated by means of two lines,
                    one drawn parallel to the base of the skull (from the front margin of the
                    occipital foramen to the anterior end of the cerebral surface of the
                    presphenoid), the other drawn from the front end of that base to the middle of
                    the lower margin of the upper jaw.</p>
                <p>No ape, especially no ape of the Old World, presents so elevated and rounded a
                    contour in the frontal region as does man. It is in American forms, especially
                    in the genus <hi rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> that we find the greatest
                    resemblance to man in this respect; but the skull is lofty in the orang.</p>
                <p>The convexity of the occiput is well marked in <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi><hi

                <p>Ridges for muscular attachment, or other bony prominences, more or less
                    disguising the rotundity of the cranium, are very generally developed, except in
                    the smallest species. Such ridges are met with at once at their very maximum of

                    of the neck. A very largely developed supra-orbital ridge runs transversely
                    above the orbits, which it obliquely overhangs. The orang has no supra-orbital
                    ridge, but in the other large <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi> all these ridges
                    are more or less developed, and moderate sagittal and lambdoidal ridges are

                <p>The vertebral or spinal column in all apes consists of the same regions as it

                    That beautiful sigmoid curvature which exists in the human spine is not found in

                    Except in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi>
                    it is almost always perforated by the vertebral artery, instead of being merely

                    massive, and may, by very rare exception, develop a spinous process. The spines
                    of the cervical vertebrae do not bifurcate beyond the second, and generally the
                    spine of the seventh vertebra is the longest, at least with the exception of
                    that of the axis. In the gorilla and orang, however, the spines of the third,
                    fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae are exceedingly elongated and longer than
                    that of the seventh. The cervical neural laminae are wider antero-posteriorly,

                    less than half the length of the dorsal in the gorilla. The lumbar spinous
                    processes are vertical, or project backwards in the <hi rend="italic"

                    project strongly forwards, especially in the lower <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae.</hi> The lumbar transverse processes always project outwards, more or
                    less at right angles to the axis of the spine, or else forwards. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> they are never
                    inclined ventrally, but in some of the lower <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi>
                    they begin to be so; in the lower <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> they are so
                    very decidedly. Only in <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia</hi> are they inclined somewhat dorsally. In the last two genera the
                    lumbar vertebrae are broader than their length; in most other forms length is in
                    excess. The length of the individual lumbar vertebrae, compared with the dorsal
                    <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the longest lumbar with the ninth dorsal), is
                    greatest in the lower <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi> rather less in the lower
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe,</hi> and least in the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> attains its greatest absolute length in the
                    gorilla, but it is relatively longer than in man in all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe.</hi> Of all the inferior apes, <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> has
                    the relatively longest sacrum. The number of vertebrae inincluded in the sacrum
                    varies more or less with age. In the apes below the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe</hi> there are generally only two or three sacral vertebrae. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles, Hylobates,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brachyurus,</hi>
                    there may be four; while in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> there are always
                    five, and sometimes six sacral vertebrae. In most apes the sacrum and lumbar
                    vertebrae appear to lie in one slightly curved line. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes</hi> presents in this respect a great contrast to the human
                    structure. In <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> the sacro-vertebral angle is rather
                    more marked; but sometimes in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi> it is so much
                    so as almost to rival that of man. The same may be said of the concavity of the
                    anterior surface of the sacrum. It is most marked in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephali,</hi> and is more so in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> than in <hi
                    rend="italic">Troglodytes.</hi> The sacrum gradually tapers posteriorly in <hi
                    rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi> and more or
                    less so in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> In the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadoe,</hi> however, the sacrum is very wide at its anterior end, and it
                    then very rapidly contracts backwards, so that the transverse diameter of the
                    third sacral vertebra is very much narrower than that of the first. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> generally, and especially in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles,</hi> the contraction is not so marked.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">caudal</hi><hi rend="italic">vertebroe</hi> are always more

                    occasioned rather by a diminution in the size of the component vertebrae than by
                    a decrease in their number. In the other forms the number varies between twenty
                    and thirty-three, the latter being the number attained in the genus <hi

                    three to one; in the other longest-tailed genera it is rarely so large as two to

                    >Sèmnopithecinoe,</hi> where also the individual caudal vertebrae attain their
                    greatest length, namely, two inches. The caudal vertebrae generally increase in
                    length as we proceed backwards from the sacrum, till about the seventh, eighth,
                    or ninth, which, with the tenth and eleventh, are the longest caudal vertebrae
                    in most long-tailed forms. In <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> however, it is the
                    eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth vertebrae that are the longest. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Inuus</hi> the
                    caudal vertebrae decrease in length as we proceed backwards. Except in the forms
                    just named, all the first four caudal vertebrae possess a complete neural arch,
                    sometimes six are so provided, but only in <hi rend="italic">A teles</hi> does
                    the number attain eight. With the same exceptions, again, the first four caudal
                    vertebrae unite by articular processes, while transverse processes (single or
                    antero-posteriorly double) exist in a great part of the tail. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles</hi> the caudal vertebrae are (as might be expected from
                    the very prehensile character of the tail) exceptionally provided with bony
                    processes serving as points of muscular attachment. <hi rend="italic">Chevron
                    bones</hi> and processes for their attachment are altogether wanting only in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Macacus inuus.</hi>
                    They attain their maximum in <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> where they present
                    almost every variety of development in one or other part of the caudal
                    region.</p>
                <p>Certain vertebral processes, which in man are generally inconspicuous, and which
                    are but little developed in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> attain in lower
                    forms a marked development. These are the <hi rend="italic">metapophyses</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">anapophyses.</hi> The first of these generally appear
                    about the eighth or ninth dorsal vertebra, and may thence be traced backwards
                    into the anterior caudal vertebrae, where they end by coalescing with the
                    prezygopophyses. In <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> these processes may sometimes
                    be traced as far forward as the third cervical vertebra. The anapophyses become,
                    below the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> very conspicuous, projecting outwards
                    and backwards from one vertebra, and embracing the prezygopophysis of the

                    appear to coalesce with the transverse processes in the tail, and thus they may
                    be developed almost throughout the vertebral column. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae</hi> often develop <hi rend="italic">hyperapophyses</hi> in the last
                    dorsal and in the lumbar vertebrae. These processes are somewhat similar to <hi
                    rend="italic">anapophyses,</hi> but are placed much higher, and each pair
                    embraces the spinous process of the vertebra next behind.</p>
                <p>In most apes <hi rend="italic">the sternum</hi> is quite narrow, and consists of
                    a more or less enlarged manubrium, followed by a chain of sub-equal and
                    antero-posteriorly elongated bones from three to six in number. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> alone do we find a broad sternum, or one consisting
                    of a manubrium, followed by one bone only, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylobates.</hi> The orang presents a singular peculiarity, in that the
                    breast-bone long remains made up of ossifications arranged in pairs, side by
                    side, successively. The total number of <hi rend="italic">ribs</hi> has already
                    been indicated in speaking of the dorsal vertebrae. The <hi rend="italic">true
                    ribs</hi> are seven in number on each side in the highest forms, but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> there are sometimes eight. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles</hi> there are sometimes nine pairs. In <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi>
                    the number varies from six to eight, and it is seven or eight in the other
                    genera. The “angles” of the ribs are never so marked as in man. They are most
                    marked in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi><hi rend="italic">Pithecia</hi> is
                    distinguished by the greater relative breadth of the ribs. In no ape is the
                    thorax half as broad again as it is deep from back to breast. Nevertheless, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> its transverse diameter exceeds its depth
                    by from about one-fourth to a little under one-third of the latter. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles</hi> (and sometimes also in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes)</hi>
                    the thorax is wider than it is deep, but in all the rest it is narrow, being
                    deeper than it is wide.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Appendicular Skeleton.</hi><hi rend="italic"/></p>
                <p>The development of this part of the skeleton has been indicated in a general
                    manner in speaking of the external form. The length of the pelvic limb compared
                    with the pectoral one—the foot and hand being removed—attains in no ape the
                    proportion that it does in man, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 145 to 100; the
                    nearest approximation being made by <hi rend="italic">Nycti-pithecus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Callithrix,</hi> namely, about 137 to 100. The length of the
                    foot, compared with that of the hand, is exceptionally small in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> namely, from 84 up to 115 to 100. Its greatest
                    relative length is in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix,</hi> viz., about 177 to
                    100. In man it is about 134 to 100. The entire pectoral limb (measured from the
                    summit, of the head of the humerus to the distal end of the longest digit) is
                    absolutely longest in the gorilla and orang. Its proportion to the spine is
                    greatest in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> where it may attain the proportion
                    of 222 to 100. Next come <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> 174, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia</hi> 170, the gorilla 150, and the chimpanzee 152. The rest vary from 121
                    to a little shorter than the spine, except certain of the lower <hi
                    rend="italic">C</hi><hi rend="italic">ebidoe,</hi> thus in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysothrix</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> it is less than 84 to 100.
                    Only in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi>
                    is the pectoral limb, without the hand, shorter than the spine.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> of the gorilla presents a remarkable likeness
                    to that of man, but that of its congener, the chimpanzee (the posterior
                    vertebral angle being so acute), is less like man’s than is that of the orang.
                    The size of the supraspinous fossa, as compared with the infra-spinous one,
                    attains its maximum in the gorilla and <hi rend="italic">Mycetes.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">Simia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pitheciinoe</hi> the
                    supra-spinous fossa is exceptionally small. The margin, corresponding with the
                    superior margin of man’s scapula, is generally convex in the forms below the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> (except <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pithecia),</hi> and attains its maximum of convexity in aged <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephali.</hi> A suprascapular notch is not well defined in the

                    from the bridge of bone encircling this foramen. This process exists in no other

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">clavicle</hi> is well developed in every species of the
                    order, and that of the orang is absolutely the largest; and it is longest,
                    compared with the spine, in that animal and in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi>
                    being as 28 or 32 to 100, while in the lower <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> it
                    may be less than 12 to 100. This bone is exceptionally slender in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> and is broadest in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Cynopithecinoe.</hi> In the lower
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi> a fossa is excavated beneath the acromial end of
                    the bone. Rarely, as in <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi> there is a very prominent
                    deltoidal ridge.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> presents in all apes the same fossae and
                    prominences as in man. Its length, as compared with the spine, is in <hi
                    rend="italic">IIylobates</hi> 70 or 80 to 100; but in most apes its length, thus
                    compared, is between 45 and 30 to 100. The articular surface of the head is
                    directed backwards and inwards, instead of almost exclusively inwards, as in
                    man. In this respect man is most resembled by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe.</hi> The tuberosities may project upwards slightly above the
                    articular head, as in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi> Generally they are
                    about on a level with its top, but may be decidedly below it, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles, Hylobates,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> The
                    radial border of the bicipital groove may be very prominent, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi> The groove may be spanned by a bridge of bone,
                    as sometimes in the chimpanzee. The position of the nutrient foramen varies even
                    in different individuals. The supinator ridge is especially developed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephalus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cebus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hapale.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> it is only
                    slightly developed. The external condyle is distinct in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe;</hi> in the other genera it is closely applied to the capitellum. A
                    supra-condyloid foramen is never present normally in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadoe,</hi> but is present more or less constantly in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Cebus</hi> downwards, being perhaps most
                    frequently absent in <hi rend="italic">Hapale.</hi> Through this canal the
                    brachial artery and median nerve pass. The projection of the radial margin of
                    the trochlea is most prominent in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hapale.</hi> It almost disappears in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynopithecinoe.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ulna</hi> are never ankylosed together in apes. They diverge most, medianly,
                    one from another in the gorilla. The radius is four-fifths the length of the
                    spine in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> and three-fifths in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles.</hi> Mostly it is between three-tenths
                    and two-fifths of the length of the spine, but may, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapale,</hi> be only a quarter. The total length of the radius rather more
                    frequently falls short of, than exceeds, that of the humerus. It exceeds it in
                    <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hylobates, Ateles,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephalus,</hi> and sometimes in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semnopithecinoe.</hi> In all the others it falls short—in none, however, so
                    much so as in man, <hi rend="italic">Brachyurus</hi> approximating most to the
                    human proportion. The radius is stoutest in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus,</hi>
                    slenderest in <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> and, above all, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> The ulna varies, like the radius, in length and
                    breadth. The olecranon is broad in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> but in
                    the lower apes it is relatively larger, especially in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mycetes.</hi> The styloid process is
                    very long in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> where it develops a prominence,
                    on its hinder side, for the internal lateral ligament of the wrist. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles</hi> this process is extremely long, having, as it were, a
                    rounded articular head placed at the end of a peduncle. The ulna articulates
                    with the carpus in all the apes except <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi><hi rend="italic">]</hi></p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> attains its greatest bulk in the
                    gorilla, but its greatest length in the orang. It may be more than half the
                    length of the spine in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> and hardly less in <hi
                    rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles.</hi> It may be but a
                    fifth, as in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> consists, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes,</hi> of the same eight bones as in man. In all the other genera
                    there is a ninth bone, the <hi rend="italic">intermedium.</hi> Only in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> does the length of the carpus considerably exceed
                    its breadth—as 100 to 82. The nearest approach to this is made by <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> where the length is to the breadth as 100 to 107. The
                    <hi rend="italic">scaphoides</hi> may, as in the gorilla and lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadoe,</hi> develop a large tuberosity. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >intermedium</hi> has a flattened proximal surface, which joins the ulnar part
                    of the concave distal articular surface of the scaphoides. Its distal surface is
                    in general deeply concave antero-posteriorly, and embraces the radial side of
                    the head of the magnum. The bone appears to answer to part of the scaphoid of
                    man. The <hi rend="italic">cuneiforme,</hi> except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi> articulates directly with
                    the ulna. The <hi rend="italic">pisiforme</hi> is small (as in man) in <hi
                    rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles;</hi> it is very large in
                    the gorilla and <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus,</hi> and long but slender in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> Commonly it contributes to form, with the
                    cuneiforme, a cup for the reception of the end of the styloid process of the
                    ulna. The <hi rend="italic">trapezium</hi> has sometimes, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the gorilla and <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> a very large
                    radial tuberosity. The surface for the reception of the first metacarpal is
                    convex from the dorsal to the palmar surface of the bone, and sometimes it is
                    more or less concave in the reverse direction, but this concavity is never so
                    strongly marked as in man. In <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> the highest apes
                    there appears to be much irregularity as to its development In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylobates</hi> there is no trace of any concavity, but a strongly convex and
                    rounded tubercle receives the articular cup of the base of the first metacarpal.
                    In the lower <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi> the concavity is sometimes present,
                    and sometimes in the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> (as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> occasionally in <hi rend="italic">Cebus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachyurus}</hi> a small saddle-shaped surface may be found. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles</hi> the trapezium is large in spite of the rudimentary
                    condition of the pollex, but there is no saddle. The trapezium is always so
                    placed that the axis of the convexity of the saddle forms a marked angle with a
                    line drawn across the articulations of the four outer metacarpal bones with the
                    proximal row of carpals. In the gorilla this angle is, as in man, very open; but
                    in the chimpanzee and lower <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi> it is smaller, the
                    trapezium being, as it were, somewhat more pressed inwards, at its radial end,
                    towards the middle of the palm. In the American'apes the trapezium is well set
                    out; and this, no doubt, contributes to produce that very feeble opposition and
                    palmad flexion of the pollex which have been noticed as existing in them. The
                    <hi rend="italic">magnum</hi> is not generally the largest carpal bone, but
                    rather the unciforme, which latter has its palmar process sometimes very much
                    produced, as is the case in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> attains its greatest absolute length in the third
                    metacarpal of <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> This segment may, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> attain the proportion of one-fifth the length of
                    the spine. The metacarpals are longer and narrower proportionally in apes than
                    in man.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> are the same in number in apes as they are
                    in man, except that in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colobus</hi> the pollex may have but one small nodular phalanx or none. The
                    phalanges are generally more curved than in man, and, except in the <hi

                    the leg of the chimpanzee is longer than that of the orang.</p>
                <p>Compared with the length of the spine, the entire pelvic limbs of <hi

                    namely, as 162 or 169 to 100. That of <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> is the
                    shortest, being but as 110 to 100. Without the pes, the leg of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapale</hi> is also shortest relatively compared with the spine, namely, as 77
                    to 100; while that of <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> is longest, namely, as
                    125 to 100. The <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">innominatum</hi> is
                    in every species strikingly different in form from that of man. In absolute size
                    this bone attains its maximum in the gorilla, where it is much larger than in
                    man, and where the ilium is very broad. The external surface of the ilium is
                    generally more or less concave, and concave only. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi> however, it is more or less
                    convex, but not as in man, and therefore there is no sigmoid curvature of the
                    crest of the ilium, and there are no distinct gluteal lines. The internal
                    surface of the ilium is generally narrow and flat, or only slightly concave,
                    except in the gorilla. The tuberosity of the ischium is always a marked and more
                    or less rugose enlargement of the bone; but in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadae</hi> below <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> it is flattened and very
                    much developed, and so much everted that sometimes (in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephalus)</hi> its transverse exceeds its antero-posterior diameter. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> it again becomes small, and more or less
                    rounded.</p>
                <p>The spine of the ischium is generally very small, yet distinct. Only in <hi
                    rend="italic">Simia</hi> does it attain a considerable sharpness and prominence.
                    The great sciatic notch is never very deep and concave, as in man. It is most
                    concave in the gorilla, the orang, and in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi>
                    The lesser sciatic notch is generally represented by a margin which is so
                    slightly concave as to be almost or quite straight save through the eversion of
                    the tuberosity. The projection of the spine of the ischium produces in man a
                    deep notch such as exists in no ape. The cotyloid notch, and the excavation
                    continuous with it, are constantly present, even in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia,</hi> where, however, it is very small and narrow, in harmony with the

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">femur's</hi> length, compared with that of the spine, is as
                    67 to 100 in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> 61 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles,</hi> 54 in the gorilla, 47 in <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> It is
                    shortest in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix,</hi> 40, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapale,</hi> 37. Tn the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> it is shorter than is
                    the humerus, its proportion to which in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> is as 73 to
                    100. Only in some of the <hi rend="italic">Semnopithednoe</hi> does its length
                    exceed that of the humerus more than it does in man. The shaft of the femur is
                    sometimes nearly straight, as in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> and in most
                    <hi rend="italic">Cebidae.</hi> The femur is stoutest, relatively as well as
                    absolutely, in the eorilla. It is slenderest in <hi rend="italic">Hylo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bates.</hi> The neck of the femur is longest in <hi rend="italic"

                    >Hapale.</hi> Except in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi> and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> the great trochanter is pointed at its upper end.
                    The trochanteric fossa is shallow in the gorilla, but is in most forms deep. The
                    lesser trochanter is at its minimum of relative size in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe,</hi> and is largest relatively in <hi rend="italic">Hapale,</hi> and
                    the posterior surface of the femur is in that genus wide and flat between the
                    trochanters. The pit for the insertion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligamentum</hi><hi rend="italic">teres</hi> is always present, except in the
                    orang and gorilla, where it is absent almost constantly in the first ape,
                    occasionally in the second. In the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lagothrix</hi> the internal
                    condyle projects considerably further backwards than does the external one. The
                    angle formed by the neck of the femur with the shaft varies from about 155° <hi
                    rend="italic">(Simia)</hi> to 128° (the gorilla).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fibιda</hi> never become
                    ankylosed together. The tibia is absolutely longest in the gorilla. Its length,
                    compared with that of the spine, is never so great as in man, except in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> in which it is slightly longer relatively. It is
                    shortest in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> about as 37 to 100. Its length is
                    generally less than that of the femur, but sometimes, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapale,</hi> it slightly exceeds it. It is never, however, so short compared
                    with the femur as in man. The crest of the tibia is not so sharp as in man. The
                    shaft is sometimes straight, as in <hi rend="italic">Lagothrix</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> sometimes considerably curved, as in the gorilla
                    and lower <hi rend="italic">Cebidae.</hi> The malleolus is generally
                    well-developed, but sometimes, as in the orang, very short. Its articular
                    surface is sometimes nearly at right angles with the inferior surface of the
                    shaft of the tibia, as in the chimpanzee; sometimes it forms an obtuse angle
                    with that surface, as in the gorilla, and still more in the orang. The distal
                    articular surface of the shaft of the tibia is rarely horizontal, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lagothrix.</hi> In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> and lower <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> the outer
                    portion rises so that the articular surface slopes upwards and peronead. The
                    fibula has its malleolus much produced outwards, projecting only about as much
                    as, or rather less than, the tibial malleolus, whereas in man the fibular
                    malleolus is much deeper than the tibial one.</p>
                <p>The length of the <hi rend="italic">pes</hi> (or foot) is absolutely greatest in
                    the orang and gorilla. Estimating the spine as 100, the length of the pes is as
                    much as 53 in the orang; it approximates to man (35 to 100) most in the lowest
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiadae,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix</hi> —36
                    to 100. The proportional length of the pes to the rest of the pelvic limb is
                    greatest in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> (58 to 100), then in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nyctipithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> (50 to 100), but never
                    falling quite so low as in man, where it is 30 to 100. Its length, as compared
                    with that of the tibia, is greatest in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> (122 to
                    100). In all the rest it is more than four-fifths, except sometimes in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> which however is never so small as in man, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as 67 to 100. The length of the pes, compared with that
                    of the manus, is greatest in <hi rend="italic">Chrysothrix</hi> (177 to 100). In
                    <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> it sinks to 113 to 100, and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylobates to</hi> 85 or 84 to 100.</p>
                <p>The absolute length of the <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> is never so great as in
                    man, though that of the gorilla is nearly as long. The rest of the foot is so
                    much longer relatively in apes than in man, that, whereas in him the proportion
                    of the tarsus to the whole pes is as about 46 to 100, it is only 39 to 100 in
                    the gorilla, which in this respect approaches nearest to man. The proportion
                    sinks to 26 to 100 in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles,</hi> and 27 or 28 to 100 in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> Only in
                    <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> is the tarsus
                    ever less, or only a very little more, than twice the length of the carpus. The
                    tarsus consists constantly of the same seven bones as in man, and these bones
                    are so arranged, or bound together by ligaments, as to form a transverse and an
                    antero-posterior <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0176-0163"/> arch. In no ape, however, do the distal ends of
                    the inner metatarsals form the anterior point of support of the anteroposterior
                    arch, as in man. The <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">calcis</hi> is
                    always, except in the gorilla, shorter compared with the spine than in man. The
                    <hi rend="italic">tuberosity</hi> may be produced upwards or downwards, or both,
                    and is concave or grooved behind, except in the gorilla. In no ape are the long
                    axis of the heel or the peroneal and tibial surfaces of the os calcis so
                    vertical as they are in man; but the bone is always more or less twisted, so
                    that the <hi rend="italic">sustentaculum tali</hi> forms a more or less acute
                    angle with the long axis of the tuberosity instead of a right angle, as in man.
                    The twisting of the os calcis is very slight in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> and not great in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> It is more marked in the lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadoe,</hi> and more so still in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes.</hi> A narrowing of that part, which answers to the plantar
                    surface of man, accompanies this in-twisting. In the gorilla that part of the os
                    calcis which is behind the articular surface for the astragalus exceeds in
                    length all the bone anterior to the hinder border of that surface; and in this
                    respect the gorilla may be said to have the longest heel of any ape, and a
                    longer heel than man. The head of the <hi rend="italic">astragalus</hi> is
                    generally united to its body by a tolerably long neck. This neck is, however, in
                    the gorilla shorter than even in man. The upper surface of this bone is less
                    convex than in man, in <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles,</hi> and the gorilla; generally it is more convex than in man. The
                    surface for the external malleolus forms, with the upper surface of the
                    astragalus, almost a right angle in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> (as in
                    man), and an obtuse one in <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lagothrix.</hi> In most other apes (including <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes')</hi> it forms an acute angle. The angle formed by the upper
                    surface of the astragalus with that for the tibial malleolus, instead of being a
                    right angle, as in man, is generally more or less obtuse, especially in the
                    gorilla. The <hi rend="italic">naviculare</hi> has sometimes its tuberosity
                    greatly developed; this is especially the case in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylobates.</hi> The surfaces for the three cuneiform bones are generally more
                    convex and concave respectively than in man. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ento-cuneiforme</hi> generally has its plantar and distal surfaces considerably
                    longer than its dorsal and proximal surfaces respectively. These are
                    exceptionally equal (as in man) in the orang and gorilla. The surface for the
                    hallux is always strongly convex. The long axis of this articular surface always
                    forms a more or less acute angle with a line drawn across the articular surfaces
                    for the four outer metatarsals. In the lower <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi>
                    this angle is as acute as in man. In <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> it is a
                    little more open, but not nearly so open as is the homotypal angle in the hand
                    even of the same species. The surface is never saddle-shaped in apes. In all
                    apes, even in the chimpanzee, the distal tarsal segment is capable, as a whole,
                    of a considerable degree of motion upon the proximal part,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> upon the astragalus and os calcis,—and this mobility is extreme in
                    the orang. The absolutely longest <hi rend="italic">metatarsal</hi> bone is the
                    second of <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> The metatarsus often exceeds the tarsus
                    in length, but it may, as in the gorilla, fall much short of it, thus resembling
                    man. The four outer metatarsals and the innermost one diverge instead of being
                    parallel, as in man. The former, except in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi>
                    and in <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> are more rounded than in man, and their
                    distal articular surfaces are less bent downwards, and are limited posteriorly
                    by a deeper transverse groove. The first metatarsal, compared in length with the
                    spine, is longest in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> (10 or 12 to 100), and
                    shortest in <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> (about 6 to 100). It is always longer
                    than the first metacarpal, except in <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> Its proximal
                    surface is generally more concave than in man, and its long axis is different.
                    It is as if the metatarsal of man had been removed, softenèd, and then, after
                    being turned, so that the dorsum looks inwards as well as upwards, reapplied to
                    the convex ento-cuneiforme, and thus stamped with an oblique depression. The
                    angle formed by this surface, with a line traversing the articular heads of the
                    four outer metatarsals, approximates to a rectangle instead of to a straight
                    line, as in man.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> are always the same in number as in man,
                    except that the hallux of <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> has often but one. They
                    are very like their homotypes in the manus, and are convex above, concave and
                    flattened below. Only in the <hi rend="italic">Hapalinae</hi> are the last
                    phalanges laterally compressed instead of flattened. The pedal digits are never
                    nearly so short relatively in apes as they are in man; yet the proportion borne
                    by the hallux, with its metatarsal, to the spine closely approximates in the
                    gorilla to the proportion existing in man, and the proportion is exceeded in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ateles.</hi> It is much in
                    defect in <hi rend="italic">Hapalinae,</hi> where it is little more than
                    one-tenth. Its proportion to the whole pes in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi>
                    (as in man) is nearly half, while in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> it is but a

                    rend="italic">Semnopithecinoe.</hi> The hallux, when brought beside the second
                    digit, never reaches so far as in man, but at most (as in the chimpanzee) to the
                    proximal end of the second phalanx, or to the middle of the proximal phalanx (as
                    in most <hi rend="italic">Cebidae),</hi> or a little beyond its base (as in <hi

                    not nearly even to the distal end of the metatarsal (as in <hi rend="italic"

                    >Cebidae,</hi> notably <hi rend="italic">Hapale,</hi> the hallux projects
                    further than does the pollex of the same individual when applied to the second
                    digit of the manus. The hallux also always exceeds the pollex in absolute
                    length, except in <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia.</hi> The length of the hallux, without its metatarsal, compared with
                    that of the spine, is as 25 to 100 in the chimpanzee (as in man), 19 in the
                    gorilla, and but 8 in <hi rend="italic">Simia.</hi> The second digit of the pes
                    is always longer than that of the manus except in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiinoe,</hi> which so far resemble man. The index digit, with its metatarsal,
                    compared -with the spine, is as 38 to 100 in <hi rend="italic">Simia,</hi> and
                    it varies thence down to 21 in <hi rend="italic">Cercopithecus.</hi> The longest

                <p>The muscles of apes are very similar in number, distribution, and form to those

                    Semnopithecus)</hi> the muscular bundles answering to the coccygeal muscles of
                    man are so greatly developed as to form eight sets of caudal muscles. The <hi

                    >indicis</hi> commonly sends a tendon to the third digit as well as to the

                    rend="italic">digiti</hi> sends a tendon to the fourth digit as well as to the
                    fifth. An <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">primi internodii

                    >glutaei</hi> muscles of apes are feeble and small, and are inserted low down on
                    the femur. Only in the gorilla are they large enough to cause a small buttock to
                    protrude over the ischiatic tuberosities, but even in this ape the buttocks do
                    not meet so as to conceal the anus. Apes have an extra muscle, called the <hi

                    the great trochanter of the femur, and must act as a powerful rotator of the

                    and is inserted lower down on the tibia than in him, as is also the case with

                    end of the os calcis, and goes to the plantar fascia. No ape seems to have any

                    the fifth digit, while in the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> we may also have a
                    <hi rend="italic">peroneus quarti digiti</hi> going similarly to the fourth

                    >extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">ossis metacarpi pollicis.</hi> The muscles of

                    in the insertion of the tendon of that dorsal interosseous mass which is
                    interposed between the second and third metatarsals, into the proximal phalanx
                    of the third digit (as in the human hand), instead of into that of the secpnd
                    digit (as in the human foot). The hallux in the orang is, in spite of its
                    imperfect development, provided with an <hi rend="italic">opponens</hi> muscle.
                    The <hi rend="italic">flexor brevis</hi><hi rend="italic">digitorum</hi><hi

                <p>The absolute size of the brain never in any ape approaches that of man. Thus the
                    cranial capacity is never less than 55 cubic inches in any normal human subject,
                    while in the orang and chimpanzee it is but 26 and 27∣ cubic inches
                    respectively. The relative size of the brain varies inversely with the size of
                    the whole body, but this is the case in warm-blooded vertebrates generally. The
                    extreme length of the cerebrum never exceeds, as it does in man, two and a
                    quarter times the length of the basi-cranial axis. The proportion borne by the
                    brain to its nerves is less in the apes than in man, as also is that borne by
                    the cerebrum to the cerebellum. In general structure and form the brain of apes
                    greatly resembles that of man. Each half of the cerebrum contains a triradiate
                    lateral ventricle, and though in some <hi rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> the
                    posterior cornu is relatively shorter than in man, it again becomes elongated in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi> and in many of the latter it is actually
                    longer relatively than it is in man. The posterior lobes of the cerebrum are
                    almost always so much developed as to cover over the cerebellum, the only
                    exceptions are the strangely different forms, <hi rend="italic">Mycetes</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Hylobates syndactylus.</hi> In the latter the cerebellum is
                    slightly uncovered, but it is so considerably in the former. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysothrix</hi> the posterior lobes are much more largely
                    developed relatively than they are in man. The cerebrum has almost always a
                    convoluted external surface. In this group, however, as in mammals generally, a
                    much-convoluted cerebrum is correlated with a considerable absolute bulk of
                    body. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> (and there only) we find the
                    cerebrum quite smooth, the only groove being that which represents the Sylvian
                    fissure. In <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes,</hi>
                    on the contrary, it is very richly convoluted. A <hi rend="italic">hippocampus
                    minor</hi> is present in all apes, and in some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae</hi> it is much larger relatively than it is in man, and is absolutely
                    larger than the <hi rend="italic">hippocampus major.</hi> Of all apes, the orang
                    has the brain which is most like that of man; indeed, it may be said to be like
                    man’s in all respects, save that it is much inferior in size and weight, and
                    that the cerebrum is more symmetrically convoluted and less complicated with
                    secondary and tertiary convolutions. If the brain of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia</hi> be compared with that of <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes,</hi> we find
                    the height of the cerebrum in front greater in proportion in the former than in
                    the latter; also the “bridging convolutions,” though small, are still
                    distinguishable, while they are absent in the chimpanzee. Nevertheless, this
                    character cannot be of much importance, since it reappears in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles,</hi> while two kinds of the genus <hi rend="italic">Cebus</hi> (so
                    closely allied as to have been sometimes treated as one species) differ
                    strangely from each other in this respect. The <hi rend="italic">corpus
                    callosum,</hi> in apes generally, does not extend so far back as in man, and it
                    is very short in <hi rend="italic">Pithecia.</hi> In the orang and chimpanzee
                    there are, as in man, two <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >albicantia,</hi> while in the lower monkeys there is but one. The <hi
                    rend="italic">vermis</hi> of the cerebellum is larger in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae</hi> than in the <hi rend="italic">Simiadae.</hi> In all apes below the
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> each lateral lobe of the cerebellum gives off a
                    small lobule, which is received into a special fossa of the petrous bone.
                    Certain prominences of the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata,</hi> termed <hi
                    rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">trapezoidea,</hi> which are found in
                    lower mammals, begin to make their appearance in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">The Teeth.</hi></p>
                <p>The teeth of apes consist, as in man, of incisors, canines, premolars, and
                    molars; but the series of teeth nowhere forms so perfect an arch as in man, the
                    opposite series of grinding teeth tending to become more parallel. No ape has
                    the teeth placed in one uninterrupted series in each jaw, as is the case in the
                    human species, but there is always a small interval <hi rend="italic"
                    >(diastemei)</hi> between each upper canine and the adjacent incisor, and
                    between each lower canine and the adjacent premolar. This condition is due to
                    the excessive size of the canines, the interspaces giving passage to the apices
                    of these teetE . This prolongation of the canines into tusk-like weapons of
                    offence and defence (especially developed in the males), makes a great
                    difference between the aspect of the dentition in apes and man. The number of
                    the teeth is the same as in man in the <hi rend="italic">Simiadae.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> have an additional premolar on each side of each jaw,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Hapalinae,</hi> besides this, have a true molar the
                    less. The incisors are always nearly vertical, save in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pithednae,</hi> when their apices project strongly forward. The canines are
                    always considerably longer than the incisors, except in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Hapale,</hi> where the lower incisors equal the canines in length.
                    The premolars differ structurally from the molars much as in man, save that the
                    first lower premolar may be modified in shape to give passage to the upper
                    canine, as is specially to be seen in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi> The
                    grinding surface of the molars consists generally of two transverse ridges, each
                    end of each ridge projecting more than the intermediate part, and so giving rise
                    to four tubercles. In <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troglodytes,</hi> however, we find in the upper molars an additional structure,
                    which also exists in man. This is a ridge which runs obliquely from the front
                    inner tubercle (or cusp), outwards and backwards to the hind outer <pb

                    >Simiadae</hi> this ridge is wanting, but it reappears in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ateles</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mycetes</hi> amongst the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Hapalinoe</hi> the tubercles of the
                    molars are more produced and sharp-pointed, in harmony with their decidedly
                    insectivorous habits. The last lower molar may be reduced or much enlarged as
                    compared with the others. Thus in <hi rend="italic">Cercopithecus talapoin</hi>
                    it has but three tubercles, while in the <hi rend="italic">Macad</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephali</hi> it is very large, and has five well-developed
                    cusps. The number of milk teeth is as in man, save that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae</hi> have an additional milk molar. In general the canines are the last
                    teeth to be cut of the permanent dentition. Their cutting sometimes causes such
                    constitutional disturbance as to produce convulsions and death. In the gibbons,
                    however, the canines accompany, if they do not precede, the appearance of the
                    hindmost molar, while in the orang they at least sometimes make their appearance
                    before that grinder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Organs of Nutrition and Excretion.</hi></p>
                <p>The alimentary, circulating, and excretory organs of apes closely resemble those
                    of man. The mouth is always guarded by <hi rend="italic">lips,</hi> which,
                    though generally thin, are often very mobile and extensible, the lower lip
                    having no fraenum in the orang, and this is also absent in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebus,</hi> though it may be present in other forms, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephalus.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tongue</hi> is much longer relatively in most apes than in
                    man; but it may closely resemble his, as does that of the orang, in which the
                    circumvallate papillae are collected in a V-shaped aggregation, while there may
                    be only two such papillae, as in <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> the tongue is in
                    this respect man-like; yet in that genus we first meet with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >sub-lingual process</hi> (which becomes much larger in the lower apes), in the
                    form of a little conical bifid membrane. This structure is formed by the union
                    of the processes upon which open the sub-maxillary ducts—processes much
                    elongated in the chimpanzee, though man-like in the orang.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi> is generally present, but becomes rudimentary in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> generally, though it exists as a relatively
                    thick, short structure in <hi rend="italic">Hapale.</hi> It is long and pointed
                    in <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus,</hi> and plainly visible in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes.</hi> On the
                    other hand, in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> it is disguised by the extensive
                    development of the membranous edge of the <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">palati</hi> on each side of it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi> is simple in all the apes except the <hi
                    rend="italic">Semno-pithecince.</hi> It is especially human in shape in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> except that the pylorus is somewhat more elongated
                    and distinct. It is of a rounded form in <hi rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Hapale</hi> the cardiac orifice is exceptionally near to the
                    pylorus. In the <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecinae</hi> the stomach is extremely
                    sacculated, especially at the cardiac end, being, in fact, very like a colon
                    spirally coiled. It is in the stomach of these apes that the oriental Bezoar
                    stones are found.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">intestine</hi> in apes is devoid of <hi rend="italic"
                    >valvuloe</hi><hi rend="italic">conniventes,</hi> but is always provided with a
                    well-developed <hi rend="italic">caecum,</hi> though it is short and conical in
                    <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi> Only in the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe</hi>
                    do we find a <hi rend="italic">vermiform appendix.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> may be much longer relatively than in man, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes.</hi> It may be
                    greatly sacculated, as in <hi rend="italic">Hylobates;</hi> or devoid of
                    sacculations, as in <hi rend="italic">Cebus.</hi> As in foetal man, so in the
                    lower apes, only the right extremity of the mesocolon is involved in the
                    formation of the great omentum, the middle and left parts of the mesocolon lying
                    behind, and independent of the omentum. This is not, however, the case in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> which are more like adult man in this
                    respect.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> may be very like man’s, especially in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> the orang, and the chimpanzee; but in the gorilla
                    both the right and left lobes are cleft by a fissure almost as much as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynocephalus.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecinae</hi>
                    the liver is much divided, and it is placed obliquely to accommodate the
                    sacculated stomach. The lateral lobes of the liver are in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapale</hi> very much larger than the central lobe. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >caudate lobe</hi> is very large in the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi>
                    especially in <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> and above all in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pithecia.</hi> There is always a gallbladder.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">larynx,</hi> is in many apes furnished with sac-like
                    appendages. These are different in different species as regards number, size,
                    and situation. They may be dilatations of the laryngeal ventricle (opening into
                    the larynx below the false vocal chords), as in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes.</hi> They may open above the false vocal chords
                    so as to be, in fact, extensions of the thyro-hyoid membrane, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi> There may be but a single median opening in the
                    front part of that membrane at the base of the epiglottis, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> below the <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe.</hi> There may
                    be a single median opening at the back of the trachea, just below the cricoid
                    cartilage, as in <hi rend="italic">Ateles.</hi> There may be but a single sac,
                    or there may be five, as sometimes in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes.</hi> These may
                    be enormous, meeting in the middle line in front, and extending down to the
                    axillae, as in the gorilla and orang. A sac may occupy the cavity of the
                    expanded body of the hyoid bone, as in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">hyoides</hi> has its basilar part
                    generally somewhat more convex and enlarged than in man; but in <hi
                    rend="italic">Mycetes</hi> it becomes greatly enlarged and deeply excavated, so
                    as to form a great bony bladder-like structure.</p>
                <p>The cornua of the hyoid are never entirely absent, but the anterior or lesser
                    cornua may be so, as in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes.</hi> The anterior cornua
                    never exceed the posterior cornua in length; but they may be <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Cercopithecus)</hi> more largely developed
                    relatively than in man, and they may even be jointed structures, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Lagothrix.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi> have generally the form of those of man; but the
                    right lung may have four lobes, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates.</hi></p>
                <p>The great <hi rend="italic">arterial trunks</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Simia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi> are arranged as in man. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Hylobates</hi> and the lower apes, however, the left carotid may
                    take its origin from the innominate artery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Generative Organs.</hi></p>
                <p>The generative organs are, in common with the other parts of the body, formed on
                    the same model as in tho human species. The <hi rend="italic">penis</hi> is
                    pendulous, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> hangs freely, instead of being (as in
                    the dog) bound to the ventral surface of the abdomen. The prepuce, however, is
                    without a fraenum. The <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> are relatively large, and
                    descend into a scrotum. In some species, however, they do not descend so much as
                    they do in man, but remain just outside the inguinal ring, and are thus placed
                    rather beside than beneath the penis. These parts, as has been said, are
                    brightly coloured in some of the lower <hi rend="italic">Simiadae.</hi> The
                    penis is furnished with a <hi rend="italic">bone</hi> in all the apes below the
                    Anthropoid ones, and probably in the latter also, since the chimpanzee has one
                    about one-third of an inch long and gristly at each end. In all apes the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus</hi> is single, and not twohorned; but it is more elongated
                    relatively in monkeys than in the human species. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >clitoris</hi> is well-developed, but boneless in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadae,</hi> and is large even in <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">niger.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> it contains a
                    bone; and in some genera, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Cebinoe,</hi> it
                    is enormously developed, so as to be very easily mistaken for a penis. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> however, its length is mainly due to its extremely
                    elongated prepuce.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi> of apes is discoidal and deciduate, and is
                    generally bilobed. Sometimes, however, as in <hi rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> it
                    is single. It is especially thick in proportion in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hapalinoe.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> there is but one
                    umbilical vein, but in the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> there are two.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Menstruation</hi> occurs periodically, but the excretion is

                <p>There appears as yet to be no evidence of the existence of apes earlier than
                    during the Miocene period. This absence of evidence must by no means be taken as
                    a conclusive proof of their non-existence, since, as Dr Falconer has pointed
                    out, we ought not to expect to find ape fossils often. We ought not to expect
                    this, because the agility and arboreal life of these animals enable them to
                    escape local inundations, and other causes of destruction and speedy burial, to
                    which more sluggish and terrestrial animals are exposed. When they fall dead
                    they are almost immediately devoured by carnivorous animals and feeders on
                    carrion, and it is owing to this that their remains are so rarely found in
                    India, on which account the Hindoos believe that they bury their dead.</p>

                <p>A fragment of a right, maxilla, from Soleure in Switzerland, was described by
                    Rütimeyer in 1862, under the name <hi rend="italic">Coenopithecus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lemuroides.</hi> But the recent discovery of fossil lemurs in
                    France renders the ape character of this fragment (which was always doubtful)
                    still more uncertain.</p>
                <p>When we enter upon Miocene deposits we find plentiful and unquestionable remains
                    of apes now extinct. In India, in the Sewalik hills, the astragalus of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi> (resembling <hi rend="italic">S. entellus)</hi>
                    has been found. Also jaws and teeth of other forms allied to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semnopithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macacus</hi> have been discovered, one
                    with an upper jaw nearly as large as that of the existing orang. These fossils,
                    however, exhibit no remarkable difference in form from the bones of existing
                    apes.</p>
                <p>In Europe a very remarkable ape fossil, named <hi rend="italic">Dryo∙
                    pithecus</hi><hi rend="italic">fontani</hi> (Lartet), has been found at Saint
                    Gaudens in France. A lower jaw and humerus were there obtained, but isolated
                    teeth have also been met with in the Suabian Alps. This creature was an ape
                    belonging to the highest sub-family, <hi rend="italic">Simiinoe,</hi> and was
                    allied to <hi rend="italic">Hylobates,</hi> but ef greater bulk than any
                    existing gibbon.</p>
                <p>Two other species of ape have been found allied to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hylobates,</hi> but of smaller size than <hi rend="italic">Dryopithecus,</hi>
                    and showing some probable affinity to <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus.</hi>
                    These are <hi rend="italic">Pliopithecus</hi><hi rend="italic">antiquus</hi>
                    (Lartet), and <hi rend="italic">P. platyodon</hi> (Biedermann). Of the former,
                    two imperfect lower jaws were found in fresh-water deposit at Sansan, near Auch,
                    in France; while of the latter, an upper jaw has been found in Zurich at Elgg,
                    in the upper fresh-water Molasse there. Another ape (probably of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiinoe'),</hi> of which a lower jaw has been found in the
                    lignite bed at Monte Bamboli in Tuscany, has been named by G. Μ. Gervais, <hi
                    rend="italic">Oreopithecus bambolii.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. Gaudry has also found a rich deposit of ape relics at Pikermi in Greece. He
                    has sent thence to Paris parts of as many as twenty-five individuals, while
                    other remains are preserved in Munich, and no less than five crania at Milan.
                    These remains have been placed by Wagner in a new genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesopithecus.</hi> They are very interesting, as showing a somewhat
                    intermediate structure compared with living apes. The cranium and dentition bear
                    affinity to <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus,</hi> but the limbs are rather those

                    the Pikermi deposits) have also been attributed to the former genus; while five
                    mandibula, found at Steinheim in Würtemberg, have received the name, from Fraas,
                    of <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi><hi rend="italic">grandaevus.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the rich palaeontological treasures which have recently been found inthe
                    North American Miocene deposits are certain teeth and fragments, which, it has
                    been suggested, may be those of apes. At present, however, their nature is quite
                    problematical, though the presence of apes at that period in America would be a
                    fact of extreme interest, if sufficient remains could be found to determine
                    whether such apes were <hi rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cebidae,</hi> or forms intermediate between the two.</p>
                <p>The Pliocene deposits have not yet yielded much in the way of ape remains. Some
                    teeth from Montpellier (found in fresh-water marl) have been named <hi
                    rend="italic">Semnopithecus Monsq&gt;essulanus</hi> by Μ. Gervais, while part of

                    teeth of <hi rend="italic">Macaci,</hi> have been found in the Val d’Amo, and
                    are preserved at Pisa, Turin, and Florence. A single tooth from Grays, Essex,
                    has been described by Professor Owen as <hi rend="italic">Macacus plio-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caenus.</hi></p>
                <p>In America, besides the Miocene fragments before referred to, numerous bones of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mycetes</hi> and other genera have been found in the caves of
                    Brazil. These, however, appear to be, geologically speaking, quite recent, and
                    they closely resemble the bones of apes now living in that region.</p>

                    translation from the Italian) by Major Forsyth, in the <hi rend="italic">Annals

                <p>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.</p>
                <p>The apes are, as far as is yet certainly known, at present almost confined to
                    tropical latitudes. Theiι-most northern limits in the Old World are Gibraltar
                    <hi rend="italic">(Macacus inuus),</hi> Moupin, in Thibet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Macacus thibetanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">roxellanae),</hi> and Japan <hi rend="italic">(Macacus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">speciosus).</hi> In the New World the highest northern latitude
                    certainly known to be attained is 18° or 19° <hi rend="italic">(Ateles
                    melanochir)</hi> in Southern Mexico, but they possibly reach even latitude 23°.
                    Father David, however, sees no reason (considering the severity of the climate
                    of Moupin) why apes should not also be found in the mountains of Northern China,
                    and the natives have repeatedly assured him they are to be found there.
                    Southwards, apes are found to near the Cape of Good Hope, and the island of
                    Timor <hi rend="italic">(Macacus cynomolgus),</hi> in the Indian Archipelago, in
                    the Old World, and to about 30° in Brazil and Paraguay, in the New World. As to
                    vertical extent, a <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi> has been seen near
                    Simlah, at a height of 11,000 feet; Dr Hooker saw monkeys in the Himalaya at an
                    elevation above 8000 feet; and <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">roxellanae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macacus thibetanus</hi> were
                    found by Father David inhabiting the Snowy Mountains of Moupin, in Thibet, at an
                    elevation of about 3000 metres, where frost and snow last several months. In
                    Miocene times the ape range was more extensive—namely, to Greece, Tuscany, the
                    South of France, Zurich, Würtemberg, and even to Essex.</p>
                <p>Some of the localities richest in monkeys are islands, such as Ceylon, Borneo,
                    Sumatra, and Java; and apes are also found in Trinidad, and the island of
                    Fernando Po.</p>

                <p>There are, however, certain islands which seem eminently well suited ⅛o support
                    an ape population, where apes, nevertheless, are conspicuous by their absence.
                    Such are the West Indian Islands, Madagascar,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Madagascar is the special home of the
                    half-apes or lemurs.</p></note> and New Guinea; moreover, no ape inhabits
                    tropical Australia. These facts become the more remarkable, if, as Father David
                    suspects, apes exist in Northern China to-day. Evidently it is not climate which
                    prevents their existing in Central Europe now. The continents of Africa, south
                    of the Sahara; of Asia, south of the Himalaya; and of America, from Panama to
                    the southern part of Brazil, are, with the islands before mentioned, the special
                    ape regions of the existing fauna.</p>
                <p>There is a remarkable difference between the ape population of the New and the
                    Old World, the latter being inhabited exclusively by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadae,</hi> the former as exclusively by the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae.</hi>
                    Europe has but a single ape species; and Asia, north of the Himalaya, has but
                    the few found in Thibet, China, and Japan. Africa, north of the Sahara, is
                    zoologically a part of Europe, and there also <hi rend="italic">Macacus
                    inuus</hi> is found, which is the only African species of the genus. African
                    apes are the chimpanzee and gorilla of the west coast, the former extending
                    eastwards to 28° E. long.; the <hi rend="italic">Colobi</hi> (which are, in
                    fact, but the African form of <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus),</hi> the
                    long-tailed <hi rend="italic">Cercopitheci,</hi> including mangabeys (or
                    white-eyelid monkeys); and, lastly, the baboons, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynocephali.</hi> The genus <hi rend="italic">Cynocephalus</hi> extends into
                    Arabia; but that, zoologically speaking, is a part of Africa. The Asiatic
                    regions possess the orang <hi rend="italic">(Simia)</hi> (in Borneo and
                    Sumatra), the long-armed apes <hi rend="italic">(Hylobates),</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Semnopitheci,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macaci.</hi></p>
                <p>One form of <hi rend="italic">Macacus,</hi> and a very peculiar one (<hi
                    rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">niger),</hi> is found in the islands
                    Batchian and Celebes; and it is a noteworthy fact that this, the most
                    baboon-like of all the <hi rend="italic">Macaci,</hi> should only exist in a
                    region so extremely remote from Africa. The genus <hi rend="italic">Macacus</hi>
                    is the most widely spread of any existing genus—namely, from Gibraltar, North
                    Africa, Thibet, and Japan (perhaps even from Northern China), down to the island
                    of Timor, and from the north-west of Africa in the west, to Batchian, Japan, and
                    the Philippine Islands in the east. In ancient times this genus seems to have
                    extended to France, and even to Essex. It is interesting to note that, in the
                    Miocene period, the geographical range of the apes of India was much greater.
                    Gibbon-like monkeys existed in the south of France, while forms intermediate
                    between <hi rend="italic">Semnopithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macacus</hi>
                    abounded in Greece.</p>
                <p>In America, north of Panama, the genera as yet known to be represented are <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysothrix, Nyctipithecus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cebus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles, Mycetes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hapale,</hi> in
                    Veragua; <hi rend="italic">Nyctipithecus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cebus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mycetes,</hi> in Costa Rica and

                    Guatemala; and <hi rend="italic">Ateles,</hi> in Southern Mexico. Brazil is, of
                    course, the headquarters of the American apes; but different portions of that
                    vast region have a somewhat different ape fauna. Thus the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Eriodes</hi> appears in South-Eastern Brazil to represent the
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Ateles</hi> inhabiting the more northern and
                    western parts of the empire. Southwards, the genera <hi rend="italic"

                    >Callithrix</hi> extend furthest; but they do not probably all extend to the
                    furthest limit yet known, namely, 30° S. The species found farthest south are

                <p>ZOOLOGICAL POSITION AND AFFINITIES OF APES.</p>
                <p>By universal consent apes are placed in the highest rank of all brutes, and,
                    excepting man, are generally taken to be the most perfect animals of the
                    mammalian class. It may be questioned, however, whether, if the animal man had
                    never existed, this place would be assigned them by any observing intelligence.
                    The half-apes, or lemurs, commonly placed in the same order with them, are
                    certainly inferior mammals; and it might be contended that the perfection of the
                    mammalian type is rather to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> (or
                    cat family), by reasoning analogous to that by which it might also be contended
                    that birds (with their differentiated limbs, perfect circulating and respira
                    tory systems, acute sense organs, complex instincts, and teachableness) are
                    really the highest of all vertebrate animals, and represent the vertebrate type
                    of structure carried to the highest degree of perfection yet attained.</p>
                <p>The question as to which animals are most nearly allied to apes is one by no
                    means easy to answer. Leaving man aside (whose close anatomical resemblance to
                    apes is so obvious), it is at present extremely difficult to say what are the
                    apes’ true zoological affinities. It is to be hoped that future palaeontological
                    researches may afford us materials for tracing these out; but at present a chasm
                    separates the apes from every other group of animals. The halfapes, or lemurs,
                    were generally considered to lead down from the apes towards the Insectivora,
                    and thence to the implacental mammals; but the differences between the apes and
                    lemurs are so many and great, that it cannot be considered otherwise than in the
                    highest degree improbable that (on the Evolution hypothesis) they took origin
                    from any common root-form that was not equally the progenitor of other mammalian
                    orders.</p>
                <p>But if the apes cannot be considered to show evidence of genetic affinity with
                    any other mammalian order, do they constitute so homogeneous a group as to
                    suggest the former existence of one ancient root-form common to them all? To
                    this question it may be answered that the differences between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> are such as to
                    render it doubtful whether they may not have had respectively quite different
                    origins, and whether their resemblances may not have been superinduced by
                    similarity of needs and conditions. The differences referred to are as to— (1),
                    dentition; (2), nasal septum; (3), tail—the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi>
                    showing a tendency to a curled tail-end, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiadae</hi> never manifest any such tendency; (4), cheek pouches; (5),
                    ischiatic callosities; (6), general form and habit of body; (7), opposability of
                    the thumb; (8), bony <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">auditorius
                    externus.</hi> All these characters, taken together, seem to make it probable
                    that the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simiadae</hi> are
                    not diverging offish ots from some common ape parent, but that they have arisen
                    in an independence as complete as that between the origin of either of them and
                    the origin of the lemuroids or carnivores. Possibly further discoveries in the
                    Miocene deposits of North America will reveal to us transitional forms between
                    the Old and the New World apes, but the existence of such forms cannot certainly
                    as yet be affirmed. It may be asked, however, Can the genera, which possess so
                    many points in common as <hi rend="italic">Cebus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cercopithecus,</hi> have come to resemble each other independently <hi
                    rend="italic">J To</hi> this it may be replied, that the number of similarities
                    of structure which must have had an independent origin is so great that it is
                    difficult to see why those of the two genera named may not also have had such an
                    origin. As examples of such similarities of independent origin, the following
                    structures may be referred to :—The bony covering of the temporal fossa in <hi
                    rend="italic">Chelonia, Pelobates,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lophiomys;</hi>

                    certain frogs. But if some naturalists are disposed to admit that the common
                    origin of the <hi rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi>
                    may be very doubtful, can they be even sure of that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cercopithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hylobatest</hi> It has been recently
                    suggested, that the <hi rend="italic">Artiodactyla</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Perissodactyla</hi> (the even and the odd-toed ungulates) may be
                    genetically independent (their common characters being merely adaptive,
                    functional ones), as also with the <hi rend="italic">Baloenoidea</hi> (whales),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Delphinoidea</hi> (dolphins). The response of organisation
                    to need being such as it is (structure and function manifesting themselves so
                    simultaneously), the discrimination between genetic and adaptive characters must
                    always be a work of extreme delicacy. In the presence of the various
                    genealogical trees of animal descent which have been so hastily put forward of
                    late, a judicious scepticism seems the attitude best warranted by the evidence
                    yet obtained. If so many similar forms have arisen in mutual independence, then
                    the affinities of the animal kingdom, or even of the mammalian class, can never
                    be represented by the symbol of a tree. Rather, we should conceive the existence
                    of a grove of trees, closely approximated, greatly differing in age and size,
                    with their branches interlaced in a most complex entanglement. The great group
                    of apes is composed of two such branches; but their relations one to another, to
                    the other branches which represent mammalian groups, and to the trunks from
                    which such branches diverge, are problems still awaiting solution. .</p>
                <p>There can, however, be no doubt that the <hi rend="italic">Simiadoe</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebidae</hi> together form a most natural group, and are closely
                    allied with man in structure. Moreover, as man is the highest animal, and,
                    zoologically considered, differs less from even the lowest ape than such ape
                    differs from any other animal, man and apes must be placed together in one
                    order, which may well bear its primitive Linnean name, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates.”</hi> Whether any other animals (and, if any, what) should also be
                    included in this order, are questions for the consideration of which the reader
                    is referred to the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi></p>
