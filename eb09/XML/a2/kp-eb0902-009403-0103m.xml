                    in structure but also in habits. The familiar ant <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Formiccι),</hi> found in Britain and Europe generally, belongs to an order of
                    insects known as the <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera,</hi> of which division the
                    bees, wasps, hornets, are also well-known examples. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Termites,</hi> or white ants—insects which also live in social communities, and
                    which inhabit tropical regions—belong to a different order, that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Neurop-terous</hi> insects, and exhibit differences in several
                    important respects from the ordinary ants. To both species or kinds of these
                    forms it will be necessary to direct attention, and the familiar ants naturally
                    fall to be considered first.</p>
                <p>The Hymenopterous insects are distinguished by the possession of four membranous
                    wings, although in certain exceptional instances—as among certain members of the
                    ant community—the wings may be wanting. The organs of the mouth are partly
                    fitted for mastication by the development of jaws, and partly for suctorial
                    purposes by the possession of a proboscis or “antlia.” The females of this order
                    generally possess a terminal abdominal appendage, forming a “sting” <hi
                    rend="italic">{aculeus),</hi> or which may be used in the deposition of the
                    eggs, when it is termed an <hi rend="italic">ovipositor.</hi> The Hymenoptera,
                    besides, undergo a “complete” metamorphosis,—that is, in their passage from the
                    egg towards adult or mature existence they appear first as grubs, or <hi
                    rend="italic">larvae,</hi> then are enclosed in a pupa-case, and finally appear
                    as the perfect, and generally winged insect, or “imago.” The Hymenoptera
                    exhibit, perhaps, the most remarkable development among insects of the faculty
                    of instinct, and constitute excellent examples of so-called “social” insects,
                    living in communities regulated by definite laws, each member of the society
                    bearing a separate and well-defined part in the organisation and arrangement of
                    the colony at large.</p>
                <p>From the earliest times ants have attracted the attention, not only of
                    naturalists, but of philosophers and poets. The ancients were familiar with many
                    of the phenomena characteristic of the ant colony. Aristotle and Pliny, for
                    example, inform us that the labours of ants are regulated in a great measure by
                    the phases of the moon. Pliny also makes mention of a species which he alleges
                    is found in Northern India, which were said to equal Egyptian wolves in size,
                    and were supposed to occupy themselves in digging gold from the bowels of the
                    earth, whilst the inhabitants of the country were said to rob the ants in summer
                    of their accumulated winter treasures.</p>
                <p>The harvesting and grain-storing habits of ants, so familiar to the popular
                    reader, were at first supposed to be common to <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
                    species of ants; but this view has been abundantly proved to be erroneous,
                    whilst the opposite extreme of asserting that no species practise these habits
                    is to be viewed as equally incorrect. In many cases it is probable that
                    observers have been deceived into the supposition that certain species of ants
                    really carried grains of corn in their mouths, whereas the so-called corn grains
                    of these species were in reality the cocoons or pupae-cases containing the young
                    and immature forms. And whilst most species of ants are granivorous, or
                    vegetable feeders, certain species are as decidedly carnivorous. These latter
                    kinds do not, therefore, participate in the frugal and industrious habits of
                    their allies.</p>
                <p>The bibliography of ants is very extensive. Dr King, in the 23rd number of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> described the form of the
                    eggs and of the larvae, and also the habits of ants in reference to their care
                    of their young. Leeuwenhoeck, the Dutch naturalist, traced the successive stages
                    of development in the ants, and demonstrated the egg, “larva,” “pupa,” and
                    “imago,” or perfect insect. Swammerdam, with the application of the microscope,
                    further advanced the knowledge of the development and structure of the ants; and
                    Linnaeus (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of
                    Stockholm)</hi> ascertained many facts relative to the reproduction of these
                    forms, and determined that the winged ants are those which alone exercise the
                    generative functions. A Mr Gould published <hi rend="italic">An Account of
                    English Ants,</hi> of which work a notice by the Rev. Dr Miles is given in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1747. This account,
                    excellent in many respects, is nevertheless erroneous in certain points,—the
                    result of following too closely the analogy presumed to exist between bees and
                    ants. Geoffroy <hi rend="italic">{Histoire des Insectes qui se trouvent aux
                    Environs de</hi><hi rend="italic">Paris'),</hi> a good naturalist otherwise, is
                    a bad authority on the subject of ants. The most complete series of observations
                    on ants, which appeared among the earlier accounts of these forms, are those of
                    De Geer, a Swedish entomologist <hi rend="italic">{Mémoires</hi><hi

                    fidelity the utmost reliance may be placed. Olivier, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie Méthodique</hi> (article <hi rend="italic">Fourmi),</hi>
                    summarised the knowledge of his own and of preceding times, and described a few
                    new species of ants; and Bonnet, in his <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur les Insectes</hi> (vol. ii.), has given us some interesting,
                    though by no means extensive information regarding the habits of ants. The
                    “sugar-ant” (Î) forms the subject of a memoir in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1790, this latter species having caused
                    much havoc among the sugar-plantations of Grenada over a period of ten years.
                    Latreille, a famous entomologist, in his special monograph <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Histoire Naturelle des Fourmis),</hi> published at Paris in 1802, gave the
                    most succinct and accurate account of the ant-tribe which had appeared up to
                    that date. His description of the structure and classification of these insects
                    is remarkably clear, and he fully describes one hundred species known to
                    himself, and mentions twenty-four species which he was enabled to describe from
                    the reports of others. He distributed these species among nine families,
                    selecting as the bases of his classification the situation and structure of the
                    “antennae” or “feelers,” and the disposition of the abdominal scales.</p>
                <p>The habits of ants receive the fullest attention at the hands of Pierre Huber of
                    Geneva,'who in a treatise <hi rend="italic">{Traité des Moeurs des
                    Fourmis</hi><hi rend="italic">Indigenes)</hi> published in 1810, gave a very
                    interesting, lucid, and valuable account of his native ants, drawn from actual
                    observation of the nests and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0104-0095"/> communities. This result he achieved by means of
                    an apparatus which enabled him to view the interior of the nest. Many facts have
                    been added to the history of ants since 1810; the list of works and treatises
                    upon this and allied entomological pursuits having been largely increased,
                    especially of late years.</p>
                <p>The constitution of an ant-community may be readily appreciated; but it is, at
                    the same time, important to note the distinctions between the various groups or
                    sects into which the curious colony is divided. A threefold distinction of sex,
                    resulting in the production of three kinds of individual forms, is to be
                    perceived in the ant-colony, as well as among other hymenopterous insects <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> bees). These three grades of individuals are known
                    respectively as males, females, and neuters. The males and females <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fig.</hi> 1.—Wood Ant <hi rend="italic">(Formica rufa).</hi> 1,
                    Female; 2, Male; 3, Neuter.</p>
                <p>are winged,—the former retaining their wings throughout life, and the latter
                    losing these organs after the pairing is over. During the summer the winged
                    males and females are produced in large numbers, and they soon leave the nest to
                    take their “nuptial flight” in the air, in the course of which the females are
                    impregnated. The function of the male ants having been thus performed, they die;
                    the females, after impregnation, lose their wings; and whilst in this
                    comparatively helpless state they are conveyed by the neuters to new situations,
                    where they become the founders of fresh colonies.</p>
                <p>Each fertile female or “queen” is carefully attended by a retinue of “neuters,”
                    the latter being simply females the sexual organs of which are undeveloped. The
                    curious experiments of entomologists have proved that, in all probability, the
                    cause of this differentiation of sex is dependent upon the nature of the food
                    with which during the larval state the ant is fed. Exempted thus from all sexual
                    functions, the duties of the neuters are confined to the performance of all the
                    offices which contribute to, or are connected with, the welfare and labour of
                    the ant-community. They thus not only construct and build the nest or home, and
                    keep it in constant and assiduous repair, but they are also the providers of
                    food and sustenance for the community; and they act the part of nurses, in that
                    they carefully attend to the hatching, nutrition, and rearing of the young. They
                    are also the defenders of the colony, in that they protect the nest and its
                    inmates from the attacks and assaults of nearly-related enemies or foreign foes.
                    In connection with the defence of the ant-colony, certain species possess
                    peculiar neuters, termed “soldiers,” upon which the care and protection of the
                    community more especially devolve. These “soldiers” are provided with large
                    mandibles or biting-jaws, which constitute efficient organs of offence or
                    defence; and they are distinguished from the ordinary neuters by several
                    characteristics in addition to this larger development of the jaws.</p>
                <p>Regarding the more intimate structural differences which have been ascertained to
                    exist between the various members of the ant-community, it may be remarked that
                    the antennae of the male ants possess thirteen joints each, and those of the
                    female twelve. The antennae of the neuters are composed of twelve joints. The
                    abdomen of the male ant consists of seven joints, and that of the female and
                    neuter of six. The mandibles or large jaws of the female and neuter ants are
                    larger than those of the males, and are frequently found to be serrated or even
                    hooked at their extremities. The external sexual organs of the neuters
                    correspond to those of the females, although, as already remarked, the essential
                    internal reproductive organs are wholly undeveloped in the neuter ants; and to
                    this most important distinction there is added the absence of wings, the neuters
                    being thus distinguished from the females by a variety of characters, while the
                    near relation is at the same time shown of the one series of truly sexual forms
                    to those in which the sex is undeveloped. The neuters, it may lastly bo
                    remarked, conform to the female characteristics, in having the abdomen provided
                    with a sting, the male ants being destitute of this appendage.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of the ants conforms to the ordinary insect-type; but in these
                    and other insect forms, we find the highest development of those faculties to
                    which the general name of <hi rend="italic">Instinct</hi> is applied. By
                    instinctive acts, in their simplest sense, we mean those acts which an animal
                    performs chiefly from impressions made by surrounding objects upon its nervous
                    or sensory apparatus. These are very different in character and origin from the
                    actions of the higher vertebrate animals, in which the independent faculty of
                    <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> operates as the direct source of action, in place of
                    the surrounding circumstances of the lower form. Thus, in the case of ants,
                    bees, &amp;c., wonderful as their operations may appear, and regular and
                    methodical as the manner in which they are performed may seem, it will be found
                    that a marked uniformity and likeness of conditions exist, which tend to produce
                    a corresponding similarity of effects. The same external conditions thus tend to
                    induce undeviatingly similar series of phenomena, and under the operation of
                    these acts the animal exercising them may justly be compared to an automatic
                    machine, or to a piece of mechanism, self-directing only in so far as it is
                    directed by external .circumstances and outside conditions. Hence we find
                    certain species of ants or bees invariably constructing similar series of cells
                    or habitations, and engaging in the same labours as their predecessors, which
                    labours or operations will be faithfully and exactly repeated by succeeding
                    generations. And the automatic and mechanical nature of instinctive acts may be
                    clearly viewed when we contrast them in their essential nature with the
                    directing intelligence and guiding impulse of mind, as we find these qualities
                    exercised in the highest vertebrates. In the latter case, the mental impulse
                    itself directs alike the physical and psychical operations, and so far from the
                    animal being merely automatic, it assumes the higher phase of nervous action
                    involved in self-originating mental impulse. The actions of the intelligent
                    being are self-determined: those of the instinctive being originate from the
                    outer world. Through the higher nervous centres the intelligent being first
                    appreciates the outward circumstances, and then reacts upon them; the nervous
                    centres of the lower being are, in the first instance, acted upon by the outer
                    world, and then in their turn react upon the organism. Lastly, and in accordance
                    with the more perfect appreciation of external objects through sensations and
                    perceptions, we have to note in the higher being the operation of the educative
                    power we entitle <hi rend="italic">experience.</hi> The ant or bee, when first
                    introduced into the special sphere of its labours, assumes its functions, and
                    performs its duties as perfectly as if it had been engaged in their performance
                    for a lengthened period. And the long-continued performance of these duties will
                    in no degree tend to make the ant or bee a more perfect or more skilful worker
                    than when the performance of the duties first commenced. Here, again, we observe
                    the operation of the automatic powers; the lower animal, like the perfected
                    machine, operates at once and without any previous experience as perfectly as
                    after a lengthened period of working. But, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0105-0096"/> in the higher operations directed by
                    intelligence, the being acquires in a gradual manner, and only after a
                    lengthened experience, the perfect manner of working. In the one case instinct
                    incites the being automatically, or through the excitory outward impressions, to
                    perform the acts; in the other, an intelligent mind first appreciates the
                    impressions, and, through the educative training of experience, is enabled to
                    perform the acts, and to understand in a greater or less degree the reasons
                    which prompt and justify them.</p>
                <p>Apart from the possession of high instincts, however, we find ants, in common
                    with many other insects, to be possessed of very perfect senses. In addition to
                    the large compound eyes with which most insects are provided, they possess
                    simple organs of vision. The sense of smell also appears to be represented in
                    the ants and insects generally, but the seat of this sense has not been well or
                    satisfactorily determined. Judging from analogy, however, the olfactory
                    apparatus has been supposed to reside in the basal joints of the feelers or
                    antennae. Ants have been long observed to follow accurately the track of their
                    companions. Bonnet concluded that they were enabled to follow up this line of
                    march by their scent, and in proof of this he repeatedly drew his finger at
                    various parts across the line of march. The ants, on arriving at the interrupted
                    spots, seemed to lose scent, and directed their steps in an irregular and
                    hesitating manner, but having once crossed the interrupted space of the finger
                    track, they resumed their journey once more in a regular manner along the line
                    of march. Latreille, with the view of ascertaining if the sense of smell resided
                    in the antennae, cut off these organs in several ants, when he found that they
                    appeared to lose their way, and to be incapable of directing their further
                    steps. It may, however, on obvious grounds be doubted whether this experiment
                    may be deemed at all satisfactory or conclusive on the point. In this experiment
                    it was noticed that the neighbouring ants appeared to observe the distress of
                    their mutilated companions, and they seemed to stanch the wounds of the
                    sufferers by an application of the organs of the mouth to the wounded
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The antennae in insects are certainly the organs of touch, but in ants these
                    organs appear to subserve some undetermined function, in that through their
                    agency communication may be made from one ant to the other. Μ. Huber was so
                    strongly impressed with this latter fact, that he applied the term <hi
                    rend="italic">langage</hi><hi rend="italic">antennal</hi> to the intercourse
                    which he supposed took place between ants through the media of the antennae. For
                    example, by each ant striking its head against its neighbour, and by the
                    transmission of this impulse, the whole ant-community appeared to be warned of
                    danger, and in other ways, but chiefly through the antennae, the sense of danger
                    appears to be appreciated by each member of the colony.</p>
                <p>The food of ants has formed a debatable point ever since the attention of
                    naturalists was directed to the investigation of their economy. As already
                    remarked, many species are truly carnivorous, and prey upon the soft parts of
                    other insects, and particularly of larvae, which they are enabled to seize and
                    capture with little danger and trouble. The well-known partiality of ants for
                    animal food is taken advantage of by those who wish to obtain the hard parts or
                    skeletons of animal forms; since by placing an animal body within reach of an
                    ant-colony, the soft parts are gradually eaten away, and the harder portions are
                    left intact. In tropical climates, rats, mice, and poultry, even in a living
                    state, are said to succumb to the attack of these creatures; and man himself, as
                    related by Prévost in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Général</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Voyages,</hi> is even subject to the attacks of ants. Prévost
                    relates that an Italian missionary in Congo was awakened from sleep by his
                    negroes, with the intelligence that an immense horde of ants was invading his
                    house. Before he could rise they had already covered his legs, and the floor of
                    his house was carpeted by a thick layer of the invading forms. Fire seemed to be
                    the only preventive to their onward march; and it was stated that cows were
                    known to be devoured in their stalls by these creatures. These remarks may be
                    viewed as applying more particularly to the <hi rend="italic">white ants</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">termites,</hi> of which an account will be given, afterwards.
                    For <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi> ants seem to have a special predilection; and
                    they appear not only to obtain the saccharine matter from vegetables, but also
                    to abstract it from animal sources. The <hi rend="italic">aphides,</hi> or plant
                    lice, become in this way the subjects of very extraordinary attentions on the
                    part of ants. The plant lice possess a glandular structure, situated at the
                    extremity of the abdomen, which communicates with the external surface by two
                    small ducts. This gland secretes a sweet or saccharine liquid of viscous nature,
                    of which ants are extremely fond, and the <hi rend="italic">aphides</hi> appear
                    to be literally “milked” by their smaller neighbours. The antennae of the ants
                    in this case also appear to be the media of intercourse between the <hi
                    rend="italic">aphides</hi> and themselves, and by touching the abdomen of the
                    plant lice with the antennae, a drop of the saccharine liquid exudes from the
                    gland, which is eagerly seized upon by the ants; and in th13 fashion the milking
                    process is continued until the ant is satisfied. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >aphides,</hi> in this instance, appear voluntarily to surrender themselves for
                    the purpose of affording the saccharine matter; but it has been also alleged
                    that certain species of ants keep <hi rend="italic">aphides</hi> within their
                    nests for the purpose of affording the desired matter. Whether or not this
                    alleged domestication of the aphides by ants is to be deemed worthy of belief
                    yet remains to be proved. A single <hi rend="italic">aphis</hi> may be
                    occasionally seen surrounded by three or four ants, —the latter ordinarily
                    finding the <hi rend="italic">aphides</hi> on the leaves of plants and in their
                    natural habitat. The association of ants and aphides, strange as it may seem, is
                    not, however, without its parallels in the history of the ant-colony. Thus
                    wood-lice are not infrequently found as apparently normal guests within the
                    ant-nest; and Siva of Pisa observed a species of grasshopper, to which he has
                    given the name <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >myrmecophilus,</hi> which inhabits the nest of an Italian ant. The ant-nest, in
                    fact, appears to be the normal habitation of this grasshopper.</p>
                <p>The ant-nest forms a very interesting subject for consideration, and the various
                    groups of ants differ widely in the outward form and internal plan according to
                    which the nests are constructed, as well as in the materials of which the
                    habitations are built Clay, earth, and vegetable matters form the chief sources
                    of supply, and excavations in the ground, or erections above ground, in trees,
                    walls, and houseroofs, may be mentioned as the most common situations for the
                    nests. The internal arrangement also varies even to a greater extent than the
                    external appearance or materials. The general plan of the nest shows an
                    arrangement of flats or stories, connected throughout by passages, and supported
                    by definite pillars or partitions. The chief ends and objects in the
                    construction of the nest appear to be directed to the preservation of the
                    larvae, and to their protection from changes of temperature. During the night
                    the larvae are placed in the furthest chambers of the nest, the entrance to the
                    nest being carefully secured for warmth and for ensuring protection from the
                    raids of enemies. In the morning-the larvae are transferred by the diligent
                    neuters to the outer chambers, to which the sun’s heat has access; or they may
                    even be exposed directly to the sun. A change-of temperature or weather is
                    sufficient to set the watchful neuters on the alert, and to cause them to hurry
                    the larvae to the inner recesses of the abode, where they may be safely
                    protected from the variable effects of the climate.</p>
                <p>Some of the most curious and extraordinary traits in antcharacter relate to the
                    acquiring by certain ants <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> Amazon-ants<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n106/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0106-0097"/>) of the pupae or immature young of other species,
                    and the training and subjection of these pupae as slaves and servitors. Regular
                    raids and forays appear to be made by the slave-making ants upon the nests of
                    certain species, the pupae of which are captured, and when developed brought
                    into bondage and subjection to the captors.</p>
                <p>No closer imitation of the ways of man could well be found in the entire animal
                    economy; and the circumstances of these curious cases have been so thoroughly
                    investigated that the matter is placed above the possibility of doubt or error.
                    The relative position of the masters and slaves varies greatly, the extreme of
                    hard servitorship being seen in some cases, whilst in other cases the position
                    of the slaves is much easier. The slaves of <hi rend="italic">Formica
                    sanguinea</hi> are aided by their masters in the work of the colony. But in the
                    case of <hi rend="italic">Formica</hi><hi rend="italic">rufescens</hi> the
                    labours of the slaves are greatly increased,—the entire work of the community
                    devolving upon the unfortunate captives, and the neuters, laborious in other
                    species, being merely employed in the duty of capturing fresh servitors. This
                    latter trait also appears among the Amazon-ants, which literally stir neither
                    “hand nor foot,” nor make any effort to help themselves, but are waited upon and
                    attended in the most devoted manner by their willing serfs. The slave making
                    forays are by no means invariably destitute of bloodshed or warfare, and
                    frequent and hot combats appear to be engaged in between the would-be masters
                    and the species of intended slaves. Once captured, developed, and domiciled
                    within the nests of their masters, the slave-ants appear to be thoroughly at
                    home, and no effort at insurrection or attempt to gain their freedom appears
                    ever to be made. The early state of development in which the pupae are generally
                    captured, would necessarily favour the complete domestication of the captured
                    ants within the home of the slave-making community; and the ants appear to
                    possess and exhibit the greatest care and solicitation for the welfare of their
                    serfs, —the slaves being carried in the mouths of their owners when the latter
                    shift their abode, or undertake any expedition leading them from home.</p>
                <p>From the accounts of Messrs Bates and Belt, we gain some curious and interesting
                    information regarding species of ants peculiar to South and Central America,
                    which exhibit marked differences in habits from all British or even other
                    foreign species. Chief among these South American ants are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraging</hi> Ants <hi rend="italic">(Eciton),</hi> of which there are several
                    distinct species. These ants are truly carnivorous in their tastes, and ravage
                    whole districts, their march being regarded with terror by the natives of
                    Central America. Mr Bates tells us that different species have different modes·
                    of marching, by which they may be recognised. The Ecitons in Nicaragua are
                    termed “Army Ants,” and they appear regularly to change their hunting-grounds in
                    quest of food. Their community comprises males and females, and two kinds of
                    neuters or workers—a “workermajor,” or large-headed worker, and a small-headed
                    kind, termed the “worker-minors.” The former kind are noted for their elongated
                    jaws; and in some species these forms are denominated “soldiers,” their peculiar
                    office being the protection of the community from the attacks of enemies, or the
                    making forays on the nests of other species, or upon other aûimals. The habit
                    the Ecitons have of hunting in regular organised bands, distinguishes them from
                    other and more familiar British species <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Λfyrmica,</hi>
                    the Red Stinging Ant of Britain), which are predatory, but hunt in an irregular
                    and ill-defined manner. One of the best-defined species of foraging ants is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eciton predator,</hi> a small species which hunts in dense
                    hordes, and marches rapidly over a territory. A moving phalanx of this species
                    will extend over from 4 to 6 square yards; and any unwary insect meeting with,
                    or falling into the serried ranks, is soon torn to pieces and devcured. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecιton</hi><hi rend="italic">hamata</hi> hunts both in dense
                    masses or in detached columns. The nature of the prey appears to regulate the
                    mode of march. Thus, when proceeding in columns, Mr Belt found that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eciton</hi><hi rend="italic">hamata</hi> was in search of the
                    nests of another ant <hi rend="italic">(Hypo-clinea),</hi> the larvae and pupae
                    of which are seized by the Ecitons for the purpose of being brought up as
                    slaves, in accordance with the habits already alluded to. The Hypo-clineas rush
                    out on being attacked, bearing their pupae and larvae in their jaws; but the
                    Ecitons at once seize the young ants, although they never appear to injure the
                    parent Hypoclineas. The latter appear a cowardly race, as they make no effort at
                    self-defence, their habits leading them chiefly to milk <hi rend="italic"
                    >aphides,</hi> which they desert at once on seeing another and even smaller
                    species of ant approach. Birds and opossums are terrified, as well as insects,
                    at the Foraging Ants, and frequently fall victims to the determined onslaught of
                    the little furies.</p>
                <p>The other species of Ecitons comprise <hi rend="italic">Eciton</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rapax,</hi> the largest of the race, the body of which is
                    half-an-inch in length; <hi rend="italic">Eciton</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >legionis,</hi> famed for its ravages on other species of ants <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Formicae);</hi><hi rend="italic">Eciton</hi><hi rend="italic">hamata</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">E. drepano-</hi><hi rend="italic">phora,</hi> nearly related
                    species; and the so-called <hi rend="italic">Blind Ecitons,</hi> thus named from
                    the imperfect condition of the eyes. The <hi rend="italic">E. vastator</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">E. erratica,</hi> species of blind Ecitons, proceed on their
                    raids by means of covered roads or ways, which are excavated and formed in front
                    at a rate corresponding to the advance of the army.</p>
                <p>Some interesting information regarding the senses and instincts of the Foraging
                    Ants appears to corroborate the opinions of some earlier observers, already
                    alluded to, on the subject. About a dozen individuals of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eciton</hi><hi rend="italic">hamata</hi> were observed to assemble together, as
                    if in consultation, in a tramway excavation in Nicaragua. One ant suddenly left
                    the assembly, and ran up the perpendicular side of the cutting. The example of
                    this first ant was followed by several others, which ran after the first ant for
                    a short distance, then returned, and again proceeded for a farther distance
                    along the track of the first. The object of this proceeding was to make the
                    track readily determinable by the succeeding travellers, and the route of the
                    first individual was unerringly followed by the others, who were at long
                    distances behind. A portion of the trail was removed, when the ants appeared at
                    fault, and occupied themselves in making detours until they again hit upon the
                    interrupted track. On arriving at the top of the excavation, a suitable spot for
                    hunting was descried, when the information appeared to be quickly communicated
                    to those that were below, and the whole army rushed upwards in obedience to the
                    behest of the scouts. All the Foraging Ants are migratory in habits, and appear
                    to possess no fixed place of abode, but shift their camp at intervals of from
                    four to six or more days. The temporary abode is found in hollow trees, or under
                    fallen trunks. An Eciton, intentionally imprisoned beneath a stone, was
                    discovered by a companion, who at once informed his neighbours. The other ants
                    then came to the rescue; and by biting at the stone, trying to move it, and
                    seizing the prisoned ant by the legs, they, by their united efforts, set their
                    companion free. An ant embedded in clay, with only the points of the antennae
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0107-0098"/> protruding, was discovered by his neighbours, and
                    soon disentombed. And in cases where the efforts of one ant have been inadequate
                    to release a comrade placed in peril, the others were duly informed of the fact,
                    and hurried to assist their less fortunate neighbour. In crossing a crumbling
                    slope, which was gradually disintegrating under the passage of the ant-army, a
                    portion of the band, by adhering to each other, formed a solid, pathway, over
                    which the others passed safely. A twig formed a bridge across a small rill; but
                    this proving insufficient and too narrow for the transit of the army, it was
                    widened by ants clinging to each side of the twig, and in this way the track was
                    broadened sufficiently to admit of the easy passage of the mass. Such acts would
                    appear to lie beyond the category of purely instinctive processes, since they
                    appear to involve an adaptation of faculties to special cases, and result in
                    special actions being instituted, and thus bear some resemblance to what we
                    familiarly see involved in the process of reasoning characteristic of man’s
                    mental powers. The more ordinary operations of ant-life are purely instinctive,
                    as has been already shown; but it may be a matter for consideration if the
                    theory of some naturalists, that the higher development of instinctive powers is
                    akin to reason itself, may not be tenable. Such instances as these just given of
                    the curious and extraordinary acts of the Foraging Ants may serve to show from
                    what circumstances the theory obtains support. Houzeau, in particular, among
                    recent writers, adopts analogous views to these, and maintains that the ants
                    most nearly approach man in the arrangement and general nature of their social
                    existence and condition.</p>
                <p>The Leaf-cutting Ants <hi rend="italic">(Oecodoma)</hi> are noted pests of
                    central and tropical America; and, as is implied by their name, commit fearful
                    havoc among trees, laboriously and persistently carrying off in their mouths,
                    piece by piece, the foliage of trees and shrubs. The orange, lemon, and mango
                    trees in particular have suffered from their attacks. Carbolic acid has been
                    tried with success as a remedy against these ants, the use of this antiseptic
                    killing large numbers; and corrosive sublimate in powder, sprinkled across their
                    paths, has a deadly effect upon the leaf-cutters. Coal tar has also been
                    employed against them. Gigantic black ants, averaging an inch in length, are
                    found in Central America. They are notable as being solitary in their habits,
                    and possess well-developed eyes and formidable stings. These forms contrast with
                    the gregarious and social ants, in which the eyes are comparatively weak, or may
                    be rudimentary.</p>
                <p>Certain curious little ants <hi rend="italic">{Pseudomyrma bicolor)</hi> inhabit
                    the hollow thorns of the “bull’s horn” acacia of Central America. The horn-like
                    thorns form the nest, the aperture being situated near the tip of the thorn.
                    These ants preserve the plant from the attack of the Leaf-cutting Ants, and also
                    from mammals feeding upon it. The ants obtain a supply of food from the plant,
                    in the shape of a honeylike secretion, found in a gland situated at the base of
                    the leaflets. Protected by, and at the same time protecting the plant, the
                    intimate relations between the acacia and the ants may be argued to possess a
                    deeper significance than relates to a merely casual or chance connection. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Cecropia,</hi> or trumpet tree of Central America, is tenanted
                    by ants, which obtain a sweet fluid, through the agency of brown scale-insects
                    (C ’ ocαJce), kept by them in the cells of the trunk. This recalls the case of
                    the <hi rend="italic">aphides,</hi> or ordinary plant lice, the ants sucking the
                    fluid from the scale-insects through a dorsal or back-pore. The queen-ant in her
                    royal cell is attended by a special bevy of <hi rend="italic">Coccidoe,</hi> who
                    supply her with the requisite food. The <hi rend="italic">Coccidoe</hi> in
                    America take the place of the European <hi rend="italic">aphides</hi> as
                    ant-cows, but the tropical ants appear to attach themselves to other insects
                    also. Thus, the leafhoppers <hi rend="italic">{flembracis)</hi> are attended by
                    ants, for the sake of the honey which the larvae exude. Those insects which are
                    attended by ants are protected from the attacks of other animal forms; and the
                    shelter given to the ants thus serves to protect the tree or shrub, and to save
                    it from becoming exterminated.</p>
                <p>The “soldier ants,” referred to in the foregoing account of the Foraging Ants,
                    are not peculiar to that race, many other species also possessing “soldiers.”
                    These forms, as has been already stated, appear to be merely neuters which have
                    the jaws very largely developed, for the protection of the true neuters or
                    workers, and for the defence of the nest generally. This further subdivision of
                    the ant-community would seem to indicate an additional approach to the social
                    arrangements which characterise the human state.</p>
                <p>The reproduction and development of the ordinary ants may be very briefly touched
                    upon in the present notice. The impregnation of the females in their aerial
                    nuptial flight has been already alluded to, as also has the death of the males
                    after the congress. The impregnated females are conveyed to the nest, and the
                    deposition of eggs is proceeded with, the young forms being tended through their
                    larvae and pupae stages by the assiduous neuters. Unlike the bees, several
                    female ants may inhabit the same nest; and the swarming or exodus of the young
                    ants, so far from having for its one and essential object the formation of a new
                    colony, appears to be simply devoted to further reproductive measures. Thus,
                    those that leave the nest are the fresh males and females, the sexual history of
                    which has already been traced; and the nest thus remains a more or less
                    permanent institution, changing its inmates only in part, and in exceptional
                    circumstances alone giving origin to a new and independent colony.</p>
                <p>The stings with which the neuters and females are armed constitute formidable
                    organs of defence. The poison, to which the violent or painful effects of the
                    sting are due, appears to consist of a definite chemical organic compound, the
                    chief acid of which is known by the appropriate name of <hi rend="italic">formic
                    add,</hi> the formula for this compound being CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi>, Formic acid is also found in the glands attached
                    to the pointed hairs of stinging-nettles. This acid, in itself possessing
                    irritant qualities of a high order, also appears capable of producing even more
                    serious effects when manipulated by chemical means.</p>
                <p>The ant-colony, powerful as we have seen it to be, and well protected as it
                    undoubtedly is, is nevertheless subject to the attacks of enemies which wage a
                    successful war against it. Certain species of ants appear to be more subject
                    than others to the attack of such higher forms as the mammalian ant-eaters <hi
                    rend="italic">{Echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophagidoe)</hi> and
                    armadillos, as well as to the onslaught of the insect ant-lion <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Myrmeleo).</hi> The latter literally digs a pit for his victim, in the bottom
                    of which he lies securely hidden, ready to devour any unwary ant which may
                    chance to tumble in. And even where the victim is not within actual reach of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Myrmdeo,</hi> the latter by means of a shower of
                    sand-particles frequently succeeds in causing it to fall into the snare. Several
                    substances which have a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0108-0099"/> noxious effect upon the ant-colony have been
                    already mentioned. Thus carbolic acid and corrosive sublimate appear to affect
                    the ant-colony as poisonous agents; and solutions of tobacco, lime, soot, and
                    walnut leaves, with urine, are also stated to prove effectual in destroying
                    them, although these latter are decidedly inferior to the two first-mentioned
                    substances. Corrosive sublimate, indeed, appears to have a curious and even
                    specific action upon these forms, in rendering them actually <hi rend="italic"
                    >maniacal,</hi> to use a phrase which is applicable generally to the human
                    subject alone. Under the influence even of external contact with this substance,
                    the ants in Grenada during their ravages of last century, were observed to be
                    singularly affected, and were seen even to attack each other with outrageous
                    violence,—an effect also corroborated of late years in Central America by Mr
                    Belt, who saw the rabid ants collected into small balls biting one another, and
                    seizing hold of each other in a most extraordinary fashion under the influence
                    of the mercurial poison. The corrosive sublimate, it is stated, can be
                    effectively used only in dry weather.</p>
                <p>A brief description of the <hi rend="italic">Termites,</hi> or white ants, may
                    appropriately conclude the present article. These forms have already been stated
                    to be entirely different from the familiar and true ants, and to belong to the
                    Neuropterous insects, whereas the true ants are classed with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hymen-optera.</hi> They resemble the true ants in living in highly
                    organised social communities, and in being endowed with as high and as
                    specialised instincts. But they differ from them, first, in the fact that they
                    do not undergo a complete metamorphosis, that is, the Termite larvae and pupae
                    resemble the perfect insect, and do not pass through the defined stages of
                    change and development characteristic of the true ants, bees, and other insects.
                    The young Termite, in fact, differs from the ordinary adult only in the non-
                    p03sessi0n of eyes, and from the sexual forms in the nondevelopment of wings.
                    The white ants inhabit the tropical regions of the world generally, but are
                    found in the greatest abundance in tropical South America. Their nests form
                    characteristic structures, rising sometimes to a height of 5 or 6 feet, and
                    constructed of earthy particles worked into a mass as hard and durable as stone.
                    Many species of Termites are known, but they resemble one another in essential
                    structure and habits. As indicated by their popular name, they are of a whitish
                    colour and are soft-bodied. The Termite community consists, as in the true ants,
                    of males, females, and workers or neuters. In the true ants the latter are
                    undeveloped females, whereas in the Termites the sex of the neuters is w holly
                    undeterminable; and in addition the workers are invariably divided into two
                    distinct classes: the “soldiers,” with largely-developed jaws, whose sole office
                    is to defend the community; and the ordinary “workers,” on whom devolves the
                    entire labour of the nest. Both classes of neuters are blind; and from a close
                    examination of the eggs, the distinctions, not only between males and females,
                    but also between the soldiers and workers, may be easily seen. The difference in
                    food, so powerful in the development of sex and characteristics in other
                    insects, does not therefore operate in the case of the Termites. The entire
                    white ant colony and species also exhibits a division into subordinate groups
                    and classes, the recognition and characters of which are veιy difficult of
                    determination. And on this, as well as upon other grounds, the organisation of
                    the white ant com munity is generally to be regarded as of a higher type thar
                    that of the familiar and true ants.</p>
                <p>The nest of the Termites is known as a <hi rend="italic">termitarium^</hi> the
                    essential internal arrangement of which consists of a large number and series of
                    chambers, connected by galleries and passages. Entrance to the nest is afforded
                    by concealed roads and subterranean passages. A large hillock may be a compound
                    termitarium, formed by and inhabited by different species; and certain kinds of
                    Termites build their nests of smaller size, sometimes of the consistence of
                    paper. Their structures may be attached to the branches of trees, or they may be
                    entirely subterranean, or concealed under the bark or within the stems of trees.
                    The latter species are those which destroy timber, furniture, and household
                    objects.</p>
                <p>Within this curious home an equally curious community is found to reside. The
                    king and queen represent the sexual part of the community, the true neuters or
                    workers form the greater part of the ordinary individuals, and the soldiers and
                    winged Termites complete the list of inmates. The royal cells, tenanted by the
                    king and queen, exist in the inmost part of the nest, and are closely guarded by
                    a retinue of workers. The king and queen are wingless and much larger than the
                    neuter ants. The queen Termite when within the royal cell is permanently gravid,
                    the abdomen being immensely distended with eggs, which as they are produced, are
                    seized upon by the workers, <hi rend="smallcaps">Fig.</hi> 6,—White Ant <hi
                    rend="italic">{Terme*</hi><hi rend="italic">be∏icosut).</hi> Graτid female.</p>
                <p>and conveyed to special cells prepared for their reception. The relations of the
                    winged Termites to the other members of the nest long formed a subject of great
                    difficulty to naturalists; but they appear to be males and females, which are
                    ready to assume sexual relations, and to become the progenitors or kings and
                    queens of new communities. The neuters are, accordingly, quite distinct from the
                    sexual forms, and do not pass through any similar developmental phases, but
                    differ from the others, even in the egg, as has been already mentioned.
                    Occasionally a new termitarium may be found, in which a king and queen are
                    absent, and which contains workers only. These, however, gradually prepare the
                    nest for full completion, by bringing eggs into the cells from a neighbouring
                    termitarium, from which the due population of the colony will be in time
                    produced.</p>
                <p>The exodus or swarming of the Termites appears to resemble more nearly that of
                    the bees, although like that of the true ants, it is more purely reproductive in
                    its nature, and not so much connected with the departure of fully grown forms
                    from a hive which has become inadequate to the comfortable accommodation of all
                    its inmates. The larvae, prior to the swarming, are fed and tended by the
                    workers, the youngest larvae receiving the greatest share of attention. The
                    workers apparently feed the larvae by injecting a fluid from their mouths into
                    the larval cells; and in about a year after the deposition of the eggs the
                    larvae become fully grown, and the period of the exodus arrives. The exodus
                    generally takes place on damp evenings, or cloudy mornings, and many extend over
                    several days, or until such time as all the males and females have emerged from
                    the nest. Having reached the ground, the wings of each ant are shed by a natural
                    effect—a seam or place of separation existing at the roots of the wings—and
                    after <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0109-0100"/> the throwing off of the wings, the surviving
                    males and females pair, and become the parents of new colonies. Many fall
                    victims to the attacks of enemies, as spiders, bats, lizards, toads, and
                    goat-suckers. The pairs that survive take up their abode in some secluded
                    situation, as under leaves, or under a clod of earth; there the females become
                    impregnated, and by-and-by a new hive and its population are produced. The
                    Termites serve an important purpose, in the particular areas of the world they
                    inhabit, in disintegrating, removing, and destroying decaying wood.</p>
