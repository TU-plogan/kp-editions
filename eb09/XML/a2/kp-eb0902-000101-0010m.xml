                <p><hi>ANAXAGORAS,</hi> according to the most probable calculations, was born about
                    the year 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> At his native town of Clazomenae, in
                    Asia Minor, he had, it appears, some amount of property and prospects of
                    political influence, both of which he surrendered, from a fear that they would
                    interfere with his search after the knowledge of nature. In early manhood he
                    went to Athens, which was rapidly becoming the headquarters of Greek culture;
                    and in that city he is said to have continued for thirty years. Here Pericles
                    learnt to love and admire him; and the poet Euripides derived from him an
                    enthusiasm for science and humanity. His influence was due partly to his
                    astronomical and mathematical eminence, but still more to the ascetic dignity of
                    his nature, and his superiority to ordinary weaknesses— traits which legend has
                    embalmed. His observations of the celestial bodies led him to form new theories
                    of the universal order, and brought him into collision with the popular faith
                    which found the objects of its worship in the heavens. Anaxagoras had tried to
                    reduce eclipses to the operation of known causes: he had removed the halo of
                    deity from the sun, and profanely turned Apollo into a mass of blazing metal,
                    larger than Peloponnesus; and he was even reported to have brought the phenomena
                    of meteoric stones within the limits of predictable events. The dominant
                    polytheism, and the ignorance of the multitude, could not tolerate such
                    explanation; and the enemies of Pericles used the superstitions of their
                    countrymen as a means of attacking the ideas of that statesman in the person of
                    his friend. Anaxagoras was arrested on a charge of contravening the established
                    dogmas of religion; and it required all the eloquence of Pericles to rescue him
                    from the persecutors. Even then Athens could no longer be the sphere of his
                    activity. He was forced to retire to Lampsacus, where he died about 428 <hi

                <p>It is difficult to present the cosmical theory of Anaxagoras in an intelligible
                    scheme. All things hâve existed in a sort of way from the beginning. But
                    originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves,
                    endless in their number, inextricably mixed throughout the spaces of the world.
                    All things were in that mass, but in the obscurity of indistinguishableness.
                    There were the seeds or miniatures of com, and flesh, and gold, in the primitive
                    mixture; but these parts, of like nature with their wholes (the <hi
                    rend="italic">0∕jLoιoμcpη</hi> of Aristotle), had to be eliminated from the
                    complex mass before they could receive a definite name and character. The
                    existing species of things having thus been transferred, with all their
                    specialities, to the prehistoric stage, they were multiplied endlessly in
                    number, by reducing their size through continued subdivision, at the same time
                    that each one thing is so indissolubly connected with every other that the
                    keenest analysis can never completely sever them. The work of arrangement, the
                    segregation of like from unlike, and the summation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >oμoLoμepη</hi> into totals of the same name, was the work of Mind or Reason.
                    This peculiar thing, called Mind (νους), was no less illimitable than the
                    chaotic mass, but it stood pure and independent, a thing of finer texture, alike
                    in all its manifestations, and everywhere the same. This subtle agent, possessed
                    of all knowledge and power, is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life.
                    Its first appearance, and the only manifestation of it which Anaxagoras
                    describes, is Motion. Reason originated a rotatory movement in the mass (a
                    movement far exceeding the most rapid in this present scene), which, arising in
                    one comer or point, gradually extended till it gave distinctness and reality to
                    the aggregates of like parts. But even after it has done its best, the original
                    intermixture of things is not wholly overcome. No one thing in the world is ever
                    abruptly separated, as by the blow of an axe, from the rest of things. The name
                    given to it merely signifies that in that congeries of fragments the particular
                    seed is preponderant. Every <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of this present universe is
                    only <hi rend="italic">a</hi> by a majority, and is also in lesser number δ, c,
                    <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>Anaxagoras proceeded to give some account of the stages in the process from
                    original chaos to present arrangements. The division into cold mist and warm
                    ether first broke the spell of confusion. With increasing cold, the former gave
                    rise to water, earth, and stones. The seeds of4 life which continued floating in
                    the air were carried down with the rains, and produced vegetation. Animals,
                    including man, sprang from the warm and moist clay. If these things be so, then
                    the evidence of the senses must be held in slight esteem. <hi rend="italic"
                    >We</hi> seem to see things coming into being and passing from it; but
                    reflection tells us that decease and growth only mean a new aggregation and

                <p>Anaxagoras marks a turning-point in the history of philosophy. With him
                    speculation passed from the colonies of Greece to settle at Athens. By the
                    theory of minute constituents of things, and his emphasis on mechanical
                    processes in the formation of order, he paved the way for the Atomic theory. By
                    his enunciation of the order that comes from Reason, on the other hand, he
                    suggested the theory that nature is the work of Design. But the features of this
                    Reason he described in a vague and analogical way. Aristotle and Plato have
                    blamed him for basing his explanations on natural, not on final causes. These
                    charges are scarcely fair. Anaxagoras seems to have held that the order was the
                    work of Mind; but he needed not on that account to assume what the order was,
                    and then employ the conception to explain why things were so and so. The order
                    is rather the general postulate which the details have to prove, instead of
                    themselves resting upon it. The conception of Reason in the world passed from
                    him to Aristotle, to whom it seemed the dawn of sober thought after a night of
                    distempered dreams. From Aristotle it descended to his commentators, and under
                    the influence of Averroes became the engrossing topic of speculation. The
                    fragments of Anaxagoras have been collected by Schaubach (Leipsic, 1827), and
                    Schorn (Bonn, 1829). See also Mullach, <hi rend="italic">Fragmenta,</hi><hi
