                    instituted sacrifices of this kind, and probably this legend arose from the
                    connection of Acca Larentia, as <hi rend="italic">mater</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Larum,</hi> with the Lares who had a part in the religious ceremonies of the
                    arvales. But apart from this, there is proof of the high antiquity of the
                    college in the verbal forms of the song with which, down to late times, a part
                    of the ceremonies was accompanied, and which is still preserved (Becker, <hi
                    rend="italic">Handbuch der Röm. Alterthümer,</hi> iv. p. 407). It is clear also
                    that, while the members were themselves always persons of distinction, the
                    duties of their office were held in high respect. And yet it is singular that no
                    mention of them occurs in Cicero or Livy, and that altogether literary allusions
                    to them are very scarce. On the other hand, we possess a long series of what may
                    be called the minutes of their proceedings, drawn up by themselves, and
                    inscribed on stone. At the time of Marini <hi rend="italic">(Gli</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Atti e Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">eld Fratelli</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arvali,</hi> Roma, 1795) 67 of these sets of records were known,
                    beginning at 14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> and extending to the time of
                    Gordian. Since then several others have been discovered. The college consisted
                    of a master <hi rend="italic">(magister),</hi> a vice-master <hi rend="italic"
                    >(promagister),</hi> a <hi rend="italic">flamen,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >praetor,</hi> with eight ordinary members, attended by various servants, and in
                    particular by four boys, sons of senators, having both parents alive. These
                    officers were elected annually in May, but did not enter on their duties till
                    the 17th December. Each wore a wreath of grain, a white fillet, and the
                    praetexta. The great annual festival which they had to conduct was held in
                    honour of the Dea Dia, who appears to have resembled the goddess Ops, the wife
                    of Saturn. It occupied three days, and fell either on the 17th, 19th, 20th, or
                    the 27th, 2 9 th, 30th of May. The ceremony of the first day of the May festival
                    took place in Rome itself, in the house of the magister or his deputy, or <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Palatio Rivorum,</hi> where after sunrise
                    the peculiar ceremony was gone through of “touching” <hi rend="italic">(tangere
                    fruges)</hi> samples of the old and the young grain. On the second and principal
                    day of the festival the ceremonies were conducted <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">luco Dece Diae,</hi> that is, in a grove just beyond the fifth
                    milestone from <pb break="no"

                    sacrifice two young pigs <hi rend="italic">(por cilice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >piaculares)</hi> to purify the grove, which, it was held, was liable to be
                    defiled in a religious sense by the felling of trees, and by the presence in it
                    of any iron tool or instrument, such as was required by the lapidary who
                    engraved on stone the records of the proceedings. Then, after the sacrifice of a
                    white cow, the magister drew up a minute of what had been done, and all retired
                    to their tents. At midday they again met, settled and confirmed the minutes, and
                    the public being now excluded, went into the depth of the grove to sacrifice a
                    fat sheep. Returning to the temple, the <hi rend="italic">thesauri,</hi> which
                    seem to have been money collected from the people present, were placed on the
                    altar, and the arvales arranged themselves in a line, with an attendant at each
                    end. The attendant at one end received from the public the samples of grain and
                    fruits which they had brought to be “touched,” or blessed, and handed them to
                    the brother next him, who passed them on till they reached the attendant at the
                    other end, who restored them to the owners. The arvales now entered the temple,
                    and with closed doors proceeded to dance and sing the song of the brotherhood,
                    which is known to have been sung by them in its ancient form down to the 3d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> This was followed by the election of
                    officers for the next year, a banquet, and races. On the third day the sacrifice
                    took place in Rome, and was of the same nature as that offered on the first day.
                    Among the many minor occasions on which the arvales had to offer sacrifice were
                    the birthday of an emperor, the beginning of a consulate, an escape from danger,
                    the starting for or return from a journey, or other event of importance to the
                    imperial family, but especially on the 3d of January, on which day a particular
                    form of prayer for the ruling emperor was recited, and sacrifice offered to a
                    series of deities, male animals to male deities, and female to female. In the
                    British Museum is a bust of Marcus Aurelius in the dress of a Frater Arvalis.
