                    according to laws to be presently discussed, have not remodelled and
                    transfigured or disfigured; while the scarcity of documents makes it impossible
                    to reconstruct a coherent historical picture. Thus the work of comparison
                    between the historical and the legendary personages, such as has been performed
                    for Charlemagne by MM. Gaston Paris and Léon Gautier, is impossible in the case
                    of Arthur. We can only study the legend and analyse its elements.</p>
                <p>There is an error, not so popular as it once λvas, which supposes that myths and
                    legends are arbitrary creations, and does not recognise them as having an origin
                    in regular causes, and therefore a rational history, before the period when they
                    are crystallised into their final legendary form, or are merged in the current
                    of a literature in that later and artificial stage when it disinters and
                    refashions old materials. Before Arthur took his final French form in the
                    Romances of the Round Table, he was a Celtic hero in the Breton, and more
                    specifically still in the yet earlier Welsh, legends. And behind these is the
                    original Arthur, of whom we must <pb break="no"

                    from his contemporaries, Myrdhinn and Lywar’ch.</p>
                <p>Lywar ’ ch, a bard and king, born about 480, was one of the companions of the
                    valiant chief, Urien of Reghed, in Cumberland, upon whose death he composed a
                    pathetic lament. He survived the death of his twenty-four sons in the last
                    struggles against the Saxon, and in his old age, banished and a cripple, he
                    wrote from his hiding-place a mournful hymn on his own and his country’s decay,
                    in which lovers of the poetry of despair have admired this verse worthy of Job
                    :—“See yonder leaf driven by the wind; woe for him who has the like lot! it is
                    old, though born within the year.” But the bard-king had only despaired after a
                    life-long struggle, and in like manner the bardprophet Myrdhinn had long sung in
                    praise of peace before he went mad with grief, on the night of the battle of
                    Arderidd, where the northern and southern Celts slaughtered each other to the
                    profit of the Saxons. Before this fratricidal struggle (the beginning of the 6th
                    century) Myrdhinn had cherished the dream of the resurrection, of an ancient
                    chief, whom he called Lemenitz :—</p>
                <p>“My prophetic soul foretells it; discord shall reign among the British tribes
                    until the federation which shall be formed by the chief of heroes, Lemenitz,
                    when he comes back to the world. Like the dawn he will arise from his mysterious
                    retreat.”</p>
                <p>By this chief of heroes, destined to bring back union, the bard meant his king
                    and friend, Aurelianus Ambrosius, and after his death Arthur, his valiant
                    successor, and Myrdhinn’s own pupil. The battle of Arderidd came to dissipate
                    the last of these illusions. One of the contending hosts consisted of northern
                    Celts, bent upon imposing on all of their race yet unconquered in Great Britain
                    the authority of Howell of Scotland, the brother of that Gildas who soon
                    afterwards became a convert at once to Christianity and to Saxon interests. The
                    other host, that of the southern Celts, was led by Aurelianus Ambrosius, whose
                    favourite bard was Myrdhinn. After the final destruction of the Celtic power,
                    the destiny of Myrdhinn is to reappear in legend with the Latinised name of
                    Merlin. Aurelianus Ambrosius and Arthur, the two Celtic chiefs to whom the bard
                    had been so loyal, undergo a like resurrection; but their lives and exploits are
                    confounded, according to the accumulative method of legend, with each other and
                    with those of Vortigern, king of Kent. The Arthur of the legend more than
                    realises all the prophecies of Merlin; and these prophecies in the process of
                    oral repetition, and in travelling further from the place and the time of their
                    origin, themselves were altered to an ampler tenor. They underwent one great
                    degree of change in crossing the Channel, and another and greater in passing
                    from the soil and speech of Brittany into those of France. With the tenor of the
                    prophecies grow the proportions of the hero. The poetic Arthur pacifies the
                    Celts, quells the Saxons, and ends by establishing a reign of justice upon
                    earth. It is a hard saying, but true, that the key to all this is a certain
                    sentiment which is the mark of conquered races. The Celtic genius after its
                    defeat in arms would have revenge in songs. What happened was this. The Celtic
                    chief, Vortigern, summoned to his help the Saxon chief Hengist. Now, let it be
                    noted that, in the annals of the Saxon kingdom of Kent, the fourth king in
                    succession from Hengist is the Saxon Ethelbert. Turning to the legend, it will
                    be found that the corresponding fourth king in succession from Vortigern is the
                    British Arthur. For in legend the treachery of Vortigern must not be allowed to
                    bear fruit, the Celts after many a struggle must be left conquerors. The honour
                    of giving the last blow to the Saxon invasion in Kent, West Wales, and
                    elsewhere, is assigned in the legend to Arthur. And why to Arthur Î Because of
                    the ancient prophecies of the resurrection of the fabled Lemenitz, with whom
                    later times identified him, and above all, because the whole legendary structure
                    hinged upon the impressive portraiture of Merlin, whose historical prototype
                    had, in fact, been the devoted follower of the historical Arthur and Aurelianus
                    Ambrosius. But this edifice of fable, under which the Celts strove to hide from
                    themselves the real ruin of their race, was not built up in a day. The conquered
                    people repeated and enlarged upon the prophecies of Merlin; and with these grew
                    the figure of Arthur, enriched by every noble trait which could be borrowed from
                    the stories of the bravest chiefs, and made to accord with the prophecies. Round
                    the main personage soon revolved other ideal types, and little by little was
                    founded the harmonious hierarchy of King Arthur and his knights, such as it now
                    remains in romance, and such as never existed in reality. The tales were then
                    carried into France, for just as in England the Irish bards were held in higher
                    esteem than the Welsh, in France the Breton lays were preferred to the songs of
                    the <hi rend="italic">trouvères.</hi> While this work of infiltration was going
                    on, Geoffrey of Monmouth set down, in 1130 and 1147, the Arthurian legend in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Historia, Britonum,</hi> and. emboldened by the popularity of
                    this work, published afterwards a poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Vita
                    Merlini,</hi> which lent the authority of Latin to the tissue of fabulous
                    successes. Robert Wace translated the chain of legends into old French, and
                    Richard de Borron added has <hi rend="italic">Saint Graal,</hi> which serves in
                    some sort as a theological preamble to the Romances of the Round Table. At that
                    time the poems of the Car-lovingian era had lost their hold on popular favour,
                    as much from the unreality of their heroes,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charlemagne</hi><hi rend="italic">à la barbe</hi><hi rend="italic">florie,
                    Roland,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La violente</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Blanchefleur,—</hi> as because the dominant sentiment pervading these poems, as
                    binding faith and loyalty between vassal and lord, had ceased to find an echo in
                    the hearts and life of the people. An attempt was made to replace the
                    Carlovingian Cycle by another formed from the various songs taught by Breton
                    minstrels to <hi rend="italic">trouvères</hi> and troubadours; for Charlemagne
                    was substituted the far more poetical type of Arthur. <hi rend="italic">Languor,
                    fatality, pleasure,</hi> were all personified in Lancelot, Tristan, Gaurin,
                    &amp;c., and the Romances of the Round Table took the shape in which they now
                    remain. Nevertheless, those who have traced the legend to its source, and for
                    whom the ancient Celtic foundation is still visible, will regret in reading even
                    the graceful paraphrases of Christian de Troyes, or the sweet and simple poems
                    of Marie de France, their departure from the original types.</p>
                <p>The recent discoveries of Messrs Owen Jones and Her-sart de la Villemarqué in
                    Welsh literature show us how much the romances lost in elevation of sentiment
                    and depth of thought as they varied from the Celtic model. To give an example.
                    of this revarnishing and its effect in concealing the primitive foundation, we
                    may cite Tristan, who, in the original legend, drinks the philtre to obtain by
                    it all knowledge, and his madness and despair that ensue are the madness and
                    despair of one fatally gifted with universal insight; whilst in the French
                    romance the philtre becomes a vulgar love draught. This was only a preliminary
                    step to the false sentiment of modern French <hi rend="italic"
                    >romanticists,</hi> who have since, in their exaltation of the passions,
                    dispensed with philtres altogether. In the same way Merlin, in the Welsh texts,
                    is mad with grief on beholding a fratricidal war, and his madness, according to
                    the old Celtic idea, endows him with the power of a seer and magician over all
                    nature. In the romances his frenzy and magical power have no worthier cause than
                    his love for Vivian.</p>
                <p>The figure of Arthur, on the contrary, seems to gain in dignity by the migrations
                    of the legend. In the Welsh tale of <hi rend="italic">0ιvain and Gherain</hi>
                    (Ivain et Erec, with Christian de Troyes), <hi rend="smallcaps">wo</hi> see him,

                    as a little exalted monarch, a <hi rend="italic">roi-bonhomme,</hi> asleep on
                    his throne, while the chiefs of his following relate at their ease all their
                    adventures. Here we find preserved the idea of the individual independence of
                    all the Celtic chiefs, whose king, only <hi rend="italic">primus inter
                    pares,</hi> must necessarily have been as little of a sovereign as possible.
                    After the legend has passed into France Arthur becomes a sort of rival
                    Charlemagne, holding supreme and boundless sway, though never as a real feudal
                    emperor (they were tired of that in France), but rather as a Marcus Aurelius,—a
                    monarch, half philosopher, ruling chiefly by his wisdom and subtlety, and still
                    more a judge than a general over his people. The type is one which belongs
                    essentially to the Celtic mind, more akin to the Greek than any other, and
                    naturally as far removed from the Roman as from the Saxon turn of thought.</p>
                <p>Among the writers of the 17th and 18th centuries the historical existence of
                    Arthur was, with a few rare exceptions, denied, and the Arthurian legend
                    regarded purely as an invention of the worthy chronicler, Geoffrey of Monmouth.
                    Pinkerton bestows a moment’s notice on “the king whose exploits fill all the
                    poetry of the Middle Ages, and whose very existence is doubtful,” and then
                    passes on. The difficulty of establishing the filiation of Arthur perplexed
                    Milton, who says, “As to Arthur, more renowned in songs and romances than in
                    true stories, who he was, and whether any such reigned in Britain, has been
                    doubted heretofore, and may again with good reason. No less is in doubt who was
                    his father; and as we doubted of his parentage, so may we also of his
                    puissance.” Guin-guené settled everything by the unwarranted explanation, that
                    English romancers had invented an Arthur out of jealousy of the French
                    Charlemagne. English writers of Guinguené’s calibre in mythical science replied,
                    that Arthur was a French invention of Richard or Elie de Borron, or of the
                    Anglo-Norman Mapes, basing the assertion on an expression found in Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth. Ampère, deficient here in his usual penetration, throws entire
                    discredit on the good faith of Marie de France, who speaks of having seen and
                    handled the original Celtic MS. Fauriel, and with him the other French <hi
                    rend="italic">savans,</hi> would fain have attributed the Arthurian legend to
                    the troubadours rather than acknowledge its Welsh origin. He asked for the tests
                    which have since been discovered by Mr Owen Jones and commented on by Μ. Hersart
                    de la Villemarqué with perhaps indiscreet zeal. Sir Walter Scott’s excellent
                    historical instinct had already exhibited a part of the truth in bis edition of
                    Thomas of Ercildoune’s Rhymes. We may now, therefore, venture on being more
                    positive than Southey, and less sceptical than Mr Thomas Wright, the two modern
                    editors of the translation which Sir Thomas Malory made in 1634 of the five
                    Romances of the Round Table (he “compiled the booke oute of certaine bookes of
                    Frensshe, and reduced it into Englysshe”), and we may follow almost step by step
                    the development of the legend, and of the various Arthurs, from the British
                    Arthur of history to the mythical Arthur of Cambrian and Breton tradition, and
                    lastly to the French Arthur, the rival of Charlemagne.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude by noticing the main features of the character of Arthur, and
                    indicating their origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Historic Facts.—</hi> The general belief regarding Arthur has
                    been that he was a leader of the Celtic tribes of the west of England against
                    the Saxons. It is recorded that, about the middlo of the 5th century, Kent,
                    after suffering from famine and pestilence, was invaded by the Picts and Scots,
                    while at the same time another struggle, longer and more keen, was taking place
                    in West Britain against another Saxon invasion. The longer and braver resistance
                    of the Western Celts is partly set down to the merit of their leaders,
                    Aurelianus Ambrosius and Arthur. The men of Kent, however, after a vain appeal
                    to Aelius, prefect of the Gauls, were induced by Vortigern, their most important
                    chief, not only to make peace with the Saxons, but to invoke their aid against
                    the Picts and Scots. Hengist was appealed to, and the looked-for Saxon alliance
                    became the Saxon invasion and conquest of Kent, after Hengist, heretofore a <hi
                    rend="italic">Heretogen,</hi> became a king. Whilst his immediate descendants
                    were establishing themselves in succession to him, the contest in the plain of
                    Arderidd took place, which occasioned Myrdhinn’s frenzy. Arthur was slain in the
                    battle called by historians the victory of Mountbadon near Bath, 520 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.</hi></p>
                <p>[The historical Arthur is now regarded by many as having been a 6th century
                    leader, <hi rend="italic">Guledig,</hi> or “Dux Bellorum” of the northern Cymry
                    of Cumbria and Strathclyde against the encroaching Saxons of the east coast
                    (Bernicia), and the Picts and Scots from beyond the Forth and Clyde. For such
                    would appear to be the, at least, approximately certain result of recent
                    researches, in opposition both to the scepticism of the 17th and 18th centuries
                    as to the existence of an historical Arthur, and to the popular notion of him as
                    a West-of-England king, or king of Wales, or Cornwall. This conclusion had,
                    however, been more or less distinctly suggested by Chalmers, by Sir Walter
                    Scott, by a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> (1842), by
                    Mr Nash, and by Dr Burton. Yet this result of special recent researches is still
                    so far from being generally known and accepted, that it may be desirable briefly
                    to indicate the arguments in support of it.</p>
                <p>First, then, we have the facts of the northern extension and conflicts of the
                    Cymry in those five centuries, from the 6th to the 10th, which may be
                    distinguished as the Pre-mediaeval Period. For these facts our first authorities
                    are the only premediaeval British historians, Gildas and Nennius —the <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi> of the one
                    having been composed in the 6th, and the earliest of the works that go under the
                    name of the other in the 7th century. Now, in the former there is, at least,
                    nothing to favour that popular notion as to Arthur which is derived from the
                    mediaeval chronicles; for the words in the Durham MS., “Qui prope Sabrinum
                    ostium habetur,” are now acknowledged to be an interpolation of the 13th
                    century. And the latter is most naturally interpreted as positively affirming
                    that Arthur’s conflicts we <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e with the Saxons of
                    Bernicia (Northumberland and the Lothians). It has been contended that this
                    could not be meant, because the Teutonic settlers in the north were Angles. But,
                    in answer to this, it can now be affirmed that the earlier Teutonic settlers in
                    the north were Frisians, a tribe of Saxons; and that the northern settlement of
                    the Angles did not take place till 547, after the time of Arthur. Besides, the
                    bards of the 6th century, to whom are attributed those historical poems, which
                    do not, however, appear to have taken their earliest consistent shape farther
                    back than the 7th century, and which have been recently edited by Mr Skene under
                    the title of the <hi rend="italic">Four Ancient Books of Wales,—</hi> these
                    Cymric bards—Merlin, Taliessin, Aneurin, and Llywarch Hen—are all connected with
                    the north; of a large proportion of their poems the scenery and events lie in
                    the north; these poems are, in fact, the literature of the Cymric inhabitants of
                    Cumbria and Strathclyde before these kingdoms were subjugated by the Saxon king,
                    Edmund of Wessex, and by him ceded to the Gaelic king, Malcolm king of Scots, in
                    946; the warriors, whose deeds are celebrated in these poems, were “Gwyr y
                    Gogledd,” or men of the north; and the historical Arthur, who figures in five of
                    them, is no southern king, but a Guledig, whose twelve battles are in the north.
                    And, finally, in evidence of the former northern extension of the Cymry, it is
                    as Bretts and Welsh that the inhabitants<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0713-0652"/> of Cumbria and Strathclyde are referred to by the
                    contemporary Saxon chroniclers, and in the charters and proclamations of the
                    Scottish kings, David I., Malcolm IV., and William the Lion. So late, indeed, as
                    1305, we find a recognition of the Cymry as a distinct element of the population
                    of southern Scotland, in the enactment that “the usages of the Bretts shall be
                    abolished and no more used.” And it is to Welsh that we must still look for the
                    etymology of the names of the great natural features of that district of
                    southern Scotland which would appear to have been the scene of the battles of
                    the historical Arthur. From Welsh the names Tweed, Tcviot, Clyde, Nith, and
                    Annan, and the numerous Esks, Edens, and Levens, &lt;tc., are all derived. From
                    Welsh, also, we explain Cheviot, and the names of the border hills. And where
                    the eminences of southern Scotland are not <hi rend="italic">hills, fells,
                    laws,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">knowes,</hi> they are <hi rend="italic"
                    >pens,</hi> as in Wales or Cornwall.</p>
                <p>But if, as these various facts (and particularly the connection in which Arthur
                    is mentioned in contemporary, or approximately contemporary, histories and
                    historical poems) lead us to believe, Arthur was a leader of those northern
                    Cymry afterwards absorbed in the population of southern Scotland and the English
                    border, then, in this district, we ought certainly to find localities which can
                    be more or less clearly identified with those mentioned in the earliest
                    historical notices of Arthur; and localities also which, in their names or the
                    traditions associated with them, commemorate his story. Now, it has been shown
                    that such localities are not only found in the district thus defined, but are
                    found there in such numbers as can nowhere else be paralleled. And a very
                    important verification is thus obtained of what, from the scantiness of the
                    earliest sources, might, if thus unsupported, be regarded as a mere hypothesis
                    rather than a theory, with respect to the scene of the battles of the historical
                    Arthur.</p>
                <p>Scotland, however, is but the northern extremity of a long line of country in
                    which Arthurian localities are found. What we may call the Arthur-land extends
                    from the Forth and Clyde, or rather from the Grampians, in Scotland, to the
                    Loire in France, and includes (besides the south of Scotland and the north of
                    England) Wales, Somersetshire, Cornwall, and Brittany. It is certain that the
                    scene of the battles of the historical Arthur of the Gth century could have been
                    but a comparatively small area of this vast territory. There must, therefore,
                    have been a migration of Arthurian traditions from the south to the north, or
                    from the north to the south. And if, on quite independent grounds, we find it
                    more probable that such migration of tradition was from the north to the south,
                    rather than from the south to the north, it is evident that we shall have a
                    still further verification of the hypothesis suggested by our examination of the
                    earliest historical records. Now, considering these facts,—Cymric migrations
                    from, but not to, the north; the northern descents of some of the southern
                    dynasties; theupburstof Cymric literature (which belongs in the main to the
                    mediaeval period) contemporaneously with the last struggles for, and final loss
                    of, national independence; and the satisfaction, too great to be regardful of
                    historical truth, which a conquered people would have in locally commemorating
                    former victories and heroes of their race,—we cannot but see conditions in the
                    highest degree favourable to the importation from the north of the Arthurian
                    traditions of Wales, the south-west of England, and the north-west of France. On
                    the other hand, we not only find no conditions favourable to the importation of
                    Arthurian traditions from the south into the north, but conditions that would
                    have been positively inimical to the preservation of such traditions, and
                    conditions, therefore, that would seem to make it impossible to explain the
                    existence of Arthurian localities in the north, except on the hypothesis of the
                    north having been the scene of actual Arthurian events. Such conditions are to
                    be found in these facts :— the absorption of the northern Cymry by a kindred
                    race with whom they had never, save temporarily, been at war, viz., the Scots, a
                    brother of whose king they had themselves voluntarily elected to the throne in
                    918, previously to their being regularly incorporated with the Scottish
                    nationality after the treaty of 94G between Malcolm II. and their Saxon foe,
                    Edmund of Wessex; the preparation for this political incorporation in the 10th
                    century by an ecclesiastical incorporation in the 8th century, through the
                    subversion of the native Cymric Church by the opponent Irish or Columban Church
                    of the Scots with its Gaelic language, whence followed the dying out of the
                    Cymric language; and, finally, the possession by the Scots, with whom the
                    northern Cymry were thus incorporated, of a traditional and poetic literature of
                    their own, which must certainly have greatly opposed the introduction, after
                    their incorporation of the Cymry, of Cymric poetry and tradition, and been
                    highly unfavourable to its preservation, if it had any other than a native
                    historical origin. But yet, further, it is to be noted that Arthurian localities
                    are, speaking generally, found in Scotland only where, in the Gth century, there
                    was a Cymric population; that that part of Scotland in which Arthurian
                    localities are, speaking generally, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> found, coincides
                    with the ancient kingdoms of the Picts, and Scots, and is dotted all over with
                    localities belonging to the other great cycle of Celtic tradition, the Fenian,
                    Fingalian, or Ossianic; and that, while Fingalian localities are not found at
                    all in the Arthurian district, Arthurian localities arc found in the Fingalian
                    district, or in the ancient territory of the Picts, only in cases in which their
                    being found in that territory is a strong indication of their having originated
                    in such actual historical facts as they commemorate. <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Additions to Historic Facts and Introduction of Mythological
                    Elements.—</hi> From the Saxon invasions resulted two emigrations closely
                    succeeding each other of Britons into French Brittany; and the impenetrable
                    forests and mountains of Wales afforded a refuge where the more recent fugitives
                    from Wessex or the north mingled with the earlier exiles from Kent, and hence
                    the subsequent confusion of historic facts. Vortigern of Kent became in the
                    legend the kinsman of Ambrosius of Wessex; the gaps in the history were filled
                    up by mythic reminiscences, and to Arthur was assigned a celestial and
                    miraculous parentage from Uthyr Pendragon, that is to say, Head of the Dragon.
                    Under the form of a cloud this Celtic Jupiter became the father of Arthur, who
                    in the same mythological order gave his name to two constellations, Arthur’s
                    chariot, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Great Bear, and Arthur’s lyre. But the
                    word for cloud in Welsh was <hi rend="italic">Gorlasar.</hi> Now, whilst the
                    legend was carried from place to place acquiring new force, the Celtic world had
                    made a stand against Roman and Teutonic ideas; there was, as in Greece, a
                    tendency to explain the earlier myths, no longer understood, into the gross
                    elements of adultery and incest; bastardy was not censured, &lt;tc. Thus the
                    Uthyr Pendragon of the Romances of the Round Table is a real Jupiter. The cloud
                    becomes a man, <hi rend="italic">Gorloes;</hi> and there is an Alcmene, Ygierne.
                    In short, when Molière has, with more genius than morality, diverted so many
                    generations by his <hi rend="italic">Amphitryon,</hi> he is striking an old
                    Celtic and Welsh chord. Then Arthur is another Hercules. An advantage, from a
                    national point of view, gained to the legend by Arthur’s celestial and pagan
                    origin, is that he becomes by it at once above and akin to all the Celtic
                    chiefs. All the chiefs become his brethren; their sons, who flock to fight under
                    his banner, his <hi rend="italic">beaux</hi><hi rend="italic">neveux,</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">bonhomie</hi> which was the chief characteristic of the early
                    Cambrian Arthur. The Arthur born of the recollections and resentments of exile
                    has a more terrible shape. In Brittany, the land of exile, was elaborated this
                    type of a national avenger,—a more moral David (Arthur slays his giant), a
                    Solomon without his scepticism (Arthur was a great author of proverbs). In exile
                    this figure of a Celtic Messiah was graven with some of its most indelible
                    traits. Arthur’s own device is very far removed from the gospel; he out-Herods
                    Herod, and, franker than the Jesuitical cruelty of the twelve tables or of
                    Shylock, he goes beyond the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >talionis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> “a heart for an eye, a head for an arm,”
                    he says. Alain de Lille relates, in his commentaries and explanations on the
                    prophecies of Merlin, that in his day any one who, drinking with the Bretons,
                    would tell them that Arthur was dead and never to return, was in danger of being
                    stoned. “Like the dawn, he will arise from his mysterious retreat.”</p>
                <p>To return to the Arthur of the Round Table, nothing in the romances is touched
                    with more generous sentiment than his invariable affection for Ken (Kay of the
                    Welsh légends), his cunning but clownish, friendly yet treacherous seneschal.
                    For the infant Arthur had been confided by Merlin to Antor, and believed himself
                    his son, while Ken, the real son of Antor gives place to Arthur, is neglected,
                    and all his evil qualities are derived from the wicked nurse to whom he had been
                    given away from his mother; so Arthur was bound to be patient and kind to Ken in
                    after life, and forgive him many times for being “fol et vilain et fei.”</p>
                <p>We shall not describe the trials to which Arthur submits, those of the sword and
                    of the anvil, for instance, nor the essay in royalty he makes without taking the
                    title of king, though the idea of being made a king, not only by election, but
                    even after examination, is remarkable. Nor shall we relate how, in disguise,
                    aided by his friends Ban and Bohor, he rescues Leogadan from the “Saisnes”
                    (Saxons) and Danes; in disguise, as Merlin explains to Leogadan, who had thrown
                    himself at the feet of his deliverer to entreat to know his name—because thus,
                    without naming himself, should a hero, who is the son of a king, seek out and
                    win his wife. So Arthur woos and weds Guenever, Leogadan’s daughter, the
                    Gwenhwyvar of the Welsh tales. The Welsh would have their Arthur cross the
                    Channel to succour their kindred allies in Brittany; the Bretons, in the same
                    way, sent their Arthur into Great Britain, hence confusions which explain each
                    other. One reproach, which has been made at all times, by Mr P. Paris, as by
                    William of Newburgh, to the revengeful instinct which was the soul of the
                    Arthurian legend, is its monstrous vanity, which has depicted Arthur as an
                    opponent and conqueror of the Romans. William of Newburgh has said, “the Britons
                    were little to be feared as warriors, little to be trusted as citizens;” and
                    this passage curiously resembles one in the legend where a Roman knight, before
                    the battle of Langres, is made to exclaim, “Behold truly the Britons—slow in
                    action, ready in menace !” Whence has arisen this battle of Langres, where
                    Arthur, allied with Claudas, king of the “Terre Déserte,” conquers the Romans
                    and destroys their empire. Strange to say, the fictitious battle of Langres has
                    an authentic foundation in history, being but an echo in tradition of the
                    obstinate and successful resistance to the Romans carried on by the Celts of the
                    vast district called the <hi rend="italic">Tractus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Armoricanus,—</hi> a resistance out-lasting, indeed, the Roman power, till
                    Clovis turned it to account and destroyed it; and of Clovis, the treacherous
                    ally of the Armorican Celts, the portrait is easily recognised in the Claudas of
                    the romance.</p>
                <p>Rome has been cursed in history more often than she is named in Camille's
                    imprecation in Corneille’s play, and we need uot wonder at the legend, wherein
                    Arthur calls together a confederation of Greeks, Africans, Spaniards, Parthians,
                    Medes, Libyans, Egyptians, Babylonians, Phrygians, &lt;fcc., in fact, all
                    nations, against Rome. The legendary hero falls at last, in all his glory and in
                    the midst of his reign of justice, on the field of Camlan. But he is not
                    deserted by that fairy world with whom Shakespeare’s soul delighted to dwell;
                    magically transported into the Isle of Avalon, his body is cured of its wounds,
                    and his soul sleeps, while rests his enchanted sword Excalibur, till that day
                    comes when he shall rise again from his mysterious retreat. But that day must
                    dawn for all nations at once, as in the veins of all peoples of Europe is hidden
                    some Celtic blood. On the other hand, progress is barred and darkness dwells
                    where the Celtic race remains unmixed. So it is the destiny of some peoples,
                    while buried for ever as a temporal power, because of their irreparable faults,
                    to live on gloriously for the good of all, but only as an idea, an instruction,
