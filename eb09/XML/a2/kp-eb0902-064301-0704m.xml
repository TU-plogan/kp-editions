                    sense, it does not apply either to the island of Ortygia at Syracuse, or to the
                    spot so named near Ephesus, which were the two principal competitors for the
                    honour of having been the birth-place of the goddess. Besides, she slew Orion in
                    Ortygia, and that incident is connected with the mythology of Delos.
                    Consistently with her relation to Apollo, she was conceived as sharing his
                    aspect and attributes, her occupations and even her beauty tending rather to
                    what would be appropriate for males. Both were endowed with perpetual youth, and
                    this, if it did not originally help to suggest the idea of their being twins, is
                    consistent with a universal feeling as regards that relationship. Like him she
                    is armed with bow and arrows, which, jointly with him, she used against
                    offending mortals as in the case of the Niobides, or of Laodamia, and the wife
                    of Eëtion <hi rend="italic">{Iliad,</hi> vi. 205, 428), she slaying women—he,
                    men. At other timee, with no sign of anger, her arrows brought soft death, such
                    as Penelope desired <hi rend="italic">{Odyssey,</hi> xviii. 201, xx. 62, 80).
                    But, unlike Apollo’s, the bow in her hands was chiefly employed, as a borrowed
                    weapon might be, for the amusement of the chase. And here a broad line must be
                    drawn between two sides of her character. On the one hand she is a sister of
                    Apollo, and shares several of his functions, even taking part on occasion in his
                    favourite music and dance. But in this respect her actions seem sometimes
                    forced, as if grafted upon her in comparatively later times, as indeed seems
                    also her name = <hi rend="italic">apτep,ης,</hi> “spotless,” as applied to a
                    virgin. On the other hand she had what appears to be a more primitive name,
                    Oupis or Opis, and a wide variety of functions, which are not only obviously
                    suggested by the real and supposed influence of the moon on nature, but~also
                    approximate often closely enough to the functions of Apollo to have led to the
                    identification of the two deities as brother and sister. The name Opis is taken
                    to refer to the light of the moon. With that luminary she was distinctly
                    associated, but not as guiding its movement,—a task which devolved on Selene
                    (Luna), just as the course of the sun was directed by Helios, not by Apollo. To
                    regard the goddess of the moon as sister of the god of the sun was natural, but
                    it was an observation of a secondary kind, and founded only on the appearance
                    and movement of those orbs. Primitive observations would refer to the sensations
                    immediately awakened by the moonlight In general terms Artemis, the moon
                    goddess, was styled <hi rend="italic">φώσφορος</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >σeλaσφopoς,</hi> and carried, besides bow and arrows, a torch, here only with
                    the idea of spreading light, and not as when, under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">hegemone,</hi> she carried a torch to light the way for
                    travellers, as in the typical instance of Demeter searching for Persephone. At
                    Athens she had an annual festival, <hi rend="italic">Munychia,</hi> on the 16th
                    of April, for which cakes were made in the form of a full moon stuck over with
                    lights. But, in particular, the spread of vegetation from the dew under a
                    peaceful moonlight was ascribed to her influence. Her presence was felt near
                    springs, streams, bays, on the sea, and in marshy places, whence she bore the
                    titles of πoτα∕√α, λιuvaia, λι∕zvSτιs. In lifting the veil of night she revealed
                    to the imagination the world of wild animals, among which she was an intrepid
                    and unwearied huntress, and over which she exercised the care of a godde≡3. Her
                    favourite animal was the deer, whence she obtained in Olympia and Elis the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">lλaφia</hi> or cλαψιαια, Because Agamemnon had killed a
                    deer sacred to her she detained the Greek fleet in Aulis, and required the
                    sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia. But while deer, goats, rams, and wild
                    animals were generally regarded as dependent on her control, certain animals
                    were specially associated with her in particular districts of Greece, as was the
                    wild boar in Aetolia and elsewhere, and the bear in Arcadia, and in her worship
                    as Artemis Brauronia, and Munychia at Athens. When a wild boar appeared ravaging
                    a district, as did the Caly-donian boar, it was sent by Artemis in anger. The
                    boar, however, was not an instrument of her moods, but rather, it would seem, a
                    symbol of the awakening every spring of the hunting season after the sleep of
                    winter. “Bears” (άρκτοι) was the name sometimes applied at Athens to young girls
                    who there, as throughout the rest of Greece, were under her special protection,
                    in token of which it was usual for them to dedicate to her a lock of hair, a
                    trinket, or some plaything. Boys also were under her care. With the symbol of a
                    bear she was worshipped among the Arcadians, or “bear people,” who claimed her
                    as the primeval mother of their race, till, through the increasing prominence of
                    her virginal character, that honour devolved upon Callisto, whose name is an
                    obvious variation of <hi rend="italic">κaλλiστη,</hi> the title of Artemis, and
                    her transformation into a bear an invention for the purpose. Arcadia was her
                    chief huntingground, and more numerous were her sanctuaries there than elsewhere
                    in Greece. As <hi rend="italic">Artemis agrotera,</hi> a title under which she
                    was worshipped in Attica, she was conceived not only as goddess of the chase,
                    but also as in some way providing the wild impetus with which men rush into
                    battle. Hence the 500 goats annually sacrificed at Athens, to commemorate the
                    battle of Marathon, were sacrificed to her. It was customary with the Spartans
                    to sacrifice a goat before closing with an enemy (Xenophon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hellen.,</hi> iv. 2, 20). Possibly, also, the curious dance with which the
                    maidens of Caryae (Caryatides), in the valley of the Eurotas, celebrated her
                    festival had reference to her part iu war. Her care over children was recognised
                    in Laconia and Messenia under the name of κopυ0αλiα,to w hose temple, by the
                    stream Tiasa, nurses brought their charges at the festival of the Tithenidia,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> festival of nurses. As λoχια or λoχ&lt;√a she
                    divided the w orship of Ilithyia by her helping presence at childbirth. With
                    marriage her care almost ceased, and hence it has been supposed that the dresses
                    which women dedicated to her were such as they had worn as virgins, and were
                    intended to express piety for her past protection. In reference to this,
                    apparently, she was styled <hi rend="italic">∙χyrωvy</hi> or χιτώνια. Youth,
                    innocence, modesty, and a good name were thought to find high favour with her,
                    and as an illustration of this was often told, in works of art andin the
                    tragedies of Sophocles andEuripides. the story of Hippolytus. Her own purity was
                    unsullied <hi rend="italic">(αγνή,</hi> Aeschylus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agamem.,</hi> 135 <hi rend="italic">; alεv</hi><hi rend="italic">άδρήτα,</hi>
                    Sophocles, <hi rend="italic">Electr.,</hi> 1239). Actaeon, the huntsman, she
                    caused to be devoured by his own hounds, because he had seen her bathing. She
                    slew Orion because of his pressing advances to Aurora. She transformed Daphne
                    into a laurel to preserve her from pursuit. Meadows in their spring verdure and
                    flowers, fields with the seeds springing, and the gay seasons of rural life,
                    gave occasion for thoughts of her overseeing care. She was hailed by rustic
                    choruses, all manner of rejoicings, and, in particular, on a hill at the back of
                    Mount Taygetus with songs known as καλαβοιδια. In Arcadia she was called <hi

                    defeated the god of that river in his passion for her nymph Arethusa, by leading
                    the spring Arethusa underground away to the island of Ortygia at Syracuse.</p>
                <p>So far the various phases of her character are such as were more or less
                    generally accepted in the times of literature and art. But there had also
                    survived certain peculiarities in her worship from apparently very early times,
                    though the fact of their being found only in certain localities renders it
                    impossible to know whether they had been originally only local peculiarities or
                    universally admitted. Of this kind was the Tauric Artemis, peculiar at first to
                    the Crimea and the shores of the Black Sea. From the Crimea, Orestes, it was
                    said, brought the ancient image of the goddess to Sparta, and with it her
                    worship, the chief characteristic of which was the sacrifice of human beings
                    which it required. At Sparta these sacrifices were afterwards commuted by
                    Lycurgus for the ceremony of flogging youths at her altar, but not till this
                    barbarous phase of her worship had spread to several places in Greece, Asia
                    Minor, and Italy. Her title at Sparta was <hi rend="italic">Orthia,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthosia.</hi> Again, originally peculiar to Crete was <hi
                    rend="italic">Artemis</hi><hi rend="italic">Britomartis,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictynna,</hi> the latter name being interpreted by the legend
                    that Minos had loved and pursued her till she leapt into the sea, and was saved
                    by being caught in a fisherman’s net. In this character she was chiefly the
                    goddess of seafarers, and as such was widely worshipped on the islands and
                    coasts of the Mediterranean. But nowhere w¾s the worship of Artemis so
                    non-Hellenic in character as among the Greeks at Ephesus. It would seem as if
                    the Greek colonists there had found among the native Carians and Leleges a form
                    of the moon goddess, which, though widely different from their own, had the
                    advantage of an image that had fallen from heaven <hi rend="italic"
                    >(diopetes),</hi> and an established hold on the people with whom the colonists
                    had to deal. Like theirs she was a goddess with power over wild animals, and
                    identified with their productivity, as appears from her being represented with
                    many breasts,—a characteristic of animals, and not necessarily to be understood
                    as expressing her interest in matérnity in the usual sense, which would have
                    been strongly opposed to the Greek feeling towards their virgin goddess. Her
                    worship was surrounded by hierodulae and eunuchs. She was the goddess of the
                    warlike Amazons, whose fondness of the chase presented another point of contact
                    between the Asiatic and thé Greek goddess. But however much of the Greek element
                    may in time have become grafted upon her, Diana of Ephesus was only in rare
                    instances accepted by the Greeks outside of Asia Minor. The wealth and splendour
                    of the temple made Ephesus a powerful attraction for devotees in the
                    neighbourhood. A figure of her similar to that at Ephesus existed near Magnesia
                    on the Meander, where from the name of the Spot she was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Λ-evκoφpvηvη. </hi></p>
                <p>The usual figure of the Ephesian Artemis, as preserved in works of art, is in the
                    form of a female with many breasts, from the waist to the feet resembling a
                    pillar, narrowing downwards, and sculptured all round with rows of animals. In
                    archaic works, as on the chest of Cypselus of Corinth, she appeared winged, and
                    holding a lion with each hand. As to the original image, believed to have fallen
                    from heaven, it is not impossible that it had been made tc take the place of a
                    meteorite. But the Greek Artemis was usually represented as a huntress with bow
                    and quiver, in face very like Apollo, her drapery flowing to her feet, or, more
                    frequently, girt high for speed. She is accompanied often by a deer or a dog.
                    Perhaps the finest existing statue of her is the Diana of Versailles On the
                    coins of Arcadia, Aetolia, Crete, and Sicily, are to be seen varied and
                    beautiful representations of her head as conceived by the Greek artists in the
                    best times. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
