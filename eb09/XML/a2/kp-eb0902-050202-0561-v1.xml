                <p><label type="entry">ARION</label> (pronounced <hi rend="italic">Aιd'on),</hi> a
                    celebrated poet and cithara player, a native of Methymna, in Lesbos. As he is
                    said to have been the friend of Periander, tyrant of Corinth, he must have
                    flourished about 625 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Several of the ancients
                    ascribe to him the invention of the dithyramb and of dithyrambic poetry; it is
                    probable, however, that his real service was confined to the organisation of
                    that verse, and the conversion of it from a mere drunken song, used in the
                    Bacchic revels, to a measured antistrophic hymn, sung by a trained body of
                    performers. Nothing more is known of the life of Arion, with the exception of
                    the beautiful story first told by Herodotus, and afterwards elaborated and
                    embellished by many subsequent writers. According to Herodotus, Arion had become
                    desirous of exhibiting his skill in foreign countries, and, leaving Corinth, had
                    travelled through Sicily and parts of Italy, where he gained great fame, and
                    amassed a large sum of money. At Tarentum he embarked for his homeward voyage in
                    a ship belonging to Corinth. The sight of his treasure roused the cupidity of
                    the sailors, who resolved to possess themselves of it by putting him to death.
                    Tn answer to his entreaties that they would spare his life, they insisted that
                    he should either die by his own hand on shipboard, or cast himself into the sea.
                    Arion chose the latter, and as a last favour begged permission to sing a parting
                    song. The sailors, desirous of hearing so famous a musician, consented, and the
                    poet, standing on the deck of the ship, arrayed in the rich garments in which he
                    was accustomed to be habited, sang a dirge accompanied by his lyre. He then
                    threw himself overboard; but instead of perishing, as the sailors imagined, he
                    was miraculously borne up in safety by a dolphin, supposed to have been charmed
                    by the music. Thus he was conveyed to Taenarus, whence he proceeded to Corinth,
                    arriving before the ship from Tarentum. Immediately on his arrival Arion related
                    his story to Periander, the tyrant of Corinth, who was at first incredulous, but
                    eventually learned the truth by a stratagem. Summoning the sailors, he demanded
                    what had become of the poet. They affirmed that he had remained behind at
                    Tarentum; upon which they were suddenly confronted by Arion himself, arrayed in
                    the same garments in which he had leapt overboard. The sailors confessed their
                    guilt, and were punished. Herodotus and Pausanias both refer to a brass figure
                    at Taenarus, which was supposed to represent Arion seated on the dolphin’s back.
                    But this story is only one of several in which the dolphin appears as saving the
                    lives of favoured heroes. Among others, it is curious that Taras, the mythical
                    founder of Tarentum, is said to have been conveyed in this manner from Taenarus
                    to Tarentum. On Tarentine coins a man and dolphin appear, and hence it may be
                    thought that the monument at Taenarus represented Taras, and not Arion. From the
                    frequent appearance of the dolphin in mythical stories of voyages, it has been
                    conjectured that it was looked upon as in some way the preserver of those at
                    sea, and votive offerings would therefore be given to it by those who had
                    escaped the perils of the deep. At the same time, the connection of Apollo with
                    the dolphin must not be forgotten. Under this form the god appeared when he
                    founded the celebrated oracle at Delphi, the name of which commemorates the
                    circumstance. He was also the god of music, the special preserver of poets, and
                    to him the lyre was sacred. The story of Arion seems, therefore, to be but one
                    of the many and varied forms of the wide-spread myth of Apollo. Among the
                    numerous modern versions of it, particular mention may be made of the pretty <hi
