                    Perdiccas, having an eye to universal dominion, determined to divest him of his
                    government, and laid plans for his life, by bringing various accusations against
                    him. Antigonus escaped with his son Demetrius into Greece, where he obtained the
                    favour and protection of Antipater, 321 B.c.; and when soon after, on the death
                    of Perdiccas, a new division took place, he had the province of Susiana added to
                    his former share. He was likewise intrusted with the command of the war against
                    Euinenes, who had joined Perdiccas against the coalition of Antipater,
                    Antigonus, and the other generals. Eumenes was thoroughly defeated, and was
                    obliged to retire with only 600 men to the inaccessible castle of Nora, and a
                    new army that was marching to his relief was also routed by Antigonus. In the
                    interval Antipater had died (318 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and the
                    opportunity excited the ambition of Antigonus to possess the whole of <pb

                    Antipater in the regency, to the exclusion of Cassander his son, Antigonus
                    resolved to set himself up as lord of all Asia. On account of the great power of
                    Eumenes, he greatly desired to gain him over to his interest; but that faithful
                    commander, effecting his escape from Nora, raised an army, and was appointed the
                    royal general in Asia. He defeated Antigonus in several engagements, but was at
                    last delivered up to him through treachery, and put to death Upon this the
                    governor of Upper Asia yielded to Antigonus, The latter now seized upon all the
                    treasures at Susa, and directed his march towards Babylon, of which Seleucus was
                    governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy, and entered into a league with him, together
                    with Lysimachus and Cassander, in order to check the exorbitant power of
                    Antigonus (315 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) Notwithstanding this Antigonus
                    made a successful attempt upon Syria and Phoenicia, though these provinces were
                    soon after recovered by Ptolemy, who defeated his son Demetrius, while he
                    himself was employed against Cassander in Asia Minor They were again taken by
                    Antigonus, who, flushed with success, sent an expedition against the Nabathaean
                    Arabs dwelling in the deserts adjacent to Judaea. In the first enterprise his
                    troops were cut to pieces by the Arabs; but his son commanded the second, and
                    was more successful. Demetrius then expelled Seleucus from Babylon; and, success
                    attending his arms wherever he went, the confederates had to make a treaty with
                    Antigonus, stipulating that he should remain in possession of all Asia, but that
                    the Greek cities should retain their liberty. This agreement was soon violated,
                    under the pretence that garrisons had been placed in some of these cities by
                    Antigoħus. At first Ptolemy made a successful descent into Asia Minor, and on
                    several of the islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length totally defeated
                    by Demetrius, in a naval engagement off Salamis, in the island of Cyprus On
                    gaining this victory Antigonus assumed the title of king, and bestowed the same
                    upon his son; and from that time (306 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) his reign
                    in Asia, and that of Ptolemy in Egypt, and of the other generals of Alexander in
                    their respective provinces, properly commence. Antigonus now prepared a large
                    army, and a formidable fleet, the command of which he gave to Demetrius, and
                    hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however,
                    proved a failure; a battle with Ptolemy at Mount Casius gained Antigonus no
                    advantage, and, after a few other fruitless efforts, he was obliged to retire
                    (306 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Demetrius Attempted the reduction of
                    Rhodes; but, meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to make a treaty
                    upon the best terms that he could, in order to join his father in •crushing a
                    confederacy that had been formed between Cassander, Seleucus, and Lysimachus.
                    Father and son advanced with their united forces into Phrygia, and met the enemy
                    at Ipsus. A decisive battle was fought, in which Antigonus fell, in the 81st
                    year of his age, 301 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and with him fell the
                    fortunes of his house.</p>
