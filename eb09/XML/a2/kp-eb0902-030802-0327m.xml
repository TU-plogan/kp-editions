                    Count of, a descendant of a noble family in Aragon, was born at Saragossa, 21st
                    Sept. 1718. He served for several years in the army, and, after retiring with
                    the rank of lieutenantcolonel, spent some time in travelling through France,
                    Italy, and Prussia. He seems to have fallen under the displeasure of Ferdinand
                    VI., but on the accession of Charles III. in 1759, he was appointed ambassador
                    to the court of Poland, an office which he held for several years. On his return
                    he took the command of the army sent against the Portuguese, and gained some
                    successes. He was then appointed captain-general of Valencia, from which place,
                    two years later, in 1765, he was summoned to Madrid to assist in quelling an
                    insurrection. His success was rewarded by the appointment to the Presidency of
                    the Court of Castile. "While holding this office he induced the king to give his
