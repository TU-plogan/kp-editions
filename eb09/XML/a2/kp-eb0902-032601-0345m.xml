                    Greece, bounded on the N. by Achaia, on the W. by Elis, on the S. by Messenia
                    and Laconia, and on the E. by Argolis, and almost shut in from the neighbouring
                    states by a natural rampart. Its most important heights were Cyllene, the
                    birth-place of Hermes, in the north-east, Erymanthus in the north-west,
                    Artemisium and Parthenium in the east, and Maenalus and Lycaeus in the south. It
                    was watered by the Alpheus, the largest river of the Peloponnesus, the Helisson,
                    the Ladon, the Erymanthus, and a number of smaller streams which cut their way,
                    in many cases by underground passages, through the limestone rocks. In the east
                    there were several lakes, as those of Orchomenos and Stymphalus; and in the
                    north-east, near Nonacris, was the great waterfall of the Styx, which produced
                    such a deep impression on the ancient Greek mind. Arcadia seems to have been
                    inhabited from the earliest times of Grecian history by the same race of people,
                    which down to the days of Roman dominion continued to be distinguished from the
                    neighbouring states by greater simplicity and inertness of life. Deprived by
                    their position of the quickening influence of commerce, broken up into small and
                    almost independent communities by the physical character of their country, and
                    thus having hardly any proper national existence, the Arcadians acquired a
                    certain awkwardness in dealing with their more vivacious neighbours, who laughed
                    at Arcadian stupidity, while they were pleased with Arcadian hospitality, and
                    almost envied Arcadian repose. Like other mountaindwellers they were determined
                    defenders of their liberty, and their history is chiefly taken up with united or
                    sporadic conflict against Spartan invasion. About the time of the foundation of
                    Megalopolis (370 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) a certain unity and consequent
                    power were attained, but it was not long ere matters fell back to their former
                    condition. Ultimately the whole country joined the Achaean League, and was
                    afterwards incorporated with the Roman province of Achaia. The most important
                    towns in Arcadia were Tegea, Stymphalus, Cleitor, Pallantium, Pheneus, Caryae,
                    Nonacris, Methydrium, Heraea, Mantinea, Lycosura, according to Pausanias, the
                    most ancient town in Greece, and Megalopolis, one of the most recent. The Greek
                    and Roman poets celebrated the simplicity of Arcadian life and character, not
                    without a certain touch of satire; but by moderns, such as Sannazar and Sydney,
                    the country and its inhabitants have been idealised and elevated into a type of
                    pure pastoral happiness.</p>
