                <p><label type="entry">APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS</label>, the general name given to a
                    vast system of elevations in North America, partly in Canada, but mostly in the
                    United States, extending for 1300 miles, from Cape Gaspé, on the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence, south-west to Alabama. The whole system may be conveniently divided
                    into three great sections: the <hi rend="italic">Northern,</hi> from Cape Gaspé
                    to New York; the <hi rend="italic">Central,</hi> from New York to the valley of
                    the New River; and the <hi rend="italic">Southern,</hi> from the New River
                    onwards. The first of these includes the Adirondacks, the Green Mountains, and
                    the White Mountains, and the irregular elevations towards 'the north: the
                    central contains a large portion of the Blue Ridge, the Alleghanies proper, and
                    a great number of lesser ranges: and the southern consists of the prolongation
                    of the Blue Ridge, the Black Mountains, the Smoky Mountains, and the Unaka
                    Mountains. The whole range, and especially the central portion, is remarkable
                    for the parallelism of the various ridges, the uniform height of the summits in
                    the same part of the chain, the absence of a central axis of elevation, and the
                    presence, instead, of a central valley or axis of depression. The typical
                    arrangement of the system—most distinctly visible in the central division—might
                    be represented in diagram thus: first, a stretch of country, gradually sloping,
                    with slight undulations and irregularities, upwards from the Atlantic, and
                    attaining a height of 300, 500, or 1000 feet; then, a lofty ridge rising like a
                    rampart, and succeeded by other ridges separated from each other by longitudinal
                    valleys; next, the great central valley or axis of depression; and lastly, a new
                    succession of ridges breaking off into table-land with transverse valleys and a
                    gradual decrease of elevation. The Atlantic slope varies in breadth from 50
                    miles, as in New England, to 200 miles, in the south, and in the neighbourhood
                    of New York has almost altogether subsided. The central valley may be traced
                    from Lake Champlain in the north, along the course of the Hudson, down through
                    the Cumberland Valley, in Pennsylvania, and the Great Valley of Virginia and
                    Tennessee; it varies in breadth from 15 miles in the north to 50 or 60 miles in
                    the south. The elevation of the valley rises towards the south in keeping with
                    the elevation of ^the neighbouring ranges. None of the summits of the system
                    reach the region of perpetual snow, but a large number of them attain a
                    considerable altitude. In the Adirondacks the highest point, Mt. Tahawus or Mt.
                    Marcy, reaches 5379 feet. In the White Mountains, Mt. Washington, in the main
                    chain, has a height of 6288 feet; Mt. Adams, 5794; Mt. Madison, 5365; Mt.
                    Jefferson, 5714; Mt. Clay, 5553; Mt. Monroe, 53S4; Lafayette, 5290; and a great
                    number of summits attain a height of more than 4000 feet. In thè Green Mountains
                    the highest point, Mt. Mansfield, is 4430 feet; Lincoln Mount, 4078; Killington
                    Peak, 4221; Camel Hump, 4088; and a number of other heights upwards of 3000
                    feet. In the central division the hypsometric surveys are imperfect; but the
                    general elevation of the higher chains is from 1000 to 2500 feet. As we approach
                    the south, the complexity of the system and the altitude of the individual
                    mountains increase together, and the chains which have run parallel and distinct
                    begin, as it were, to gather and fold themselves into an irregular coil. The
                    peaks of Otter in Virginia are about 4000 feet high; and in the Black Mountains,
                    the Black Dome (Clingmann), which is the culminating point of the whole system,
                    attains the height of 6707 feet; Balsam Cone (also known as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0214-0201"/> Guyot, from the hypsometrical explorer of the
                    region) has 6671; Black Brother, 6619; and Mt. Hallback (Sugarloaf), 6403;
                    besides a large number of summits varying from 3000 up to 6000 feet. In the
                    Smoky Mountains we have Clingmann’s Dome, 6660 feethigh; Guyot (in Tennessee),
                    6636; Mt. Alexander, 6447; Mt Leconte, 6612; Mt Curtis, 6568; several others
                    upwards of 6000, and a great many of more than 5000. In the whole Appalachian
                    system, Lake Champlain is almost the only lake of any importance; but a
                    multitude of rivers, and some of them of considerable size, find their sources
                    in its recesses. The watershed does not lie along any one continuous axis, but
                    shifts its position several times along the line. In the north it is found in a
                    stretch of country, called the Height of Land, that lies between the White and
                    the Green Mountains, and gives birth to the Connecticut and a number of smaller
                    streams; next, it is formed by the Adirondack Mountains, which supply the
                    sources of the Hudson River; and, further south, by the high plateaus of
                    Pennsylvania and New York, which give origin to the Delaware and the
                    Susquehanna, with their numerous tributaries. These rivers, flowing south and
                    east, have thus to cut their way through the successive ridges of the whole
                    Appalachian range. The watershed is next situated in the Alleghanies proper,
                    which send a number of affluents to the Ohio on the west, and give rise to the
                    James River on the east; and lastly, it runs along the terminal cluster or coil
                    composed of the Black, the Smoky, and the Unaka Mountains. Here a tributary of
                    the Ohio, called the Red River, a number of the affluents of the Tennessee, and
                    various less important streams, have their sources. The Appalachian Mountains
                    are a vast storehouse of mineral wealth. Magnetite, hematite, limonite, and
                    other iron ores, are found in great abundance. The first is best exhibited in
                    what is frequently called the Champlain Iron District, where it is now largely
                    manufactured; and it also attains remarkable development in various parts of New
                    York and New Jersey. The extensive deposits of this ore in Virginia, North
                    Carolina, and Georgia, have hitherto been turned to comparatively little
                    account. It is frequently contaminated by phosphate of lime, sulphur, and
                    titanium. Red hematite is found in New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and
                    Georgia, and is usually known as Clinton ore, from a place of that name in
                    Madison County, New York, while in Tennessee it is called Dyestone ore. It is of
                    great commercial importance, though, on account of the amount of phosphorus
                    which it contains, it is worthless for the manufacture of steel. Limonite, or
                    brown hematite, which, from its fusible character, is usually worked along with
                    the more crystalline ores, occurs in a series of beds all along the flanks of
                    the Appalachians, from Maine iu the north to Georgia in the south. The earthy
                    carbonate of iron—“clay ironstone ore,” “shell ore,” “kidney ore,” — is found in
                    most parts of the system in connection with the Carboniferous strata, and has
                    been very largely manufactured. In the northern district alone—that is, in the
                    eastern part of New York, in New Jersey, and Eastern Pennsylvania—the number of
                    furnaces is about 200, and the gross production of iron 900,000 tons per annum,
                    or one-third of the entire production of the United States. This abundance of
                    ore would have been almost useless had it not been for the equally abundant
                    supplies of fuel; and the coal measures are among the most extensive in the
                    world, the bituminous coal alone covering an area of 56,000 square miles,
                    without counting the unrivalled beds of anthracite in Pennsylvania and New York,
                    which cover an area of between 400 and 500 miles. While the supply of gold,
                    silver, copper, and lead is of comparatively no importance, marble, limestone,
                    fire-clay, gypsum, and salt are extremely abundant. Many of the ranges arc
                    richly covered with forest, and yield large quantities of valuable timber,
                    consisting chiefly of sugar maple, white birch, beech, and ash, in the north,
                    and oak, cherry-tree, white poplar, white and yellow pine, towards the south.
                    The dark foliage of the pines, balsam-firs, hemlock-trees, and cedars, gives
                    colour and name to many of the districts. Rhododendrons, kalmias, azaleas, and
                    other flowering shrubs, often grow in almost impenetrable thickets; and in some
                    parts the botanist is at once delighted and bewildered by the profusion and
                    variety of the smaller plants. Bears, “panthers,” wild cats, and wolves haunt
                    the forests in large numbers.</p>
                <p>The Appalachian system has a history which is of great interest, as it affords
                    the clue to the causes of its formation; but a few points only can be touched on
                    here. The earliest strata in the range are of Upper Cambrian age, and during the
                    later portion of this period the Potsdam sandstone was deposited, the nature of
                    which demonstrates that a large portion of the United States was then a shallow
                    sea. Upon this were superimposed strata of Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous
                    age, but these deposits were by far the thickest along the broad band now
                    occupied by the Appalachians, and where thickest they have the general character
                    of shallow water-beds. Beds of the same age occupy the valley of the
                    Mississippi; there they are largely composed of limestones and deep water-beds,
                    and have an aggregate thickness of about 8000 feet, usually horizontal or only
                    slightly inclined. In the Appalachian Mountains their aggregate thickness is
                    40,000 feet, and the beds are thrown into complicated folds and contortions. At
                    the close of the Carboniferous Period the beds were deposited in shallow water,
                    and hence there must have been a subsidence along the band whereby the Potsdam
                    sandstone and its associated rocks were depressed from 30,000 to 40,000 feet
                    below the sea-level. This depression threw the strata into one gigantic
                    synclinal basin, to conform to which the beds were necessarily crumpled up, and
                    at the same time more or less metamorphosed. Then the beds began to rise above
                    the sea-level, and the valleys and ridges to be formed, a process which may have
                    been one of slow development, but which had made considerable advance prior to
                    the Triassic age, when sandstones were deposited in the Appalachian valleys. The
                    elevation has continued until the Potsdam sandstone is now a few hundred feet
                    above the sea. If the strata had retained their original character and planes of
                    deposition relatively to the horizon, the highest mountains would have reached
                    40,000 feet; but, as w e have seen, they actually attain but 6707 feet. The
                    elevation was not confined to the line of the Appalachians, but was continental
                    in extent. During the process of elevation denudation was in operation, and by
                    this agency the surface features of the range generally have been moulded. From
                    this brief summary some idea may be conceived of the numerous operations and
                    circumstances involved in the formation of a mountain chain like the
                    Appalachians, which are intermediate in nature and in age between the older
                    Laurentides, which are now worn down almost to a stump, and the Rocky Mountains,
                    which have an air of comparative freshness. (For fuller details on this subject,
