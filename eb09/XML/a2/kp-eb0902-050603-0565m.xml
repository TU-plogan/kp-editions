                    philosophy, was the son of Aritadas, a wealthy merchant of Cyrene, in Africa.
                    Nothing is known of the early part of his life, but he appears to have been sent
                    by his father on a voyage to Greece, and while there, attending the Olympic
                    games, he was attracted by the fame of the Socratic teaching. He immediately
                    proceeded to Athens, united himself to the circle of followers who surrounded
                    Socrates, and continued with him till his death in 399. He did not, however,
                    accept without essential modification the teaching of his master, and his
                    conduct, in many points, was displeasing both to Socrates and to other members
                    of the Socratic band. He had probably brought with him from the wealthy city of
                    Cyrene habits of luxury and ostentation, which contrasted forcibly with the
                    homely and temperate life of his master. Xenophon, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorabilia,</hi> reports his conversation on the nature of temperance, in
                    which he defends his life of ease and self-indulgence. Plato also somewhat
                    significantly states that he was absent in the island of Aegina on the day when
                    Socrates died. Another feature of his character, which rendered Aristippus
                    objectionable to the other Socratics, was his tendency to adopt the theory and
                    practice of the Sophists, among whom he is expressly included by Aristotle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Met.,</hi> ii. 2). It is more than probable that in Cyrene he had
                    been already introduced to the doctrines of Protagoras, of whose influence his
                    own theory shows manifest traces. We are further told that he opened his school
                    before the death of Socrates, who blamed him for receiving payment from his
                    scholars. This story is probably inaccurate as to the time when he began to
                    teach, but it is undoubtedly true that he took money for his lectures, and
                    defended the practice. Aristippus resembled the Sophists in another particular;
                    like them, he avoided the duties and ties of citizenship by wandering from city
                    to city. He was a professed cosmopolitan. The records of his travels,
                    particularly of his visit or visits to the court of Syracuse, and his hostile
                    relations with Plato there, are not in all points consistent, and rest on but
                    slender authority. He appears to have settled finally in his native city, and
                    seems to have died there. Although nothing is known with certainty as to the
                    dates of his birth and death, 435 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for the one,
                    and about 356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for the other, may be accepted as
                    probably accurate. The life of Aristippus is the best exemplification of his
                    principles. True temperance, according to him, consists not in abstaining from
                    pleasure, but in being able to enjoy it with moderation. He therefore indulged
                    in good living, rich clothing, splendid dwellings, and in the society of the
                    accomplished hetaerae. But in all these pleasures he remained thoroughly master
                    of himself; he possessed them, and was not possessed by them. At any moment he
                    could relinquish pleasure, for he had attained an equanimity that rendered him
                    happy under any circumstances. To make the most of life, reasonably to enjoy the
                    present moment, and to drive off care, reflection, and forethought, were the
                    practical precepts by which he guided himself. As might naturally be expected,
                    Aristippus left no definite system of philosophy; indeed, according to some
                    accounts, he wrote nothing at all. Diogenes Laertius certainly gives a list of
                    works ascribed to him, but some of these were no doubt spurious, and none have
                    survived. His daughter Arete, who had received the spirit of his teaching,
                    continued the school after his death, and in turn instructed her son, the
                    younger Aristippus (hence called μψγ&gt;oδι‰κτos), to whom is attributed the
                    systematic representation of the Cyrenaic doctrines, the fundamental principles
                    of which, however, are due to the elder Aristippus.</p>
                <p>In the Socratic theory of morals, virtue had appeared as the only human good, and
                    reason as the indispensable condition of right action; but there was at the same
                    time a utilitarian side to this teaching. Ethical virtues had been tested by
                    their consequences; proof of the virtuous quality of an action had been drawn
                    from its tendency to give pleasure; happiness or utility had been, in a certain
                    sense, laid down as the end of action. This one-sided aspect of the Socratic
                    theory was accepted by Aristippus, and by him carried out to its full extent. He
                    refused altogether to consider those speculative elements, which, though in some
                    degree rejected by Socrates himself, were nevertheless inherent in the Socratic
                    system. Logic and Physics he thought unnecessary, for they contained nothing
                    which bore upon the end of action, and for the same reason, as Aristotle tells
                    us, he rejected mathematical study. But although Logic and Physics, as separate
                    disciplines, received no attention from the Cyrenaics, yet they were admitted as
                    supports to their ethical theory. According to Aristippus, knowledge is sensible
                    perception; all that we know of anything is the impression made by it on us.
                    These impressions are motions,—changes in our mental states; and each mental
                    state is a purely subjective phenomenon, from which we can deduce nothing as to
                    the constitution of external reality. Nor can we compare our knowledge with that
                    of others; each one’s sensations are peculiarly his own, and can be known only
                    by himself. General names or conceptions, and, consequently, general
                    propositions or truths, are meaningless and absurd. Individual feeling is the
                    sole criterion of truth. From this it follows at once that such feeling is the
                    only means by which we can determine our actions; feeling becomes the standard
                    both of truth and of action. Now the only difference among feelings, in their
                    relation to action, is their pleasurable or painful quality. The change effected
                    in us by any object is either a violent, a gentle, or a perfectly tranquil
                    motion. The first is painful, the second pleasant, the third in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0566-0507"/> different. The end of life, as is manifest also
                    from experience, is the attainment of pleasure, which must be positive or real,
                    not merely absence of pain, as the Epicureans afterwards held. Further, future
                    pleasure, as a gentle motion not yet effected, and past pleasure, as a gentle
                    motion completed and done, cannot possibly enter into our estimate of happiness.
                    Immediate gratification, the pleasure of the moment <hi rend="italic"
                    >(μov</hi><hi rend="italic">άχρονος),</hi> is the end of life; real happiness
                    consists of a succession of moments of intense pleasure. The conception of a
                    life in which, on the whole, pain is over-balanced by pleasure, may certainly be
                    formed, but can never furnish a satisfactory end of action. Varieties of
                    pleasure were, of course, admitted by Aristippus, but his decided opinion seems
                    to have been that bodily pleasures and pains are the most potent factors in
                    human happiness or misery. As to the causes of pleasure, the means by which it
                    was to be attained, these are in themselves indifferent; an action which gives
                    pleasure is good, whether or not it be opposed to the religion or laws of the
                    country. The predicates, good and bad, attached to actions independently of
                    their consequences, are merely conventional, and not founded in nature. Yet
                    Aristippus was compelled to admit that some actions which give immediate
                    pleasure entail more than their equivalent of pain. This fact, he thought, was
                    the true ground of the conventional distinction of right and wrong, and in this
                    sense regard ought to be had to custom and law. But there is quite another side
                    of the Cyrenaic doctrine, which appears as strongly in the theory as in the
                    practice of Aristippus. Man must not give up himself as a slave to pleasure; he
                    must be superior to it. True happiness can only be obtained by rational insight,
                    prudence <hi rend="italic">(φρόνησκ),</hi> or wisdom. Only through this
                    prudence, which is in truth virtue, can man make a proper use of the good things
                    in his power, and free himself from those superstitions and violent passions
                    that stand in the way of happiness. Through this wisdom we are enabled to
                    preserve the mastery of pleasure, to rise superior to past, future, or even
                    present happiness, and make ourselves independent of circumstances. True freedom
                    of soul, real self-sufficiency, is given by wisdom, by mental cultivation. It is
                    evident that at this point Aristippus approximates more closely to Socrates and
                    the Cynics; and it is a suggestive fact that his followers, who pushed his
                    principles to their logical consequences, landed in a theory of the negation of
                    pleasure, nearly identical with the later Cynic views.</p>
