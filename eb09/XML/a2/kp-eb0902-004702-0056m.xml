                    Prussian province of Brandenburg, Anhalt is entirely surrounded by Prussian
                    Saxony, which also intersects it, breaking it up into two large and several
                    small portions. The Hartz mountains extend into the western of the large
                    divisions, but the rest of the country is very flat, and even in the mountainous
                    part no elevations rise to any great height. Most of the plain, which is watered
                    by the Elbe and its tributaries, the Mulde and the Saale, is very fertile,
                    producing large quantities of grain, tobacco, flax, hops, and fruits, especially
                    grapes; cattle and sheep are reared in considerable numbers on the rich pasture
                    lands; game and fish are abundant; while the mine3 in the Hartz mountains yield
                    iron, lead, silver, and other minerals. The chief manufactures of Anhalt are
                    linen, cotton, and woollen goods, metallic and earthen wares, beer, brandy, and
                    sugar; but the principal export trade is in the raw products. Internally, Anhalt
                    is governed by a constitutional and hereditary monarchy, the legislative body
                    being a diet of 36 members, of whom 10 represent the nobility; 14, the principal
                    towns; 10, the rural districts; and 2 are nominated by the duke, who has the
                    entire executive power in his own hands; while, as a member of the German
                    empire, the duchy has one vote in the Bundesrath, or Federal Council, and two in
                    the Reichstag. Its income and expenditure for the year 1872 exactly balanced,
                    being each 2,231,000 thalers, or £334,650; the public debt at the end of 1871
                    was 4,073,026 thalers, or £610,954. Anhalt contained 203,354 inhabitants in
                    1871, most of whom are Protestants. Its capital is Dessau, and the other chief
                    towns are Bernburg, Köthen, and Zerbst. Railways connect these towns with one
                    another, and also with Berlin and the principal cities of Germany. Bernard, son
                    of Albert the Bear, margrave of Brandenburg, was the first upon whom the title
                    of count of Anhalt was conferred. He died in 1212, and was succeeded in the
                    principality of Anhalt by his son Henry L; while Albert, a younger son, received
                    his large possessions in Saxony. On the death of Henry in 1252, Anhalt was
                    divided among his family into three parts,—Ascania, Bernburg, and Zerbst,—which
                    were afterwards united under Joachim Ernest, who reigned from about 1570 to
                    1586. In 1603, however, the territory was again broken up, on this occasion into
                    four parts, Dessau, Bemburg, Köthen, and Zerbst, four of Joachim Ernest’s sons
                    inheriting one of these divisions each, while the fifth, Augustus, who was the
                    third in point of age, received a considerable sum of money, and the promise
                    that, in the event of any one of the other lines becoming extinct, he or his
                    descendants should succeed to the principality; his brother Christian, of Anhalt
                    Bemburg, also gave him the small property of Plötzkau, from which he took his
                    title. This promise was fulfilled in 1665, when William Louis of Anhalt Köthen
                    died without direct heirs, and was succeeded by Lebrecht of Anhalt Plötzkau, u
                    ho thereafter laid aside his own title. The Zerbst line becoming extinct in
                    1793, the principality, in accordance with a compact made in 1665, was divided
                    among the three remaining families; next, by the death of Henry duke of Anhalt
                    Köthen in 1847, that duchy was a second time left without direct heirs, but was
                    ultimately incorporated with Dessau; and lastly, the Anhalt Bemburg family died
                    out in 1863, leaving the whole of Anhalt under a single ruler. The present
                    duke,—the title of duke was conferred upon the counts of Anhalt in
                    1807,—Frederick, succeeded his father Leopold in 1871, being at that time about
                    forty years old. Several of the rulers of Anhalt have borne a conspicuous part
                    in the affairs of Europe, and not a few of them have been noted for their zeal
                    in the cause of Protestantism. Wolfgang, a prince of the earlier Zerbst line,
                    was present at the diet of Augsburg in 1530, and was one of those who presented
                    the confession to the emperor. Leopold I., of Anhalt Dessau, was one of the most
                    distinguished soldiers of his time.</p>
