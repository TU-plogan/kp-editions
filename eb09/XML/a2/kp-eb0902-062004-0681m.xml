                    1594. Of his large family, Antoine was the twentieth and youngest child. As he
                    was at first destined to follow his father’s profession, he turned his attention
                    to legal studies as soon as he had completed the usual course of education at
                    the colleges of Calvi and Lisieux. But the earnest advice of his mother, a
                    deeply religious woman, who afterwards became an inmate of Port-Royal, induced
                    him to give up the profession of a lawyer and to engage in the service of the
                    church. He received his first instructions in theology from Lescot, confessor of
                    Richelieu, but his teacher’s influence over his mind was greatly weakened by the
                    study of some works of Augustine, which, at the request of his mother, had been
                    recommended to him by St Cyran. The thesis which he presented for the degree of
                    bachelor in 1635 showed manifest traces of Augustine’s influence, and gave great
                    offence to Lescot. Arnauld now entered the Sorbonne, and from 1638 to 1640
                    professed the courses of theology and philosophy requisite for a licence. In
                    1641 he was ordained priest, and took his degree of doctor. After being twice
                    rejected on formal grounds, or, perhaps, from the hostile influence of Lescot,
                    he was, in 1634, admitted a member of the Society of the Sorbonne. In 1641 his
                    mother died. Her last words, in which she implored him to hold stedfastly by the
                    truth, made a deep impression on his mind. He gave up several benefices which he
                    had obtained, and resolved to devote himself with all his soul to the defence
                    and propagation of what he believed to be the truth. Between 1641 and 1643 he
                    composed a treatise in two vols, <hi rend="italic">De la Nécessité de la
                    Foi</hi> (not published till 1700), and another, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Théologie</hi><hi rend="italic">Morale</hi><hi rend="italic">des Jésuites.</hi>
                    In August 1643 he published his famous work, <hi rend="italic">De la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fréquente</hi><hi rend="italic">Communion,</hi> expressly directed
                    against the Jesuits, who held that the mere mechanical reception of the
                    sacraments was sufficient, and that previous preparation and actual repentance
                    were of secondary importance. They had even gone the length of saying, that the
                    more a man sinned the more frequently and boldly should he approach the table of
                    communion. Arnauld’s book was sanctioned by many doctors of the Sorbonne, and by
                    several bishops and archbishops. It was denounced by the Jesuits, one of whom,
                    by name Nouet, preached against its heretical tenets, and called Arnauld an
                    heresiarch worse than Calvin or Luther. This, however, carried matters too far;
                    the Sorbonne and the bishops, who had given their sanction, were implicated in
                    such a condemnation, and, by their influence, Nouet was compelled to retract.
                    But the Jesuits insisted that the work must be judged at Rome, and laid special
                    stress on a sentence in the preface, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0682-0621"/> due not to Amauld, but to De Barcos. This
                    sentence they held to be adverse to the Papal supremacy, and they so wrought
                    upon Mazarin as to obtain from him a decree commanding Arnauld and De Barcos to
                    repair to Rome. Such intense excitement and indignation were roused by this
                    decree, which struck a blow at the freedom of the French Church, that Mazarin
                    apologised and withdrew it. De Barcos, who had made preparations for his journey
                    to Rome, now learned that the Jesuits were forming bolder and more dangerous
                    designs against Arnauld and himself. He withdrew into concealment and warned
                    Arnauld, who followed his example. The book was examined at Rome and defended by
                    Bourgeois, a doctor of the Sorbonne; and only the one sentence in the preface
                    fell under Papal censure.</p>
                <p>Scarcely was this controversy over, when a fresh cause of trouble arose. In 1640
                    appeared the <hi rend="italic">Augustinus</hi> of Jansen, bishop of Ypres, the
                    great object of which was to show that the doctrines of Augustine on grace,
                    freewill, and redemption, were opposed to those of the Jesuits, which were
                    really semi-Pelagian. This work fell under Papal censure in 1642, in the bull
                    <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic">eminenti,</hi> which condemned it as
                    a revival of the errors of Bajus. Arnauld, in 1643, wrote some observations and
                    considerations on the bull, and in 1644-45 a first and second apology for
                    Jansenius. For a time there was little opposition made by the Jesuits, and
                    Arnauld, besides superintending at Port-Royal, occupied himself in translating
                    into French some of Augustine’s works, and into Latin his own treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De la</hi><hi rend="italic">Frequente</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Communion.</hi> At last, in 1649, one Cornet proposed to the Sorbonne seven
                    propositions which he maintained to be heretical. Of these, five were drawn from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Augustinus</hi> of Jansen. The other two propositions were
                    allowed to drop, and after much controversy the five were condemned by a Papal
                    bull in 1653. Two years later the duc de Liancourt, whose chaplain was a
                    Jansenist, and whose grand-daughter was an inmate of Port-Royal, was refused
                    absolution by a Jesuit confessor unless he dismissed his chaplain and withdrew
                    his grand-daughter from the heretical community. Arnauld wrote two letters upon
                    this affair—the first anonymously, the second signed with his name, and
                    addressed to the due de Luines. In this second letter it was stated,—1st, that
                    the fathers of the church exhibit to us, in St Peter, a saint who was deficient
                    in saving grace; 2d, that the five heretical propositions were not contained in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Augustinus.</hi> This second statement contains the
                    celebrated distinction of the questions “de jure” and “de facto.” As a matter of
                    right,—of faith,—the propositions were heretical, wherever they occurred; but as
                    a matter of fact, they were not to be found in Jansen’s book in the sense
                    ascribed to them by his opponents. The Jesuits held that this was really a
                    rejection and defiance of the Papal bull; and, in 1656 they prevailed on the
                    Sorbonne to expel Arnauld, deprive him of his doctorate, and pass a decree to
                    the effect that all future members of their body must sign the censure.
                    Arnauld’s defence against this decree was undertaken by Pascal, who, in his
                    brilliant <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters,</hi> brought down the dispute to
                    the level of public comprehension. Arnauld continued to live in retirement, and,
                    in company with Nicole, composed the valuable Port-Royal treatises on grammar,
                    logic, and geometry. In 1668 the peace of the church allowed him to emerge from
                    his retirement. He was received with great honour, and devoted himself to
                    defending Jansenism from the imputation of leading to Calvinistic heresy. To
                    refute this calumny he had already published (in 1664) the work known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Petite</hi><hi rend="italic">perpétuité de la Foi;</hi> and in
                    1669 appeared the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Grande</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">perpétuité de la Foi de</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Eglise</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucharistie,</hi> which was continued in 1671 and 1674.</p>
                <p>This great defence of transubstantiation, though appearing under Arnauld’s name,
                    was mainly the work of Nicole. Arnauld followed it up with several polemical
                    writings against the impious and immoral tendencies of Calvinism. During this
                    time also he was engaged in his elaborate assault on the moral doctrines of the
                    Jesuits; the first volume of the <hi rend="italic">Morale Pratique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Jésuites</hi> appeared in 1669, and seven other volumes
                    followed at intervals up to 1694.</p>
                <p>In 1679 Arnauld was again compelled to conceal himself. He fled from France, and,
                    pursued by the enmity of the Jesuits, went from Mons to Tournai, thence to
                    Ghent, from Ghent to Brussels, and, after having been driven into Holland,
                    settled at Brussels from 1682 to 1690. In 1690 he was again compelled to leave
                    his refuge, but, after wandering about for four years, returned to Brussels,
                    where he died on the 8th August 1694. He was buried in secret, and his heart was
                    sent to be interred at Port-Royal. During the last years of his life his
                    activity never slackened. While continuing the large works already begun, he
                    entered on a long philosophical discussion with Male-branche, in the course of
                    which he published his treatise <hi rend="italic">Des Vraies et des Fausses
                    Idées,</hi> 1683, the <hi rend="italic">Réflexions Philosophiques et
                    Théologiques,</hi> 1685, and a number of letters to Malebranche. He was also
                    engaged in keen controversy with his old friends Nicole and Domat. Of his
                    unwearied activity a characteristic illustration is his reply to Nicole, who
                    urged him to rest from his labours. “Rest!” replied he, “shall we not have the
                    whole of eternity to rest in <hi rend="italic">1</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> η</hi></p>
                <p>As a theologian Arnauld stands high among French writers, not only from the
                    matter of his works, but from their style. He was the first to introduce a pure
                    and grammatical mode of composition, and to lay aside the infinitely numerous
                    subtleties of the preceding centuries. His writing is singularly vigorous and
                    clear. His philosophic reputation rests on lus doctrine of external perception
                    and his work on logic. He was perhaps the first to oppose the theory of
                    representative ideas, or of perception through the ideas of objects, which ideas
                    exist apart from the perceived thing and the perceiving mind. According to him,
                    we perceive things in ideas, but the idea is the same as the perception; we
                    have, in short, only a modification of the mind, conditioned by, or containing
                    objectively, the thing itself. This mental state is subjective, but with an
                    objective reference; to mark the first characteristic, it may be called
                    perception, to mark the second, idea. In many points Arnauld anticipates Reid’s
                    objections to representative ideas, but their theories of perception can
                    scarcely be regarded as identical. The <hi rend="italic">Art de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Penser,</hi> familiarly known as the Port-Royal Logic, is the best
                    specimen of the logic of the Cartesian school. It is fresh, clear, and
                    instructive, not overburdened with the useless paraphernalia of scholastic
                    forms, but rich in practical precepts and examples. It is, however, in the main
                    popular, and falls far short of a scientific presentation of the theory of
                    thought. It has been frequently republished in France, and has been much used
                    both in England and in Germany. The complete edition of Arnauld’s works, with
                    life by Larrière, is in 45 volumes, 4to, Paris and Lausanne, 1775-1783.</p>
