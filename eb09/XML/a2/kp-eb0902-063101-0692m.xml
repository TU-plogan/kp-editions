                    obtained from the rhizomes or root-stocks of various plants are known in
                    commerce under the name of arrowroot. Properly the name should be restricted to
                    the starch yielded by two or three species of <hi rend="italic">Mar anta,</hi>
                    the chief of which is Jf. <hi rend="italic">arundinacea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and when genuine or West Indian arrowroot is spoken of, it is understood
                    that this is the variety meant. <hi rend="italic">Maranta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arundinacea</hi> is originally a native of the American continent, but it has
                    long been cultivated in the West Indian Islands, and it has now spread to most
                    tropical countries. The plant produces a scaly, white, tuberous rhizome, and it
                    is at the period when this organ is gorged with starch-cells, immediately before
                    the season of rest, that it is ripe for use. In addition to about 25 per cent,
                    of starch, the fresh roots contain a proportion of woody tissue, vegetable
                    albumen, and various salts. The arrowroot may be separated on a small scale in
                    the same manner as potato-starch is frequently prepared, that is, by peeling the
                    root and grating it in water, when the starch falls to the bottom. The liquor is
                    then drained off, and the starch purified by repeated washings till it is ready
                    for drying. On a large scale the manufacture of arrowroot is conducted with
                    specially prepared machinery. The rhizomes when dug up are washed free of earthy
                    impurities and afterwards skinned. Subsequently, according to Pereira’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Materia</hi><hi rend="italic">Medica,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    the carefully skinned tubers are washed, then ground in a mill, and the pulp
                    washed in tinned-copper cylindrical washing-machines. The fecula is subsequently
                    dried in drying-houses. In order to obtain the fecula free from impurity, pure
                    water must be used, and great care and attention paid in every step of the
                    process. The skinning or peeling of the tubers must be performed with great
                    nicety, as the cuticle contains a resinous matter which imparts colour and a
                    disagreeable flavour to the starch. German-silver palettes are used for skimming
                    the deposited fecula, and shovels of the same metal for packing the dried
                    fecula. The drying is effected in pans, covered with white gauze to exclude dust
                    and insects.”</p>
                <p>Arrowroot is distinguished by the granules agglomerating into small balls, by
                    slightly crepitating when rubbed between the fingers, and by yielding with
                    boiling water a fine, transparent, inodorous, and pleasant-tasted jelly. In
                    microscopic structure the granules present an ovoid form, marked with concentric
                    lines very similar to potato-starch, but readily distinguished by having a
                    “hilum” marking at the thick extremity of the granule, while in potato-starch
                    the same appearance occurs at the thin end (compare figs. 3 and 4 below). In
                    addition to the West Indian supplies, arrowroot is now found in the commerce of
                    Brazil, the East Indies, Australia, Cape Colony, and Natal, in the last of which
                    localities it has become a staple of some importance. Bermuda arrowroot has
                    always been held in the highest esteem, but on those islands the cultivation is
                    gradually giving way to more profitable crops. In 1872 only 26,710 lb, of the
                    value of £1323, were exported from the Bermudas, while in 1851 the value of the
                    export trade was more than £10,000. St Vincent is now the chief seat of
                    arrowroot culture in the West Indies.</p>

                    chief use, however, of potato-farina as an edible starch is for adulterating
                    other and more costly preparations. This falsification can readily be detected
                    by microscopic examination, and the accompanying drawings exhibit the
                    •appearance under the microscope of the principal starches we have described.
                    Although these starches agree in chemical composition, their value as articles
                    of diet varies considerably, owing to different degrees of digestibility and
                    pleasantness of taste. Arrowroot is found frequently to remain in the stomach of
                    invalids when most other forms of food are rejected, and on this account it has
                    considerable therapeutic value. Being destitute of nitrogen, arrowroot and the
                    other edible starches belong to the force-producing class of foods, and cannot
                    of themselves form a perfect diet. They require to be associated with milk,
                    eggs, meat, or other substances rich in nitrogenous compounds as articles of
                    diet; and they should not be given to young infants, whose organs are not suited
                    for the digestion of starchy food.</p>
