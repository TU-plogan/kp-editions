                    this supremacy arose from no false estimate or unwarranted preference.
                    Aristotle, speaking generally, treated of every subject which came within the
                    range of ancient thought, and if we regard matter, and not form or literary
                    style, he treated of each of these subjects better than any one else. He also
                    initiated many new branches of inquiry, dependent on observation and induction,
                    and thus not only represented in himself the culmination of Greek speculative
                    philosophy, but was also, as far as possible, the forerunner of modern science.
                    Therefore, the sense of mankind recognised him gradually (after many
                    vicissitudes of appreciation) as the strongest of the ancients. It even came to
                    pass that, for a long period, all secular writings but those of Aristotle had
                    dropped out of notice in Europe. His works may almost have the credit of having
                    saved men from relapsing into barbarism. All sought in Aristotle the basis of
                    knowledge. Universities and grammar schools were founded in Aristotle. Dante
                    only justly expresses this predominance, when he speaks of Aristotle<note

                    master of those that know,” and depicts him as centre and head of the
                    philosophic family. Of the influence which he has exercised over the minds of
                    men we have evidence, not only in the vast literatures connected with his
                    system, which exist in all great libraries, but also in the traces which that
                    system has left in all the modern languages of Europe. The number of

                    it had not been for the system of Aristotle, we should have had to express many
                    of our ordinary thoughts differently.</p>
                <p>The thought of Aristotle takes its start out of two separate sets of elements
                    previously existing in Greece: the one purely philosophical, the other
                    scientific. In Plato were summed up and remoulded all the former results of
                    logical, metaphysical, psychological, ethical, and political speculation in
                    Greece. And Aristotle was, in the first place, thoroughly imbued with Plato, and
                    all the purely philosophical side of his writings was conceived in close
                    relation to Plato’s works, the results of which he may be said to have codified,
                    reducing into expository form what Plato had left scattered up and down, rather
                    as hints and suggestions, in his brilliant dramatic dialogues. Partly, then,
                    Aristotle adopted the results of Plato, and made them available for the world in
                    general; partly he dissented from some of the Platonic doctrines, and carried on
                    a polemic against them. To compare the Platonic dialogues with the works of
                    Aristotle, and to trace the agreements and disagreements between them, forms an
                    interesting study in the history of philosophy. But on the whole, the difference
                    between Aristotle and Plato is one of aims rather than of doctrines. Aristotle’s
                    aim, almost from first to last, is to be scientific, and to reduce even
                    philosophy to science. He wishes to deal with what can be known for certain, and
                    to express this in exact language. Plato’s aim was, in one sense, greater than
                    this; in another sense it was inferior to it. Plato stood apart from dogmatic
                    systematising; he seems to have regarded truth as too great and many-sided to be
                    capable of being submitted to such a process; he was content to develop various
                    aspects of the truth, on all the highest questions, as they appeared to
                    different minds, or to the same mind at different periods. To do this he chose
                    the vehicle of the dramatic dialogue, in which nothing was positively announced
                    beyond the views arrived at for the moment by the particular speakers. He was a
                    poet at the same time <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0570-0511"/> that he was a philosopher, and his works exhibit
                    that true note of poetry which consists in constant attention to form, so that
                    no part is a mere means to a final result; but each part is treated as an end in
                    itself, and contains its own beauty and perfection. His dialogues are thus
                    masterpieces of consummate literary art, though somewhat indefinite in their
                    conclusions, and not without a tinge of imaginative mysticism. To all these
                    Platonic tendencies in the treatment of philosophy Aristotle was totally
                    opposed. He disregarded form in all his extant works; he thought of matter
                    alone, and his main care was to be definite and exhaustive. In adopting results
                    from Plato he first stripped them of the poetry with which they had been
                    surrounded. We shall revert below to some of the points on which he controverts
                    Plato, but the real contrast between them is in their attitude; the one is
                    essentially a dialectician, though of the highest and noblest type, the other
                    more and more tends to be a man of science. Following out his proper bent,
                    Aristotle, in many of his works, strikes on a path in which Plato had not been
                    his precursor. In these works he lays the foundation for the sciences of Natural
                    Philosophy, Mechanics, Physiology, and Natural History. In these branches of
                    thought he stands related, not to Plato, but to the early Greek writers on
                    physical subjects, the inquirers on special questions, the medical writers, and
                    the travellers, whose works he often mentions,<note anchored="true"

                    achieved in the accumulation and systematising of knowledge, and in preparing
                    the way for its future development.</p>

                    was un-Greek in the character of his mind; that he was deeper and more earnest

                    residence of the Macedonian king, Amyntas, whose physician Nicomachus, the
                    father of Aristotle, became. Intercourse with the Macedonians may have, to some
                    extent, influenced the manners of this family. But it is to be remembered that
                    they belonged to the race of the Asclepiads, or supposed descendants of
                    Aesculapius, and it is more natural to attribute the scientific tendencies of
                    Aristotle’s mind to the inherited character and traditions of this race than to
                    any influence which he can have received from the Macedonians. Among those

                    whether Aristotle ever dissected the human subject. This would have been much
                    opposed to Greek prejudices. See <hi rend="italic">A ristotle: a Chapter from,

                    contented themselves with dissecting the lower animals; the same may generally
                    have been the case with Aristotle. But he appears to have dissected tho human
                    foetus, and in one place, at all events, he seems to Indicate acquaintance with
                    dissections of the adult human subject <hi rend="italic">(De Part. Animal,</hi>
                    i. v. 7). But his knowledge of anatomy, as compared with that of modern times,
                    was superficial.</p></note> to· have been one, that “from father to son they
                    learned the art of dissection, as regularly as others learn to read and write.”
                    The best biography of Aristotle, hitherto written, is that given by Grote in his
                    posthumous work referred to in note 3. The chief ancient authority on the

                    gossiping statements, two fragments of antiquity which are of the greatest
                    value. One of these is an extract from the chronology <hi rend="italic"

                    “the books which he left behind him,” to the number of 146. The following are
                    the statements of Apollodorus:—That Aristotle was born 384 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> That he joined Plato and passed twenty years with him, thirteen of
                    them consecutively, and that he came to Mitylene 345 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> That in the first year after the death of Plato he went to Hermeas,
                    and abode with him three years; that he came to Philip 343 B.C., when Alexander
                    was fifteen years old; that he came to Athens 335 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    That he held a school in the Lyceum thirteen years, and then went to Chalcis 322

                    years old. This skeleton of the life of Aristotle is probably authentic;<note

                    Apollodorus to be a trustworthy chronologist. Valentine Rose, however, <hi

                    of Aristotle’s death can alone be relied on, and that all the other particulars
                    are filled in, going backwards from this, on conjecture. Rose believes that the
                    account of Aristotle’s connection both with Plato and with Alexander is a mere
                    fiction, and, in short, that we know nothing about the life of Aristotle. This
                    is an extreme of scepticism.</p></note> and if so, we know as much about him as
                    could possibly be expected. It is easy to fill up, to some extent, the details:
                    he must have been in his seventeenth year when he came to Athens to put himself
                    under Plato; twenty years afterwards, when Plato died, he was, on account of his
                    great divergencies of mind from Plato, not appointed head of the school, and he,
                    therefore, retreated to the court of his philosophical friend, Hermeas, ruler of
                    Atarneas, in Asia Minor; he married the niece of Hermeas, who was a eunuch, and
                    had been a slave. On his death Aristotle went to live in retirement in Mitylene,
                    whence, in his forty-second year, he was summoned by Philip of Macedon to
                    undertake the tuition of Alexander the Great, then fifteen years old. Seven
                    years later Philip was assassinated and Alexander became king of Macedonia, and
                    was immediately absorbed in plans for the conquest of the East. Aristotle now
                    came to Athens and spent the last thirteen years of his life there, and it is
                    these years which have the most interest for us, for in them, in all
                    probability, he composed all those of his works<note anchored="true"

                    considerable development of particular thoughts can be traced as having occurred
                    during the actual writing of the books.</p></note> which still remain. In
                    rivalry to the Platonic school which had been established in the gardens of the
                    “Academia” on the west side of Athens, he set up his own school in the covered
                    “walks” <hi rend="italic">(περίπατοι)</hi> round the temple of the Lycean
                    Apollo, on the east side of the city, and from this circumstance his philosophy
                    got the appellation of “Peripatetic.” His mind and the general features of his
                    system were now mature; he had before him the task, on the one hand, of reducing
                    to writing for the world the results of his reflections in philosophy, on the
                    other hand, of accumulating fresh materials for those sciences of observation of
                    which he was laying the foundation. He set himself simultaneously to writing and
                    to teaching, and there is reason to believe that he employed <pb break="no"

                    construction of the great philosophical and scientific edifice which he had in
                    view. The period of the zenith of Aristotle was coeval with the astonishing
                    career of his pupil, Alexander. There is a tradition that Alexander<note

                    <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> viii. c. 16.</p></note> furnished him with funds
                    for his physical and zoological researches. However this may have been, it
                    appears certain that Aristotle was identified in Athens with the Macedonian
                    cause, and that when, in the summer of 323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the
                    startling news of the sudden death of Alexander was spread through Greece,
                    Aristotle was involved in the temporary fall of a political party, and those
                    who, from different causes, were his enemies, made an attack upon him which
                    caused him to fly from Athens. Grote has well drawn out the various elements of
                    enmity existing against Aristotle, and to his account we refer. Aristotle
                    retired to Chalcis in Euboea, a place garrisoned by the Macedonians, and there
                    shortly afterwards closed, in an illness, his life of unsurpassed activity and
                    achievement. His will, preserved by Diogenes, would seem to indicate a kind,
                    just, and generous disposition; of the genuineness of this document we cannot be
                    sure, but there is nothing recorded of Aristotle with any certainty which would
                    lead us to think of him personally otherwise than with respect.<note

                <p>After his death his works had a strange and remarkable history. His library,
                    containing all his own autographs, many of them being MSS. of unpublished and
                    unfinished treatises, was bequeathed to Theophrastus, his chie <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> f disciple, who, dying thirty-five years later,
                    bequeathed them in turn, together with his own books and writings, to Neleus, a
                    Peripatetic scholar. Neleus took the whole precious collection with him to his
                    home at Scepsis, in Asia Minor, and his heirs concealed it in a vault to prevent
                    its being seized by the king of Pergamus, who was then levying contributions for
                    his royal library. The Aristotelian MSS. were thus lost to the world for 187
                    years. About the year 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> they were brought out
                    of their hiding-place and sold to a wealthy book-collector, named Apellicon, who
                    carried them back to Athens. In the year 86 B.C., on the taking of Athens by
                    Sulla, the library of Apellicon was seized and brought to Rome. There some
                    learned Greeks obtained access to it; Tyrannion, the friend of Cicero, arranged
                    the MSS.; and Andronicus of Rhodes undertook the task of furnishing a correct
                    text, and a complete edition of the philosophical works of Aristotle, out of the
                    materials at his disposal. He arranged the different treatises and scattered
                    fragments under their proper heads, and published what was henceforth received
                    as the authorised edition of the works of Aristotle.<note anchored="true"

                    declined; all the philosophic ability round the shores of the Aegean threw
                    itself into one or other of the two new rival schools which had arisen, the

                    in rhetorical form. We may hesitate to affirm that, during 187 years, there were

                    in the vault of Scepsis, for the Stoical ethics and logic both bear traces of a
                    knowledge of Aristotle. But, at all events, for the time, the world had lost its
                    interest in all that we most prize in Aristotle’s thought. Strabo<note

                    a more popular character,” had been lost; and in accordance with this,
                    Cicero<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Topica,</hi> i. 1-3.</p></note> says that “even philosophers know nothing of
                    Aristotle, though they ought to have been attracted by the incredible sweetness
                    of his diction.” The latter part of this remark may seem surprising, for it is
                    not in the least applicable to any of the works of Aristotle which have come
                    down to us. But Cicero is evidently referring to the Dialogues,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Cicero, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epist. ad Famil.,</hi> t. ix. 23, where he speaks of his three books <hi

                    his dialogues always assigns to himself the leading part in the conversation.”
                    This shows that the dialogues of Aristotle were very different from those of
                    Plato, and were probably expository and dogmatic, and not at all
                    dramatic.</p></note> which were read, admired, and attributed to Aristotle in
                    the days before the edition of Andronicus became known. The question has been
                    raised, especially by Valentine Rose,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Arist. Pseudepigraphus,</hi> pp.
                    23-26.</p></note> whether these dialogues, and other short, unsystematic works
                    which passed under the name of Aristotle, were all forgeries, or were in any
                    case genuine. On the one hand it is urged that the dialogic, or artistic, mode
                    of exposition, was alien from Aristotle’s turn of mind. On the other hand, it
                    may be said that Aristotle in his youth may very probably have tried his hand at
                    imitating the Platonic dialogues. And, indeed, unless he had done so, it is
                    difficult to understand how even the forgers could have ventured to publish
                    dialogues bearing his name. Very likely, after his death and the loss of the
                    main bulk of his works by their removal to a vault in Asia Minor, a crop of
                    forged Aristotelian writings sprung up, and imitations of his earlier and more
                    popular works were among the number. But still, it appears safest to believe
                    that Aristotle did at one time endeavour to make the dialogue his vehicle for
                    philosophy. In the years that followed the death of Plato, he probably felt
                    within himself a reaction and repugnance against this mode of writing, and when
                    he returned to Athens as the leader of a school, he utterly renounced it, and
                    set himself henceforth to the statement of the naked truth in the directest and
                    most scientific terms which ho could find. Whether the dialogues which Cicero
                    and his contemporaries read and admired were early works of Aristotle himself,
                    or were forgeries, there is no means of knowing. But the fragments<note

                    collectively in the 5th volume of the Prussian Royal Academy’s edition of

                    ancient literature has brought together, show us nothing worthy of Aristotle in
                    his best days, nothing that contributes any light to his philosophy. And it is
                    remarkable that all works of this kind seem to have been excluded from the
                    edition of Andronicus. Owing to that exclusion they are all now lost, and thus
                    the tables are turned, for whereas before the edition of Andronicus the <pb

                    spurious imitations of these, it came to pass later that all except his solid

                <p>Turning now to the catalogue of the works of Aristotle which has been preserved

                    up “our Aristotle.” This is very striking, and suggests the question, Did
                    Aristotle really write all these works enumerated in the catalogue, and if so,
                    how is it that they are all lost! Did he really write over and over again on the
                    same subject, as the catalogue, taken together with our edition, would indicate
                    <hi rend="italic">1 Or</hi> is the catalogue virtually a list of forgeries,

                    can be accepted absolutely, but the last mentioned contains, probably, by far
                    the nearest approximation to the truth. It seems credible that the catalogue in
                    question was taken from the backs of rolls in the Alexandrian library, and that

                    received by the world as Aristotle’s at a time when the real Aristotle was
                    buried out of sight. The books enumerated in the catalogue strike us at once as
                    peculiar in character: first we meet with the names of several dialogues (such
                    as “Nerinthus,” “Gryllus, or on Rhetoric,” “Menexenus,” “Symposium,” “the
                    Lover,” &amp;c.); afterwards there are the names of apparently short treatises

                    unity of each of the great branches of philosophy which we find in Aristotle as
                    we know him. This organic unity has not been superinduced by the editorial
                    labours of Andronicus, for we see by the openings of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics, Ethics, Politics,</hi> and other existing works, taken in
                    connection with their succeeding parts, that Aristotle conceived a grand and
                    comprehensive plan for each main branch of philosophy and science; that he
                    proposed to follow this out so as to produce in each case a complete whole, but
                    that most of his multifarious designs were arrested by death, so that much that
                    he has left bears the character of a mighty fragment. But the Peripatetic school
                    seem to have abandoned his comprehensive views, and to have only followed him in
                    that other side of his method which consisted in working out the details of
                    special and subordinate questions. This tendency resulted in the production of
                    small separate treatises and essays, and it is the names of such as these that
                    are recorded in the catalogue. The Peripatetic school seem to have worked on a
                    sort of co-operative principle. Aristotle, during his own lifetime, probably
                    encouraged them to work up separate points for incorporation into his
                    philosophy; and if so, they would have less scruple in affixing his name to
                    works written after his death, but which they conceived to represent, or,
                    perhaps, a little to improve upon, his views. Whatever may have been the
                    literary morality of this procedure, we can hardly doubt that it existed as a
                    fact. Even the works of Aristotle, as we possess them, show clear traces of it.
                    Take, for instance, the four different ethical treatises which are found among
                    these works. Of these the first is the <hi rend="italic">Nicomachean
                    Ethics,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Grant’s

                    of Aristotle. It is conceived on a comprehensive plan, and the beginning and end
                    are complete, but the middle part was probably never written. The name of this
                    treatise was, perhaps, given to it for the sake of distinguishing it from the
                    other ethical works in the Peripatetic school library, the MS. cf this having
                    been to some extent revised and edited by Nicomachus, the son of Aristotle. The
                    second is the <hi rend="italic">Eudemian Ethics,</hi> a paraphrase of the work
                    of Aristotle, written by Eudemus, one of his scholars, with a slight divergence
                    in some points from the original doctrines. Three books from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eudemian</hi> treatise, on Justice, on the Relation of the
                    Intellect to Morality, and on Weakness of the Will, were afterwards incorporated
                    by some editor into the <hi rend="italic">Nicomachean Ethics,</hi> so that in
                    modern times they have always formed part of both treatises, and their
                    authorship has been much disputed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    conclusions taken directly from that of Aristotle, and with some matter
                    introduced from another source, perhaps the ethical writings of Theophrastus.
                    The fourth is a little tract <hi rend="italic">On Virtues and Vices,</hi> which
                    is not even Aristotelian in doctrine, though it shows an acquaintance with the
                    Aristotelian system. It is chiefly characterised by some small points of
                    physiognomical observation, such as are found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >characters</hi> of Theophrastus. These four works well illustrate the growth of
                    an ungenuine Aristotelian literature. We begin with a genuine work of Aristotle
                    himself, though even into this a spurious element has been introduced; we go on
                    to a paraphase, and then to the paraphrase of that paraphrase; we end with a
                    light essay written for the sake of one or two observations on character which
                    the writer had made; and yet all stands under the name of Aristotle.<note

                    at giving a collected body of Aristotelian doctrine, rather than an edition of
                    Aristotle’s own undoubted writings. We know that Andronicus pronounced the

                    that none of the works so enumerated -were written by Aristotle himself, but
                    probably much the greater portion of them were not written by him. And without

                    have touched upon the question. Most of the leading opinions upon it have been

                    But the question is now reduced to a very small one. The word “exoteric”
                    suggests the opposite term “esoteric,” in the sense of secret; and the writers
                    of the later empire,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">E.g.,</hi> Aulus Gellius, xx. 4.</p></note> who were accustomed to
                    the idea of mystical and hierophantic teachings, as professed by the
                    neo-Pythagorean and neo-Platonic schools, took up the notion that Aristotle had
                    two forms of doctrine: the one “esoteric,”—containing his real opinions, and
                    confined to the circle of his initiated scholars,—the other “exoteric,”
                    containing superficial truth with which the profane vulgar might be put off and
                    satisfied. After the Renaissance the idea of a double doctrine in Aristotle was
                    exploded, and it was acknowledged that “exoteric” in the passages above
                    mentioned is not opposed to “esoteric” or “secret,” but denotes the external,
                    non-philosophical, non-scientific treatment of a subject, as opposed to the
                    strictly scientific treatment of it (oικ∈7os λόγος). The only question, then,
                    which remained is this,—Does Aristotle, when he refers to “the exoteric
                    discourses,” mean to refer directly to his own more popular writings, or does he
                    make general reference to popular discussions on philosophical subjects,
                    including not only his own and other people’s popular writings, but also the
                    ordinary debates and discussions on such subjects, rife enough in Athenian
                    society, and, of course, unscientifically conducted <hi rend="italic">I</hi>

                    monograph, has endeavoured to prove that each of the passages in which “the

                    dialogues of Aristotle, the character and contents of which Bernays seeks to
                    gather from the scanty fragments of them preserved by the ancients. It appears
                    to us, however, that this attempt is infelicitous in its results, and that there
                    are many reasons for thinking that Aristotle did not appeal to his own popular
                    writings for conclusions in philosophy, but merely said, occasionally, that the
                    popular views on some questions of philosophy were sufficiently accurate and

                    discusses the thirty-eight books of “Problems” attributed to Aristotle, in which
                    questions on all conceivable subjects are proposed and answered. Prantl shows

                    starting and endeavouring to answer “problems” as a contribution to science, and
                    though there may be a small nucleus of Aristotle’s own writing here, yet the

                    >Metaphysics</hi> (which, if he wrote the book at all, he must have done), then
                    we must suppose that at the outset of his independent career as a philosopher he
                    began with an externe reaction against the realism of Plato, and that in later
                    life he returned from this to approximation towards Plato’s views. The other
                    hypothesis possible is, that a bias towards physical research and experiment and
                    the collection of facts naturally led the Peripatetic school in the direction of
                    nominalism, till at last some member of that school gave expression to this
                    tendency by writing this little treatise called the <hi rend="italic"

                    teaching, but laying it down far more dogmatically than he would have done that

                    pronounce in favour of one hypothesis or the other. For the school of Aristotle
                    copied, and obtained a close resemblance to, their master’s style. But whether
                    this treatise was written by Aristotle or not, it has had a great influence. It
                    led the world not only to think that Aristotle was a decided nominalist, but
                    also that he classified existence under ten “categories” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >summa</hi><hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> But this doctrine would hardly have
                    been gathered from the undoubted writings of Aristotle. In his logical
                    researches he naturally much busied himself with the different relations which
                    the predicate of a sentence can bear to the subject. And in the earliest of his
                    extant works <hi rend="italic">(Topics,</hi> i. 9), he enumerates “the classes
                    of predications” (τά yen; τωv κα∙∏7y0pιωv) as ten,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Substance, quantity, quality, relation,
                    place, time,posture <hi rend="italic">(κe7σθai),</hi> habit (or dress, <hi
                    rend="italic">eχeιv),</hi> action, passion. Such a list would form a strange
                    classification of all things in the universe. Some of these categories have an
                    easily traceable affinity with the parts of speech, thus showing the relation
                    between logic and grammar. But this is not their only source. As the individual
                    man may sometimes be the subject of predication, his “dress” and “posture” were
                    admitted among the classes of categories. <hi rend="italic">Habit,</hi> from the
                    Latinised form of *X <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> " ’ &gt; survives in modern
                    languages, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to'be “habited” is to be dressed,a lady

                    and gives the same list as that given in the <hi rend="italic">Categories;</hi>
                    but the object of this enumeration is merely logical, in order to show what must
                    be meant by the word “same” when it is predicated of any subject. Elsewhere,
                    Aristotle does not adhere to the number ten; he mentions<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Bonitz ’ s Index to Aristotle, in the

                    or modes of predication. There is no trace of his mapping out to himself the
                    “Cosmos” under the divisions of ten or any other number of categories. In <hi
                    rend="italic">He Anima,</hi> i. 1, 7, he says that “it will be necessary, in
                    discussing the soul, to define which of the categories it belongs to, and again
                    whether it is a potentiality or an actuality.” But, having said this, Aristotle
                    does not further advert to the categories, while he obtains his whole definition
                    of the soul by considering it as an “actuality.” In fact, “Potentiality and
                    Actuality,” or “Matter, Form, and Deprivation,” were the ontological
                    “categories” of Aristotle, far rather than that logical list of ten kinds of
                    predication, on which mediaeval and modern thinkers have laid so much stress.
                    That they have done so is perhaps mainly due to this little work called the <hi

                    Aristotle himself, or was the compilation of some peripatetic follower) has had

                    Aristotle to be misunderstood, severely criticised, and sneered at. At the same
                    time it has given an impulse to philosophers, from the Stoics<note

                    inconclusive. Whether this treatise was by Aristotle or not, it contains a very

                <p>We now come to the undoubted works of Aristotle. These, as before said, were
                    probably all actually written during his last thirteen years, but they must
                    have, to a great extent, been prepared during the previous course of his life,
                    during which he had thought out the divisions, the method, and the terminology
                    of philosophy and science. The order of composition of these works, so far as it
                    can bo determined at all, must be determined by internal evidence. This internal
                    evidence does not consist merely in references from one book to another (for
                    these are not always reliable—in some cases they are almost certainly
                    interpolated), but still more in comparison of the thought in different books,
                    and the various degrees of maturity exhibited by the same conception occurring
                    in different books. F or instance, in the first chapter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analytics</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi> are referred to; therefore,
                    either the <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi> were written first, or else this
                    reference is spurious. But the doctrine of the syllogism is worked out with far
                    more precision in the <hi rend="italic">Analytics</hi> than in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Topics,</hi> therefore the former hypothesis must be accepted. A
                    similar combination of verbal and real internal evidence would seem to show<note

                    of his works were simultaneously “on the stocks” up to the time of his death,
                    and this makes their precise order difficult to assign.</p>
                <p>We shall nowproceed briefly to indicate, we cannot attempt more, the leading
                    features of the contents of Aristotle’s undoubted works, as they have come down
                    to us. The books of the <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi> (see note 10, p. 514)
                    form together a connected whole. Of these the <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi>
                    appear to have been written first, but the sequence of thought between the books
                    is that the <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics</hi> stand first, as containing
                    the theory of the syllogism, a necessary preliminary to reasoning of all kinds;
                    and then growing out of this root we have two divergent treatises: the <hi
                    rend="italic">Posterior Analytics,</hi> on demonstrative reasoning, or the logic
                    of science; and the <hi rend="italic">Topics,</hi> on dialectic, or the art of
                    discussing subjects in which demonstration is impossible. For the details
                    contained in these treatises we must refer the reader to Grote’s (see note 3, p.
                    511) generally<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See some

                    <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics</hi> has become the common property of all

                    added to the syllogism (uselessly); and Sir W. Hamilton introduced the

                    >tout,</hi></p></note> has had to be detracted from or added to what Aristotle
                    wrote upon the syllogism. His was the proud distinction of having discovered and
                    fully drawn out the laws under which the mind acts in deductive reasoning. That
                    in deduction the mind proceeds from some universal proposition, and how it
                    proceeds—these were the first things which Aristotle had to tell the world. The
                    modern attempts to impugn these principles, and to show that the mind does not
                    reason from universals, are a failure. They confuse inductive with deductive
                    reasoning, and ignore both the case of a science like geometry, which is all
                    deduction, and also the numerous cases where the mind, having unduly assumed a
                    universal principle, rests in it afterwards and makes deductive applications of
                    it. Granting that there is such a thing as deductive reasoning (and surely life
                    is full of it), it is a great matter to have the laws of this so clearly
                    ascertained, that about the process itself there can no longer be doubt, and any
                    flaw in the process can instantly be detected. This was the service that
                    Aristotle rendered in drawing out the laws of the syllogism. Men, of course,
                    reasoned deductively by means of “the syllogism” before Aristotle had
                    appropriated this name<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    to indicate the formula for deductive reasoning, and before he had discovered
                    and stated the laws under which the mind acts in deductive reasoning. They did
                    so, however, unconsciously and by instinct, just as men wrote and talked
                    grammatically before any idea of a science or an art of grammar existed. In
                    Aristotle deductive reasoning became conscious of itself. Unfortunately for his
                    reputation, this merely preliminary part of his labours, in which the principles
                    and rules of syllogistic inference were drawn out, occupied almost exclusively
                    the minds of thinkers in the Middle Ages. The errors of modern Aristotelians
                    were imputed to Aristotle, and hence arose the notion that Aristotle explained
                    nature by means of the syllogism. Nothing could be further from the truth;
                    Aristotle was not only one of the most inquiring and encyclopaedical, but also
                    one of the most thoroughly sensible, of all writers, and no one would have
                    repudiated more strongly than himself the idea that the formula of the syllogism
                    can be used to test or explain anything beyond the process of reasoning from
                    certain premisses possessed or assumed, and he is never tired of telling us that
                    the only means of obtaining premisses is by experience and observation of facts.
                    While discussing the syllogism itself, he says,<note anchored="true"

                    of astronomicai phenomena, and it is the case with every branch of science or
                    art. When the facts in each branch are brought together, it will be the province
                    of the logician to set out the demonstrations in a manner clear and fit for
                    use.” It is true that Aristotle did nothing towards the logic of Induction, that
                    is to say, towards elucidating the methods by which the mind legitimately
                    arrives at general facts or laws of nature. This was left to be worked out by
                    the moderns, by Galileo, and Bacon, and Whewell, and J. S. Mill. Aristotle,
                    indeed, made a cursory attempt<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    1870), chap. i. § 2.</p></note> to put the inductive process into syllogistic
                    form, thus :—“A, B, and C draw iron; A, B, and C are (or represent) all magnets;
                    therefore all magnets draw iron.” It is clear that this syllogism does not
                    explain the inductive process, it only records in the minor premiss a previous
                    induction. The real question is, do A, B, and C here properly represent all
                    magnets I To answer this, verification would be required. The syllogism, then,
                    does not explain the inductive process, but only calls attention to what is
                    implied in it. Leaving unattempted the question how jthe minor premiss in the
                    Inductive syllogism is to be obtained, and how tested,— what Aristotle really
                    works out is the logic of Deductivo Science (in the <hi rend="italic">Post.

                    >Dialogues</hi> of Plato may serve to give us an idea of a society possessed
                    with an insatiate appetite for discussion and controversy, and always delighted
                    to take part in, or assist at, an intellectual game or fencing match between two
                    opponents. And it is the object of the <hi rend="italic">Topics</hi> of
                    Aristotle to lay down the rules for the game of Dialectic, and to establish it
                    as a highly salubrious and necessaryintellectual art. Dialectic, properly
                    speaking, is discussion with a view to probable truth, and so far is worthy of
                    the attention of a philosopher. But it may easily emerge into Eristic, which is
                    discussion with a view to victory. Even under this aspect Aristotle does not
                    think it ought to be neglected. Drawing on his vast and methodised observation
                    of life, he gives rules and hints for the conduct of Eristic. The name <hi

                    charlatans. Thus, while Eristic is arguing for victory, he describes Sophistry
                    as arguing for gain. The Sophist, according to Aristotle, tried to refute by
                    means of fallacy, in order that he might be thought clever, and so get pupils
                    and make money. Aristotle collects, classifies, and exposes these fallacious
                    refutations; and so exhaustive is he in one short book, that the human mind has

                    opinion is, that Aristotle was here referring to his having worked out the forms

                    positively nothing said before me; I had to work it out for myself by long and
                    laborious research.”</p>
                <p>Greece at this time was full of Dialectic and Rhetoric, and the two were closely
                    connected; and it was quite natural for Aristotle (whose aim was to take up and
                    carry out to perfection all that the intellect of his countrymen had assayed),
                    next in order after Logic and Dialectic, to deal with Rhetoric. We have already
                    seen (p. 515) that ha probably wrote his <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>
                    immediately after the main books of the <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi> but
                    before the <hi rend="italic">Sophistical Refutations.</hi> But a distinction
                    must here be added, for it seems pretty plain that, after he had written the two
                    first books of his <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> there was an interval, and
                    that he did not add on the third book<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Book iii. opens with the same words with which book ii. had
                    concluded. This looks as if Aristotle had returned to the subject after on
                    interval, having forgotten the exact form of what he had before written. This
                    book (c. i. § 10) quotes the treatise <hi rend="italic">On Poetry,</hi> which

                    Rhetoric has been preserved for us among the works of Aristotle, having been
                    long attributed to him on account of a spurious letter prefixed to it, and
                    purporting to be from Aristotle to his former pupil, Alexander the Great. Hence

                    drew forth the reprobation both of Plato and Aristotle. Plato,<note

                    identified rhetoric with trickery, and refused to countenance the study of it.
                    Aristotle, who often exhibits less moral earnestness, but greater intellectual
                    breadth than Plato, thought it necessary that this, like other intellectual
                    fields, should be exploited. He thought,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Bhet.,</hi> i. 1, 12.</p></note> amongst
                    other reasons, that unless this were done, truth and justice would sometimes be
                    left deprived of proper representation and support. He repudiates the practice
                    of the earlier rhetoricians, who had based their “Arts” entirely on appeals to
                    the passions; and in a large and manly way he proceeds to develop all the
                    various points which an orator must keep in view, and to indicate all the kinds
                    of knowledge which he must acquire in order to be master of his profession. In
                    so doing, Aristotle has displayed his extraordinary power of exhausting any
                    subject to which he gave his mind. Hardly anything of importance on the subject
                    of Rhetoric has been added to what he wrote. Take the most powerful and subtle
                    specimens of modern oratory,—for instance, Shakspeare’s speech of Mark Antony
                    over the body of Caesar,—and you will find the <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi>
                    of every telling point set forth by anticipation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhetoric</hi> of Aristotle. His work contains some few Greek
                    technicalities,—for instance, tho doctrine of the Enthymeme,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Enthymeme is a rhetorical
                    (i.e., non-demonstrative) syllogism. Its premisses are “signs” and
                    “probabilities.” Its province is to show likelihood, not certainty. The question
                    with scholars is, whether it is essential to the Enthymeme that one of its
                    premisses should be left unexpressed. See Sir W. Hamilton, <hi rend="italic"

                    commentators are not agreed. But the main bulk of the treatise consists of a
                    rich collection of remarks on human nature and life, applicable to all periods.
                    In the wisdom and knowledge of the world which it exhibits, Aristotle’s <hi

                    >Essays</hi> of Lord Bacon. And it might be compared with them also in this
                    respect, that a bad and Machiavelian use might certainly be made of some of the
                    suggestions which it contains, though Aristotle professes only to give them to
                    be employed in the interest of truth and justice. The third book, on Style, is
                    excellent so far as it goes, but it is less exhaustive and universally
                    applicable than the former books, which treat of the matter of speeches.</p>
                <p>Rhetoric was said by Aristotle<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the other hand to Ethics; and, accordingly, he seems to have gone next to the
                    exploration of the latter subject. At all events he wrote the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nicomαcheaη Ethics</hi> later than the <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric.</hi> When we
                    compare the two treatises together we are struck with the growth of mind which
                    has taken place between them. The <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi> is full of
                    ethical definitions of happiness, pleasure, virtue, friendship, and the like.
                    But in the <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> these are all remodelled, and made far
                    deeper and more exact.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Nicomachean Ethics</hi> was, perhaps, the first of
                    Aristotle’s extant works which entered upon the matter of knowledge, as distinct
                    from the theory of the reasonings by which knowledge is obtained, and from the
                    theory of the statement by which knowledge may be best set forth. Tho moral

                    Aristotle denied a future life is another question to be considered later. But
                    at all events he constructed ethics independently of such a doctrine. On the
                    other hand, his system differs from the modern point of view, in that he asks,
                    not, What is right? what is our duty? or what is the ground of moral obligation?
                    but, What is the chief good for man? In order to answer this question, he calls

                    must consist in something which is an End in itself, and that it must be found
                    in the actuality of the human powers. It is a weak point in the system that,
                    instead of at once recognising the law of moral obligation as the deepest thing
                    in man, it introduces<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the idea of virtue and morality in a dry logical way, saying that the chief good
                    for man must be the actuality of his powers according to their own proper law of
                    excellence (κατά <hi rend="italic">την</hi><hi rend="italic">οlκeiav</hi><hi

                    virtue, Aristotle divides it, in relation to man, into moral and intellectual.
                    The part of his work which treated of intellectual excellence is lost, or was
                    left unwritten. His discussion on moral excellence or virtue is full of
                    interest. Its salient points are— <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the doctrine oi
                    the formation of habits or states of mind; <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> the
                    doctrine of “the mean,” as the essential determinator of virtue; <hi
                    rend="italic">third,</hi> a brilliant analysis of the qualities and characters
                    which were reckoned either as cardinal or secondary virtues in Greece. On
                    Aristotle’s doctrine of “the mean” a word must be said. Objection has been made
                    to it in modern times, on the ground that it sets up a merely quantitative
                    difference between virtue and vice. But Aristotle’s point of view was thoroughly
                    Greek, it was based on the analogy of Art. When we speak of actions being
                    “right” or “wrong” the Greeks spoke of them as being “beautiful” (καλά) or
                    “ugly’’(αισχρά). In all Greek art and literature the great aim was to avoid the
                    “too much” and the “too little,” and in this way to attain perfection. Aristotle
                    only followed Greek feeling, and the lead of Plato,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato’s term for the law of the beautiful was

                    and Grant’s <hi rend="italic">Ethics,</hi> essay 4.</p></note> in applying the
                    same idea to morals. It might, indeed, be urged that this idea of “the mean,” of
                    “neither too much nor too little,” is a negative and merely regulative
                    conception, and that it ’ does not suffice to explain the moral beauty of the
                    phenomena which Aristotle had in view. For instance, he describes the brave
                    man<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eth.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nie.,</hi> iii. 9, 4.</p></note> consciously meeting
                    death for a worthy object, and consciously sacrificing life and happiness, and
                    much that he holds dear, because he feels that it is “beautiful” to do so. But,
                    so far as we can learn from Aristotle, the “beauty” here consists J in
                    exhibiting neither too much nor too little boldness, but the exact mean. In this
                    there is obviously something inadequate; but the fault seems to lie, not so much
                    in laying down “the mean” as the law of beauty, but rather in not going beyond
                    the identification of the morally admirable with the beautiful. This leaves each
                    moral action, or course of conduct, to be judged of as α work of art. The
                    proportions in each case are relative, but he who can judge aright will feel the
                    harmony or otherwise of the details. With this artistic and somewhat superficial
                    conception of morality, Aristotle is, in his own way, an intuitionist. He
                    thinks<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> See <hi
                    rend="italic">Politics,</hi> i. 2, 12.</p></note> that we have a sense
                    (αισ0τjσις) for moral beauty, but that this sense exists in perfection in the
                    wise man <hi rend="italic">(φρόνιμος),</hi> to whom in all cases must be the
                    ultimate appeal.</p>
                <p>But the whole question of man’s moral nature is really subsidiary in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ethics</hi> of Aristotle. His question is, What is the chief good
                    for man ⅛ and the answer to this question is, It must consist in the evocation
                    and actuality of man’s highest faculty, namely, the Reason. Thus, the highest
                    happiness is to be found in contemplation and speculative thought; the joys of
                    the philosopher are beyond compare. A satisfaction of an inferior kind is to be
                    found in the exercise of the moral virtues. Such is, in brief, the view which
                    Aristotle gives of human life. He excludes religion from his consideration of
                    the subject, though his disciple, Eudemus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Fritzschius, <hi rend="italic">Eudemi Rhodii Ethica</hi>

                    introduce it. The same question, What is the <hi rend="italic">summum bonum</hi>
                    for man? has been answered in somewhat similar terms, in modern times, by
                    Spinoza.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    which the mind has with the whole of nature, and to be able to enjoy that state

                    individual separately. Moral development and the realisation of our powers
                    (evεpγeια) require as external conditions a settled community, social habits,
                    the restraint and protection of laws, and a wisely-regulated system of public
                    education. Man is by nature a political creature; he cannot isolate himself
                    without becoming either less or more than man <hi rend="italic">(ή
                    θηρίον</hi><hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">θεός).</hi> Thus the state
                    is a prime necessity to man, and, indeed, the state is prior in idea to the
                    individual, that is to say, the normal conception of man is of man in a state of
                    civilisation, and this implies beforehand the conception of a state. On these
                    grounds Aristotle went on from his <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> to the
                    composition of his <hi rend="italic">Politics.</hi> Some little time,<note

                    in Bekker’s edition it breaks off in the middle of Aristotle’s theory of
                    education (book viii.) Some have thought that this unfinished book was put last
                    by some editor because it was unfinished, but that it originally stood earlier
                    in the treatise, and that the commonly received order of the books should be

                    not concluded in the most interesting part of all), books iv. vi. v. forming a

                    remedies for the different evils apparent in the actual Governments of Greece.
                    Suffice it, however, to say that the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> of
                    Aristotle have come down to us in a fragmentary condition, not carrying out all
                    that their author had intended, and probably never having received his last
                    hand. The contents of this work are interesting, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi>
                    from an antiquarian point of view, as throwing a flood of light on Grecian
                    history; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> from the knowledge of human nature and
                    the wise remarks applicable to all times with which they abound. On the other
                    hand, Aristotle’s considerations are too much confined to Greek states, that is,
                    to states on an extremely small scale, to allow of his political theories being
                    very useful in modern times. Owing to this his <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi>
                    have been comparatively little studied. It is said<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mr Congreve, <hi rend="italic">Ρol. of
                    Ar.,</hi> introduction, p. xxiii.</p></note> that in the Italian republics, from
                    their resemblance to the Greek states, more attention than elsewhere was paid to
                    this treatise. Aristotle had no political ties; he lived at Athens as a <hi
                    rend="italic">metic,</hi> or foreigner, without the rights or duties of a
                    citizen, and thus he was in a position to write, with the utmost impartiality,
                    of political questions. But his statesmanship does not appear to have extended
                    to what we should call the “balance of power,” by which national existence might
                    be preserved and guaranteed. He limited his view to the well-being of each
                    little state within itself, though he probably would not have objected to, and
                    perhaps even contemplated, the hegemony of Macedonia, provided that under this
                    each Greek city were left to carry on its own civic life.</p>
                <p>His ideal state contrasts favourably, from a scientific point of view, with that
                    of Plato. For while giving, as we have seen above, great and predominant weight
                    to the idea of the state, he refuses to allow the individual and the family to
                    be absorbed by the state. He thus resists all approaches to that communism<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">≡
                    Ρol.,</hi> ii. 1, 3; 5, 28.</p></note> which was carried to so great
                    extravagance in the <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> of Plato. The form of
                    government which, ideally speaking, he prefers, is a wise monarchy or
                    aristocracy,—some government, in short, in which neither wealth nor numbers
                    shall be permitted to determine everything. In some points it must be confessed
                    that he exhibits a narrow and conservative spirit, and a belief in the divine
                    right of things as they are, which puts him at a disadvantage in comparison
                    either with Plato or with modern views. Thus, despite counter opinions in his
                    own day, he maintains the institution of slavery as based on nature, and even
                    lays it down<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Pol.,</hi> i. 8, 12.</p></note> that it is justifiable to make war
                    upon and reduce to slavery those races who were evidently intended by nature to
                    be subject. In accordance with his physiological system, he treats woman<note

                    therefore, he resists Plato’s proposals for the emancipation and improved
                    education of women. And by a third misapplication of his favourite conception of
                    “nature,” he denounces interest<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pοl.,</hi> i. 10, 4.</p></note> as
                    unnatural, money being a mere instrument of exchange, whereas interest
                    unnaturally increases it. These specimens of backwardness of thought all occur
                    in the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Politics,</hi> and may serve to show
                    how much “Truth is the daughter of Time,” and into what weaknesses the strongest
                    individual minds may fall on questions not yet sufficiently ventilated and

                    he had not yet got the division of the two subjects clear in his mind; for he

                    “'purification” (κα0αpσις) has a moral significance, such as was associated with
                    the term in the Greek “mysteries,” or whether it is a purely medical metaphor,
                    and means simply “purging.” In the <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> (viii. 7, 3)
                    Aristotle has used the same term <hi rend="italic">(κaθa,pσι&lt;s)</hi> in
                    reference to the effect of certain kinds of music, and had promised to give a
                    fuller explanation of it in his treatise <hi rend="italic">On Poetry;</hi> but
                    this promise is unfulfilled, and we have rather to go back to the <hi

                    burden, We must regret, however, that the fuller disquisition on this subject,
                    which he had promised, has not been given. Much stress has been laid, especially
                    by the French, on “the unities” of the drama, as supposed to be prescribed by
                    Aristotle <hi rend="italic">On Poetry.</hi> But in reality he attaches no
                    importance to the external “unities” of time and place. In enumerating the
                    differences between tragedy and epic poetry, he says,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Poet.,</hi> V.
                    8.</p></note> that “the one generally tries to limit its action to a period of
                    twenty-four hours, or not much to exceed that, while the other is unlimited in
                    point of time.” But he does not lay this down as a law for tragedy. The
                    peculiarity of the Greek drama, in which a chorus remained constantly present
                    and the curtain never fell, almost necessitated “the unities,” but Aristotle
                    only concerns himself with internal unity, which he says that tragedy must have
                    in common with every other work of art,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    consists in making every part bear an organic relation to the whole, so that no
                    part could be altered or omitted without the whole suffering. This principle,
                    much more valuable than that of “the unities,” is habitually <pb break="no"

                    him into the “speculative” part of his system, consisting of a rich series of
                    physical and physiological treatises. In this department the results arrived at
                    2200 years ago by Aristotle come into sharp contrast with the achievements of
                    modern science up to the present day. Those who enter upon the comparison are
                    apt to run into one of two extremes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    scientific merits. He himself affords an instance of the opposite extreme, being
                    in many points too hard upon Aristotle.</p></note> —either to pass
                    undiscriminating eulogies on Aristotle, and to credit him with impossible
                    anticipations of future discovery, or to treat him with undue disparagement, as
                    utterly false in method and puerile in his views of nature. It is only owing to
                    Aristotle’s real greatness that such a comparison could for a moment be
                    made,—for what, comparatively speaking, could be expected of a philosophy 2000
                    years old in respect of the sciences of observation and experiment, whose very
                    essence consists in gradual advance from one new vantage point to another? To do
                    personal justice to Aristotle, we must conceive, as a matter of fancy, what it
                    would have been if he could have had one of the great modern discoveries
                    imparted to him,—the Copernican system, or the law of gravitation, or the
                    circulation of the blood, or the analyses of air and water, or the conservation
                    of energy; if he could have had any modern instrument of observation, such as
                    the telescope or microscope, or even the thermometer or barometer, placed in his
                    hands. How swiftly would he have used such an advantage! what new and ramifying
                    deductions and inductions he would have made! how radically he would have had
                    modified many of his views! But all this was, of course, impossible. Physical
                    knowledge was in its infancy; Aristotle could only start where his predecessors
                    left off; he laid the foundation of many sciences, and wherever simple
                    observation was adequate,—as, for instance, in politics and in some parts of
                    natural history,—his achievements were complete and surprising. But for the
                    greater realms of science he had no starting point and no appliances; he could
                    only slightly modify the almost childlike views of the Greeks, and rest content
                    with such unverified hypotheses<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    explain the nature of things. Thus, it is not to be wondered at that he
                    considered the earth to be stationary and the centre of the world, with the
                    seven planets (including as such the sun and moon) moving round it in oblique
                    courses to the left, while the outer heaven or sphere of the stars—composed not
                    of perishable matter, but of divine ether—he thought to move from left to right,
                    with perfect and regular motion returning on itself, deriving its motion from
                    the encompassing Godhead,—that essence which moves things, but is not moved
                    itself. Such was, according to the belief of Aristotle, the framework of the
                    universe; and the order<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    this framework. Of his method it may be said, in one word, that no one was ever
                    more keen than he to make “fact” <hi rend="smallcaps">(to</hi> on) the basis of
                    every theory. It is not to be supposed for a moment that he attempted to explain
                    nature by means of the syllogism. But, on the other hand, the art of
                    experimenting, and the exact quantitative record of observations had not been
                    developed. So Aristotle was often quite destitute of the appropriate “facts” for
                    a particular inquiry, and sometimes deceived in the “facts” upon which he
                    founded. And his training as a dialectician was in some respects a disadvantage
                    to him, as it led him to depend too much on the evidence of language in forming
                    his theories of nature.</p>
                <p>The logical order of the physical treatises, and, probably to a great extent, the
                    actual order of their composition, is as follows :—1si, The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physical Discourse,</hi> in eight books, forms an introduction to the entire
                    subject. It is, as Hegel called it, “a Metaphysic of Physic.” It treats of the
                    Principles of Existence, Matter and Form, Nature, Motion, Time, Space, the
                    Unmoved First Mover, and the Ever-moved, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the sphere
                    of the outer heaven. 2√, The treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Heavens,</hi> in
                    four books, naturally succeeds; and Aristotle, thus beginning with the periphery
                    and divinest part of the universe, descends gradually to the region of the
                    material and perishable. In so doing it becomes necessary to him to consider the
                    causes of those changes,— that passing into and out of existence,—which had no
                    place in the higher region. Therefore, <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> the treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">On Generation and Destruction,</hi> in two books, gives us
                    Aristotle’s theory of the Hot and the Cold, and the Wet and the Dry,—pairs of
                    opposites, the first pair active, and the second pair passive, which by their
                    combinations and mutual workings produce the four elements (Hot and Dry = Fire,
                    Hot and Wet — Air, Cold and Dry = Earth, Cold and Wet = Water), and form the
                    ground for all natural changes. <hi rend="italic">4th,</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Meteorologies,</hi> in three books, treat of the region of the
                    planets, comets, and meteors,—a region ever full of change and alteration. The
                    fourth book of this treatise does not logically belong to it, for in it
                    Aristotle develops his theory of two exhalations—the steamy or wet, and the
                    smoky or dry—which, being imprisoned within the earth, produce, the former the
                    metals, and the latter the rocks, and such other minerals as are incapable of
                    being melted. This theory, which seems to be a dim foreshadowing of the doctrine
                    of crystallisation, takes us out of the mid-air below the surface of the earth.
                    It is, therefore, out of place; but almost everything in Aristotle must be
                    looked upon as unfinished. <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> The treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Parts of Animals,</hi> in four books, leads the way to .the
                    investigation of organic life. It contains Aristotle’s physiological distinction
                    between homogeneous and unhomogeneous substances <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ομοιομερή</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ανομοιομερή),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> tissues and organs. This distinction, which is recognised still as
                    perfectly valid, gives a scale of ascension from the inorganic to the organic
                    world. First, Heat and Cold, &amp;c., form the simple elements; out of the
                    elements are formed the homogeneous substances or tissues; out of these are
                    formed the organs, out of the organs the organised being. As a principle of
                    method, Aristotle lays it down<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De Part. 4nim.,</hi> i. 1, 4-7.</p></note>
                    that all which is common to the various species of living beings should be
                    discussed before entering upon their specific differences. Therefore, <hi

                    in order, which, as Spengel observes (see note 3), is not to be regarded as a
                    work on psychology in the modern sense, but as a physiological treatise on the
                    soul or vital principle common to all livingbeings. And next follow, <hi

                    356 species of vertebrato animals. Of the invertebrate classes, about 60 species
                    of insects and arachnids seem to have been known to Aristotle; some 24
                    crustaceans and annelids, and about 40 molluscs and radiates. See <hi

                    question. The very name “Metaphysics” (see before, note 8, p. 514) embodies a

                    exclusively metaphysical) words are used. It may have been jotted down by
                    Aristotle himself, and have been found among his papers; but it is only through
                    injudicious editing that it can have been inserted in this work. Book x. is
                    quite peculiar; the first half of it (chapters 1-7) is a brief restatement (by
                    Aristotle himself, as Bonitz thinks) of the conclusions of books ii. iff. v.;
                    the second half is an un-Aristotelian epitome of part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physical Discourse.</hi> Even making these deductions, the remainder of the
                    work is not homogeneous, but is resolvable into two separate treatises: the
                    first being intended to set forth Aristotle’s system of metaphysic, and
                    consisting of books i. ii. iii. v. vi. vii. viii., which give the history of
                    former systems and the groundwork of his own. The second treatise is contained
                    in book xi., which, after a short sketch of the nature of substance in general,
                    ends in a dissertation upon the nature of God. Books ix. (on Unity) and xii.

                    >Metaphysics</hi> of Aristotle, as they stand in our editions, are composed. How
                    far the making up of them into their present form is due to Eudemus and the
                    earlier Peripatetics, how far to the editorial hand of Andronicus, we cannot
                    tell.</p>
                <p>Among the many-sided merits of Aristotle must be mentioned the example set by him
                    of making the history of opinion on each subject the prelude to a scientific
                    consideration of the subject itelf. In the first book of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysics</hi> he sketches the leading doctrines of his predecessors on the
                    first principles of existence. He thus becomes the father of the history of
                    philosophy, a study which has been taken up anew and much developed during the
                    present century. His brief and masterly sketch is, however, open to the charge
                    of not doing sufficient justice to the different points of view of former
                    philosophers. And his polemic against Plato’s doctrine of Ideas, which is

                    may be urged against the system. Ard, wonderful to relate, Aristotle uses some

                    impugns. Aristotle himself never discarded idealism. He declared that
                    universals, and the truths apprehensible by the highest reason, were “by nature
                    more known”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    individual concrete phenomena, and the facts apprehended by sense. But yet he
                    had the strongest bias towards physical research and empirical observation. A
                    modern physical philosopher might have been content to follow out his own
                    special inquiries without seeking a general scheme for the universe. But
                    Aristotle had to form a theory of the whole, leaving scope, afterwards, for the
                    separate physical sciences. The idealism of Plato did not do this; it left no
                    place for matter, motion, or change; when followed out it reduced all but the
                    Ideas to the category of the non-existent. Aristotle, to rescue all nature from
                    theoretical annihilation, introduced a term between the existent and the
                    non-existent, namely, the “potential” <hi rend="italic">(8υvαμις).</hi> On the
                    one hand, the potential does not exist, for as yet it has no qualities; on the

                    and this could not be without implying the previous existence of the potential.
                    The universe, according to Aristotle, is a continuous chain; at the one end is
                    the purely potential—matter without form or qualities; at the other end is pure
                    unconditioned actuality, the ever existent, or God.</p>

                <p>“Nature,” or the system prevailing from the earth upwards through the planetary
                    sphere, is full of reason; it does nothing in vain.<note anchored="true"

                    perfection, of each thing, is generally to be identified with the final cause,
                    or end, at which nature aims. Matter, rising from the merely potential, through
                    the four elements into various substances, is the material cause; and the
                    efficient, or motive cause is supplied by the active powers of heat and cold.
                    Nature, however, is impersonal, and to speak of it as pervaded by reason, has
                    all the appearance of pantheism. But yet in the system of Aristotle there was a
                    God who was not part of nature. Aristotle’s utterances on this subject are
                    obscure; he speaks of the unmoved Mover of all things at one time<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the dissertation on the
                    nature of God, <hi rend="italic">Metaph.</hi>, χi. c. 6-10.</p></note> as if He
                    supplied motion to the periphery of heaven, at another as if He moved things by
                    desire, under the form of the Good. But, at all events, He is personal: He
                    enjoys for ever that bliss which we can only at brief moments attain to; His
                    life is the thinking upon thought. In all this there is something incomplete,
                    and the different points of view are not reconciled. Aristotle argues that<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaph.,</hi> xi. 9, 4.</p></note> God could not, as thought, have any object
                    of thought inferior to himself, else the divine thought, by thinking upon an
                    inferior object, would suffer change and degradation. God, therefore, can only
                    think upon himself. This argument would seem to foreclose the possibility of
                    either Providence or prayer. There is something Eastern in this idea of a God
                    absorbed in self -meditation; and, on the other hand, we observe that Aristotle,
                    while considering no trouble too great to obtain excellence in any little point
                    of art, or science, or morals, or politics,—still, in comparison with the great
                    universe, makes human affairs of relatively little importance. But yet, within
                    the sphere of nature, man is, according to him, the highest product—indeed, the
                    one end for which all the arrangements of nature are but means.<note

                    vain, has made all things for the sake of man.”</p></note> Nor does man himself
                    fall wholly within the sphere of nature. Every natural soul is the ultimate
                    expression <hi rend="italic">(erτeλeχeιa) of</hi> a corresponding physical body.
                    But in the human soul there is something which has no physical substratum, which

                    physical, this something must belong to the ethereal essence of which the outer
                    heavens and the self-conscious, happy stars are composed. Thus man, by his
                    reason, has a direct connection with the sphere of the eternal and the blessed.
                    The question then arises whether the individual man can look forward to
                    immortality. On this, regardless of Plato’s elaborate pictures of a Hell, a
                    Purgatory, and a Heaven, Aristotle says nothing. In one celebrated passage<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De
                    Anima,</hi> iii. 5, 2'.</p></note> he makes reason twofold, the active and the
                    passive, of which the active reason, and it alone, is indestructible; but if
                    this be incapable of receiving impressions, it would seem that all our
                    memory,·—in short, all that constitutes human individuality,·—is doomed to
                    extinction. But Aristotle never says so in express terms, and therefore has
                    given scope for much controversy in modern times as to his opinion.<note

                    in apprehending universals, apprehends something homogeneous with
                    itself,—something, in short, ethereal, This would bring the Aristotelian
                    universals very near to the Platonic ideas, but that he maintains<note

                    immanent in the individuals, never transcendental, or existing by themselves.
                    But this doctrine widely separates Aristotle from the modern experimental
                    school, though, on the other hand, there is no trace of his having believed in
                    “innate ideas” upon any subject. Aristotle, like Locke, considered each human
                    mind to bo originally a blank tablet, but he would not agree with Locke that
                    this tablet is written upon by external objects, he would rather say that, by
                    the joint action of the active and the passive reason, the tablet writes upon
                    itself, and that there is much in our knowledge which comes from the nature of
                    the intellect itself. Two doctrines lie at the foundation of his system: 1st,
                    the principle of contradiction,—that a thing must be either A or not A; 2d, the
                    dualistic opposition, throughout the universe, of reason and matter. In modern
                    times we have been long accustomed to think of this world as having had a
                    beginning, and recent theories of “development” are attempts at a speculative
                    history of nature gradually arriving at its present condition. Such theories
                    have nothing to correspond to them in the system of Aristotle, for in his view
                    the present fabric of the world has had an eternal existence, and nature is
                    fixed, being only slightly varied by the element of chance. He admits, indeed, a
                    process of development in human society, but in order to adapt this process to a
                    fixed and eternal frame of things he announces<note anchored="true"

                    to perfection all art, science, and philosophy, and has on each occasion been
                    swept away by some widespread catastrophe or convulsion of nature, leaving only
                    a few individuals to repropagate the race, and to begin again the development of
                    civilisation out of the merest rudiments.</p>
                <p>In endeavouring to bring forward, in a brief space, some of the salient
                    characteristics of Aristotle, we have been led to mention chiefly those points
                    on which he differs most <pb break="no"

                    therefore, are his points of weakness. Much that the world has accepted from
                    him, many a solid mass of wisdom and good sense, to be found in his writings, we
                    have been obliged to pass over in silence. On most subjects Aristotle is no
                    longer an authority, but yet, for many reasons his works are well worth study.
                    <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> on account of the important part they have borne
                    in the history of the world. No one who aspires to cultivation can dispense with
                    a historical knowledge of the thought of Europe, and Aristotle is one of the
                    great fountain-heads of that thought. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> if
                    cultivation consists, as has been said, in an acquaintance with all the best
                    productions of the human mind, Aristotle’s works, despite their want of style,
                    certainly come among the number. Hegel advocated the study of these works as
                    “the noblest problem of classical philology.” The University of Oxford, during
                    the present century, has made a renewed study of Aristotle one of its chief
                    instruments of education,—and with great success, as was especially testified to
                    by the late Dr Arnold<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>\

                    knowledge of human nature, exhaustive classification, and clear methods of
                    disentangling a question and dealing with what is essential in it, render many
                    of his works an excellent <hi rend="italic">curriculum</hi> for training young
                    men, and fitting them for all the superior business of life. There is a certain
                    dynamical impulse to be derived from Aristotle, independent of all his results
                    and conclusions. The Aristotelian element in thought and knowledge may, perhaps,
                    be summed up as “analytic insight;” and this insight arises out of concentration
                    of the mind upon the subject in hand, marshalling together all the facts and
                    opinions attainable upon it, and dwelling on these, and scrutinising and
                    comparing them till a light flashes on the whole subject. Such is the procedure
                    which may be learnt, by imitation, from Aristotle.</p>
                <p>The history of the study of the Aristotelian philosophy, since the time of
                    Andronicus, falls under various heads, dealt with elsewhere. It is contained,—

                    Averroes, and Moses Maimonides (of Cordova), and the history of the

                    translations, and commentaries. All previous editions of the text of the entire
                    works give way to the recension of Immanuel Bekker (1831-1840) which being
                    supplemented by a volume of <hi rend="italic">Scholia</hi> upon Aristotle edited
                    by Brandis (1836), and a complete index to all the works, compiled by Bonitz
                    (1870), constitutes the great edition of the Prussian Royal Academy. Within the
                    last forty years much admirable work has been done in Germany in the way of
                    clearing up special questions relating to Aristotle, and introducing correct
                    judgments about his philosophy generally. Perhaps the scholar who, by a mixture
                    of rich learning and penetrating good sense, has deserved best of Aristotle is
                    Dr Leonhard Spengel, to whose papers, contributed to the Royal Bavarian Academy
                    of Munich, we have often previously referred. The historians of philosophy,
                    beginning with Hegel’s “Lectures,” and going on to Brandis, Zeller, Schwegler,
                    and Ueberweg, reflect the progressive opinions about Aristotle of critical and
                    philosophical circles. Many excellent editions of the separate treatises, and
                    many monographs on special points, have performed a subsidiary function. And a
                    good German translation, executed by Stahr, Bender, Karsel, &lt;kc., of the
                    works of Aristotle, now nearly complete, has been published at Stuttgart, by
                    Krais and Hoffmann.</p>
                <p>No other nation can compare with Germany in recent services towards a knowledge
                    of Aristotle. France has contributed translations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physics, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Anima, Parva</hi><hi rend="italic">Haturalia,
                    Organon, Politics,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ethics,</hi> by Barthélemy St
                    Hilaire, an essay on the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> by Ravaisson, and a
                    few less important works. The translations are readable, but cannot be relied on
                    for accuracy in any difficult point. In England the contributions to
                    Aristotelian literature have borne no sort of proportion to the extent to which
                    minds have been educationally imbued with certain of Aristotle’s works. The
                    unproductiveness of Oxford in this respect is certainly a matter of reproach to
                    that university. Sir W. Hamilton exhibited great learning in all that concerned
                    Aristotle rather than a true insight into Aristotle himself. Grote’s work was
                    conceived in a German spirit, but it was begun far too late in life to have any
                    chance of success. The problem how to translate Aristotle into English has not
                    yet been solved. We have had a translation of the entire works by the not very
                    sane, and very unscholarlike, Thomas Taylor (10 vols., London, 1806-12), which
                    exists only as a curiosity for book collectors. And we have had the not
                    uncreditable versions of Bohn’s Classical Library, but these latter were done to
                    order, and cannot be expected to perform what is in itself so difficult. Mr
                    Poste, perhaps the most thorough of present English Aristotelians, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Aristotle on Fallacies,</hi> gives us rather a condensed
                    paraphrase than a translation, and is often as difficult as the original Greek.
                    The problem is, how to convey, in readable English, a philosophical style, full
                    of technical terms for which we have no exact representatives. Circumlocution,
                    or paraphrase, becomes necessary; the question is, how to use this with the
                    greatest tact, so as, while conveying Aristotle’s exact meaning, to retain
                    something of his manner. Perhaps this problem may, in course of time, be solved,
                    if in the meanwhile the study of Greek is not altogether abandoned in
                    England.</p>
