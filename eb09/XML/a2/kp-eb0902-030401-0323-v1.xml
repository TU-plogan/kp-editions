                <p><label type="entry">ARAGON</label>, a captaincy general, or, as it is usually
                    called by the Spaniards, a kingdom, of Spain, situated between lat. 40° and 42°
                    5Γ N., and between long. 2° 10' W. and l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 45' E.,
                    is bounded on the N. by the Pyrenees, which separate it from France, E. by
                    Catalonia and Valencia, S. by Valencia, and W. by Navarre and the two Castiles.
                    It has an area of 14,726 English square miles, and a population of
                    925,773—calculated for 1867 on the basis of the census of 1860. It is divided by
                    the river Ebro, which flows through it in a south-easterly direction, into two
                    nearly equal parts, known as <hi rend="italic">Trans-ibero</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Cis-ibero.</hi> The north is occupied by a portion of the
                    Pyrenees, which here attain in Monte Perdido, or as it is variously called Mont
                    Perdu, Las Tres Sorores, almost their highest altitude (11,430 feet); and in the
                    south and west are various sierras of considerable elevation. The whole surface,
                    indeed, is very irregular. The large and fertile plain in the middle, bordering
                    on the Ebro, is broken by offshoots from the north and south, while the mountain
                    ranges, on the other hand, are interrupted by numerous valleys of great beauty.
                    The central pass for carriages over the Pyrenees is on the line between
                    Saragossa and Pau, and bears the name of Port de Confranc. The Ebro is the
                    principal river, and receives from the north in its passage through the
                    province, the Arba, the Gallego, and the united waters of the Cinca, the Essera,
                    the No guera Ribagorzana, and the Noguera Pallaresa—the last two belonging to
                    Catalonia; and from the south the Xalon and Xiloca and the Guadalupe. The
                    Imperial Canal of Aragon, which was commenced by Charles V. in 1529, but
                    remained unfinished for nearly two hundred years, extends from Tudela almost to
                    Sastago, a distance of 80 miles; it has a depth of 9 feet, and an average
                    breadth of 69, and is navigable for vessels of about 80 tons burthen. The Royal
                    Canal of Tauste, which lies along the north side of the Ebro, was cut for
                    purposes of irrigation, and gives fertility to the district. Two leagues N.N.E.
                    of Albarracin is the remarkable fountain called Celia, 3700 feet above the sea,
                    which forms the source of the Xiloca; and between this river and the Sierra
                    Molina is an extensive lake called Gallo-canta, covering about 6000 acres. The
                    climate of Aragon is, as might be supposed, of a very varied character, rigorous
                    in the north and among the sierras, but mild and even oppressive in the south,
                    especially towards the Mediterranean. Its vegetable products are necessarily
                    affected by a similar variety. The hills are clothed in many places with oak,
                    pine, and beech, which, if utilised, would furnish a good supply of timber. The
                    flora is exceedingly rich, but has been slightly explored. Wheat, maize, rice,
                    wine, oil, flax, and hemp, of fine quality, are grown in considerable
                    quantities; as well as saffron, madder, liquorice, sumach, and a variety of
                    fruits. Swine and sheep are reared in considerable numbers, the merino wool
                    supplied by the latter being one of the chief productions of the province; but
                    little attention is paid to other descriptions of cattle. The manufactures are
                    comparatively insignificant, being in great measure supplementary to the
                    agricultural and pastoral pursuits of the people. The silk manufacture has
                    declined, and woollen and linen cloth is only produced in small quantities. The
                    mineral resources of the country consist of iron, lead, copper, sulphur, cobalt,
                    asphalt, lignite, alum, rocksalt, jet, marble, and jasper, which are all found
                    in abundance, but they are very inadequately wrought. Aragon is divided into
                    three provinces, <hi rend="smallcaps">Huesca, Teruel,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Saragossa,</hi> accounts of which will be found under these
                    headings. The capital is Saragossa, and the other towns of importance are Jaca,
                    Huesca, and Barbastro to the north of the Ebro, and Tara-zona, Calatayud,
                    Daroca, Calamocha, Albarracin, Montalban, Teruel, and Alcaniz to the south.
                    Saragossa is an archbishopric<pb break="no"

                    Teruel, and Albarracin are episcopal sees. In 1867 there were 2257 priests in
                    the kingdom.</p>
                <p>Previous to the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella the political constitution of
                    Aragon was the most liberal in Europe. Formally monarchical, its genius and
                    maxims were purely republican. The kings, who were long elective, retained only
                    the shadow of power; while the real exercise of it was in the hands of the
                    Cortes, an assembly consisting of the nobility, the equestrian order, the
                    representatives of the cities and towns, and the clergy. No law could pass
                    without the assent of every member who had a right to vote. Without the
                    permission of the Cortes, no tax could be imposed, war could not be declared,
                    nor peace concluded. Besides these, and other extraordinary privileges enjoyed
                    by the Cortes, the Aragonese possessed another safeguard against despotic power
                    in the election of a <hi rend="italic">Justicia,</hi> or supreme judge, who
                    acted as the guardian of the people, and the controller of the prince. He was
                    the supreme interpreter of the laws, and was accountable to the Cortes alone for
                    the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office. See Robertson’s <hi

                <p>The history of Aragon before its union with Castile by the marriage of Ferdinand
                    and Isabella, when it was merged in the kingdom of Spain, will be found in the
                    general history of that country. It had, before this epoch, a succession of
                    twenty sovereigns, from the year 1035 to 1516. See Zurita, <hi rend="italic"
